   &UR; THE PROFESSOR AND THE MADMAN: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and
the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary &LR;  By Simon Winchester.
Harper Perennial, $13. In 1896 the editor of the Oxford English
Dictionary tracked down and befriended one of his most prolific and
dependable contributors, an American Civil War veteran who was
incarcerated at an asylum for the criminally insane. Last year the
reviewer David Walton called this an ``elegant and scrupulous
retelling'' of ``one of the strangest modern literary stories.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIRDS OF AMERICA &LR;  By Lorrie Moore. Picador USA, $14. These
stories feature articulate, romantically frustrated characters,
usually women, whose predicaments allow the reader to infer a
lifetime from a moment of crisis. Some of the tales in this
collection, which was selected as one of the best books of 1998 by
the editors of The New York Times Book Review, concern adults or
children with cancer, yet somehow they manage to find humor even as
they sharply probe issues of mortality. ``Fluid, cracked, mordant,
colloquial, Moore's sentences hold, even startle, us as they glide
beneath the radar of ideological theories of behavior to evoke the
messy, god-awful behavior itself,'' James McManus wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COLLECTED TALES OF NIKOLAI GOGOL &LR;  Translated by Richard
Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky. Vintage Classics, $15. These 13
stories by the Russian fantasist include early tales of Cossacks
and devils set in his native Ukraine, and later classics like ``The
Nose'' and ``The Overcoat,'' written after he became famous in his
early 20s. Last year one critic called this ``a superb new
translation.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TOMCAT IN LOVE &LR;  By Tim O'Brien. Broadway, $13. This novel's
narrator is a snide linguistics professor (and Vietnam veteran) who
is obsessed with his ex-wife and driven by a need to seduce every
woman he meets. ``Like all comic novels, `Tomcat in Love' is a
complex affair that invites a complex response and offers a complex
reward,'' Jane Smiley wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MINOR CHARACTERS: A Young Woman's Coming-of-Age in the Beat
Orbit of Jack Kerouac &LR;  By Joyce Johnson. Penguin, $13.95. The
former girlfriend and caretaker of the guiding spirit of the Beats
describes her growing up bright and sensitive in the 1950s
counterculture and her years with Kerouac's subterranean boys'
club. In 1983 the reviewer Helen Chasin said her stories are ``not
only interesting and vivid but in several respects have more
dimension than the adventure tales and clubhouse philosophizing
that captured America's imagination in the late '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SORT OF RICH &LR;  By James Wilcox. Back Bay/Little, Brown, $12.95.
In this comic novel, a New Yorker settles down with her wealthy new
husband in tranquil Tula Springs, La., where her hopes for a
simpler life are dashed by the exotic household help, including a
mysterious hippieish handyman and his arthritic stepniece. ``Wilcox
is both a fine storyteller and a skilled novelist,'' Jill McCorkle
wrote in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also reissued  &UR; POLITE SEX &LR;  ($13),
Wilcox's novel about the shifting fortunes of two lifelong friends,
an idealistic actress and an aspiring model, who flee Tula Springs
for the bright lights of New York. In 1991, Elinor Lipman admired
the author's ``sly social satire.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NOT ENTITLED: A Memoir &LR;  By Frank Kermode. Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $13. With tact and restraint, the renowned literary critic
recalls his childhood on the Isle of Man, his six-year stint in the
Royal Navy during World War II and his long career in academia and
letters. The result is ``a triumph of tone,'' David Bromwich wrote
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AN EMPIRE WILDERNESS: Travels Into America's Future &LR;  By Robert
D. Kaplan. Vintage Departures, $14. A journalist combs the West and
foresees a nation of privately guarded housing developments,
corporate fortresses, homogenous suburban pods and
automobile-dominated cities. Believe it or not, he finds it all
``not so bleak.'' In 1998 the reviewer Thurston Clarke said, ``His
theories are brave and provocative, and I cannot imagine anyone
will concoct a more convincing scenario for the American future.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDERCLASS &LR; , by Ken Auletta (Overlook, $16.95), is a
revised and updated edition of the author's 1982 journalistic study
of the chronically poor welfare recipients, criminals and drifters
whose problems defy simple solutions _ conservative, liberal or
otherwise. This is an ``important and impressive'' book, Charles
Peters wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THIS IS MY DAUGHTER &LR;  By Roxana Robinson. Scribner, $13. This
novel is about innocence lost _ that of two children of divorce,
and that of their parents, who are stricken by rage, guilt and
shame. In 1998 the reviewer Diana Postlethwaite noted that while
the author's fiction is often called Cheeveresque, this time she
``made me think of an earlier literary forebear, Henry James.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUTH: Four Stories I Am Finally Old Enough to Tell &LR;  By Ellen
Douglas. Plume, $12.95. In her first nonfiction book, the Southern
novelist meditates on events that fueled her ficti/n, including a
lifelong illicit romance, her grandfather's suicide and the
execution of some local slaves. The result is a ``curious, lovely
book,'' Laura Jamison wrote earlier this year.

BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE NEAR CELLULAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 (HLW)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bell Atlantic, the nation's largest local telephone
company, appears close to an agreement to combine its national
wireless operations with the United States wireless assets of
Vodafone Airtouch PLC, the world's largest wireless telephone
company, in a deal that would create a separate company valued at
between $70 billion and $80 billion, said people close to the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   If the two companies are successful in their negotiations, and
there is no guarantee that they will be, an announcement could come
as early as this week. The deal being discussed would give Bell
Atlantic the national cellular footprint that the company has long
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic was prevented from doing that in January when it
lost a bidding war to acquire Airtouch, then the nation's largest
wireless operator.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone Group PLC beat out Bell Atlantic by offering to buy
Airtouch for about $60 billion in stock and cash. The combined
company was then renamed Vodafone Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone executives have been very vocal about wanting to expand
the company's cellular reach in the United States, and this deal
would give the company an additional 14 million mobile phone
subscribers to add to the approximately 9.5 million it already has
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Vodafone's business and Bell Atlantic's
wireless business would also allow Vodafone to compete in the
United States against rivals like AT&AMP;T Wireless Services and
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic was expected to complete its $52.9-billion merger
early next year with GTE, which would then control about a third of
the United States' local phone industry and would have major
Internet and wireless phone units.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vodafone Airtouch confirmed it was discussing an
alliance with Bell Atlantic. The structure of a deal has begun to
emerge over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said that Bell Atlantic would own
about 55 percent of a newly combined United States wireless company
with Vodafone owning the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies have been working out other
issues over the weekend, including fine-tuning the new company's
value, discussing who would run it, and what executives would be
appointed to the new concern's board.
</P>
<P>
   Although executives have been making progress, according to
people close to the talks, one noted that the negotiations could
fall apart at any time. If talks do dissolve, Vodafone probably
will consider other alternatives in its quest to establish itself
as a dominant player in the U.S. cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bell Atlantic decided to disband its Primeco Personal
Communications partnership with Vodafone, which left Vodafone
without cellular service in the Eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Logical options would include the acquisition of a company like
Omnipoint Corp. or the bankrupt Nextwave Telecom Inc., both of
which have operations in the Eastern United States. Omnipoint
agreed to merge with Voicestream Wireless Corp., but that
$3-billion deal has not closed, and it is possible Vodafone could
still make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Vodafone and Bell Atlantic each declined to
comment on reports of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a surprising compromise, albeit a seemingly smart
one, for Ivan Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Bell
Atlantic. In interviews last January after his company lost
Airtouch to Vodafone, he was candid about his disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we see this, is this was more of a missed
opportunity,'' Seidenberg said at the time. ``In the longer term,
it is our job to prove that we would have been the best
proposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, by early summer, executives from Vodafone and Bell
Atlantic had agreed to start talking about some kind of joint
venture in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gent, chief executive of Vodafone, is transforming the
company into a cellular powerhouse both here and abroad. He makes
frequent trips to the United States _ he is here about once a month
_ and has held meetings with Seidenberg.

WELTERWEIGHTS FIGHTERS AN ISLAND OF STABILITY IN DIRTY SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The landscape is littered with outrageous decisions, Mike
Tyson's profanity, sucker punches, low blows, Don King's fractured
metaphors, fractured jaws, fraudulent matches, addled brains,
bruises, blood, pretenders, contenders, convicts, grand juries, FBI
raids and a long-lost piece of Evander Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a piece of condemned property. Enter at your own
risk, and be sure to bring along a good criminal attorney. The
fight game is a sport in name and, too often, a felony in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it endures.
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of reasons have been offered for boxing's ability to
survive scandals that might have shut down any other business long
ago. If it isn't the world's oldest profession, it is a close
second. It always manages to stick around, regardless of whether it
is illuminated by bright lights or hidden amid dark shadows in back
rooms of low-rent saloons.
</P>
<P>
   For the crowd that hates it, boxing is like a cockroach. The
abolitionists can't do anything to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be a secret to the sporting stepchild's
resiliency:
</P>
<P>
   The welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past century, the curiously named division _ almost at
the midpoint between all the juniors, supers and cruisers _ has
been a place that a badly battered sport comes to renew itself. The
money is still in the heavyweights. So, too, is most of the alleged
corruption. But it is at 147 pounds where boxing has traditionally
rediscovered the drama, grace and courage that so often have been
resources for the novelists and filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's welterweight clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Felix
Trinidad is being called the Fight of the Millennium by the
promoters. It's part hype. But there also some truth in it. The
welterweights always have come to the rescue when boxing seems to
be headed for another demise.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, himself, seems to sense his role. He talks about
leading the attempted restoration of the sport's credibility, lost
in the controversial judging in March for the Lennox
Lewis-Holyfield draw and the infamous Bite Fight in which Tyson
dined on Holyfield's ears. De La Hoya even talks about what will
happen when, and if, he retires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch what happens when I retire from boxing,'' De La Hoya,
the unbeaten World Boxing Council champion (31-0, 25 knockouts),
said 10 days ago from his training camp at Big Bear, Calif. ``It's
not going to be the same, because my fans _ mothers, grandmothers
of kids _ will follow me wherever I go.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks smack of arrogance, and there are more than just a
few who would love to see Trinidad, the unbeaten International
Boxing Federation champ (35-0, 30 KOs) knock De La Hoya off the
pulpit. Nonetheless, his rivals welcome the attention and the money
he has brought to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Bert Sugar, a well-known boxing historian, compares De La Hoya's
role in boxing to that of Tiger Woods in golf. He has generated
interest from people who have been ambivalent or even offended by
prizefighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a person whether they could meet Lennox Lewis or
Oscar, they would say Oscar,'' he said. ``Sometimes fight fans find
him the most recognizable boxer, even more than Evander. For him to
put the heavyweights' biggest names under a bushel basket is a hell
of a marketing job.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, he is boxing's most recognizable name because he is
also its most credible. He is the first boxer in years to attract
endorsements from the hamburger chains and deodorant companies that
had fled the fight game because of repeated scandal. King can sell
a fight, but would you buy a car from him?
</P>
<P>
   In terms of history, De La Hoya's role is not unprecedented.
Sugar Ray Leonard was the last fighter to have his kind of
broad-based appeal and clout. Leonard came along just when the
sport had receded into another one of its declines. An aging,
ailing Muhammad Ali had just lost to Larry Holmes in a bout that
left the public disgusted.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Leonard and a whole generation of welterweights who
would make boxing a credible, popular sport throughout the late
1970s and and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that many parallels are being drawn between
De La Hoya-Trinidad and the classic Leonard-Thomas Hearns
welterweight clash in September 1981. It was a classic, in large
part because of what happened within the ropes. The fighters
switched roles. Leonard, the boxer, became the puncher to beat
Hearns, the acknowledged puncher, in the 14th round.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard went on to fight Marvin Hagler as a middleweight. But
his fame came as a welterweight. He took his nickname, Sugar, from
perhaps the best fighter of all time. Sugar Ray Robinson came along
as a welterweight when boxing was suffering through scandals linked
to the big-city mobs. Fixed fights were suspected and addressed in
front of Senate subcommittees.
</P>
<P>
   The original Sugar Ray won the welterweight title in 1946 before
moving on and up to the middleweights. But it was as a welter that
he established a legacy that continues. An alternative pop group
calls itself Sugar Ray these days.
</P>
<P>
   The pound-for-pound designation, a permanent part of today's
language, was created because of Sugar Ray, who in his days was
better than any champion in any weight class.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sugar Ray Robinson, there was Henry Armstrong, who
defended the welterweight title 18 times _ five in one month _ in
the 1930s. Before Armstrong, there was Barney Ross, who came out of
Chicago's ghettos in the 1920s and was perhaps the best in a
generation of great Jewish fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Ross, whose parents wanted him to become a Hebrew
teacher, defines what the welterweight division has always been.
It's a crossroads. Poor kids from a variety of backgrounds can
fight at 147 pounds. They don't have to be a freak of nature with a
6-foot-5, 220-pound frame. All they need are some smarts, courage,
quick hands and a willingness to fight. In 1938, Ross, the Jewish
kid, lost to Armstrong, a Black kid who was born in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one years later, the crossroad takes on a decidedly Latin
beat. De La Hoya, the Mexican-American from East Los Angeles, meets
Trinidad, a Puerto Rican and a Black man. The cultural
crosscurrents are there as much as they have ever been. There is a
longtime rivalry between Mexican-American and Puerto Rican
fighters. It also pits Los Angeles, home for many of Mexican
descent, and New York, home for a large Puerto Rican community. The
fight itself also is symbolic of the rapid rise of the Latin market
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take that to another level,'' De La Hoya said when
asked about the fight as a symbol of the Latin emergence. ``I
choose to carry that responsibility. I want to make a name for all
of us, for all Latinos across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in the right weight class to do it. &QL;

CRASH KILLS CART ROOKIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ A lively practice session ended tragically
Saturday when rookie Gonzalo Rodriguez was killed following a
vicious head-on crash into a concrete wall at the Honda Grand Prix
of Monterey at Laguna Seca Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a 27-year-old Uruguayan, died of massive head and
neck injuries, according to the Championship Auto Racing Teams
medical director, Dr. Steve Olvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impression of (witnesses) at the scene was (Rodriguez) was
killed instantly with impact of the wall,'' Olvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who finished 12th in the Aug. 8 Detroit Grand Prix in
his only previous CART start, was approaching the famed Corkscrew
turn on the 2.238-mile road course when his brakes locked, and his
car plowed through a gravel trap without losing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's car then slammed into a tire barrier and the
concrete wall behind it at a speed measured at about 160 mph. The
car then flipped backward about 30 feet into the air, catapulted
over an advertising wall, narrowly missed striking a tree and
landed upside down on a grassy hill.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team owner Roger Penske nor CART officials would
immediately speculate on the cause of the accident, but there was
some speculation that the throttle may have stuck open or
Rodriguez's foot may have mistakenly slipped and pressed the
accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   CART officials impounded the car, and Penske immediately
withdrew the team's other car and driver, Al Unser Jr., from
today's race.
</P>
<P>
   Course workers removed Rodriguez from the wrecked car, and he
was taken by ambulance to Community Hospital of the Monterey
Peninsula, where he was pronounced dead 42 minutes after the
accident at 10:10 a.m. (Arizona time).
</P>
<P>
   ``At our drivers' request, and a request that we absolutely
support, there will be no (second round of qualifying),'' CART
President and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Craig said.
``Obviously, the teams are decimated with the loss of a well-liked
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic tribute to Rodriguez, the green flag was displayed
in front of an empty pit lane during the scheduled qualifying
session.
</P>
<P>
   Today's starting grid will be determined by Friday's qualifying
session. Defending champion Bryan Herta will start from the pole
position, and Tony Kanaan will line up outside the front row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible tragedy,'' Michael Andretti said. ``Our hearts
go out to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Robby Gordon also expressed sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable what happened,'' Gordon said. ``Out of
respect for Gonzalo and his family, the drivers stuck together and
decided to have a moment of silence. It's the least we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   A Toyota Atlantic race went on as scheduled, as did qualifying
in another support series. However, no car returned to the
racetrack until 4{ hours following the crash. Much of the delay was
due to repairing the wall, which was significantly damaged by the
impact.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was the first CART fatality since Jeff Krosnoff was
killed in a race held at Toronto in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Three spectators, however, were killed by debris following a
crash at Michigan Speedway in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Three more spectators were killed by debris following a crash in
a May Indy Racing League event at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Olvey said Rodriguez's crash was the first serious injury since
the series began going to Laguna Seca in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragic day for Laguna Seca Raceway,'' said John
Stornetta, the racetrack's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Atlantic cars returned to the track, an eerie silence
shrouded the garage area and the grandstands.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also seemed to agree with the decision to curtail CART
activities for the remainder of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the right decision,'' said Monterey fan Terry Terrana,
whose 5{-year-old son was attending his first race. ``After
something like that, everybody should pay their respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows fatalities are part of racing, but they're few
and far between. Unfortunately, my son had to be at this race, and
now I have to try and explain to him that people dying at races
doesn't always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was a regular in the European Formula 3000 circuit,
where he was runner-up in the drivers standings. Rodriguez also is
a three-time Uruguayan Formula Renault champion and was a Formula 3
rookie of the year in 1991. His last win was in a Formula 3000 race
in May at Monaco. &QL;

STARS ALIGN TO CREATE SEASON OF A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Baseball is governed by the law of gravity and the law
of averages. Over the course of a 162-game season, it has the
uncanny power to bring you down to earth and drop you off right
where you're supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are always exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   As the Diamondbacks continue to chug toward a division title,
there is a prevailing belief that a second-year expansion team is
benefiting largely from a cluster of ``career years'' _ guys who
have somehow escaped baseball's radar and never hit the ground.
Guys who are doing things they'll never do again.
</P>
<P>
   This is a misperception.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the Diamondbacks are flourishing because of a
confluence of abnormal factors. And all told, it is the
organization that is having a career year. One that will never
happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all interrelated,'' Matt Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   If you look up and down the Diamondbacks' roster, only Luis
Gonzalez is truly having a ``career year,'' the kind of season that
is so far above his normal production that it will never be
duplicated. Entering Saturday's game with the Phillies, Gonzalez
was hitting .339 - a whopping 71 points higher than his career
average. And he's already set personal bests for runs scored (104),
home runs (24), doubles (41) and RBIs (97).
</P>
<P>
   The power numbers offered by Bell (33 home runs, 97 RBIs) are
staggering, and with one more hot streak, he has an outside shot to
join Rogers Hornsby, Davey Johnson and Ryne Sandberg as the only
second basemen in history with 40 or more home runs in one season.
But home runs are up all over baseball, and it's debatable whether
Bell's season fits the criteria of a career year. After all, Bell
hit .310 with 187 hits in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as it's tempting to put the same label on Matt
Williams, Steve Finley and Matt Mantei, it just doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Finley will exceed his career bests in home runs and RBIs, but
he has had better overall seasons. Mantei is dominating in his
second full season as a closer, but it's too early in his career to
know what's normal. And then there's Williams, the MVP candidate,
the one who is constantly lumped in the ``career year'' category by
national observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction? I'm not,'' Williams said. ``I've passed my career
high in RBI, but I've hit more homers, hit for a higher average. I
think that label just comes from the lack of that (production) last
year. ``And probably because it makes good copy.''
</P>
<P>
   A company called Diamond Mind Inc. offers projections based on
where a team should finish given the standard production of its
players. It relies on comprehensive mathematical formulas and
adheres to the theory that the number of above-average seasons will
be balanced by the below-average performances. Which is normally
the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   Before the season started, it pegged the Diamondbacks as a
second-place finisher with a record of 83-79. It predicted the
pitching staff would finish fifth in the National League, but
projected the Diamondbacks' offense to end up in the bottom half of
the standings.
</P>
<P>
   So, with only one unquestioned career year, how can you explain
what could be the single greatest one-year turnaround in the long
history of baseball? &QL; 
The loaded gun factor
</P>
<P>
   The top three slots in the Diamondbacks' batting order _ Tony
Womack, Bell and Gonzalez _ have scored a mind-boggling 315 runs
through 141 games. That is more than the any three players on the
Mets, Braves, Reds or Astros.
</P>
<P>
   When on base, Womack's speed has diverted the focus of opposing
pitchers, helping Bell to see a lot of fastballs. Gonzalez's whole
season has been a hitting streak, offering protection to Bell and
RBI opportunities to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I have so many RBI is because they've been on base
all season,'' Williams said. ``Otherwise, I'm just hitting the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   With Williams, the top four players in the lineup have combined
for 405 of 776 runs scored (52 percent) and 357 of 740 RBIs (48
percent). &QL; 
The good season factor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just like the world champion Yankees of last season, the
Diamondbacks have an abundance of players enjoying good seasons and
few who are struggling. That, more than anything, has tipped the
scales in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   The two-catcher tandem of Kelly Stinnett and Damien Miller has
20 home runs and 76 RBIs. The pinch-hitting/platoon tandem of Greg
Colbrunn and Bernard Gilkey has combined for a .297 average, 10
home runs and 48 RBIs. And the one flame-out _ Travis Lee _ has
been replaced by the huge bat of Erubiel Durazo, who has nine home
runs in 105 at-bats. Which, by the way, is a 54-home run pace over
the course of a full season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is because we're a veteran club, and when the game
starts, we know what to do,'' Gonzalez said. ``If we're scuffling
on a particular day, we know how to work a walk. We push each
other. Not verbally, but by example. No one wants to be the weak
link.''
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative productivity has shocked the experts. Entering
Saturday, the Diamondbacks ranked second in the National League in
runs scored, total bases, home runs and RBIs. They rank third in
slugging percentage. And soon they will tie a National League
record by having four players with 100 or more RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has contributed,'' Gonzalez said. ``Even Rob Ryan was
getting big hits for us when he was in the lineup.'' &QL; 
The luck factor &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have had an assortment of injuries, and the one
suffered by David Dellucci curtailed what would've been another
career year. But none of their position players has been on the
shelf for an extended period. And even with the mid-season loss of
Todd Stottlemyre, their six starting pitchers entering spring
training have started 141 of 141 games.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of horseshoes, you know the Diamondbacks aren't the
fleetest team in the world. Yet, they rank first in the National
League in fewest amount of double plays.
</P>
<P>
   That's hitting them where they ain't.
</P>
<P>
   They also rank first in grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   That's hitting them when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it is?'' Gonzalez said. ``Everyone is having a
career year at something.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly. So forget the individuals. It's the franchise enjoying
the career year. The kind you'll still be talking about in 50
years. &QL;

<P>
   _ Listen again, after the Cold War, to President Clinton as he
justifies the NATO-led offensive against Serbia, the country where
an assassin sparked World War I by killing Austrian Archduke Franz
Ferdinand.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acting now we are upholding our values, protecting our
interests and advancing the cause of peace,'' Clinton said as the
despair of Kosovar refugees was broadcast around the world.
``Ending this tragedy is a moral imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Army soldiers stationed in 75 countries plied
their trades in the name of international defense. Computer users
clicked themselves around the globe, sending e-mail messages to
foreign friends they had never met. Somewhere, no doubt, a shopper
pondered whether to buy that shirt made in an Asian sweatshop.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton spoke, Ford Motor Co. sealed its deal with Volvo.
Speculation spread that Sprint might merge with Deutsche Telekom.
Hong Kong vied for a Disney theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, America is tethered to the world like no other country.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect that to change in the next century. Just expect the
questions that tethering creates, without the Soviet threat, to be
more complicated than they were in this century.
</P>
<P>
   For instance: Does a ``moral imperative'' exist for returning
peace to East Timor? Will an unstable Russia threaten our national
security or prove to be a minor annoyance? Should we offer
friendship to China if its economy strengthens? Will the euro
compete with the dollar in the same way the yen has? Should we
assist post-colonial African countries struggling to find new
governments?
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Pickering, a political science professor at Kansas State
University and an expert in international relations, adds to that
list: ``What do you do with rogue states like Korea or Iraq?
Terrorism reaching our shores? Some worry about the global trading
system growing more fragile given the threatened trade wars among
the U.S., Japan and Europe. There are questions about growing
ethnic conflicts....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really at a fluid juncture in history. The main dilemma
right now is what to do with American power.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that, confronted with so many choices, some
Americans are tempted to retreat _ again _ no matter how much power
the country wields. Just as Kansas City long neglected the Liberty
Memorial, the nation's World War I monument and symbol to our entry
into the world, some Americans will no doubt continue to urge
politicians to ignore the rest of the world. They will echo Pat
Buchanan's cry of ``America First'' and ask for protections against
global competition.
</P>
<P>
   Will their pleas yield results? Maybe a few. But it is unlikely
that such isolationist rhetoric can compete with the untamed,
world-embracing will of our cultural, technological, political, and
commercial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, that will accompanied the doughboys as they sang
``Over There'' on their way to the trenches. It accompanied Wilson
as he fought for the country's participation in the League of
Nations. It helped lay the foundations for this, the American
century. Now we must ask: Will it make the next century ours as
well?

ROENICK SETS HIS SIGHTS ON A STAR  
 HATCHER'S ELBOW PROVIDES INCENTIVE FOR COYOTES CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Forgive and forget? Not hardly. Jeremy Roenick knows
there is some unsettled business between himself and Derian Hatcher
of the Dallas Stars. And when the two lock horns for the first time
this season, expect the sparks to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm going to be out there looking for
anything,'' Roenick, the Coyotes' star center, said, ``but if
something comes my way, there's no way in hell I'm going to let it
go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If Roenick sees a chance to knock a few inches off
of the 6-foot-5 Hatcher with a good, hard, clean hit, he's going to
shoot first and answer questions later.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't happen tonight when the Coyotes meet the reigning
Stanley Cup champion Stars at 5 in America West Arena. Roenick is
scheduled to play, but Hatcher is getting the night off after
playing Saturday against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher prematurely ended Roenick's regular season and forced
him to miss the first six games of the Coyotes' seven-game playoff
series against the St. Louis Blues after elbowing Roenick in the
face and shattering his jaw in a mid-April game. Hatcher, the
Stars' captain, was suspended for seven games for the hit, believed
as retaliation for Roenick laying out Dallas center Mike Modano
with a monstrous check in an earlier game in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't forgotten what happened. I'll ``never'' forget what
happened,'' Roenick said. ``It's in the back of my mind, and it'll
never leave my mind. There's no question about that. . . . Do I
want it to go away? No. It gives me a lot of adrenaline, a lot to
look forward to and a lot to psych myself up for.''
</P>
<P>
   The soonest a Roenick-Hatcher rematch could take place would be
Nov. 5 in Phoenix, the first regular-season game between the two
clubs. But every game figures to be an adventure, according to
Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going away. Not for a long time,'' Hitchcock said
Saturday. ``I don't think anything will happen (today), but you
never know. There's bad blood between these two teams, and there
will be for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   If it gets overly rough between Roenick and Hatcher, don't call
the calvary. Roenick said he could take care of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never look for anyone to go out and fight my own battles,''
he said. ``Obviously, you feel good when someone comes to your aid.
That's comraderie. That's what makes you feel like part of a team.
But when it has to be done myself, I'm not afraid to do it. I'm not
afraid of getting beat up. I'm not afraid to take a punch or get
knocked down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher also knocked Roenick out of action four years ago with a
knee-on-knee collision that left JR with a badly bruised tibia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was a little easier to forget,'' Roenick said.
``That's just the way he plays. He plays with his elbows up and
that big, wide stance. That's what's made him successful. There are
going to be injuries because of it, and I just happened to get
caught twice by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing against him as a hockey player. I think he's a
dynamite hockey player. He's got a Stanley Cup. That says something
for him. Hopefully, he can just find something to put in it now.'' &QL;

ROBUST AMERICA FINDS ROLE IN CENTURY'S SECOND DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK WIEBE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED _ In second decade of the century, a robust America
finds its world role It's time to sum up. To look at where we are
going by asking where we have been. Confident. At times swaggering.
The world's industrial leader. But not yet its moral leader. That
was America as President Woodrow Wilson prepared to deliver his war
message to Congress on April 2, 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years before Wilson's address, in which he would ask
Congress to declare war against Germany, America snapped its
fingers to the hit song ``I Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier.''
Less than a year before the address, Democrats bragged that Wilson
had kept America out of the war.
</P>
<P>
   But early in 1917, German U-boats renewed attacks on U.S. ships
in the Atlantic, killing dozens of Americans. The nation, which had
endured the deaths of 128 Americans in the 1915 sinking of the
Lusitania, could no longer sit still.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, Wilson believed, could it act without a moral purpose,
without asserting itself as a world leader. America, he said, must
fight for ``the rights of nations great and small and the privilege
of men everywhere to choose their way of life and obedience.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Wilson would champion U.S. participation in the League of
Nations, an organization he believed would protect the sovereignty
of all who joined it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world,'' he said in his war message, ``must be made safe
for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words the United States forever changed. No longer
would it limit its foreign affairs to a strictly defensive posture.
Although America would retreat into cozy isolation after World War
I, Wilson's vision would inform the foreign policy of presidents
from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And it would spark an ambivalence that follows America into
nearly every conflict it enters. A recent Kansas City Star poll,
for example, found that only 45 percent of respondents ``strongly
agreed'' or ``agreed'' that the United States should serve as the
world's ``policeman.'' Forty-four percent ``somewhat disagreed'' or
``strongly disagreed.''
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence, however, cannot mask a reality that has marked
America ever since World War I. ``The real lesson from the teens,''
said Jeff Moran, history professor at the University of Kansas,
``is that we must participate in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1910s, America had largely avoided that, wrapping
itself in what Moran called ``this old tradition of American
exceptionalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to think of ourselves as a shining city on a hill,''
Moran said, ``that we'll be an example to the rest of the world and
not participate in it.''
</P>
<P>
   America had, to be sure, done its share of participating before
this century's second decade. It had acquired colonies from its
victory in the Spanish-American War, negotiated a peace treaty
between Russia and Japan in 1run e-inch.pgm 905 and flexed its
muscle by sending the Navy on a worldwide tour.
</P>
<P>
   But until Wilson's address, America had never fought on European
soil. No sitting president had ever crossed the Atlantic. America
simply did not meddle in Europe's affairs. For most of this
century's first two decades, America simply shone.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: By 1913 its industrial production outpaced that of all
other countries. The same year, the Ford Motor Co. set up the first
moving assembly line and was soon producing a thousand Model T cars
a day. Cities erected skyscrapers. Tractors tilled farms.
</P>
<P>
   From the turn of the century until World War I, progressives
fought to alleviate the suffering of the poor, to give women the
vote, to give workers a fighting chance against corporate America
and to bring democracy closer to the people (most notably with the
popular election of senators in 1913).
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's take care of life at home,'' much of America seemed to
say at the outset of the Great War. ``Europe can bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as America resisted joining the war, it could not
resist joining the world, or keeping the world at bay.
</P>
<P>
   By 1910 foreign-born residents made up nearly 15 percent of the
population and held close to 24 percent of the country's jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Armory Show of 1913 toured New York, Chicago and Boston with
nearly 1,300 works of modern art, about a third of them foreign and
many of them bewilderingly abstract. Picasso, van Gogh, Matisse and
others shocked mainstream America out of its cultural isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's modernist literature found a new audience in America as
dozens of publishing houses emerged to showcase the likes of James
Joyce.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, AT&AMP;T technicians made the first trans-Atlantic
radiotelephone call.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the war, sending nearly 2 million soldiers overseas to
fight the Germans. Europe ignited the pens of these
tourist-doughboys, who mailed their impressions not only of the war
but also of France to millions of Americans. Many of them were
farmers who had never traveled more than 50 miles from home. They
wrote about lands teeming with history and aging cathedrals, about
verdant landscapes and trips to the Eiffel Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade any of U.S. for an equal part of France,''
wrote Capt. Harry S. Truman to his sweetheart, Bess Wallace, ``but
if I had to give up being a Missourian I'd be a citizen of France
by second choice.''
</P>
<P>
   To the 200,000 black soldiers who served in Europe, the relative
freedom and respect they encountered meant more than beautiful
vistas and old churches. In France they were exposed to a less
racist society, one that embraced the jazz they played and awarded
some of them the Croix de Guerre for their battlefield
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Negro soldier returning from the front,'' wrote Emmett J.
Scott in his Official History of the American Negro in the World
War, ``bore it grievously that on arriving home he had to ride in
`Jim Crow' cars, and be excluded from the use of public places.''
At war's end, 110,000 of these letter writers lay dead _ more than
half as a result of the Spanish influenza that killed millions
worldwide. Americans _ dubious about the war's accomplishments _
wanted nothing to do with Europe's problems, the League of Nations
or Wilson's dream of moral leadership. For nearly two decades after
Congress rejected the Treaty of Versailles, America would keep to
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even as America rejected Wilson's dream, the Bolshevik
Revolution of 1917 planted the seeds for its permanent return.
True, World War II and America's entry into the United Nations
breathed new life into that dream. But the fear of Soviet expansion
made it last.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to President Truman _ the World War I hero from Missouri
who said the war messages of Woodrow Wilson stirred him ``heart and
soul'' _ explain why the United States should aid Greece and Turkey
to curb communism: ``I believe that we must assist free peoples to
work out their own destinies in their own way.'' (MORE)

LET'S TURN THE ROCKIES INTO AMERICAN'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' ownership group is extremely concerned with
the possibility that it might be moved to the American League
sometime before the 2002 season, a distinct possibility since the
Diamondbacks agreed to wave veto power on such a move during a
three-year window that starts this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general partner  &UR; Jerry Colangelo was in
Milwaukee last week and managed to meet up with Commissioner  &UR; Bud
Selig to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball forced the Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay,
which each joined the league last year, in an eleventh-hour tactic
the night before the franchises were awarded back in the spring of
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a $310 million investment here, while others who
own their clubs may have put in $13 million,'' Colangelo said,
taking a swipe at New York Yankees owner  &UR; George Steinbrenner, who
bought the Yankees in 1973 for $13 million. ``We've completed a new
study that shows 85 percent of our fans want us to remain in the
National League. We're going to live by whatever they decide, we
just want them to know all of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   All this talk of restructuring centers around the Texas Rangers'
valid argument that they be moved out of the AL West, where they
are the only Central time zone club while the others are all in the
Pacific time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's logical to move, say, Arizona to take Texas' spot,
there is another, far more logical move that could help alleviate
two potential problems. Instead of moving the Diamondbacks to the
AL West, why not consider asking Colorado to switch leagues?
</P>
<P>
   It would help the Diamondbacks remain in the National League,
where they have built some quick rivalries with San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Chicago in a short time. Plus, whatever club or clubs
they meet in the playoffs this season will become instant rivals
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, moving Colorado to the AL might finally help
that club see what it truly is, an AL-style club that plays in an
AL-style ballpark. The altitude will never decrease in Denver,
meaning the Rockies will be forced to play like they have in their
first seven years, waiting for the long ball to help provide runs.
</P>
<P>
   Why not simply make it official in Colorado? After all, the
Rockies are an AL club disguised within the NL, where they have no
chance to compete as long as the style of play remains more slash
and dash than the hammer-time style they play in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Expect this item to be brought up when owners meet next week in
Cooperstown. Of course, all this probably makes way too much sense
for baseball's powers that be to see it that way. However, the
Diamondbacks can be moved against their will, the Rockies cannot. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Sammy Sosa entered the weekend series with 59 home runs. His club,
the Chicago Cubs, had 56 victories before they were set to take on
Houston during the weekend, meaning Sosa could become the first
player ever to hit more home runs than his club has victories. Who
were the closest to achieve this feat? &QL; 
The real world &QL; 
If this kind of thinking is pervasive within the major leagues,
then maybe we are still living in the Dark Ages. New York Yankees
outfielder  &UR; Chad Curtis was asked last week his thoughts about
former outfielder  &UR; Billy Bean coming out of the closet and
admitting his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you polled every player in this room,'' Curtis said, ``they
would tell you they wouldn't want to even have the thought another
guy on the team might be checking them out. You have a lot of guys
in this room who are fairly uncomfortable with the idea of women in
the media coming in here _ even just the notion they're being
looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we're relieved by Detroit General Manager  &UR; Randy
Smith, who was San Diego's GM at the time Bean played for the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would've judged him on ability,'' Smith said.
``I don't think of him any differently no matter what his
lifestyle, and people would've judged him for what he was because
people knew him. In today's society, it would've had much less of
an impact than it might've had years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, it's highly unlikely any gay player would come
out during his playing days. The harassment would undoubtedly make
what
 &UR; Jackie Robinson went through in breaking the color barrier seem
like a day at the beach. &QL; 
The bizarre world &QL; 
Those wacky New York Mets have adopted the old Doors tune ``Mojo
Risin'' as their 1999 theme song.  &UR; Patricia Morrison,  &UR; Jim
Morrison's widow, was a special guest of the Mets for their game
against San Francisco last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Morrison is revered as a high priestess in the witch
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a perfect anagram for Jim Morrison,'' Patricia said.
``The song is about Los Angeles, which is kind of ironic. The
California friends of mine are very annoyed at the Dodgers for
letting the song get away. . . . I find all this extremely ironic.
I'm amused, flattered and honored. I think it's really cool. This
is Jim's way of going to baseball games.'' &QL; 
LA's real house of blues &QL; 
``Los Angeles Times'' columnist  &UR; Bill Plaschke put together these
quotes from several Dodgers sources for a recent entertaining
piece. Some highlights:

The wife of Seattle Mariners owner  &UR; Hiroboshi Yamauchi, the
Japanese tycoon, visited Seattle for the first time last week.
Mariners chairman  &UR; John Ellis and president  &UR; Chuck Armstrong
escorted the Yamauchi congregation on a tour of new Safeco Field.
She took pictures with Manager  &UR; Lou Piniella and  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>

   Yamauchi, the chairman of Nintendo, bought the Mariners in the

</P>
<P>
   &UR; What, this? I brought it in with me: With nine more games
remaining at Tiger Stadium, fans have started taking bits and
pieces of the old park home with them after games. One fan tried to
take a urinal from the stadium last week before he was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback (very special edition): Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, may
he finally rest in peace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quick pop quiz for 20 points: Over the course of the past five
seasons, only two pitchers have won at least 15 games each season.
One is easy because it's Atlanta's  &UR; Greg Maddux. The other?
 &UR; Charles Nagy of the Cleveland Indians. Surprise!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Forget Joe DiMaggio's whereabouts. Where have you
 &UR; gone, Rickey Henderson?: The American League leader in stolen bases
entering the weekend was Toronto's  &UR; Shannon Stewart, who had a
grand total of 36 steals. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees closer  &UR; Mariano Rivera, who entered the weekend
having converted all 17 save opportunities since July 16, has not
walked the first batter he has faced in any appearance since July
9, 1998. That's a span of 81 consecutive regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   With his club-leading 29 home runs this season,  &UR; Eric
 &UR; Karros is within five of tying  &UR; Steve Garvey for second place on
the all-time list since moving to Los Angeles with 211. Former
third baseman  &UR; Ron Cey tops the LA list with 228 home runs, a
figure that probably will remain since it's doubtful Karros will
return next year.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's  &UR; Cal Ripken grounded into the 323rd double-play of
his career last week, tying the AL record held by  &UR; Carl
 &UR; Yastrzemski. If he hits into five more, he will tie  &UR; Hank Aaron for
the major league record.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday's game between Los Angeles and Florida featured a
starting match-up of Dodgers rookie  &UR; Eric Gagne and  &UR; Ryan
 &UR; Dempster of the Marlins. It was the first time a pair of
Canadian-born pitchers started against each other in a National
League game since St. Louis'  &UR; Reggie Cleveland and  &UR; Ferguson
Jenkins of the Chicago Cubs faced each other on July 28, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Rusty Greer hits his next home run, Texas will become just
the seventh club in big league history to feature six players with
at least 20 home runs. The other five players are  &UR; Rafael
 &UR; Palmeiro,  &UR; Juan Gonzalez,  &UR; Ivan Rodriguez,  &UR; Lee Stevens and  &UR; Todd
Ziele. The record is seven by the 1996 Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of their first 139 games, the Florida Marlins
have seen 14 games delayed because of rain, tying the club record
set in 1997. In addition, three other games have been postponed.
This was the single biggest fear when the Marlins were awarded
their franchise. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore would love to trade  &UR; Delino DeShields during the
winter, making room for  &UR; Jerry Hairston. The $4.17 million
DeShields is due to be paid in each of the next two seasons,
however, makes it highly unlikely. By the way, GM  &UR; Frank Wren was
overruled by owner
 &UR; Peter Angelos on the DeShields contract last winter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ray Lankford, St. Louis' capable center fielder for most of the
past eight years, wants to remain in left field, where he primarily
has played this year as added protection for his surgically
repaired left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite  &UR; David Segui's being traded from Seattle to Toronto two
months ago, don't rule out the possibility of the first baseman
returning to the Mariners as a free agent during the winter.
Seattle still needs a first baseman, and the other potential free
agent,  &UR; John Olerud of the Mets, figures to be much more expensive,
though he is a Washington State native.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pitcher  &UR; Chad Ogea, who has given up 35 home runs,
is fairly certain the Phillies will not pick up his $3 million
option for next season. Ogea arrived in a trade with Cleveland and
entered the season as the No. 2 starter in the rotation. He's now
in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outfielder  &UR; Bobby Higginson, who has missed the past six
weeks because of a toe injury, will probably not be able to return
this season. But instead of  &UR; Karim Garcia being inserted in left
field, it's been  &UR; Luis Polonia.
</P>
<P>
   The job of Colorado's general manager is apparently down to a
pair of finalists: Former Cleveland assistant  &UR; Dan O'Dowd and
first-year Rockies assistant  &UR; Gary Hughes, who helped scout, sign
and develop many stars in Montreal and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dwight Gooden's spot on Cleveland's roster is said to be
hanging by a thread. Gooden is 3-3 with a 6.23 ERA in 23 games (19
starts) this year. He has just 76 strikeouts in 99 innings. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Atlanta &UR; Chipper Jones is making quite a statement about being
the MVP.  &QL;

22. ColoradoThe post office is open in Denver, where they're
mailing it in. ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; San Diego Padres: It's much too late, but the Padres have been
on a roll for a while now. The goal is not only to finish at or
above .500 but to make good on General Manager  &UR; Kevin Towers'
spring training call that the Padres would finish ahead of either
San Francisco or Los Angeles. The Dodgers slipped one-half game
behind San Diego heading into this weekend's series'. Also, it
appears  &UR; George
 &UR; Arias' shot at third base is over. The club has no plans to summon
him and intends to stick with  &UR; Phil Nevin, who was awarded a
three-year contract extension last week. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chicago White Sox: Now that it appears  &UR; Frank Thomas' season is
finished (bad ankle), the White Sox are in no better shape. This is
a club that has gone into a free fall in recent weeks and, if not
for being in the AL Comedy Central division, could easily find
itself in the cellar. As it is, the other three clubs among this
sorry lot are in hot pursuit of whatever comes with being the best
behind Cleveland. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston pitcher  &UR; John Wasdin after Seattle Manager  &UR; Lou
 &UR; Piniella insinuated the right-hander was somehow altering baseballs
with his belt buckle: ``I think he thought, `That guy doesn't have
anything that moves.' He kept saying, `His belt, his belt.' Maybe
he liked my belt. I got it at Nordstrom's. It was on sale.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most celebrated arrival in Pittsburgh since  &UR; Barry Bonds
burst on the scene in 1986 came last week when outfielder  &UR; Chad
 &UR; Hermansen, the club's first-round pick in 1995, was called up from
the minors. Not many Pirates farmhands have created this kind of
stir. Hermansen, from Henderson, Nev., hit .270 with 32 home runs,
97 RBIs and 19 stolen bases in 125 games this year at Triple-A
Nashville. The 21-year-old is slotted to be a Pirates everyday
outfielder for years to come. ``I want to see him play, and I think
the fans want to see him play,'' Pittsburgh Manager  &UR; Gene Lamont
said. ``We're a small-market team. We have to use our farm system
to develop talent, and everyone is excited about the kind of talent
Chad Hermansen has.'' &QL;

 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' ownership group is extremely concerned with
the possibility that it might be moved to the American League
sometime before the 2002 season, a distinct possibility since the
Diamondbacks agreed to wave veto power on such a move during a
three-year window that starts this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks managing general partner  &UR; Jerry Colangelo was in
Milwaukee last week and managed to meet up with Commissioner  &UR; Bud
Selig to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball forced the Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay,
which each joined the league last year, in an eleventh-hour tactic
the night before the franchises were awarded back in the spring of
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a $310 million investment here, while others who
own their clubs may have put in $13 million,'' Colangelo said,
taking a swipe at New York Yankees owner  &UR; George Steinbrenner, who
bought the Yankees in 1973 for $13 million. ``We've completed a new
study that shows 85 percent of our fans want us to remain in the
National League. We're going to live by whatever they decide, we
just want them to know all of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   All this talk of restructuring centers around the Texas Rangers'
valid argument that they be moved out of the AL West, where they
are the only Central time zone club while the others are all in the
Pacific time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's logical to move, say, Arizona to take Texas' spot,
there is another, far more logical move that could help alleviate
two potential problems. Instead of moving the Diamondbacks to the
AL West, why not consider asking Colorado to switch leagues?
</P>
<P>
   It would help the Diamondbacks remain in the National League,
where they have built some quick rivalries with San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Chicago in a short time. Plus, whatever club or clubs
they meet in the playoffs this season will become instant rivals
for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, moving Colorado to the AL might finally help
that club see what it truly is, an AL-style club that plays in an
AL-style ballpark. The altitude will never decrease in Denver,
meaning the Rockies will be forced to play like they have in their
first seven years, waiting for the long ball to help provide runs.
</P>
<P>
   Why not simply make it official in Colorado? After all, the
Rockies are an AL club disguised within the NL, where they have no
chance to compete as long as the style of play remains more slash
and dash than the hammer-time style they play in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Expect this item to be brought up when owners meet next week in
Cooperstown. Of course, all this probably makes way too much sense
for baseball's powers that be to see it that way. However, the
Diamondbacks can be moved against their will, the Rockies cannot. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
 &UR; Sammy Sosa entered the weekend series with 59 home runs. His club,
the Chicago Cubs, had 56 victories before they were set to take on
Houston during the weekend, meaning Sosa could become the first
player ever to hit more home runs than his club has victories. Who
were the closest to achieve this feat? &QL; 
The real world &QL; 
If this kind of thinking is pervasive within the major leagues,
then maybe we are still living in the Dark Ages. New York Yankees
outfielder  &UR; Chad Curtis was asked last week his thoughts about
former outfielder  &UR; Billy Bean coming out of the closet and
admitting his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you polled every player in this room,'' Curtis said, ``they
would tell you they wouldn't want to even have the thought another
guy on the team might be checking them out. You have a lot of guys
in this room who are fairly uncomfortable with the idea of women in
the media coming in here _ even just the notion they're being
looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, we're relieved by Detroit General Manager  &UR; Randy
Smith, who was San Diego's GM at the time Bean played for the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone would've judged him on ability,'' Smith said.
``I don't think of him any differently no matter what his
lifestyle, and people would've judged him for what he was because
people knew him. In today's society, it would've had much less of
an impact than it might've had years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, it's highly unlikely any gay player would come
out during his playing days. The harassment would undoubtedly make
what
 &UR; Jackie Robinson went through in breaking the color barrier seem
like a day at the beach. &QL; 
The bizarre world &QL; 
Those wacky New York Mets have adopted the old Doors tune ``Mojo
Risin'' as their 1999 theme song.  &UR; Patricia Morrison,  &UR; Jim
Morrison's widow, was a special guest of the Mets for their game
against San Francisco last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Morrison is revered as a high priestess in the witch
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a perfect anagram for Jim Morrison,'' Patricia said.
``The song is about Los Angeles, which is kind of ironic. The
California friends of mine are very annoyed at the Dodgers for
letting the song get away. . . . I find all this extremely ironic.
I'm amused, flattered and honored. I think it's really cool. This
is Jim's way of going to baseball games.'' &QL; 
LA's real house of blues &QL; 
``Los Angeles Times'' columnist  &UR; Bill Plaschke put together these
quotes from several Dodgers sources for a recent entertaining
piece. Some highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers GM  &UR; Kevin Malone, Feb. 18: ``They can't forget us now,
because they know the Dodgers are back.'' Malone, Aug. 23: ``Yes,
we did inherit some situations that we're still trying to fix.''

   &UR; San Diego Padres: It's much too late, but the Padres have been
on a roll for a while now. The goal is not only to finish at or

San Francisco or Los Angeles. The Dodgers slipped one-half game
behind San Diego heading into this weekend's series'. Also, it

   The most celebrated arrival in Pittsburgh since  &UR; Barry Bonds
burst on the scene in 1986 came last week when outfielder  &UR; Chad

the minors. Not many Pirates farmhands have created this kind of
stir. Hermansen, from Henderson, Nev., hit .270 with 32 home runs,
97 RBIs and 19 stolen bases in 125 games this year at Triple-A
Nashville. The 21-year-old is slotted to be a Pirates everyday
outfielder for years to come. ``I want to see him play, and I think
the fans want to see him play,'' Pittsburgh Manager  &UR; Gene Lamont
said. ``We're a small-market team. We have to use our farm system
to develop talent, and everyone is excited about the kind of talent
Chad Hermansen has.'' &QL;

DANFORTH FACES MONUMENTAL TASK IN WACO INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- WACO-COMMITTEE 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY and DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Jack Danforth canceled plans to go fishing this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly, he has work to do. News media from everywhere
want to interview the former U.S. senator from Missouri, and for
now he will happily oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, he is going to clam up and hunker down in what
promises to be an exhausting and tedious investigation into one of
the most contentious episodes in recent American history. Getting
to the truth of the April 19, 1993, tragedy at the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas, will take time, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How much time? Danforth can only speculate and hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking months rather than years,'' said the man
appointed last week by Attorney General Janet Reno to serve as
special counsel to the Waco probe.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than six years already.
</P>
<P>
   The physical evidence alone _ items plucked from the compound's
ashes, including rifles and grenades and 5-gallon buckets filled
with ammunition rounds _ weighs in at more than 24,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There will be hundreds of interviews to conduct, videotapes to
review and crates upon crates of documents to pore over. In Texas a
wrongful-death lawsuit pending against the U.S. government tells
the Waco tale in no fewer than 25 volumes, each 3 or 4 inches
thick.
</P>
<P>
   And if Danforth has his way _ he insists he will _ the public
will not be tipped to what his staff discovers until the probe is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who talks to the media, who leaks anything, is out,''
said Danforth, snapping his fingers to accentuate the point.
``That's an absolute priority....We'll be looking for good lawyers,
good investigators, confident people, and we need people who will
keep their lips zipped.''
</P>
<P>
   For now the Danforth team numbers three _ himself, U.S. Attorney
Edward L. Dowd and Thomas Schweich, one of Danforth's partners at
the Bryan Cave law firm. The government will pay Danforth and Dowd
$118,000 each annually.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth has 60 days to complete a budget. He said he would
recruit private lawyers and government investigators from agencies
that were not targets of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Each staffer will be required to disclose financial holdings and
subjected to intense background checks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation will be based in St. Louis, the home of
Republican Danforth and Democrat Dowd, who will be the chief
investigator. A specific office site has not been determined, but
Dowd said a ``top security'' facility would be needed to store the
records and evidence in safes.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways ``it's like any other criminal investigation,''
said Dowd, a one-time Kansas Citian who is stepping down as federal
prosecutor to assist Danforth. ``You get the facts, you examine the
law, compare the two, and then you pull the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as both men know, this is no typical case.
</P>
<P>
   The three big questions they seek to answer are chilling:
</P>
<P>
   Did the government cover up vital information about the FBI's
siege at Waco and the deadly fire that ended it?
</P>
<P>
   Did the military have an improper involvement?
</P>
<P>
   And, as Danforth bluntly puts it: ``Did federal officials kill
people?''
</P>
<P>
   The 42-story One Metropolitan Square, with its buffed offices
and captivating view of the Gateway Arch, is a long way from the
hand-cobbled compound that David Koresh and his religious followers
occupied in the rural outskirts of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' largest law firm, Bryan Cave, occupies six floors
near the top. Danforth practices law here and, for the moment, the
skyscraper is but the latest in a series of venues that the Waco
incident has traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993 various aspects of the standoff have been scrutinized
by the Texas Rangers; the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms; the Justice Department; criminal courts; civil courts;
documentary film crews; conspiracy peddlers; Internet Web masters;
and at least two congressional committees.
</P>
<P>
   The tides of available information, and misinformation, were
monstrous even before they shifted last month. That is when the FBI
acknowledged that two or three military tear-gas canisters capable
of starting a fire were shot at a concrete bunker hours before the
Branch Davidian compound became engulfed in smoke and flames.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and other authorities said they had no reason to think the
canisters _ which were used on the orders Richard Rogers, FBI
Hostage Rescue Team commander _ contributed to the blaze in which
Koresh and about 80 of his followers died.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation that combustible projectiles were fired
defied years of sworn statements by federal agents. And Friday, The
Associated Press reported that an FBI lab report _ turned over to
Congress eight months after the tragedy _ was missing a key page
that acknowledged the use of the tear-gas canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Danforth, 63, was expecting to enjoy autumn weekends
fishing and anticipating the births of five more grandchildren, he
now finds himself wading into an issue where the political
radioactivity jumps off the meter.
</P>
<P>
   And with national elections on the horizon, the heat could
become more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lot of folks on the Hill who have their political
agendas, then there will be people in the FBI and in the Department
of Justice who have their political agendas,'' said former Kansas
Congressman Jim Slattery, a Democrat. ``I think that Danforth has
the opportunity to really be the honest broker.''
</P>
<P>
   Danforth will have to contend with Congress, where members are
praising him one minute and then embarking on their own search for
the truth about Waco the next.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee has issued subpoenas, in
all likelihood for many of the same people Danforth will want to
interview. Committee Chairman Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican,
has been an outspoken critic of the Clinton administration and led
an investigation into the 1996 campaign-finance scandal.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, an Illinois
Republican, has drafted legislation to create a five-member joint
House-Senate commission to look into Waco. He intends to proceed
only if he becomes convinced that the Justice Department is
stymieing Danforth's probe.

DANFORTH FACES MONUMENTAL TASK IN WACO INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- WACO-COMMITTEE 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY and DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Even in Danforth's old haunt, the Senate, he faces
competition from Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican,
who also plans to weigh in on Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding characteristically deferential, Danforth said: ``I'm
not going to try to tell Congress what to do,'' but privately, he
may be wondering how, with so many cooks trying to stir a simmering
pot, the process will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works poorly,'' said Bill Frenzel, a Republican member of
Congress for 20 years and now a guest scholar at the Brookings
Institution. ``What happens is Congress wants to get people and
they try to cooperate with the independent counsel, but they do
step on each other toes.''
</P>
<P>
   The most notable example is the Iran-contra scandal in the
1980s. Both Congress and independent counsel Lawrence Walsh
investigated the illegal funneling of money and the trading of arms
for hostages, involving Nicaraguan revolutionaries and the Iranian
government.
</P>
<P>
   A court overturned the convictions Walsh won against two of the
key figures, Reagan White House aides Oliver North and John
Poindexter. The court ruled that the immunity granted them to
testify before Congress made it impossible for them to get a fair
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competing investigations where immunity is given can wreck a
prosecution,'' said Michael R. Bromwich, an Iran-contra prosecutor
and one of the trial lawyers in the North case.
</P>
<P>
   Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general, said
that everyone would be trying to interview the same witnesses and
that witnesses got tired of talking. The pressure also could force
Danforth into interviewing some witnesses before he was ready,
Bromwich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have competing bodies looking to interview the same
people, you do run into problems,'' he said. ``You need to know
what is being told to the other investigators. There are just a lot
of complications. This is a difficult enough one to master with the
passage of time and the extensive factual record.''
</P>
<P>
   If criminal wrongdoing is found, ``we will prosecute,'' Danforth
pledged.
</P>
<P>
   The special counsel at least will issue a final report to the
attorney general, and the report will be made public. Danforth and
Dowd said they hoped that when their investigation was complete,
Americans would consider the Waco tragedy a ``case closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck Revell expressed hope, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you can get to the bottom of this,'' said the retired FBI
special agent, who oversaw the agency's Dallas office when the
siege occurred. But Revell said he expected the final judgment to
be relatively mundane.
</P>
<P>
   ``A breakdown in communication'' within the FBI, Revell
predicted the special counsel would conclude. ``There will be no
conspiracy, no widespread cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's presuming everyone else had perfect knowledge of
what was happening in Waco, and that's just not how these things
are handled,'' Revell said. ``There were serious problems with the
way things were handled, but those problem had nothing to do with
the Davidians dying at their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the legacy of Waco, there will be accusations that
the fix is in. At least one group already insists as much.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth is ``just another `Washington Club' politician who will
likely compromise justice,'' declares a news release of Judicial
Watch, a right-wing legal group that is suing the government over
Waco. ``The choice of ex-Senator Danforth...is like having the fox
investigate his own hen house massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cox, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety,
expected as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid that no matter how hard we work, people will be
talking about all the possibilities long after I'm here to worry
about it,'' said Cox, who in 1993 was the media's point man when
state investigators fished out evidence from the charred debris.
``We're still talking about the Kennedy assassination and the
grassy knoll, aren't we?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Jack Danforth can give this the funeral it deserves. I'd
like to see the whole thing rest in peace, though I don't think I
ever will.''

TV '99 _ THE YOUNG, THE PRETTY AND THE CRUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know you mean well, but you really have to let me grow up.'' &QL; 
That's a line from a new television series this fall. So what? you
say. What precocious teen hasn't uttered the same words to her
parents?
</P>
<P>
   But that's just it _ it's not a teen who says it. It's a grown
woman. A mother herself. A judge, no less.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the new fall season. Think young,
attractive actors. Then chop a few years off what you're picturing.
Add a couple of levels of beauty, subtract a measure of maturity,
and you've got the idea.
</P>
<P>
   And if the characters aren't young, they act it _ see the above
example, from Judging Amy, a new CBS show that stars Amy Brenne man
as a single mother living with her mom.
</P>
<P>
   Further proof? Check out the title of a new ABC comedy about
three men living together, one of whom recently discovered he was
gay, which understandably fouled up his marriage, another of whom
discov ers he has a teenage daughter: Oh Grow Up.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the title of a show. It's a theme for the season.
</P>
<P>
   You can thank the WB Network for this. Or blame it, if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Felicity and Dawson's Creek
don't necessarily draw viewers in droves (droves defined as many,
many millions of people), but they leave advertisers with their
mouths hanging open, drool pooling at their feet. Advertisers love
young people. Thus, so do network programmers. And that matters
because?
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where there are increased costs and increased com
petition, and where the business is being defined by very specific
demographic groups . . . TV shows are just there so people will
watch the commercials,'' Chris Albrecht, HBO's president for
original pro gramming, told television critics this summer. Of
course, a cable guy would say that.
</P>
<P>
   But he's right.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, there is nothing inherently bad about watch
ing beautiful young people doing wacky things. If there were,
C-SPAN would be a ratings leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's what they call fantasy fulfillment,'' said Paul Feig,
the creator of the season's best new show, Freaks and Geeks.
``That's the mantra that most executives in town have, which is
teens don't want to watch their lives portrayed. They want to see
the fantasy version of their lives. And that is true _ these shows
do really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who run networks must think so. Otherwise such
teen-heavy shows as Safe Harbor, Roswell and Popular wouldn't have
found a spot in the fall lineup. And those are just the new WB teen
offerings. At least six other shows on the other networks feature
teens in either lead roles or major sup porting ones: Odd Man Out
on ABC; Freaks and Geeks on NBC; and Get Real, Manchester Prep, The
Bad Land and Malcolm in the Middle on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   But a little variety is nice. Freaks and Geeks happily avoids
fantasy fulfillment, opting instead for a more realistic, if
touchingly hilari ous, look at high school in the early '80s. Feig
just didn't have it in him to do a show about magazine-cover
candidates emoting about their Pent house Forum-grade sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are being written, and I don't think they're
based on anybody's real experience,'' he said earlier this month on
a break from shooting the show. ``That's a harsh statement, and it
might not even be true. But I sincerely can't believe that many
people were that cool at that age. We're not wired that way. I
don't know anybody who's that cool now.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Feig might be. He certainly came up with the coolest
show. And there are a surprising number of good ones this fall
(especially when you consider that in some years, that number is
zero).
</P>
<P>
   This time next year, titles like Freaks and Geeks, Action and
Malcolm in the Middle ought to sound familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, titles like Shasta McNasty, The Bad Land and Jack and
Jill won't sound familiar this time next month. Next week, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes every fall season. Some shows hit. Most miss. Here's
a quick glance at some things to look for over the next few months:
</P>
<P>
   A wide-open Thursday night. For years, NBC has ruled Thursdays
with an iron fist. But last season, with the departure of Seinfeld
and ER's precipitous drop in quality (the whole Mare
Winningham-psycho doc plot was especially embarrass ing), the
Peacock network began to slip. ER, still the most popular show on
television, lost 14 percent of its viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Any scent of blood in the water sends the other networks
circling. CBS ``retooled'' Chicago Hope (translation: bring back
Mandy Pa tinkin, fire most of the cast and hire a bevy of fabulous
babes in its place) and got a commitment from creator David E.
Kelley to be more hands-on this season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC trots out Wasteland to compete with Frasier. Kevin Wil
liamson, who created Dawson's Creek (and wrote the first two Scream
movies), created this young-adult ensemble about beautiful peo ple
hanging around New York trying to find themselves. C'mon, kids,
there's always modeling to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   UPN, doormat to the other net works, is hoping for salvation
with World Wrestling Federation Smack down! So far, so good, but
its numbers will drop when the other networks' new shows premiere.
</P>
<P>
   NBC isn't standing pat. It's add ing new faces to ER (including
a TV doctor from another television era, Alan Alda, for a few
episodes). It's also putting Stark Raving Mad in the primo slot
behind Frasier. It stars a grown-up Doogie Howser, Neil Patrick
Harris, as a book editor. Don't mark your calendar.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting salvo fired across NBC's bow is Action,
Fox's dead-on comedy about a ruthless Hollywood producer. There is
bleeped-out cursing, one of the main characters is a prostitute,
and much is made of, you know, size. As in, size doesn't really
matter (although it apparently does). If this sounds crude, that's
because it is. It's also really funny, which forgives a lot.
</P>
<P>
   All David E. Kelley, all the time. Or so it might seem. The whiz
kid behind the Emmy-winning The Practice and the ever-so-trendy
Ally McBeal will add to his workload this season.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two previous shows mentioned, Kelley has prom
ised to write a couple of Chicago Hope scripts and to make notes on
others. He's also cutting a half-hour all-comedy version of Ally
McBeal, which will be called Ally. (Perhaps later he will doctor up
an all-drama version called McBeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Snoops, Kelley's new ABC show starring Gina Ger
shon and Paula Marshall as high-tech private eyes. It'll air at 8
p.m. on Sundays, leading into The Prac tice. On the seventh day,
Kelley didn't rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Snoops is a nice com panion piece with The Practice,''
Kelley told critics this summer. ``The color palates are different.
This show really is more about the escapism. It's not nearly as
gritty. It's a distortion of private-detective reality. It's more
oriented towards fun and capers and high jinks, and, therefore, I
don't think it'll exhaust the sensibilities of The Practice
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   It may, however, exhaust the patience of people who like to
watch good TV, if the pilot is any indication. It's looking like a
rare misfire from the most prolific man in television since Dick
Van Patten's character on Eight Is Enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a somewhat related matter, Aaron Sorkin risks spreading him
self thin this season, too.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kelley, Sorkin is a rarity _ he writes most of his scripts
himself (in his case, for the great Sports Night). So if you're
trying to build an audience for a critically ac claimed show, what
do you do? Sign on for another one, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin's The West Wing, on NBC, is a mostly comic look at the
White House of a fictional president, played by Martin Sheen. The
big relief is that the pilot is great. The big question is how long
Sorkin can maintain the quality of both.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question for Sorkin and Kelley both: Don't you guys
ever sleep?
</P>
<P>
   More adult language, more skin, more sex. And that's just on
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous predictions about the fall season from television
critics.
</P>
<P>
   More immature antics, silly situations and childlike behavior
than you'll find on the first day of the semester at a junior high
school. From kids or from adults?
</P>
<P>
   This fall, from everyone. &QL;

CONTENDER OR PRETENDER: WHICH CARDINALS TEAM WILL WE SEE TODAY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - They're not having an identity crisis, even if
the rest of the football world is driving itself crazy trying to
figure the Cardinals out.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the team that was picked by many to win the NFC East, or
the one that lost three preseason games by an average of 33 points?
</P>
<P>
   ``The team that everybody is writing off is the same one that
people picked to win the division at the start of (training)
camp,'' defensive back J.J. McCleskey said.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, the Cardinals, who open the 1999 regular
season today at Philadelphia, put on an Academy Award-winning
performance this summer, these sand-baggers in football cleats.
</P>
<P>
   They are coming off their most turbulent preseason in 11 years
in Arizona, one that ended with a 36-point loss at home to the
Oakland Raiders, their worst preseason defeat in 43 years.
</P>
<P>
   The feeding frenzy started almost as soon as the Raiders game
ended. Those football experts who had been picking the Cardinals to
make the playoffs for the second consecutive year were now changing
their predictions to drop them ahead of only the Eagles in the NFC
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is strange,'' Eagles linebacker James Darling said. ``Last
year ended on such a high note for them (the Cardinals), and
especially around the league, people thought Arizona would be one
of the teams to beat. We thought they all would come back this year
with their heels clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp began with the Cardinals missing their top tackler
of a year ago (linebacker Jamir Miller), all-time leading receiver
(Larry Centers) and best blocker (Lomas Brown), all gone in free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cardinals took the field against the Raiders, they were
without four offensive starters _ quarterback Jake Plummer (thumb),
left guard Chris Dishman (elbow), right guard Lester Holmes
(lacerated forehead in a car accident in which three players were
injured) and wide receiver Rob Moore (holdout).
</P>
<P>
   Moore signed on Thursday but is expected to see only limited
duty today. Dishman hasn't played in a game since last January.
Holmes has been out for nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Coach Vince Tobin made four starting lineup changes
Monday. Zack Walz, who weighs only 219 pounds, was inserted at
right outside linebacker. Terry Hardy, who has no career catches,
was promoted at tight end. Journeyman Matt Joyce takes over at left
offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little bit of a mystery,'' center Aaron Graham said.
``But, internally, we're as focused as we've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals still have two holdouts _ veteran defensive tackle
Mark Smith and first-round pick L.J. Shelton, the Eastern Michigan
offensive tackle _ and defensive lineman Eric Swann hasn't
recovered from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   How effective Moore will be after only one practice is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's holdout made a starter out of top draft pick David
Boston, the Ohio State wide receiver picked eighth overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely will help him out,'' Moore said of Boston. ``Just
knowing the (Eagles') defensive players, things that work and don't
work against them, I need to pass that on.''
</P>
<P>
   Another rookie starting in his first NFL game is fullback Joel
Makovicka, a fourth-round pick from Nebraska who won the job in the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be a little nervous, but it helps that I played in
front of 80,000 fans in college,'' Makovicka said. ``But all of the
(veterans) have told me that the speed of the game picks up three
or four times from the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the condition of Plummer's thumb. It improved every
day last week, but he still won't be at 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can make all the throws,'' Tobin said. ``It's a matter of
if he can make them all consistently through a complete ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   All-pro cornerback Aeneas Williams understands why many fans
have become skeptical about the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what they think of us right now,'' said Williams,
one of two defensive captains. ``Maybe because of all that has
happened, the public is taking a wait-and-see attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt in Williams' mind how the Cardinals will do
today. He gave the team a fiery pep talk after Friday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like what Aeneas said, `We don't care what everyone
in the outside world thinks. We know what we've got,' '' defensive
coordinator Dave McGinnis said.

JAKE'S THUMB IS BIG SUBJECT FOR VALLEY FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - Hold up your right thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it for a moment. (OK, that's long enough.) The thumb is
the Swiss Army knife of body parts. It's as versatile as a utility
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   A thumb can flip a coin. Pop a cork. Pry a lid. Cock a gun. Turn
a page. Hitch a ride. Shoot marbles. Call a runner out.
</P>
<P>
   Without a thumb, how would we eat with chopsticks? Or hold a
glass? Or stroke our chin? Or give the thumbs-up sign?
</P>
<P>
   Without thumbs, what would we twiddle?
</P>
<P>
   The thumb is underrated. We take it for granted. It doesn't get
the attention, or respect, it deserves. Look up ``thumb'' in the
``World'' ``Book'' &UR; encyclopedia. Know what it says?
</P>
<P>
   See ``Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jake Plummer is to be commended. Since being injured in a
preseason game 23 days ago, Plummer has raised public awareness
about the human thumb and its importance, at least as it relates to
the Cardinals season.
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to say the No. 1 question going into today's season
opener is ``How's Jake's thumb?''
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever think about Plummer's thumb, or anybody else's for
that matter, until now?
</P>
<P>
   The thumb on Plummer's throwing hand is the talk of Valley
sports. Fans haven't been this concerned about an athlete's
physical condition since Charles Barkley experienced back problems,
when the Suns were a championship-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   After Barkley collapsed at training camp, the Suns switchboard
lit up with calls from worried fans. Many wrote Sir Charles,
offering help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Charles,'' Barkley said one day, reading aloud a letter
in his hands. ``You are my favorite player. I heard about your back
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley stopped in mid-sentence. ``My back. Everybody wants to
know about my ``bac''k! . . . You wouldn't believe the stuff I get.
I've got every back magazine in the world. Every back book in the
world. Chiropractors. Exercises. ``Everybody'' has a cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles held up a product he received in the mail. ``See this?''
The canister contained a powdered protein supplement. ``Some lady
sent me these milkshakes. For my BACK!''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer hasn't been besieged with home remedies, although you
suspect some exist. Instead, every day since a Tennessee defensive
lineman mistook Jake's right thumb for a slot-machine lever the
Cardinals quarterback has undergone conventional treatment
recommended by team doctors and the training staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ice packs. Heat. Whirlpool baths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultrasound,'' trainer John Omohundro said. ``High voltage
galvanic stimulation'' (Don't try this at home). ``Massage.
Splints. Tape . . .''
</P>
<P>
   What, no faith healer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake might have done that on his own,'' Omohundro said.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Plummer is a $30 million investment, and the most
important and popular player on the team, perhaps the Cardinals
should have flown in one of those traveling evangelists who work
miracles on TV.
</P>
<P>
   One night I saw an elderly man flop over on the stage like a
hooked marlin, get up, throw away his crutches and start dancing
the Charleston after one touch of Benny Hinn's electrified hand. It
seems like a good bet that _ with a little faith on Jake's part _
he could be cured of his sore thumb completely.
</P>
<P>
   Are you hee-yulled?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Plummer admitted after Friday's practice. His right
thumb is still tender. He can't throw the ball as hard as he did
before the injury. He isn't, as we say in sports, 100 percent. His
preseason preparation was limited to three series and 10 passes.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen his grip, Plummer has been squeezing a Nerf ball
and plastic putty.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, Plummer keeps a brace on his right hand. The
devise immobilizes the thumb and provides protection. Without the
brace, Omohundro said, Jake risks accidentally tweaking his thumb
by doing something as simple as ``fluffing a pillow'' during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Jake wore the brace to last week's kickoff luncheon, attended by
about 500 fans. Many were excited to be in Plummer's presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people grab your hand,'' Jake said, ``and squeeze it like
a gorilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Although listed as questionable, Plummer will start against the
Eagles. Will he require a painkiller to play?
</P>
<P>
   Omohundro said he doubts Plummer would take anything stronger
than an Advil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you have with (stronger) oral medication is `How
clear is a guy thinking?'' Omohundro said. The Cardinals trainer
read the warning label on an imaginary bottle of pain pills. ``When
using this medication do not operate heavy machinery. Do not drive
a car. Do not run into 280-pound linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   A good rule of thumb. &QL;

SOME THINGS ARE SURE EVEN BEFORE 1ST KICKOFF

   You can take these to the full-service bank or nearest ATM this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals first-round pick  &UR; L.J. Shelton, star of the NFL's
newest home video, won't be the league's Offensive Rookie of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   The new book on Saints rookie  &UR; Ricky Williams, ``Dreadlocks to
Ditka,'' will sell more copies in the New Orleans area than  &UR; Boomer
Esiason's &UR; new novel ``Toss,'' but won't be as popular as the
Budweiser bottles sprouting dreadlocks and the T-shirts that say,
``Run Ricky Run.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver  &UR; Carl Pickens won't enjoy life
after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Dolphins quarterback  &UR; Jim Druckenmiller won't be inviting
San Francisco 49ers General Manager  &UR; Bill Walsh to hear Salsa bands
on Miami's South Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Eagles owner  &UR; Jeff Lurie will win more games in the
Arena League than in the NFL this season.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years after moving to the Pontiac Silverdome, the
Detroit Lions still will have had more area codes than home playoff
games and playoff victories. &QL; 
America's funniest video
</P>
<P>
   Remember that silly tape Shelton's agent,  &UR; Lamont Smith,
threatened to play if the Cardinals didn't bargain in good faith,
the one that was supposed to show team Vice President  &UR; Bill Bidwill
Jr. saying on draft day that the club would give the Eastern
Michigan offensive tackle a contract filled with ``bells and
whistles''?
</P>
<P>
   It turns out it's a videotape of Shelton's draft-day party, but
the arbitrator didn't let Smith play it at Friday's grievance
hearing because it wasn't made available to the Cardinals earlier
in the discovery process.
</P>
<P>
   You can just imagine how insightful the videotape is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, L.J., pass the spinach dip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lamont, I think we're out of chips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The beer is outside in the cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, somewhere on the tape is Bidwill's voice, but it's
probably drowned out by Smith's clients singing, ``He's (Smith) a
jolly good fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   How absurd are these negotiations going to get?
</P>
<P>
   Two Valley radio stations are asking the same thing. KGME and
KMVP representatives said Friday that on several occasions,
Shelton's camp talked of revealing the tape on the air.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape? On the radio? &QL; 
Book reviews
</P>
<P>
   Few league rookies have had a book written about them before
they take their first regular-season snap. But Williams, the
Heisman Trophy winner, isn't an ordinary rookie, and most of the
book is about his life leading up to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Esiason, meanwhile, considers himself a bit of a Renaissance
man. So he decided to branch out and write his first novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder . . . machinations . . . and the mob keep the pot
boiling to an explosive climax,'' writes ``Publishers Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   Esiason, the former Cardinals quarterback, won't be discussing
all the plot's details on ``Monday Night Football''.
</P>
<P>
   There's the owner's seductive daughter with a thing for rookies
and the corpse of the team's ex-quarterback. &QL; 
About-face
</P>
<P>
   Pickens was so sure he never, ever would play for the Bengals
again that he walked off the field last December singing ``This is
It''.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner  &UR; Mike Brown, refusing to trade Pickens, took him at
his word that Pickens had retired and recently wished him luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he enjoys his golden years,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens will be in a Bengals uniform for today's season opener
at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is strange, one of the strangest here,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens, the team's designated franchise player, signed the
one-year tender offer of $3.53 million and will sign a five-year
deal next week that averages about $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person has the right to change his mind,'' said Pickens,
adding that it's ``kind of hard to turn down that money.'' &QL; 
Free at last
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco fans never could forgive quarterback Druckenmiller
for not being  &UR; Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers ignored Walsh's advice and passed on Plummer to draft
Druckenmiller in the first round out of Virginia Tech three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh has been wanting to get rid of him since returning to the
49ers last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller left a parting shot on his way to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill just does things sometimes just to hear himself talk,''
Druckenmiller said. &QL; 
Midas touch &QL; 
Lurie, the draftnik and Fantasy Football League fanatic, has been
so successful turning the Eagles from NFC East contenders to 3-13 a
year ago, he is about to expand his football horizons.
</P>
<P>
   He joins the Saints'  &UR; Tom Benson as NFL owners who also will be
running teams in the Arena League.
</P>
<P>
   Two more NFL owners,  &UR; Wayne Weaver of Jacksonville and  &UR; Al
Lerner of Cleveland, are trying to get into Arena Football. &QL; 
News of the weird &QL; 
With the retirement of All-Pro running back  &UR; Barry Sanders, the
Lions are expected to struggle to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Until they make the postseason again, they will continue to get
teased about having had more area codes (three) than home playoff
games (two) and playoff wins (one).
</P>
<P>
   Dog-eat-dog world &QL; 
Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback  &UR; Chad Scott, a third-year pro,
received some advice this week from veterans about playing in
Cleveland for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   They told him that with all the dog bones flying from the
stands, ``keep your helmet on'' while standing on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns-Steelers rivalry has always been one of the league's
best, which is why the NFL scheduled tonight's game in Cleveland
for the expansion team's debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't gonna lie,'' said Browns offensive tackle  &UR; Orlando
Brown, who came into the league with the Browns in 1993 before the
team moved to Baltimore. ``I hate Pittsburgh. I really hate
Pittsburgh. Anything yellow and brown, I hit it. That's how they
brought me up.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Atlanta Falcons offensive tackle  &UR; Ephraim Salaam, whose team plays
the Minnesota Vikings today in a rematch of last year's NFC title
game, thinks few still take the Falcons seriously. ``People still
don't believe we made it to the Super Bowl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, St. Louis Rams Coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil often referred to
today's opponent as the Colts instead of the Ravens. ``They'll
always be Colts to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos have won 24 consecutive games at Mile High
Stadium going into Monday night's game against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego Chargers linebacker  &UR; Junior Seau, on the team having a
bye the first week: ``I do think we have control over this. . . .
We've got to win more than five games, I guess, in order to have an
opening (week) game.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Northern Arizona quarterback  &UR; Jeff Lewis, who hoped to be
Carolina's opening-day starter, was demoted to third team after the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Said New England Patriots Coach  &UR; Pete Carroll, who's tired of
people telling him he seems more confident this season, ``You mean
there's no deer in the headlights here?'' &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; THE TOP FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Minnesota &QL; The Vikings are great until playoff time. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. Denver &QL; Can you say quarterback controversy? Coach Mike Shanahan
keeps denying one exists. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Green Bay &QL; General Manager Ron Wolf has given first-year Coach
Ray Rhodes a boatload of talent. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. New York Jets &QL; Anything short of a Super Bowl will be a
disappointing season for most Jets fans. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Atlanta &QL; NFC champion still has to prove it's for real. &QL; 
 &UR; THE BOTTOM FIVE &QL; 
 &QL; 
31. Chicago &QL; Quarterback Shane Matthews will not lead the Bears to
the promised land. &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Cleveland &QL; There isn't a running back here good enough to play
for the Rattlers. &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Philadelphia &QL; Veteran quarterback Doug Pederson could be booed
from his first misfired pass. &QL; 
28. Carolina &QL; Wasn't this franchise in the NFC title game a few
years ago?. &QL; 
27. Detroit &QL; Hope Barry Sanders is enjoying his extended vacation. &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buccaneers: They just missed the playoffs a year ago despite
shaky play at quarterback. So, again, QB Trent Dilfer's development
is the key. But nobody in the league has the Buccaneers' depth on
the defensive line. Their backs, Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott, are
a terrific combination. Receiver no longer is a weak spot. The
Buccaneers could finish third in the NFC Central and still be one
of the five best teams in the league. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cardinals: They've had an awful off-season and training camp,
which has been well-documented. Two holdouts still remain. Starting
wide receiver Rob Moore, who signed on Thursday, enters the season
having had only one practice. Quarterback Jake Plummer still has a
sore thumb. Defensive tackle Eric Swann remains on the sideline
recovering from knee surgery. If that's not bad enough, the
Cardinals play the second-toughest schedule in the NFC. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Coach Mike Ditka, on Heisman Trophy winner Ricky
Williams returning to practice from an ankle injury: ``He was into
a full limp. . . . What do you want me to say, `He looks like he
needs a wheelchair or something?' He looks fine. I bet you he's 99
percent, and at 99 percent, he's better than most guys at 100
percent.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
ODD-SHAPED BALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Talk about an offensive machine, the New York Giants haven't had
an NFL receiving leader since 1935.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a rushing leader since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't had a Pro Bowl receiver since 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense has ranked 28th, 29th, 30th, 27th and 29th the
past five seasons.  &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer's new cereal, Jake's Flakes,
should be available in Valley grocery stores by the end of this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Shane Matthews has beaten out first-round pick Cade
McNown for the Bears' starting quarterback job is he enters the
regular season with the league's highest preseason passing rating _
124.1.
</P>
<P>
   Lions running back Greg Hill, on replacing Barry Sanders: ``I
don't think there's any back in the league that could replace
Barry. You could bring back some of the great ones that are in the
Hall of Fame, and I don't think they could replace Barry. There may
be somebody who can take Barry Sanders' place. Does Barry Sanders
have a son?''
</P>
<P>
   Have times changed. Washington Redskins first-round pick Champ
Bailey, instead of singing the Georgia fight song during hazing at
training camp, delivered comedian Chris Rock's ``No Sex in the''
``Champagne Room''.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee center Bruce Matthews is scheduled to start his
league-high 181st consecutive game today against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving to St. Louis, the Rams have gotten worse each year.
They've gone 7-9, 6-10, 5-11 and 4-12. Could they go 3-13 this
year?

FREDRICKSON LETS ACTIONS SPEAK FOR HIM  
 HE'S DIFFERENT FROM MILLER, BUT EFFECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARiz. - Jamir Miller and Rob Fredrickson play the same
position, but any similarities end right there.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is an aggressive force against the run, while Fredrickson
brings more pass coverage to the equation. Miller rarely minces
words. Fredrickson prefers to be seen and not heard.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference? When the NFL kicks off its 1999 season
today, Miller will be helping the Cleveland Browns against
Pittsburgh, and Fredrickson will be in Philadelphia at Miller's
former left-linebacker post for the Cardinals against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   It's that difference that has fans wondering how much the
Cardinals have lost on the field, or in the locker room, in terms
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to compare individual players,'' Cardinals
Coach Vince Tobin said. ``They all have their different strengths
and weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis added, ``Any time you lose a
player off your team, you lose something. Every player is unique,
and you lose something unique to that player. But to say because a
guy is gone the whole thing collapses, is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue regards two highly competent players. Fredrickson has
started 67 of a possible 74 games in five seasons with Oakland and
Detroit, while Miller started 57 of 74 games in five years with the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fredrickson is a guy who has very good cover ability,''
McGinnis said. ``Jamir is bigger. He's a 6-foot-5, 260-pound
linebacker with long arms. He could even be out of position and
still make plays because of his reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamir could cover, but he doesn't cover as well as Rob. Rob
can play the run, but he's not as physical as Jamir.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their diametrically opposed strengths, it figures that
McGinnis has spent long hours adjusting his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to compensate,'' McGinnis said. ``We'll do the
same things. What you do is capitalize on the strengths of the guy
you have. It's not like Jamir was a terrible cover guy, and Rob is
a terrible run player. It's just that their strengths are on the
other sides of the spectrum. As far as quickness goes, they are
close. Rob is extremely quick.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-4, 240, Fredrickson isn't a shrinking violet. He played in
98 percent of Detroit's defensive plays last season before signing
a three-year, $7.9 million contract with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   He started all 16 games for the second straight season last year
and made 116 tackles, had 2{ quarterback sacks, defensed five
passes and had an interception and forced two fumbles. Miller,
playing the final 13 games with his hand in a cast to protect a
dislocated wrist, had 150 tackles, three sacks and defensed seven
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Slight edge to Miller. He was a leader, certainly. But he was a
leader who was a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's career in Phoenix was tumultuous. He came to the
Cardinals from UCLA with a reputation for being difficult to
handle. He was suspended for four games in his second season for a
substance abuse violation. To his credit, he noticeably changed his
lifestyle thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   When tackle Eric Swan went down last season with a knee injury,
it was Miller who picked up a large portion of the defensive load.
Yet it was Miller who publicly groused when quarterback Jake
Plummer was given a $29.7 million pact.
</P>
<P>
   It was Miller who angered coaches by demanding to be used more
as a pass rusher before the Cardinals playoff game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Miller who, after the season, demanded a multi-year
contract calling for $6.5 million a year _ quarterback-type
numbers. He turned down a two-year, $6 million offer from Arizona
to test his marketability, and finally settled for a one-year deal
for $1.3 million in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   He now vows to make every team in the NFL sorry for snubbing
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I was brought in to replace Jamir,'' Fredrickson
said. ``I just signed as a free agent. I don't feel any pressure
about filling his shoes. He's one type of player, and I have a lot
of respect for him. But he's gone. He's in Cleveland. You (media)
have to lay that to rest and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much have the defense down, and I don't feel like a
rookie around here. I feel like an established veteran, which I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he bring leadership to the equation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership doesn't always come from guys who talk a lot,''
McGinnis said. ``It comes from the way guys play or perform. The
real leaders are the guys in the locker room who are respected for
the way they work, the way they prepare, and how available they are
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that aspect of it, Rob Fredrickson is fine. But he's new.
That's the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredrickson, a high school honor student, was his senior class
president, which certainly shows leadership qualities. He also was
a three-time All-Big Ten linebacker at Michigan State, while
earning all-conference academic honors en route to a business
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can lead by example on and off the field,'' he said. ``We
need vocal leaders, and some people are good vocal leaders. Myself?
That has never been my deal. I've always worked hard and kept my
mouth shut.'' &QL;

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA - The Cardinals have shown that, if anything, they
need no help digging a hole. Crisis managers they are. Usually from
opening day on.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NFL should be flagged for piling on. The Cardinals are
opening on the road for the 12th straight season today. That's a
claim no other NFL team can make. And for the ninth time since
moving to Arizona, they play three of their first four on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder they struggle?
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly the league ships the Cardinals out early to protect
players and fans from the desert heat. Short of getting a new home
with a lid on it, there isn't much they can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a competitive disadvantage,'' said  &UR; Bill Bidwill, the
Cardinals owner. ``The heat is very difficult, and the sun is quite
difficult. We are the only team in the league that can't sell
50-yard line seats because of the sun on the east side (of Sun
Devil Stadium).''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Cardinals' schedule is particularly inequitable.
The league makes them go to Miami next week, where the heat and
humidity could be as unbearable as a September day in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but that game won't be played if there is a hurricane,''
Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL doesn't let the Cardinals play at home until Week 3, a
Monday night game with San Francisco. It then sends them to Dallas
in Week 4, where it could be hot and humid.
</P>
<P>
   The league lets Green Bay play at home in potential sub-zero
conditions in Week 17 where the Packers play _ you guessed it _ the
Cardinals, on Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Ferreira, senior director of broadcast planning and
scheduling for the NFL, acknowledges that the early games at Miami
and Dallas and the late one at Green Bay are quirks. The Dolphins
play at home only twice before Oct. 24, the Packers play at home
only twice after Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of other situations, Tampa Bay (three of
first five on the road) and Dallas (three of first five on the
road, including today at Washington), where we really try to avoid
playing September day games whenever possible,'' Ferreira said.
``In some places, like Miami, it becomes more complicated because
they are sharing a facility with a baseball team. With Green Bay,
for whatever reason players' and fans' resistance to extreme cold
isn't as severe as their resistence to extreme heat. They seem to
enjoy the cold-weather atmosphere surrounding the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things go into making the schedule to make it work
that sometimes a team gets what its fans perceive as the lesser end
of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals always get it. Let them play an opener at home
once in a while. Even Tampa Bay opens at home today. &QL; 
Late hits &QL; 
Rough week for the radio blow-hards, eh? With KGME and KMVP
arm-wrestling to be first to erroneously report the signing of
 &UR; Rob &UR; Moore, KFYI running with a false rumor that Bidwill had sold
the team, and syndicated blabbermouth  &UR; Jay Mariotti ripping the
Cardinals on their flagship station, KDUS, and then daring ``that
P.R. clown  &UR; Paul
 &UR; Jensen,'' the team's media relations director, to pressure the
station to take Mariotti off the air, is there any doubt why God
created FM?
</P>
<P>
   If  &UR; L.J. Shelton goes back into the draft, someone should do an
intervention. He was barely a first-rounder this year (21st
overall), he plays a position that doesn't quickly change games
(offensive line), he's from a small-time college program (Eastern
Michigan) and he's a big guy (6-6, 343) with potential to get
bigger in a bad way while sitting out a year. He would be a
third-round pick next year and lose millions.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm making the call on the kickers, I choose the other guy.
The Cardinals might well be showcasing  &UR; Chris Jacke.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cards don't win today, they are looking at 0-4 with the
New York Giants coming to town. They've lost four straight to the
Giants. &QL;

Texas strikes quickly, rolls past Rutgers 38-21
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Texas coach Mack Brown began preparation for the
Longhorns' first road trip of the season by admonishing his team to
forget everything about the previous week's 52-point win over
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   If the Longhorns followed his instructions, Saturday's first
half against Rutgers must have stirred feelings of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Texas got rolling early, tallying 21 first-quarter points for
the second straight game on its way to a 38-21 win over the Scarlet
Knights before a record sellout crowd of 41,511 at Rutgers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when you're up that much at halftime (28-6), the only
way you can lose the game is by turnovers, blocked kicks or your
defense not playing well,'' Brown said. ``Giving them a halftime
speech when you're leading big is easy. I've had to do it the other
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns (2-1) did not maintain the scoring pace throughout
the game as they did against the Cardinal, but the 21-3 lead at the
end of the first period was enough to spur them to the win. Rutgers
(0-2) would get no closer than 17 points the remainder of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Texas jumped on Stanford 21-7 after the first 15
minutes and went on to a 69-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first quarter, guys ran spectacular routes, caught the
ball real well, and we started mixing the run in,'' UT quarterback
Major Applewhite said. ``The first-half execution was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``(In the) second half, we kind of fell off a little bit, but it
wasn't so much that we put our team in jeopardy of losing the
ballgame. But we've got to be a four-quarter team, and I think we
played about 3{ today.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite was the offensive catalyst again, completing seven of
eight passes for 97 yards and two touchdowns in the first quarter.
For the game, Applewhite connected on 19 for 32 passes for 244
yards, his 13th consecutive 200-yard passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Split end Ryan Nunez had a career-best day for the Longhorns
with 104 yards on seven receptions.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive week, Texas brought some excitement to
the punting game, and as was the case against Stanford, the
Longhorns had the fun this time. Texas returned a blocked punt for
a touchdown and had another score set up when Rutgers punter
Charlie Titus mishandled a snap, putting Texas in business at the
Scarlet Knights' two-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot play head-to-head with Texas or any team of that
quality and have a punt blocked and have a muff,'' Rutgers coach
Terry Shea said. ``The breakdown was a product of two things. We
had a man shoot one of our gaps, and the snap got back there at a
very average pace. And Texas has too much speed not to take
advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first big play came just 62 seconds into the game. Terrell
Dillon broke free on the left side and blocked Titus' punt
following Rutgers' opening possession.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Jones scooped up the loose ball and raced 11 yards for
the score to give Texas the early lead.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dillon, who also blocked a punt against Stanford, was the
first man in on Titus after the fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty much my whole job _ running down the field on
special teams,'' Dillon said. ``I figure if I'm going to be out
there I need to give it my all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers answered that initial score with a field goal on its
next possession to close within 7-3, but Applewhite had not hit the
field yet.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore guided Texas into Scarlet Knights territory in his
first opportunity, but a sack forced Texas to punt. The next two
times the Longhorns had the ball, Applewhite found the end zone in
short order with touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   On first-and-10 from the Rutgers 28, Applewhite avoided a heavy
rush, stepped up through an attempted arm tackle and lofted a
perfect toss to a waiting Mike Jones, who had gotten behind
linebacker Jabari Moore in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Texas went 56 yards in three plays on its next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite found Ryan Nunez on a deep in route for a 23-yard
gain to the Rutgers 23.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite then hit Montrell Flowers on a virtually identical
pattern on the left side.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers danced by cornerback Tony Berry and made it into the end
zone with Moore draped around his feet. Kris Stockton's kick put
Texas ahead 21-3 with just more than a minute to play in the
period.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns got their struggling running game going to produce
their next score, and the timing could not have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite was in a head-to-head collision with a Rutgers
defender after completing a pass to Hodges Mitchell, who picked up
21 yards on the play. Applewhite was on the ground only a short
time after getting his bell rung.
</P>
<P>
   The running game took over, as it should have. Rutgers'
defensive line averages 260 pounds, while Texas' offensive line
(even without 367-pound Leonard Davis) averages 320 per man.
</P>
<P>
   Though Texas ended with only 141 yards on the ground, after
averaging just 117 in its first two games, the ground game appeared
to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Brown ripped off 15 yards and on the next play delivered
the biggest block on a Victor Ike 30-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Ike went around the right side and left freshman defensive back
Nate Colon looking dumfounded. Colon stood flat-footed without
getting a hand on Ike as he passed by on the way to his fifth
rushing touchdown of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting better every game,'' said Ike, who had 94 yards
on 17 carries. ``We're a young team with young backs, and we're
still trying to get it together.''

Baylor gift-wraps UNLV's 27-24 victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ Baylor thought last week's one-point loss was heartbreaking,
but few teams ever will suffer a more shocking defeat than befell
the Bears on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada-Las Vegas won the game on the final play with a 101-yard
touchdown return on a fumble recovery by cornerback Kevin Thomas to
give the Rebels a 27-24 victory at Floyd Casey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   With a first down at the UNLV eight-yard line, Baylor only
needed to run out the clock to win the game. Instead of quarterback
Jermaine Alfred taking a knee when the ball was snapped with eight
seconds to go, Alfred gave the ball to tailback Darrell Bush for a
handoff up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Bush broke a couple of tackles and reached the one as he fought
to cross the goal line, but UNLV linebacker Tyler Brickell stripped
the football and Thomas picked it up in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas took off around the left side and raced down the sideline
untouched for the winning TD with no time left on the clock in
front of a stunned crowd of 32,272 in the home opener for Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth consecutive loss for Baylor, dating to last
season, and ruined the home debut for new coach Kevin Steele.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hindsight is 20-20, and I know what the textbook says,''
Steele said. ``It was stupid on my part, and there is no defense
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to create an attitude of toughness, and we made
the decision to try to hammer it in. That was the intent. It was a
one-in-a-million thing for this to happen. But there's still no
justification for it. We played with fire and got burned. I take
full responsibility for it. It was a lesson learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele said his staff talked about having Alfred take a knee but
opted to run the ball forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered it strongly,'' Steele said. ``But we were trying
to create an attitude, and I never thought that could happen. I
have no answer for it. The arrows will come from 10 million
directions, and I will stand here and take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush rushed 24 times for 127 yards and one TD, all he
will remember is the horrific final play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That young man gave his heart and soul tonight,'' Steele said
of Bush. ``I made a bad judgment call. It was a sad, sad situation
for the entire team, but these players have a lot of character. I
just want to say, if there's any criticism, it comes at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' run officially was listed at 99 yards because Baylor's
statistics computer does not allow triple digits. But Thomas
clearly picked up the ball one yard deep in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV now finds itself a surprising 2-0 under new coach John
Robinson after going 0-11 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things looked out of control, but we learned a great lesson
tonight about hanging in there,'' Robinson said. ``I think everyone
still is shocked. It's just overwhelming. It was such a hard-fought
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Both starting receivers for the Rebels had a strong showing
Saturday. Len Ware had eight receptions for 83 yards, and Nate
Turner caught five passes for 85 yards and two touchdowns. UNLV
quarterback Jason Vaughan completed 17 of 27 throws for 192 yards,
two TDs and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game had four lead changes in the fourth quarter, but
Bush scored on a 10-yard run to give the Bears the lead at 24-21
with 6:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor defense held UNLV and forced the Rebels to punt
before the Bears' offense worked to run out the clock by driving
down the field.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that plan had worked until the seemingly impossible
happened and left Baylor 0-2 after losing on the last play of the
game for the second consecutive week. The Bears lost 30-29 at
Boston College last week when Kyle Atteberry missed an extra-point
attempt in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears led 10-7 at the half, but Baylor failed to score on
three chances inside the UNLV 25, including two inside the 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to put them away (in the first half),'' Steele
said. ``We have to learn how to put the nails in the coffin. When
we get that kind of momentum, we have to make it big.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bears wasted two other scoring opportunities in the first
quarter, including a fourth-and-goal situation when Baylor elected
to go for the touchdown. Elijah Burkins took an option pitch to the
left and was tackled inside the one by UNLV safety Quincy Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor defense forced the Rebels to punt from their end
zone, and the Bears took possession at the UNLV 31. Baylor had a
fourth-and-three at the UNLV 24 but elected to go for it rather
than punt because of strong headwind. Alfred's fourth-down pass
fell incomplete, and the Bears again came away empty in UNLV
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears drove to the UNLV nine on their final possession of
the first half, but Atteberry missed a 27-yard field-goal attempt
when his kick bounced off the left upright.

Younger Williams strikes first blow in budding rivalry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ The journey that began on the broken glass-strewn
playgrounds of Compton, Calif., ended Saturday inside the pristine
pay grounds of the National Tennis Center, on the floor of the big,
new stadium named for the late Arthur Ashe, the last person of her
race to claim one of tennis' major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Althea Gibson, Serena Williams' muse, opened doors for Ashe, who
in turn opened doors for Zina Garrison and Lori McNeil. The two
Houston women, latter-day trailblazers, had wonderful moments in
their careers, but they never accomplished what Williams, 17, did
at the expense of fellow teen-ager Martina Hingis, a former U.S.
Open champion and No. 1-ranked player.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one years after Gibson won her fifth and final major title
in what was then called the U.S. Nationals _ and 24 years after
Ashe's career-capping Wimbledon triumph _ the younger of the two
tennis-playing Williams siblings prevailed 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in a U.S.
Open final as heroic at the finish as it had been horrible at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, seeded seventh, prevailed despite 57 unforced errors to
Hingis' 24. Told she had that many, Williams said: ``Wow! Imagine
if I stop making so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she also hammered 36 winners, 29 more than Hingis
managed.
</P>
<P>
   An American is assured of claiming the men's title, too, with
Andre Agassi facing Todd Martin at 3 p.m. CDT today.
</P>
<P>
   The last time American-born participants claimed both U.S. Open
titles in the same fortnight was 1982, when Chris Evert and Jimmy
Connors did the honors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' win was worth $750,000, an unfathomable sum for the
little girl who took up tennis at her father Richard's behest in a
mean-streets neighborhood better known for violence than serves and
volleys. Still, Hingis' superior resume and higher ranking
notwithstanding, this Williams breakthrough was surprising only in
that Serena beat sister Venus, 15 months Serena's senior, to the
championship punch.
</P>
<P>
   But Venus, who lost to Hingis in the 1997 final, gets an
``assist'' for Serena's triumph, having forced Hingis to battle for
almost two draining hours in a rain-delayed three-set semifinal
that didn't conclude until after dark Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said yesterday,'' Hingis said, ``I've never beat both
(Williamses) in the same tournament. Serena was just better today,
after (what happened) yesterday. It was tough. I was always behind,
always having to be defensive. But I had chances. I just didn't
take them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Serena had played four consecutive three-set matches,
upending defending champion Lindsay Davenport in her semifinal,
only Hingis was fatigued at the outset. The top-seeded Swiss miss
found herself overpowered at every turn until Serena's nerves,
understandable considering the gravity of the occasion, opened a
window of opportunity after Hingis saved two championship points
against her serve in the ninth game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Both came on errors off Serena's huge, heavy backhand, the next
super shot in women's tennis. She made a whopping 14 backhand
errors during the last four games of the second set, but survived a
five-deuce struggle at the end to hold and force the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Serena was in her element there, having won each of the six she
has been in this year. Tied at 4, after a cross-court forehand had
floated long to cost her a mini-break, Serena bashed a forehand
return that landed inches inside the baseline to return the favor,
then served out the victory when a desperate Hingis lob sailed
beyond the baseline, followed by an errant defensive backhand.
</P>
<P>
   But Serena was of the opinion it never should have come down to
a tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought for sure I was going to hold my serve (in the 10th
game),'' she said, ``but something went dreadfully wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. Serena smacked three balls out and another into the
bottom of the net, losing at love. How would she stop the bleeding?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very upset with myself,'' Serena said. ``It was like,
`Serena, this can't happen. You have to think positive things.'
There comes a time when you just have to stop caving. In the end, I
told myself, `You're going to have to perform.'''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, like Venus, is bigger, stronger and faster than Hingis.
She dictated a vast majority of the points in the match, reducing
Hingis for the first set and a half to virtual spectator status.
But Hingis dragged herself off the ropes, earning verbal applause
from her vanquisher, never mind the occasional bad blood that has
existed between the two families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina is a great champion,'' Serena said. ``She's a real
fighter. She never gives up.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hingis' final shot landed long, Williams' knees appeared
to buckle and she screamed, ``Oh my God!'' Martina gave Serena a
gentle hug and two pats on the back after their handshake at the
net, then Serena headed to the players' box, where her parents and
Venus waited to embrace her.
</P>
<P>
   She kissed her mother, Oracene, and hugged her father while
Venus looked on with what seemed to be a wistful smile. But Serena
contends Venus won't be jealous and will profit from her
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything,'' she said, ``it's going to motivate her. Venus
was up there supporting me. After I lost my first two match points,
I looked over to not my mom or dad but to Venus. She was pumping me
up. It really helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   As little girls, Serena always wanted to win the U.S. Open,
whereas Venus had targeted Wimbledon. They'll get a chance today to
win the women's doubles title after beating Mary Pierce and Barbara
Schett 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when she wins Wimbledon,'' Serena said, ``she's going
to have the same feeling I had today. She has many, many more
opportunities, and so do I. We'll both be fighting for the next
Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt.

Jose proving his act belongs in The Show
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a clean, pure, hold-your-breath moment when everyone in
the ballpark knows the game will be decided by the next move.
</P>
<P>
   For Jose Lima and the Astros, the moment arrived in the eighth
inning Saturday, with the Astros leading 5-3, one out, one run in,
two runners on base, and Sammy Sosa waiting to bat for the Chicago
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lima was straining to pin down his 20th victory of an unexpected
season. Sosa was looking for his 60th home run of another historic
summer. More than 52,000 fans, the largest crowd of the Astrodome's
last year, were all but maxed out with tension of this perfect
setting.
</P>
<P>
   On the monitors in the press box, you could see Lima's lips
pursing in a fishlike motion. Then manager Larry Dierker popped out
of the dugout, and the words mouthed by Jose were unmistakable:
``No! No!''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker described himself as ambivalent even as he strolled to
the mound and waved in Jay Powell from the bullpen. He felt Lima's
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going for 20,'' he said, ``you'd like to get a
complete game. My heart is with the starting pitcher. He wants to
go on. You saw how late I went out. I had really mixed feelings. I
believe he probably could have gotten Sosa out. But Sammy has four
home runs off him in the last couple of seasons. If he hits one
here, it puts them ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima left the field, making it clear he did so under duress,
acknowledging the ovation by waving his cap so forcefully it seemed
more a gesture of despair than gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to face him,'' he said, of his fellow Dominican. ``I
wanted to do it (clinch his 20th win) in front of everybody. I'm
the kind of guy who wants to finish what he started.''
</P>
<P>
   The scripted ending Jose craved wasn't to be, but you couldn't
fault the results. Powell struck out Sosa, who tried to check his
swing on a pitch in the dirt _ and said later he thought he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked this place,'' said the honest, obliging slugger.
``I mean the Astrodome, not the city. I like Houston fine. But I've
never had any luck here. I'm so happy knowing that tomorrow is my
last game here. When I come back next year, no more Astrodome.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa, and a multitude of other frustrated batters, the Dome
walls seem to pulse, a haunting place, as if a product of the pen
of Edgar Allan Poe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no pitching staff has given Sosa more headaches than
the Astros'. He is 1-for-10 in this series and hitting .125 for the
season with one dinger, off Lima.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great,'' he said. ``All of them. Lima, Powell, (Billy)
Wagner, they all know how to pitch to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell extended the suspense in the eighth by walking the bases
full before Craig Biggio flagged a line drive to retire the side.
Wagner blew away the Cubs in order in the ninth and it was time,
Lima Time, to celebrate. The Astros have won nine in a row,
feasting on the dogs, as they should.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was left with 59, but he will do what not even Babe Ruth
achieved, becoming the first player to have back-to-back 60-homer
seasons. Mark McGwire will join him, but Sammy will have the
distinction of getting there first, with a team that vanished in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are the worst team in the National League, and that
might be too narrow a geographic distinction. They are ranked 15th
in hitting and pitching, and to make manager Jim Riggleman's task
even more depressing, his players are old and slow. They had three
straight singles to start the eighth, each advancing one base.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this can detract from the dimension of Lima's
achievement _ the first pitcher in the NL to win 20, the first
Astro to do so since Mike Scott in 1989. Lima predicted in spring
training he would achieve this magic number, and you look at his
history and salute him as a candidate for the psychic hotline. In
parts of three seasons with Detroit, his record was 8-16 and his
lowest ERA was 5.70. Pitching in middle relief for the Astros in
1997, he went 1-6.
</P>
<P>
   When injuries gave him a chance to start a year later, he
blossomed as a 16-game winner, and a candidate for a national
talent search. The Astros never have had a pitcher who could also
sing and dance, who has cut an album of merengue rhythms heard in
the Astros' clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Does he show his passion, emotion and energy? Is he volatile?
Yes. When he pleases himself, he does a dance step or two that seem
to be part conga and part the twist. If Lima lacks anything, it is
not confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 20 because I believe in myself,'' he said. ``People get
the wrong impression when they see me do my dance on the mound. I
do not disrespect this game. But I want to have fun and be the best
I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   He joined Scott, J.R. Richard, Joe Niekro and Dierker as the
Astros' only 20-game winners. Asked how he welcomed Jose to the
club, Dierker said, ``He didn't need to be welcomed. He ushered
himself in.''

Martin adapts, profits from experience
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Todd Martin calls himself a late bloomer. Saturday,
he also was a late boomer.
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered, conservative, gray-about-the-temples Martin,
who always looks as if he should be dressed in a business suit
instead of tennis shorts, is routinely decried for his lack of
``killer instinct,'' for his bloodless, aristocratic style in a
passionate, emotional sport. Martin is the anti-Ricky Martin, a
total stranger to la vida loca.
</P>
<P>
   But, against Cedric Pioline in the U.S. Open semifinals, the
seventh-seeded Martin turned into a thug, a brute and a bully. He
was a Spike or a Biff, most definitely not a Todd.
</P>
<P>
   He took off his tie. He loosened his shirt. He rubbed spit on
his hands. Then he played like a linebacker instead of the
stockbroker he resembles, or the schoolteacher he, no kidding,
might become after tennis.
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Dean Goldfine, concedes Martin needs to be more
``ruthless,'' but that was not a justifiable criticism of him
against the journeyman Frenchman, who might as well have had his
back up against the wall, a blindfold over his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pioline was out of here in 96 minutes, blown off his feet and
then off the grounds by a 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 score. He isn't sure what,
or who, hit him. All he knows is he was out cold before he had a
chance to raise a finger of protest.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of the mugging are Martin, 29, will play on the
final day of a Grand Slam tournament for only the second time.
Given that this is America's Open and he is an American playing a
fellow American in Andre Agassi, today becomes the biggest day of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on ``his.'' One of Martin's assets, as a human being
anyway, always has been his strong sense of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'll still put one foot in front of the other,'' he
said when asked what the championship would mean to him. ``I don't
think it matters a whole lot in the broad scheme of things.''
</P>
<P>
   So, can Martin win? Can he get past the re-focused,
re-energized, again top-ranked Agassi?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's able to play that way,'' Pioline said of the way
Martin performed against him, ``yes, I think he has a good
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin explains himself thusly in the current issue of Tennis
magazine: ``I think being normal is underrated. The idea that image
is everything (you know who's old slogan) goes against everything I
stand for. Substance is what counts _ not that as a player or a
person I'm always as substantial as I'd like. The truth is, I'm
constantly falling short of who I'd like to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people who know him, or his game, would dispute such a
self-effacing attitude, but it's a fact his nine mostly
undistinguished years on the ATP Tour have featured a pattern of
near misses and shortfalls, the best-remembered of which was his
humiliating meltdown of Novotna-ian proportions in the 1996
Wimbledon semifinal vs. MaliVai Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, leading 5-1 in the fifth set and serving for the match,
somehow lost it 10-8. The word ``choke'' barely does justice to the
dreadful particulars of the dreary afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin swears he profited from the painful experience,
saying: ``That match humbled me _ in a good sense. I learned that I
could deal with a terrible situation pretty well. I was surprised I
had the strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin gradually rebuilt his confidence. He changed his life
view. He stopped believing he had to play perfect tennis every time
out to win. By lowering his standards, he wound up raising his
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter had pulled out of
the Open with injuries _ both were in his half of the draw, too _
Martin had concluded he was ready to contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations and belief are two different things,'' he said.
``I believed it from the beginning; I just didn't expect it.''
</P>
<P>
   He suffered moments of self-doubt early in the tournament, then
found himself down two sets to love against Greg Rusedski in the
fourth round Tuesday night. That by-the-seat-of-his-britches
victory, accomplished despite a stomach virus and the midnight
hour, would prove to be the antithesis of his collapse against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If we believed the Wimbledon disaster defined Todd as a
competitor, felling Rusedski under such adverse circumstances
clearly re-defined him. And Martin threw us for another loop when
the match ended. Showing uncharacteristic spontaneity and emotion,
he tossed his racket into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he threw Pioline instead.
</P>
<P>
   Martin contends the ``Wimbledon thing'' has been out of his
system for a long time. Just the same, he says it was wonderful to
finish so strong, never lifting his foot off the accelerator
against Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased, more than anything else, with the way I
played the last two games,'' he said. ``I'm not taking a monkey off
my back, which I'm sure some people would write, but it was great
to be in the same situation and do something good with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite a decade ago, when Agassi was the boy phenom and had
achieved a top-three ranking, when Sampras, 19, was winning the
first of his 12 majors here, Martin was a Northwestern University
dropout eternally grateful for having received a wild-card spot in
the draw. The subsequent years have seen him overcome a range of
disabilities, from a weak ``heart'' to, in 1997, a shredded elbow.
In the last 10 months, he says he has played ``the best tennis of
my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, better late than never.

Lima delivers on his promise
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Before the start of last season, there were some serious whispers
about the Astros releasing Jose Lima, who had just endured one of
the ugliest outings in the history of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the voices in the background are muttering something
totally different. They sound something like: cha-ching, cha-ching,
cha-ching.
</P>
<P>
   Every starting pitcher dreams of winning 20 games in a season,
and in Lima's case, it was almost to the point of obsession. The
dream became a reality Saturday when he reached the milestone in
the Astros' 5-3 victory over the Chicago Cubs before 52,010, the
largest crowd at the Astrodome this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you it was going to be Lima time, and it's Lima time,
baby,'' he said. ``The reason I said that back in spring training
was that I believe in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's safe to say the Astros and the rest of baseball believe
in Lima, too. As an arbitration-eligible player after the season,
20 wins means Lima will be moving into a much higher tax bracket
next season.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's moving into some elite company among Astros
pitchers. That's a far cry from March 1998, when Lima was ripped by
the Kansas City Royals for nine earned runs in three innings in a
spring training disaster.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the 26-year-old righthander became the fifth
pitcher in franchise history to win 20 games in a season, and the
first since Mike Scott did it in 1989. Coincidentally, Scott will
throw out the ceremonial first pitch before today's series final
against the Cubs, who are in position to become the Astros' 11th
sweep victim of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros extended their season-best winning streak to nine
games and could tie a franchise record with a victory today.
</P>
<P>
   Locked in a tight National League Central Division race with
Cincinnati, the Astros have won 19 of their last 27 games and are
on pace to finish with 99 victories despite using the disabled list
16 times.
</P>
<P>
   Several other players have suffered non-disabling injuries,
including right fielder Derek Bell, who was a late scratch Saturday
because of pulled rib-cage muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still falling off, but we keep winning,'' said
shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, who has six hits in his last nine
at-bats. ``That just shows the character of this team. We've got a
lot of good players on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, but Saturday belonged to just one. After the final out
was recorded, Lima bolted from the dugout to retrieve the ball from
closer Billy Wagner, who tied Doug Jones' franchise record by
notching his 36th save.
</P>
<P>
   As the sixth-largest baseball crowd in Astrodome history rose
and applauded, Lima stood in front of the dugout and blew kisses to
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was for the fans,'' said Lima, who is one victory shy
of Joe Niekro's club record for wins in a season. ``The fans have
been so great to me. I'm just so thankful that I was traded from
Detroit to Houston (before the 1997 season). That changed my whole
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty wins has a way of putting a pitcher's career in a
different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker, along with Lima, Scott, Niekro
(twice) and J.R. Richard, is part of the select group of Astros
that knows what it takes to win 20 games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you win 20 games is by pitching consistently
month after month,'' Dierker said. ``You can't have a slump. Lima
has had a remarkable season, and he was outstanding today. He
doesn't need to be welcomed into it (the 20-win fraternity); he
ushered himself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima allowed three runs (two earned) and struck out seven
batters in 7 innings. Jay Powell bailed him out of a jam in the
eighth inning, including a huge strikeout against Sammy Sosa, and
Wagner pitched a perfect ninth inning to preserve the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to Jay Powell and Billy Wagner, it's a done
deal,'' said Lima, who offered some resistance to Dierker's
decision to remove him from the game. ``It's `game over.'''
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, the game was over when Cubs
manager Jim Riggleman presented his lineup card to the home-plate
umpire. The Cubs' lineup featured only three established major
leaguers _ Sosa, Mark Grace and Henry Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Lima before the game that the Cubs have a lot of young
guys and that you only really have to worry about Grace, Sammy and
Henry,'' said Astros catcher Tony Eusebio, who was 2-for-3 with a
homer and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guys were mostly a bunch of rookies, and if he
(Lima) got anything close, they would swing at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eusebio's RBI single gave the Astros a 1-0 lead in the second
inning, and the Astros led 3-0 after hits by Gutierrez and Ken
Caminiti drove home runs in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored an unearned run in the fourth when Grace raced
home on Rodriguez's fielder's-choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Euesbio's fourth homer _ a solo shot to right-center _ rebuilt
the Astros' three-run lead in the fourth inning, and the Astros
scored their final run on Ryan Thompson's RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The runs the Cubs scored without the benefit of an error came on
sacrifice flies by Jose Nieves in the seventh inning and Grace in
the eighth.

 FAA WRITES OFF $2.5 MILLION OF AMWEST FINE  
 By PETER CORBETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration in Washington waived a $2.5
million fine against America West Airlines in July despite
objections from the agency's Phoenix inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   America West, slapped with a $5 million fine last year over
safety and maintenance violations, had not fully complied with an
agreement to fix the problems, according to the FAA inspectors in
Phoenix who oversee the airline. The company was given a year to
improve maintenance on its fleet of 111 aircraft and add safety and
quality assurance staff.
</P>
<P>
   But FAA administrators in Washington, without explanation,
ignored the June recommendations of their own field inspectors, FAA
documents show. On July 14, they waived the remaining half of the
fine against America West.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic obtained copies of the FAA documents last
week after filing a Freedom of Information Act request.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's files show that Phoenix FAA inspectors sought a
six-month extension of the deadline and wanted to use the remaining
$2.5 million fine as leverage to force America West to resolve
remaining problems.
</P>
<P>
   America West paid $2.5 million of the fine in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix FAA office's final progress report, written by
supervi sor Ron Rosenhahn, said that Amer ica West flew aircraft as
late as this spring that it knew did not meet federal maintenance
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The June 23 report outlines a number of unresolved maintenance
problems and lays the blame on the company's top management, saying
safetycontinues to take a back seat to making money at the airline.
</P>
<P>
   The pervasive nature of the problems at America West ``is
centered on senior management's inability, unwillingness, or both,
to decisively and without market-based mitigation, change their
safety cul ture,'' Rosenhahn wrote.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokesman Ste phen Johnson counters that the
airline has the best safety record in the industry over the past 16
years and senior management is commit ted to maintaining that
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Tempe-based airline fully complied with the terms of the FAA
agreement and the company dis putes the findings of the Phoenix FAA
inspectors, said Johnson, America West corporate group man ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never operated an airplane that was unairworthy or one that
caused the remotest risk to the safety of any of our passengers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman in Washington, reiterated that
agency administrators determined that America West had complied
with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the questions were sub mitted by telephone by The
Arizona Republic, a written statement from the FAA in Washington
did not address the conflict with Phoenix FAA inspectors over
America West's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the advice of the local FAA inspectors isn't unusual
for the agency, but it is cause for concern, according to Mary
Schiavo, former inspector general of the U.S. De partment of
Transportation, which oversees the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   FAA administrators in Washing ton are cozy with airline manage
ment throughout the industry, said Schiavo, who wrote a 1997 book
critiquing airline safety titled Flying Blind, Flying Safe.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Inspector General's Office during
Schiavo's tenure in the early 1990s showed that the FAA typically
settles for about 10 cents on the dollar for the fines it levies
against airlines, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had considered a fine of $11 million to $15 million
against America West in 1998, but settled on $5 million to avoid a
protracted legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   Despite maintenance problems cited by the FAA, America West has
never had an airline crash or fatality after more than 6 million
flights since it was founded in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   And the nation's ninth-largest air carrier has made significant
im provements to its organization and improved safety and quality
con trols, Rosenhahn said in his report.
</P>
<P>
   America West has focused on improving its operations since set
tling protracted contract negotiations with mechanics in October
1998 and flight attendants in March. The company blamed some of its
main tenance problems on its labor trou ble. Profits, meanwhile,
hit $108.6 million on record revenue of more than $2 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn also praised the hiring of Gilbert Mook in April as
Amer ica West's chief operating officer. Mook's initial actions
indicate he may be effective in resolving Amer ica West's remaining
deficiencies, Rosenhahn said.
</P>
<P>
   America West says it has in creased its maintenance workforce by
more than 7 percent _ adding about 90 mechanics and 80 manag ers _
to respond to the safety issues raised in the July 1998 settlement
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Under that agreement, America West was fined $5 million, one of
the largest penalties in U.S. com mercial aviation history. The Tem
pe-based carrier paid half of that fine immediately. The remaining
$2.5 million was to be waived if America West complied.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to waive the second half of the fine angered local
inspectors who felt they were under cut by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 5 memo, Rosenhahn wrote that the decision by Washing
ton FAA officials eliminated the agency's leverage in forcing Amer
ica West's compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenhahn declined comment on the dispute when contacted Sept.
3.
</P>
<P>
   The July 1998 settlement agree ment was a compromise to settle
11 cases of aircraft maintenance and operation violations against
America West.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors had cited Amer ica West for operating 17 Airbus
A-320 aircraft on 40,961 flights while significant structural
inspec tions were overdue from August 1996 to November 1997. The
planes flew an additional 815 flights with out inspections after
the airline was notified of the problem, according to the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors also cited the carrier for unsecured webbing in the
cargo hold of airplanes and for flying a Boeing 757 that was
missing one of its elevator actuators, which control the plane's
tail flap for ascent and descent.
</P>
<P>
   Records also show that America West used masking tape rather
than a required part, called an index plate, to conduct tests on a
power control unit of a Boeing 757 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   FAA inspectors tallied 41,276 violations against America West in
which aircraft were not airworthy by federal standards, according
to FAA documents.
</P>
<P>
   To be deemed airworthy by federal standards, an air carrier must
main tain an aircraft according to rigid specifications spelled out
by the manufacturer, must have all required inspections and use
only approved parts and testing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's complex safety regula tions are intended to protect
the traveling public by requiring surgi cally precise maintenance
proce dures on aircraft and to spot flaws in safety oversight that
could lead to potentially fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic structural inspections of aircraft are required to try
to detect cracks in the fuselage, which can be deadly if a plane's
skin peels back in flight. That's what happened in 1988 when an
Aloha Airlines flight attendant was sucked out of hole in the torn
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Improperly installed cargo netting caused a 1987 fatal crash in
Miami when cargo shifted during takeoff and caused the plane's nose
to tilt upward. &QL; 
The settlement agreement required America West to set up strategic
action teams and develop action plans to address its maintenance
and safety problems. That included over sight of outsourced
maintenance, which has been a major point of contention since the
company laid off about 500 maintenance workers in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Other strategic action teams were formed to address such things
as deferred maintenance, the dispatch and flight-tracking systems,
training programs, flight-crew scheduling and proper maintenance
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   America West was also required to create an autonomous quality
assurance department and appoint a vice president of corporate
safety who operates independently of all other departments.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's final progress report in June identifies a number of
issues that still concern the Phoenix in spectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that 95 percent of the topics would have been
properly addressed if it were not for the priorities of (America
West) being shifted elsewhere,'' Rosenhahn said in his report.
</P>
<P>
   That report also documents other America West maintenance and
safety problems, including:
</P>
<P>
   Operation of 12 Boeing 737 aircraft in June even after America
West acknowledged that improperly installed bolts made the planes
non-airworthy by federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Operating an aircraft for four days in April without proper
avionics tests, even after an FAA inspector pointed out the
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix FAA's progress re port also says America West's
internal evaluation program has audited only four of the 20 areas
required by the settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And the report said problems remain with the company's quality
assurance oversight of Air Canada, America West's heavy maintenance
contractor in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Inspectors discovered that Air
Can ada had not properly tested avionics systems on an America West
air craft. Avionics are the electronic and computer components that
con trol aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   America West carried passengers on flights in the improperly
tested plane from April 23 to April 27 even after the company was
notified of the problem, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the FAA report discloses that America West operated a
Boeing 737 aircraft from April 6 to April 22 without proper
maintenance records relating to a wing flap transmission.
</P>
<P>
   America West told the FAA that it allowed the aircraft to remain
in service because no replacement part could be found, the FAA
said. &QL;

UH makes Alabama's Alexander look great
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ If the University of Houston discovered anything
in its 37-10 whipping at the hands of No. 21 Alabama on Saturday,
it was the simple fact defenders can't ground Crimson Tide tailback
Shaun Alexander with an arm tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the difference in the game today,'' said UH coach Kim
Helton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missed tackles killed us all game long,'' added Cougars
linebacker Wayne Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander compiled 167 yards rushing on 27 carries, scoring on
runs of 17 and eight yards after a 25-yard TD pass from quarterback
Andrew Zow. His 192 yards rushing and receiving compared favorably
to the Cougars' net output of 274. Alabama totaled 505 yards, split
tidily between running (275) and passing (230), while averaging 6.8
per play.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of early missed opportunities before a Legion Field
crowd of 81,110, the Cougars saw a competitive 17-10 game
degenerate when the Tide scored three TDs in just over six minutes
spanning the third and fourth quarters.
</P>
<P>
   UH drove 77 yards with the second-half kickoff, rallying within
seven points on Jason McKinley's 16-yard pass to Orlando Iglesias
when the 6-2 Iglesias outleaped 5-11 cornerback Reggie Myles near
the left boundary of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   That 17-10 margin proved to be the high point for the Cougars,
who were seeking their first win over a Top 25 team since defeating
Southern Mississippi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A 25-yard punt left the Tide just 40 yards to cover, and Zow
found wideout Freddie Milons uncovered for the final 19 yards after
the UH secondary blew its coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being in a two-deep, we were in a no-deep,'' said
Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's eight-yard run then gave the Tide a 30-10 lead,
concluding a series highlighted by Tim Bowens' diving 32-yard
reception.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore tight end Terry Jones, left uncovered for the second
time on a quick screen pass from Zow, ended the scoring on a
39-yard play with 10:28 remaining. A sack of McKinley followed by
Cornelius Griffin's 17-yard return of the resulting fumble gave
Alabama's defense reason to claim credit for that score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was good coming in,'' Helton said of Alexander,
``and we know he's good when we're leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Helton: ``Their players played well, their coaches coached
well, and their officials officiated well.''
</P>
<P>
   Without making any specific criticisms of the latter in the wake
of the 27-point loss, Helton also couldn't help but note, ``We get
to the one-foot line and get a clip called.''
</P>
<P>
   That second-quarter play eventually helped negate an 88-yard
drive by the Cougars that produced nothing when Clark missed a
39-yard field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's 80-yard drive with the opening kickoff finished with
what turned into Zow's 25-yard pass to Alexander coming out of the
backfield on third-and-17. Ryan Pflugner kicked a 26-yard field
goal for a 10-0 lead after the Tide drove 53 yards on its second
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ketric Sanford's 64-yard kickoff return to the Bama 31 preceded
a second-and-four for UH at the Tide 15, but the Cougars were
forced to settle for Clark's 32-yard field goal and a 10-3 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Iglesias, who caught six passes for 105 yards, had receptions of
39 and 26 yards in the next UH series, which reached the Alabama
six. Mike Green carried a quick pitch to the three (not the
one-foot line) before the clipping penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a big difference,'' Helton said of the penalty, one of
11 called on his team for a total of 92 yards (Alabama had nine for
92 yards). ``We got close in the second half, but penalties and
their athletic ability wore us down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Helton emphasized. ``Alabama's athletes and
coaching staff decided this game.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be obvious three plays after UH's aborted series.
Alabama, which often substituted two or three players before each
snap to get various offensive packages on the field, set up with
Jones set out to the left. Redshirt freshman Tyler Watts, who split
time with Zow, fired a quick screen pass to Jones, who broke two
tackles during a 41-yard gain to set up Alexander's 18-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great move at the half by their coaching staff,'' UH safety
Kenny Hill said of the quick screen. ``Alexander showed us his
ability to cut back, and we didn't take the right angles sometimes
in pursuit. So I give him `an all-out good game, Shaun.'''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley's critique: ``We need to make more plays when we get to
the other end of the field. We just didn't take advantage close to
the goal line.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley was 12-of-25 passing for 169 yards with no
interceptions before Tyson Helton played most of the fourth
quarter. Sanford (12 carries for 49 yards) and Leif Penn (five for
37) accounted for most of the Cougars' 103 net yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun Bohanon, Alexander's roommate, added 95 yards on 12
carries for the Tide.

NO LONGER GETTING BURNED  
 WIFE, BABY HELP CORNERBACK MATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Like those around him, who make a living putting
out fires, Kareem Clark lives his days to not get burned.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State senior has felt the heat of playing cornerback
in a Division I football program, where only your mistakes are
remembered. Yet just when his career was on the verge of getting
wiped out by a backdraft of hotshot recruits, it was Clark who
emerged as the starting cornerback when the smoke cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I finally realized that I have a family to take care
of and I can't be messing around off the field and on the field,''
he said. ``On the field, I have to take care of business. I think
I've grown up into a productive player.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark credits his recent marriage and the birth of his daughter,
April, now 5 months old, with providing direction in his life. It
has translated to success on the football field, where he turned
some heads in ASU's opener against Texas Tech and prompted Coach
Bruce Snyder to call him one of that game's ``best tacklers.''
</P>
<P>
   He also thwarted a Red Raiders drive in the first quarter by
intercepting a pass at the ASU 37. He hopes for a similar
performance when the Sun Devils play host to New Mexico State on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kareem has matured,'' cornerback Courtney Jackson
said. ``He has a family now, and he knows he has to take care of
business. He's played well, it's just that people always remember
the bad things about our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   He has come to define what Snyder envisions for his 1999 team: a
group of athletes who have put their lives, on and off the field,
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, whose brother and uncle are firefighters, knows a little
something about heat. Although he started three times last year, it
was more out of necessity than accomplishment. Injuries and a lack
of depth left the Sun Devils scrambling to find healthy
cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Although at 5 feet 10 and 186 pounds Clark is one of the team's
smallest corners, he is also one of its fastest players. Yet he
struggled to secure a full-time role, and for that, he blames
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the lack of knowing my position,'' he said. ``I
think I took some things for granted that I shouldn't have. I
wasn't studying hard enough, focusing on the right things at that
time. Now I'm practicing, studying the game more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been (hard). But my father always taught me to keep my
head focused and don't worry about it. He said, `Be ready when you
do get called.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was the forgotten man in the off-season. Any talk of
cornerbacks involved a couple of high-profile junior college
transfers, Nijrell Eason and Kenny Williams. Both have shown
promise, but as for most transfers from junior college, the
adjustment to Division I football takes time.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, two of last season's safeties, Christon Rance and
Courtney Palmore, moved to cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Clark, who, like most corners, was sometimes
remembered for things he didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me at all,'' he said. ``It's part of
playing DB. There are going to be games when somebody's going to
beat you deep. What matters is if you can bounce back and play
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is technique. You can be blessed with 4.2 speed,
but if you don't have technique, the guy's going to get open and
catches passes on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Improved technique and commitment have made Clark a better
player. He's also benefiting from an improved defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The front line is pressuring the quarterback a lot more, and
that's just making our job easier,'' Clark said. ``Last year, we
didn't have as much pressure, and the quarterback had all day to
throw the ball. That's really hard on us, when the wide receivers
can run over here, over there, across field.''
</P>
<P>
   Said defensive coordinator Phil Snow, ``You can see how much
better they are by how our corners are playing. The quarterback has
less time.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Clark during the football season. His days often start
at 5:15 a.m., because of morning practices, and don't end until
6:30 p.m. His wife, Amber, who is also an ASU student (and former
track athlete), carries much of the load during the fall, and he's
grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Early parenthood has derailed the careers of many athletes, but
Clark calls it a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really great,'' he said. ``My little daughter is
pushing me every day to perform, in the class and on the field.
It's the most exciting thing in the world. God has blessed me with
a beautiful daughter and a lovely wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his peers, Clark dreams of a future in professional
football, but if it doesn't happen, he may pursue a career as a
firefighter or probation officer. He'll have his degree in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he'll keep trying to hold off a group of talented
recruits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not to my fullest potential yet, but every game I'm
getting better and better and better,'' Clark said. ``That's my No.
1 objective: to improve every game and compete.''
</P>
<P>
   And to cool off some of the Pac-10's best receivers. &QL;

Michigan outmans Rice
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEAL FARMER &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ANN ARBOR, Mich. _ After suffering six turnovers last week against
Houston, the Rice offense cut that in half Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of being victimized by self-inflicted mistakes, Rice
was overmatched against a Michigan defense that did not allow the
Owls to cross midfield until 3:28 remained in the game. Rice was
limited to a field goal for the second time in two weeks, losing
37-3 to the sixth-ranked Wolverines before 110,501 at Michigan
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their superior talent was hard to overcome,'' Rice coach Ken
Hatfield said. ``They deserved to win. They were the better team,
and they proved it today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Owls (0-2) had 157 total yards, their fewest since gaining
119 yards in a 49-0 loss to BYU in 1996. Rice will play at the
University of Texas this weekend still looking for its first
touchdown, which is atypical for the Owls' triple-option attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts real bad (not to score a touchdown),'' said Rice
offensive tackle Aaron Sandoval. ``It's totally uncharacteristic of
this offense and these coaches and these players. That's first on
our mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield said it was hard for the offense to play consistently
because of Michigan's physical supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we called a play and Williams (Josh Williams, the
Wolverines' defensive lineman from Cypress Creek) whipped us at the
point of attack, then we are not going to get on that guy because
Williams is better than him,'' Hatfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, if he did what we asked to do and did the best he could,
then fine. But if he didn't do what he was coached to do, then we
didn't make improvement. While we may have made some improvement,
we didn't have as much success because of the strength of the
Michigan defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines' defense threw the Owls for losses on nine plays,
forcing the Rice defense to spend more time on the field than
normal. The defense gave a good accounting in the first half and
even stopped Michigan twice on fourth down in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the defense couldn't prevent the Big Ten powerhouse from
scoring when the Wolverines (2-0) obtained good field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense played great and gave us a chance to win,''
Sandoval said. ``One of the things the coaches stress is total team
blocking where all 11 guys perform their assignments on every play.
Until we get better on that, our offense won't be as good as it can
be. We are going to have to work on that this week if we are going
to beat Texas. I have total faith that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice's defense held Michigan off the scoreboard until 2:48
remained in the first quarter, when Jeff Del Verne kicked a 24-yard
field goal. After taking a 10-0 lead on a one-yard plunge by
quarterback Drew Henson early in the second quarter, the Wolverines
tacked on a 38-yard field goal by Del Verne six minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive crowd still was uneasy about the way the game
was going until Henson threw a 14-yard scoring strike to receiver
David Terrell with 1:34 left in the first half for a 20-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of third-quarter touchdowns by Anthony Thomas on runs of
11 and four yards produced a 34-0 Michigan lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines had only 132 of its 356 yards on the ground,
beating Rice through the air and on special teams. The Owls said
they were not going to let the Wolverines beat them with their
running backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan prides itself on running the ball, and I thought we
did a heck of a job creating traffic in the backfield,'' Hatfield
said. ``We stopped them twice on fourth-and-one, and that was good.
I've been pleased with our defensive effort the last couple of
games.''
</P>
<P>
   But the offense was a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we were just swamped,'' Hatfield said. ``We were
trying to find out the whole game where their weak one was on
defense, and we'd kind of run at him and pick on him. We ain't
found him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither have the Rice defensive linemen or linebackers found the
Michigan quarterback. Tom Brady, Drew Henson and even third-teamer
Jason Kapsner were able to stand like statues in the Wolverines'
backfield and pick out receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The overall superiority did not go unnoticed by Michigan coach
Lloyd Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we did a tremendous job against the triple
option,'' Carr said. ``I thought we played hard, although there
wasn't a lot of emotion. The real season starts now. We have a
tremendous schedule ahead of us. We must be ready to play and
minimize our mistakes in order to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice quarterback Chad Richardson said he knows the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any stupid plays, any blatant mistakes, which
is good,'' Richardson said. ``We are going to try and take the
positives out of this. We're going to bounce back. There is no way
this can make you worse. They are good and the best you are going
to see. We'll move forward from here.''

RESERVIST GAY LAWMAKER TRAINS, WAITS WORD FROM ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA TRUJILLO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Whether Arizona lawmaker Steve May should be kicked
out of the Army Reserve has been a discussion across the country,
with debates on Larry King and morning TV and radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   Strangers talk about whether his openness about his
homosexuality should end his military career, and a special Army
investigator is looking into it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, dressed in his camouflage work uniform and
combat boots, May stood in the shade of a canopy and taught
military strategies to other reservists. For May and the other 120
reservists, it was business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   And the routine of the day was good, the reservists seemed to
agree, after May was forced into the public view this summer when
Army officials began to investigate him because of reports in the
media in which the state legislator acknowledged he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The attention continued when May hosted a press conference in
New York last month, calling for an end to the military's ``don't
ask, don't tell'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   May, 27, says he didn't start the issue and worries that the
attention could affect his fellow reservists. ``They've been pulled
into this great national debate on this `don't ask, don't tell'
policy and they didn't ask to be part of it,'' he said. ``We're
doing our best to not allow it to become a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, at a huge parking lot outside Phoenix Municipal
Stadium, the men and women in May's 348th Transportation Company
seemed to ignore the issue altogether. Few mentioned it other than
to tease May about the camera crews following what they saw as a
routine training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most soldiers are professional. They are concerned about
competence, my performance as a leader,'' May said, taking a break
from serving his company hamburgers at lunch. ``They may not like
me . . . or appreciate or understand my sexual orientation, but
they understand that I have a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A few paused to pat May on the back and say, ``Keep it up,'' or
``We appreciate the courage,'' but for the most part the soldiers
remained silent, choosing not to say anything to the media to
indicate whether or not it's a non-issue for most of them.
</P>
<P>
   May said he doesn't discuss his sexual orientation with his
fellow reservists. ``I guess we have a `don't ask, don't tell'
policy on the weekend drill,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   May's case differs from other cases in the military. His
homosexuality became an issue after his dual careers as state
legislator and military reservist collided when he opposed an
anti-gay rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   Army Reserve officials began investigating May this summer after
learning of statements he made to the media during the 1999
legislative session when he indicated he was gay. At the time he
made the statements, May was not an active reservist.
</P>
<P>
   May initially joined the Navy through an ROTC program and in
college transferred to the Army ROTC program. After graduating from
college, he went into the Army.
</P>
<P>
   He was called back to active duty in February, after the
statements had been reported in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, once you're out of the closet, you can't go back in,''
May said. ``So this is really out of my control. But as a good
soldier, I'll do my duty. I will do my job to the best of my
ability. I'll come down here every month and put on my uniform and
train with the troops. That's all I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   May says he clearly made public statements about his sexual
orientation. ``The big issue for the Army is did I violate the
`don't ask, don't tell.' And what do they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army's policy says the military shouldn't go out of its way
to find out if a service member is homosexual and that the service
member shouldn't be open about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether May's statments, made while he was not on
active reserve, violated the policy.
</P>
<P>
   An Army Reserve investigator interviewed May last month. May
said he may hear from the investigator as soon as today about how
the case is proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, the military discharged 1,145 homosexuals in
1998, up from 997 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conflict has been created because I chose to serve
my country in uniform. I chose to serve my community in the
Legislature and I chose to live my life with integrity,'' May said.
</P>

<P>
   Wal-Mart's plans to build at least 16 huge supercenter stores in
Arizona have transformed the state into the latest battleground in
the retailer's effort to barge into the nation's grocery business.
</P>
<P>
   One supercenter has opened in Show Low in eastern Arizona. Mesa,
Payson, Scottsdale and Surprise are scheduled to get the ``big
box'' stores this year or next.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's move into Arizona is part of a larger push to build
supercenters in Utah, Idaho, Nevada and New Mexico. The company
plans to build 150 of the giant stores this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are controversial in part because of their size: They
are 200,000 square feet or larger _ about twice the size of a
typical Wal-Mart and four times the size of a large supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   The stores are different in another important way, too: They
combine a supermarket and all other Wal-Mart merchandise in one
giant store.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Wal-Mart has staked its future on the supercenter.
By the end of the 1980s, the company had loaded the country with
Wal-Mart stores and needed a new way to keep growing, said Sally
Wallick, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave them a tremendous amount of growth potential,'' she
said of Wal-Mart's entry to the grocery business. ``That's what
they were looking for and what they needed.''
</P>
<P>
   But city governments, neighborhood groups and grocery-union
members in Arizona are throwing blockades in front of Wal-Mart's
plans. They're fighting the supercenters, and killing off some of
them, in guerrilla skirmishes around the country and around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are catching on to what this is and understanding the
impact,'' grocery union spokesman Jim McLaughlin said. ``It's not
just a union issue. It's a community issue. Every city in Arizona
needs to make themselves aware of the impact these stores will
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, opponents were successful in stopping a Wal-Mart
Supercenter from being built in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The Mesa City Council is squabbling over a location for a
supercenter there. A Gilbert store is on hold after neighbors
protested, and one in Coolidge was delayed until a dispute over the
store's location, an important archaeological site, is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson is sorting through several proposals for controlling
big-box stores after Councilman Steve Leal proposed what he called
a ``hypothetical'' ban on such stores bigger than 100,000 square
feet. Leal said he offered the 100,000-square-foot figure to the
city staff as a way to open discussions on ways to control the
spread of big stores in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, is winning more
battles than it's losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to count Wal-Mart out. They're very tough,''
analyst Wallick said. ``They'll have done their homework about the
market. They have the staying power to tough it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the sort of company that will turn tail and leave
because `Gee, we didn't expect this. What a shock.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A supercenter was approved by Yuma voters Tuesday. Wal-Mart
prevailed in a similar vote last year in Payson, and that store
also is under construction and scheduled to open early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Show Low Supercenter opened in April after a legal fight
with a grocery union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local
99R.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart has encountered opposition in other states, but the
company says that the backlash in Arizona has been stronger than
most. The company is not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart redefined the notion of the big-box store _ bare-bones
stores that stock a lot of merchandise and sell at low prices _
when it opened its first supercenter in Missouri in 1988. Stores
that were big got bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The supercenter strategy is a familiar one in grocery selling:
convenience. The idea is to cram a store with a variety of services
and low-priced items to persuade time-poor shoppers to buy
everything in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nature of the American consumer has changed immensely,''
Wal-Mart spokeswoman Daphne Davis said. ``People are pressed for
time. They want convenience. I really think people of all income
levels expect value.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fight for public opinion, Wal-Mart is hammering the
themes of price and competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly think there is plenty of room for our grocery
business,'' Davis said. ``We think it will add a level of
competition to that market. While there is competition, you're
still paying higher prices in Phoenix than in other markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But comparing prices at grocery chains can be difficult. Walt
Heller, director of research at ``Progressive Grocer,'' a trade
magazine based in New York, said there have been no authoritative
studies of grocery prices recently.
</P>
<P>
   He said that's mainly because stores stock thousands of items
whose prices change constantly. Compiling comparative data would be
very difficult, Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a massive undertaking,'' he said. ``It changes weekly.
It's like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall or getting cats to
march.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, though, said Wal-Mart's fixation on cutting prices
generally affects its competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do, just by general knowledge, drive prices down in a
market,'' he said. ``Of course, they ultimately drive all the
little guys out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is following its usual game plan for growth as it moves
into the West _ build an immense distribution center and ring it
with stores. The company is expanding its Buckeye distribution
center, which ships general merchandise, and has opened another one
in Las Lunas, N.M., to handle grocery deliveries to supercenters in
Arizona and nearby states.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's high-tech supply system is the backbone of its
business. The highly automated ``just in time'' delivery network is
designed to keep excess merchandise from piling up in the
warehouses, letting the company minimize costs by buying goods only
when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart won't specify what a new store or distribution center
costs other than to say, ``Millions.'' It's planning $4.9 billion
in new stores this year, financed mainly by cash generated by its
stores, according to the company's 1999 annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Other supermarket companies are bulking up to take on Wal-Mart's
challenge. Two players in the Valley supermarket scene _ Kroger Co.
and Albertson's Inc. _ recently wrapped up mergers that vastly
enlarged their national reach. Kroger, which owns Fry's and Fred
Meyer, is the biggest grocery chain in Arizona and the country.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the motive for expansion is cost-cutting. Bigger
companies consolidate operations and buy larger amounts of
merchandise, putting them in a position to demand better deals from
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   They need those deals because profit margins in supermarkets are
notoriously low. But Wallick said that doesn't scare Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   The company is famous for pinching pennies, she said, buying and
distributing large amounts of goods and getting them to stores
cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from learning the ropes of handling perishables like milk
and vegetables, Wal-Mart already was used to the pressures of a
low-cost, price-conscious operating style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the low margins worried them because I think
they thought they could get the volumes they needed to make a lot
of money,'' Wallick said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, some supercenters are expansions of regular Wal-Marts.
That lets the company squeeze more from existing assets.
</P>
<P>
   The company rang up sales of $1 billion in 1980. The figure
leaped to $26 billion in 1989 and $137.6 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Stone, an Iowa State University economics professor and
frequent Wal-Mart critic, expects Wal-Mart to soon become the
largest grocer in the United States. He said the company has made
mistakes but didn't become the top retailer in the world by being
dumb. &QL;

BRUINS ARE OVERMATCHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo uses motivational tricks
as judiciously as trick plays. He tried both this weekend, with an
inspirational team meeting Friday and some well-timed shenanigans
Saturday night that generated the bulk of UCLA's offense.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were not ready for this, at least not as they are
currently composed _ with no proven quarterback and 11 suspended
players. In much of the critical third quarter, for instance, their
defense consisted of one junior, six sophomores and four freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   No, they were not ready for the crowd and the pressure and the
intensity. And most of all, they were not ready for Ohio State,
which used three second-quarter touchdowns to take control of what
became a 42-20 Buckeyes victory Saturday night before 93,283 fans
at Ohio Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team played hard, but our youth showed up,'' Toledo said.
``We didn't execute a lot of things, and our field position was not
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started well and ended poorly for the Bruins. Then
again, so did the Hurricane Bowl and the Rose Bowl. No doubt,
UCLA's defense performed better than it did against Miami or
Wisconsin. But there was no high-octane offense in support. The
running game sputtered and the quarterbacks, Drew Bennett and Cory
Paus, were unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the game was remarkably similar to Toledo's debut four
years ago this week _ a 35-20 loss at Tennessee. Then as now, the
overmatched Bruins played with spirit but lacked the experience,
depth and talent to match their opponent quarter for quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, their 10-0 lead disappeared when the Buckeyes steamed
for 177 yards and 21 points in the second quarter. A UCLA touchdown
early in the third simply prolonged the inevitable, as Ohio State
quickly regained command.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, turnovers, penalties and missed assignments _ all
traits of a young team _ made UCLA's challenge virtually
insurmountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say fatigue makes cowards of us all, and we got away from
using our techniques and fundamentals,'' defensive tackle Pete
Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins scored first on a bizarre play reminiscent of
Nebraska's miracle touchdown several seasons ago against Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's fourth play, Bennett threw left to Freddie
Mitchell, who was surrounded by three Buckeyes. The ball went
through the hands of safety Percy King, then bounced off Courtland
Bullard and Ahmed Plummer, and finally landed on Mitchell's back.
</P>
<P>
   It rested there for a split second before fullback Matt Stanley
snatched it off Mitchell's shoulder pad and raced 55 yards past the
stunned Buckeyes for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how long it took for us to practice that play?''
Toledo quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took a 10-0 on their most impressive drive of the
game. They ran the option, threw to the tight ends on third down
and used Stanley successfully on fourth. Their first trick play
came when Bennett handed to Mitchell on a reverse right, then
Mitchell threw back to Bennett on the left side. Bennett raced 18
yards to set up Chris Griffith's 35-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage vanished in minutes as quarterback Austin Moherman
moved the Buckeyes 81 yards for their first touchdown, a short run
by Michael Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes switched quarterbacks on the ensuing series, but
Steve Bellisari was as good as Moherman _ if not better. On third
down at UCLA's 46, he lofted a well-placed pass to receiver Reggie
Germany over cornerback Jason Bell. The 39-yard completion set up
Bellisari's two-yard scoring pass to Ken-Yon Rambo, and the
Buckeyes had a 14-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It expanded to 21-10 a few minutes later on Wiley's five-yard
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question us not having our full team had an
effect,'' Toledo said. ``Our guys were worn down, and our youth
showed up in a lot of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins emerged from halftime with the same energy they
started the game. The defense held, and the offense, behind
Bennett, moved the ball. Several option runs set up the second
trick play: an option reverse to Mitchell, who scampered 33 yards
to Ohio State's 7. On the next play, Foster ran left into the end
zone, and the Bruins were within 21-17. They would get no closer.

PIAZZA HELPS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Juan Castro was activated Tuesday and had seen
half an inning of action. Alex Cora came to the Dodgers the same
day and started once. The Dodgers' September callups haven't
exactly been overwhelmed with playing time, particularly because
the Mets are in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably play some more of the callups on Monday (against
Montreal),'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``But because (the
Mets) are in a fight for a wild card, I'll put my best foot
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the way the Dodgers have walked this season, it
means they'll most likely trip and fall anyway, which is what they
did in a 6-2 loss to the Mets on Saturday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza hit his second two-run homer
of the series and went 4 for 4. The four hits tied a career-high,
the 18th time he's managed the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ismael Valdes, the tough-luck loser this season in
dropping a plethora of one-run decisions, had no one to blame but
himself for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an atrocious three-inning, six-run stint against
Florida, Valdes lacked control and command in allowing six runs in
five-plus innings against the Mets. Not only did Valdes yield eight
hits, he walked five and threw 105 pitches in a shining example of
how not to be efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Until the start against the Marlins, Valdes hadn't allowed six
earned runs this season. Now, he's allowed six earned runs in each
of his last two starts, during which he has a 13.50 ERA and has
seen his ERA rise from 3.27 to 3.69.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (9-14) leads the Dodgers in losses. He's lost three
straight, and six of his last seven decisions. The Dodgers lost for
the 10th time in the last 11 games Valdes started.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's 35th homer of the season gave the Mets a 2-0 lead in
the third, but the Dodgers tied it with Eric Young's third-inning
ground out and Todd Hundley's fourth-inning homer. It was Hundley's
22nd homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who entered the day four games behind Atlanta in the
NL East but 2{ games ahead of Cincinnati in the wild card race,
chased Valdes when the first five batters of the sixth inning
reached base. It began with Piazza's single to left, Robin Ventura
walked and Shawon Dunston singled to right to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Roger Cedeno stroked a two-run single to left to
give the Mets a 4-2 lead and Rey Ordonez followed with a two-run
single to center to make it 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets leave town after tonight's game and Montreal comes to
town for three games. That should give Johnson the opportunity to
look at Castro and Cora, though both have major league experience.
</P>
<P>
   The slick-fielding Castro hit .188 in parts of the past four
seasons, and hit .274 with Triple-A Albuquerque this season. But
Cora is the more intriguing of the two, partly because he missed
much of spring training with a broken right hand. Cora hit .121 in
29 games with the Dodgers last season, but increased his stock by
hitting .310 with Albuquerque this year.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The hockey season won't end for nine months, so it's
probably unwise to put too much stock in the events of the opening
game of the exhibition schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, against a Phoenix Coyotes lineup missing all its
stars Saturday night, the Kings provided a few flashes of what
could be in store during the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings held a 3-0 lead through two periods of their preseason
opener, played before a crowd of about 6,000 at the MGM Grand
Garden Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Finnish defenseman Aki Berg _ back from a one-year exile due to
a contract dispute _ made an instant impact, with a couple of
crunching checks and a goal 21 seconds into the game with a shot
from the slot off the rebound of another Finn, winger Marko
Tuomainen.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Johnson (shorthanded) and Dan Bylsma were the Kings'
second-period goal scorers. Goalie Stephane Fiset made 13 saves
through 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Among other interesting occurrences in the game were Coach Andy
Murray's use of Ziggy Palffy with the Kings two men short in the
first period, a series of fights interspersed throughout the game
and Palffy's first-period breakaway, stopped by Phoenix goalie Bob
Essensa.
</P>
<P>
   Role model: One player not in the lineup for the Kings was
36-year-old defenseman Garry Galley. Murray said this week that
Galley has been the best defenseman in the Kings' training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us before we came that there would be no nonsense in
camp,'' Galley said. ``I came ready to go. I've been happy with the
day-to-day progress. I'm trying to work hard. I figure if the
oldest guy works as hard as he can, everyone will see that and
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray said, ``It's exciting to see a veteran buy into things
like he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Galley has plenty of motivation this season. He's entering the
last year of his contract, and he's coming off a disappointing
season in which he was in and out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a frustrating year for me,'' Galley said. ``The great
thing about this game is coming back, and if you're ready to stand
up for yourself, you're all right. I feel I can contribute, and I
want to leave the impression I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop sign: Kings general manager Dave Taylor reported no
progress in contract negotiations with defenseman Mattias Norstrom
or in efforts to secure a work visa for Finnish defenseman Jere
Karalahti.
</P>
<P>
   Betting line: The Detroit Red Wings are 4-1 favorites to win the
Stanley Cup in the latest odds posted by the MGM Grand sports book.
The Kings are listed at 60-1, and the Mighty Ducks are listed at
30-1. Other Cup favorites are Buffalo (5-1), Colorado (6-1) and
Dallas and Philadelphia (both 7-1). The expansion Atlanta Thrashers
are listed at 300-1.

REVOLUTION SHOWED UP IN SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ The drama of a playoff berth showdown
between the Revolution and Miami Fusion deteriorated into a
farcical scene Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. The Fusion earned a point after the
match finished 1-1 in regulation time, but only after a bizarre
scene in the shootout, during which Revolution striker Joe-Max
Moore ended up playing goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Both goals were scored within 74 seconds of the first half, the
first by Welton in the 30th minute before the Revolution's Giovanni
Savarese tied the score by crashing a header off the underside of
the bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the shootout, the Revolution's fate was sealed when
goalkeeper Jeff Causey was ejected by referee Ricardo Valenzuela
for taking down Welton. Moore then slipped a green jersey over his
No. 9 Revolution shirt, and went into the goal. He was unable to
touch Welton's penalty kick or the next two Fusion shots, and Miami
took a 1-point advantage over the Revolution in the Eastern
Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we were robbed a little bit,'' Revolution captain
Mike Burns said. ``The score was 1-1 and that was not an unfair
result. Both teams were trying to get a point and jockeying for
playoff position. If we had lost the point a little differently, it
would be easier to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel like the ref handed them a point. He could have
given the penalty but not the red card. This was a big game and for
the referee to decide it is frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Causey entered the match in the 45th minute of a 49-minute
second half, replacing player-coach Walter Zenga. The Revolution
nearly broke the tie as Savarese headed in the rebound of a Moore
shot, but was ruled to be offside on Moore's shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution then converted the first two shootout attempts
before Welton and Causey collided. Saul Martinez and Brian Kamler
scored the next two Miami attempts and Garth Lagerway saved two
Revolution shots before Paulo Dos Santos missed wide.
</P>
<P>
   Causey now could be suspended for the Revolution's next game,
against Columbus Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela was not originally scheduled to referee the game, but
MLS officials replaced Rich Grady, whose last visit to Lockhart
Stadium resulted in four ejections. Valenzuela seemed to keep the
match under control, though there were several controversial plays.
But the situation deteriorated in the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Many questions were raised by Valenzuela's decision, since there
are no FIFA rules to cover the shootout, and since the shootout
takes place after regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The game was chaotic during regulation time. Leonel Alvarez,
returning to the Revolution lineup for the first time in three
games, added poise to the midfield and helped limit Fusion
opportunities. Then, substitutes Dos Santos and Johnny Torres
sparked the team in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had excellent opportunities to break the tie. Welton
slammed a left-footed shot off the bar after outmaneuvering Brian
Dunseth in the final minute of the first half. Nelson Vargas had
two opportunities, stopped by Zenga and Alvarez. Then, Edwin Gorter
and Henry Gutierrez set up Martinez before Dos Santos recovered in
the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Moore failed to convert after finding himself free in the
penalty area twice in the second half, then had a point-blank drive
blocked by Lagerway in the 37th minute. Savarese's follow was
nullified for offside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this would be a tense game,'' Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan said. ``I called the league just to make
sure they realized the importance of the game, the intensity of the
game. It should have been treated like a Cup final, and I just
wanted to make sure the referee would understand this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not concerned that we lost in the shootout, but only that
everything deteriorated into farce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Revolution players were reluctant to talk about the match and
the lockerroom was closed to reporters. ``I am not going to say
anything until Tuesday,'' Zenga said. ``It's better for everyone
that I remain quiet. I've been fined enough already this year.''

UCLA IS OVERMATCHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ UCLA coach Bob Toledo uses motivational tricks
as judiciously as trick plays. He tried both this weekend, with an
inspirational team meeting Friday and some well-timed shenanigans
Saturday night that made for an entertaining and competitive first
half.
</P>
<P>
   But reality eventually emerged and it wasn't kind to the Bruins.
They simply were not ready for this, at least not as they are
currently composed _ with no proven quarterback and 11 suspended
players. In much of the critical third quarter, for instance, their
defense consisted of one junior, six sophomores and four freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   They were not ready for the crowd and the pressure and the
intensity. And most of all, they were not ready for Ohio State,
which used three second-quarter touchdowns to take control of what
became a 42-20 Buckeyes victory before 93,283 fans at Ohio Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team played hard, but our youth showed up,'' Toledo said.
``We didn't execute a lot of things and our field position was not
very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question not having our full team had an effect.
Our guys were worn down and our youth showed up in a lot of
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The game started well and ended poorly for the No.14 Bruins
(1-1). Then again, so did the Hurricane Bowl and the Rose Bowl. No
doubt, UCLA's defense performed better than it did against Miami or
Wisconsin. But there was no high-octane offense in support. The
running game sputtered and the quarterbacks, Drew Bennett and Cory
Paus, were unimpressive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the game was remarkably similar to Toledo's debut four
years ago this week _ a 35-20 loss at Tennessee. Then, as now, the
Bruins played with spirit but lacked the experience, depth and
talent to match their opponent quarter after quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, they jumped to a 10-0 lead, then watched it disappear
as the Buckeyes rolled for 177 yards and 21 points in the second
quarter. UCLA's touchdown early in the third simply prolonged the
inevitable, as Ohio State quickly regained command.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, turnovers, penalties and missed assignments _ all
traits of a young team _ made UCLA's challenge almost
insurmountable. So did an inconsistent running game. Tailback
DeShaun Foster gained just 51 yards and the Bruins averaged a
meager 3.1 yards per rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just aren't clicking,'' right tackle Brian Polak said.
``I thought we were doing all right, but something kept screwing us
up. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems on the line are no different from the problems at
quarterback or the problems on defense. The Bruins started 13
freshmen and sophomores, and just six of the 44 players on the
two-deep were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we had a lot of guys missing,'' defensive captain Pete
Holland said. ``But we weren't thinking about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have asked for a better opportunity _ to play a
great team like Ohio State on national TV. It was a chance to test
ourselves against a good opponent. It's very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   The game's fourth play was the strangest. It began with Bennett
throwing to Freddie Mitchell, who was surrounded by three Buckeyes.
The ball went through the hands of safety Percy King, then bounced
off Courtland Bullard and Ahmed Plummer, and finally landed on
Mitchell's back.
</P>
<P>
   It rested there for a split second, then fullback Matt Stanley
snatched it off Mitchell's shoulder pad and raced 55 yards past the
stunned Buckeyes for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how long it took for us to practice that play?''
Toledo quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took a 10-0 lead on their most impressive drive of
the game. The key play was a trick: Bennett handed to Mitchell on a
reverse right, then Mitchell threw back to Bennett on the left
side. He ran 18 yards to set up Chris Griffith's 35-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage vanished in minutes as quarterback Austin Moherman
moved the Buckeyes 81 yards for their first touchdown. Ohio State
switched quarterbacks on the ensuing series, but Steve Bellisari
was as good as Moherman _ if not better _ and directed the Buckeyes
to two touchdowns and a 21-10 lead before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins emerged from the locker room with renewed energy. The
defense held and the offense moved the ball. Several option runs
set up the second trick play: an option reverse to Mitchell, who
scampered 33 yards to Ohio State's 7. On the next play, Foster ran
left into the end zone, and the Bruins were within 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   They would get no closer.

VALDES' STRUGGLES CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For an organization that talks about its lack of
options, the Dodgers do have a few. It's in their starting
pitchers, and the recent performances of Mike Judd and Eric Gagne
have created some flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The hotly rumored pitcher to be departing the Dodgers near the
trading deadline was right-hander Ismael Valdes, though the Dodgers
elected to hold on to one of its top young pitchers. And when the
offseason arrives, again expect Valdes' name to be thrown around
endlessly in trade scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the last month of the season has a bearing on his market
value, which will be high, remains to be seen, but he certainly
hasn't helped it lately.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes, who said he isn't fatigued, has allowed 17 runs in his
last three starts, including six runs in five-plus innings of the
Dodgers' 6-2 loss to the Mets at Dodger Stadium on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was, all in all, a bad game,'' Valdes said. ``I think
everybody, through the season, struggles, and I guess this is my
time. In the month of September, I have no control of my pitches at
all. I'm behind all the hitters. I struggle with my control all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers catcher Mike Piazza hit his second two-run homer
of the series and went 4 for 4. The four hits tied a career-high.
It was the 18th time he's done it, but he said familiarity with his
one-time battery mate didn't play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I had anything to recall,'' said Piazza, who
continues to receive huge ovations when he bats. ``It's a
flattering reaction. Every time I come up there seems to be some
kind of commotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off an atrocious three-inning, six-run stint against
Florida, Valdes walked five to fall to 0-3 with a 8.40 ERA this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Until the start against the Marlins, Valdes hadn't allowed six
earned runs this season. Now, he's allowed six earned runs in each
of his last two starts, during which he has a 13.50 ERA and has
seen his ERA rise from 3.27 to 3.69.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (9-14) also took over the team lead in losses. He's lost
three straight and six of his last seven decisions. The Dodgers
lost for the 10th time in the last 11 games Valdes started.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes failed to record an out in the sixth inning, allowing the
first five batters to reach. He was knocked out on consecutive
two-run singles by former Dodger Roger Cedeno and Rey Ordonez as
the Mets turned a tie game into a 6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ismael's just in a little mini-slump,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``I guess the sixth inning, he gets in a jam and he's
not getting out of it like he can. I guess, his last (three)
starts, he's gotten into trouble and he can't get out.''

   Contract talk: Phoenix is without two key players, center Robert
Reichel and goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, both of whom are embroiled
in contract disputes. Reichel has signed with a team in Europe but
could return to Phoenix so long as he doesn't appear in a game for
the team after the start of the NHL regular season. Khabibulin
reportedly is seeking $5million a year.

<P>
   East Timor does not amount to much: it is a tiny territory of
some 800,000 people coveted by Indonesia, a country of 200 million.
That is why the rest of the world has never been much bothered by
what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   But even tiny places can become significant. If the world fails
the East Timorese again, the consequences will be felt far beyond
the fringes of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The body most immediately concerned is the United Nations. It
could hardly have prevented Indonesia from invading East Timor in
1975, after Portugal, the colonial power, had bolted _ though
America, which knew the invasion was coming and did nothing to stop
it, is far less blameless.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the U.N. have stopped Indonesia from then annexing the
territory and embarking on a campaign of repression that was to
claim, directly or indirectly, some 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, moreover, the U.N. never recognized Indonesian
rule and when, last January, President B.J. Habibie surprisingly
offered the East Timorese a referendum, the U.N. organized it with
admirable efficiency: 98.6 percent of the eligible voters cast
their ballots on Aug. 30, and 78.5 percent of them opted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But now the territory is engulfed by violence, most of it
carried out by militias determined to frustrate the voters' clear
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost responsibility for this, as for East Timor's earlier
suffering, is Indonesia's. But the U.N., having agreed to hold the
vote, and on Habibie's timetable, is now so involved that it too
will be guilty of a most terrible breach of trust if the East
Timorese are denied their independence, or gain it only after
another bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the U.N. is not an autonomous
organization whose boss has at his beck and call the troops needed
to impose law and order in unruly parts of the world. It is the
servant of its members, especially the five countries with
permanent seats on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these, China and Russia, generally stand up for oppressed
peoples only when it suits their ideological or other interests.
But the three others, America, Britain and France, nowadays
proclaim nobler principles and, over Kosovo at least, have been
prepared to rain down bombs and rockets for them.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of persecution, the East Timorese have surely suffered
more than the Kosovars, and arguably the U.N.'s obligation to them
is more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the West's principles now? On hold, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, are ready to
provide peacekeepers. Australia well might since it has a
particularly guilty conscience about the East Timorese: though they
fought in the Second World War to help prevent a Japanese invasion
of Australia, the Australians _ ever nervous of their big neighbor
_ shamefully broke western ranks to recognize Indonesia's rule of
the annexed territory.
</P>
<P>
   But even Australia will not send in its forces without
permission from the Indonesian government. That is what must now be
extracted.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to take on the Indonesian army, which is widely
accused of orchestrating the militias. And no one wants to
destabilize the world's fourth-biggest country, especially as it is
struggling to restore its economy and establish democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, outsiders are anxious to help. But they should
do so only if the Indonesian government is sincere in what it says
it is doing _ and, to judge by its actions this week, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie may well have miscalculated in allowing the referendum:
he may have reckoned that the vote would go Indonesia's way.
Neither he nor anyone in the army should miscalculate again.
</P>
<P>
   They should be left in no doubt now that the world will not
allow Indonesia to hang on to East Timor, as it did in 1975. The
current mess is, after all, a direct consequence of that piece of
misguided realpolitik.
</P>
<P>
   Conceivably, diplomatic pressure alone could still work. It will
have a better chance of doing so if it does not all come from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's Asian neighbors have a powerful interest in regional
peace. Some of them also say they resent the West's predominance on
the world stage. Why then don't they help to bring a little order
to their own neck of the woods by leaning on the powers-that-be in
Indonesia?
</P>
<P>
   The West, however, must also weigh in, making it plain that,
regardless of Indonesia's parlous economy, it will not lend money
to a country in which militias, with the connivance of the army,
make a bloodstained mockery of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy, however, may not be enough. In that case, the U.N. _
meaning the Security Council _ will have to threaten, and be ready
to use, force, even without Indonesia's permission.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, it is hard to see it being taken seriously in
such circumstances again. Rather it will be treated as an outfit
that merely organizes votes and then scuttles, leaving the local
thugs to seize control (as in Cambodia).
</P>
<P>
   That would hearten despots the world over, and dash the hopes of
millions in countries where the big powers have no direct interest.
Yet the big powers too would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   China, Russia and the West all stand to gain from an orderly
world. If the U.N. collapses in disrepute like the League of
Nations, the prospects of finding international solutions for
international problems _ such as the spread of weapons of mass
destruction _ will simply vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps then those western countries that could not tolerate
mass murder in Kosovo will wonder why they could so readily
tolerate it in ``insignificant'' East Timor. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   East Timor does not amount to much: it is a tiny territory of
some 800,000 people coveted by Indonesia, a country of 200 million.
That is why the rest of the world has never been much bothered by
what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   But even tiny places can become significant. If the world fails
the East Timorese again, the consequences will be felt far beyond
the fringes of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The body most immediately concerned is the United Nations. It
could hardly have prevented Indonesia from invading East Timor in
1975, after Portugal, the colonial power, had bolted _ though
America, which knew the invasion was coming and did nothing to stop
it, is far less blameless.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the U.N. have stopped Indonesia from then annexing the
territory and embarking on a campaign of repression that was to
claim, directly or indirectly, some 200,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, moreover, the U.N. never recognized Indonesian
rule and when, last January, President B.J. Habibie surprisingly
offered the East Timorese a referendum, the U.N. organized it with
admirable efficiency: 98.6 percent of the eligible voters cast
their ballots on Aug. 30, and 78.5 percent of them opted for
independence.
</P>
<P>
   But now the territory is engulfed by violence, most of it
carried out by militias determined to frustrate the voters' clear
desire.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost responsibility for this, as for East Timor's earlier
suffering, is Indonesia's. But the U.N., having agreed to hold the
vote, and on Habibie's timetable, is now so involved that it too
will be guilty of a most terrible breach of trust if the East
Timorese are denied their independence, or gain it only after
another bloodbath.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the U.N. is not an autonomous
organization whose boss has at his beck and call the troops needed
to impose law and order in unruly parts of the world. It is the
servant of its members, especially the five countries with
permanent seats on the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Two of these, China and Russia, generally stand up for oppressed
peoples only when it suits their ideological or other interests.
But the three others, America, Britain and France, nowadays
proclaim nobler principles and, over Kosovo at least, have been
prepared to rain down bombs and rockets for them.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of persecution, the East Timorese have surely suffered
more than the Kosovars, and arguably the U.N.'s obligation to them
is more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   So where are the West's principles now? On hold, is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, are ready to
provide peacekeepers. Australia well might since it has a
particularly guilty conscience about the East Timorese: though they
fought in the Second World War to help prevent a Japanese invasion
of Australia, the Australians _ ever nervous of their big neighbor
_ shamefully broke western ranks to recognize Indonesia's rule of
the annexed territory.
</P>
<P>
   But even Australia will not send in its forces without
permission from the Indonesian government. That is what must now be
extracted.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to take on the Indonesian army, which is widely
accused of orchestrating the militias. And no one wants to
destabilize the world's fourth-biggest country, especially as it is
struggling to restore its economy and establish democracy.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, outsiders are anxious to help. But they should
do so only if the Indonesian government is sincere in what it says
it is doing _ and, to judge by its actions this week, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie may well have miscalculated in allowing the referendum:
he may have reckoned that the vote would go Indonesia's way.
Neither he nor anyone in the army should miscalculate again.

<P>
   Whatever happened to the Iraqi opposition? Last year, the
American Congress passed a law granting $97 million-worth of
military equipment to groups trying to topple Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   The government duly named seven factions worthy of such
largesse, and even persuaded them to coalesce into a newly
revitalized umbrella group, the Iraqi National Congress (INC).
</P>
<P>
   In February, the INC announced that its parliament-in-exile
would meet in April for the first time in seven years.
Inexplicably, the date slipped to July. July came and went without
a peep from the INC, not even a new date for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   More embarrassing still, a scheme to hold the session in the
autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq was abandoned when
America said it could not guarantee the safety of the participants.
</P>
<P>
   Not a penny of the $97 million has yet reached the opposition _
and when it does, America says, it will come in the form of office
supplies, not the arms that were promised.
</P>
<P>
   Some defiant INC members insist the meeting should nonetheless
go ahead in Kurdistan. But the local Kurdish authorities are
lukewarm. Even if the session is eventually held, events so far
show that America is not serious about helping the Iraqi
opposition. That, at least, is what INC figures say.
</P>
<P>
   n theory, of course, America would be delighted for the INC to
have a go at Hussein. But in practice the administration does not
think the group up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in northern Iraq, or an attack launched from there,
might, the Americans fear, draw them into an ill-conceived and
embarrassing military adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of 1996, when Hussein's troops overran the Kurdish
capital, Arbil, and wiped out both INC and CIA staff there, lingers
on. But whereas the American government has doubts about bold
initiatives, Congress chafes at inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democrats have complained about the effects of nine
years of United Nations sanctions on Iraq and, in defiance of the
State Department, have sent representatives to Baghdad to
investigate. Others are concerned too.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials are frustrated because humanitarian aid is
hampered by bureaucratic delays by both America and Iraq. The pope
has expressed concern and promised a high-profile visit to Iraq
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are also those, including many in Congress, who want to
get tough with Hussein. The question is how. One idea is to start a
war-crimes investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Austrian authorities were arresting a Serb suspect
last month, they were also playing host to Hussein's deputy, Izzat
Ibrahim al-Douri, before letting him go home safely to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And would more military action be effective? America has
launched almost as many air raids against Iraq this year as were
launched against Serbia by NATO. &QL;

<P>
   PRAGUE _ Three dozen or so bloated corpses of Gypsies from
Kosovo were recently fished out of the turquoise waters off the
coast of Montenegro. Perhaps more than 100 had drowned when a boat
smuggling them to Italy _ for about $1,100 a head _ sank in a
summer storm.
</P>
<P>
   Though most were illiterate, they had hoped against the odds to
make a new life. There was certainly no going back. The Kosovo
Liberation Army, once NATO's bombs had made it top dog, ensured
that.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Gypsies of collaborating with the Serbs (quite a lot
did), it had at least winked at a campaign of murder, torture,
beating and the burning of Gypsy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians seem delighted that most of
the province's Gypsies, maybe as many as 80,000 of them, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   But the stinking corpses lashed to the sun-soaked deck of a
coast guard boat are but the latest incident in a sorry saga of
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 million or so Gypsies (or Roma) in Europe, nearly
three-quarters live in the continent's center and east. Despite _
and partly because of _ the paternalistic efforts of governments,
most of them live in poverty-stricken dependence on welfare or
petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century French observer's description of them as
``Europe's negroes'' still holds. Gypsies were often enslaved and
lynched with impunity. A disproportionate number still end up in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gypsy children are virtually bereft of parents: in
Romania's wretched orphanages, three-quarters of the inhabitants
are Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Just to finish school is a feat. Like American blacks, Europe's
Gypsies often suffer instant discrimination based on the color of
their skin. They frequently complain of police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways American blacks are far better off. They
have a large middle class, a measure of cultural unity and
self-awareness, a strong and sophisticated voice in politics, and
numerous role models of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies have none of that. They remain much as they have always
been: Europe's phantom nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lobby groups fighting for the Gypsies say that education is the
key. Too often, Gypsy children are automatically put into
``remedial'' classes where they sink. Campaigners now demand
literacy classes for adults. They also want Gypsy history to be
taught to all children in countries with large Gypsy minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Public statements like those of Slovakia's former populist prime
minister, Vladimir Meciar, who described Gypsies as ``mental
retards,'' would not then go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, more Gypsies now want gadje (as they call other
people) to acknowledge centuries of racism and slavery (Gypsies
were still being bought and sold in the Balkans in the 1860s) that
culminated in the Holocaust, which Gypsies call Porrajmos, meaning
``the devouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians now reckon that as many as 1 million may then
have been swallowed up, along with the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research, some of it by Gypsy scholars, is now pointing
up previously unnoticed horror-details: how, for instance, Josef
Mengele, the Nazi doctor who experimented on concentration-camp
victims, liked to put out Gypsy children's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Most Gypsies, however, never got as far as the camps: local
police, sparing the Nazis the trouble of transport and gas, shot
them.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1986, Elie
Wiesel, the Jewish campaigner for Holocaust victims, asked the
Gypsies' forgiveness for ``not listening to your story.'' No Gypsy
was asked to testify at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments made scant effort to help Gypsy survivors of
the Holocaust. Early Holocaust museums virtually ignored their
plight. Wiesel, among others, has helped change that.
</P>
<P>
   More Gypsies are beginning to lay claim to their own history,
holding a string of memorial services across Europe and North
America in August to commemorate the month when several thousand of
them had been sent to their deaths at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, says a leading Gypsy campaigner, his people
scarcely spoke of the Holocaust at all. ``Jews said, Never forget.
We said, Never remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, belatedly but urgently, Gypsy groups are seeking collective
compensation for the Holocaust. It will be hard. Gypsies, unlike

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ Three dozen or so bloated corpses of Gypsies from
Kosovo were recently fished out of the turquoise waters off the
coast of Montenegro. Perhaps more than 100 had drowned when a boat
smuggling them to Italy _ for about $1,100 a head _ sank in a
summer storm.
</P>
<P>
   Though most were illiterate, they had hoped against the odds to
make a new life. There was certainly no going back. The Kosovo
Liberation Army, once NATO's bombs had made it top dog, ensured
that.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Gypsies of collaborating with the Serbs (quite a lot
did), it had at least winked at a campaign of murder, torture,
beating and the burning of Gypsy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians seem delighted that most of
the province's Gypsies, maybe as many as 80,000 of them, have fled.
</P>
<P>
   But the stinking corpses lashed to the sun-soaked deck of a
coast guard boat are but the latest incident in a sorry saga of
persecution.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 6 million or so Gypsies (or Roma) in Europe, nearly
three-quarters live in the continent's center and east. Despite _
and partly because of _ the paternalistic efforts of governments,
most of them live in poverty-stricken dependence on welfare or
petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   A 19th-century French observer's description of them as
``Europe's negroes'' still holds. Gypsies were often enslaved and
lynched with impunity. A disproportionate number still end up in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Many Gypsy children are virtually bereft of parents: in
Romania's wretched orphanages, three-quarters of the inhabitants
are Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Just to finish school is a feat. Like American blacks, Europe's
Gypsies often suffer instant discrimination based on the color of
their skin. They frequently complain of police harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in many ways American blacks are far better off. They
have a large middle class, a measure of cultural unity and
self-awareness, a strong and sophisticated voice in politics, and
numerous role models of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies have none of that. They remain much as they have always
been: Europe's phantom nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lobby groups fighting for the Gypsies say that education is the
key. Too often, Gypsy children are automatically put into
``remedial'' classes where they sink. Campaigners now demand
literacy classes for adults. They also want Gypsy history to be
taught to all children in countries with large Gypsy minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Public statements like those of Slovakia's former populist prime
minister, Vladimir Meciar, who described Gypsies as ``mental
retards,'' would not then go unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, more Gypsies now want gadje (as they call other
people) to acknowledge centuries of racism and slavery (Gypsies
were still being bought and sold in the Balkans in the 1860s) that
culminated in the Holocaust, which Gypsies call Porrajmos, meaning
``the devouring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some historians now reckon that as many as 1 million may then
have been swallowed up, along with the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research, some of it by Gypsy scholars, is now pointing
up previously unnoticed horror-details: how, for instance, Josef
Mengele, the Nazi doctor who experimented on concentration-camp
victims, liked to put out Gypsy children's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Most Gypsies, however, never got as far as the camps: local
police, sparing the Nazis the trouble of transport and gas, shot
them.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech accepting the Nobel peace prize in 1986, Elie
Wiesel, the Jewish campaigner for Holocaust victims, asked the
Gypsies' forgiveness for ``not listening to your story.'' No Gypsy
was asked to testify at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments made scant effort to help Gypsy survivors of
the Holocaust. Early Holocaust museums virtually ignored their
plight. Wiesel, among others, has helped change that.
</P>
<P>
   More Gypsies are beginning to lay claim to their own history,
holding a string of memorial services across Europe and North
America in August to commemorate the month when several thousand of
them had been sent to their deaths at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, says a leading Gypsy campaigner, his people
scarcely spoke of the Holocaust at all. ``Jews said, Never forget.
We said, Never remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, belatedly but urgently, Gypsy groups are seeking collective
compensation for the Holocaust. It will be hard. Gypsies, unlike
many Jewish families, much of whose property and bank accounts
should be traceable, tend to lack documentation for what few assets
they had. Even where it exists, they invariably lack the political
and financial clout to press their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Still, eagerness to join the European Union has made several
Central European countries much readier to listen to Gypsy
grievances. Local councils have begun to appoint Gypsy liaison
officers.
</P>
<P>
   For every company that discriminates against Gypsies, others are
trying out job preferment. One big Czech shop that has hired Gypsy
security guards has found that theft has dropped sharply. And
charities have sprung up in Hungary, the Czech Republic and
Slovakia to help Gypsies with housing loans, literacy classes and
summer camps for children.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In America's presidential system, calls for the resignation of
top politicians are rare. Even during that most shameful of
episodes, the Lewinsky affair, comparatively few politicians echoed
The Economist's cry that Bill Clinton should go.
</P>
<P>
   So when members of Congress demand the resignation of the
attorney-general, Janet Reno, three times on three different
charges in two years _ most recently the new revelations about the
siege at Waco, Texas, in 1993 _ it is clear that something is
rotten in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Is it just Reno herself? Conservatives would say so. The longest
serving attorney-general since the days of John Quincy Adams, she
has had more than her fair share of misjudgments.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Washington in 1993 as a little-known state attorney
from Florida, with a reputation for running an enlightened and
effective anti-drug policy but no political backing in Congress or
even in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She won a good deal of public credit for her willingness, in
April 1993, to be held accountable for the disastrous operation at
Waco.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this has disappeared with her claims, in the past few
weeks, that she knew neither exactly what the FBI was doing at Waco
nor how flagrantly it lied about it afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters, the accusations against her are less
clear-cut. She was asked by the FBI to authorize a wire tap on Wen
Ho Lee, a scientist at the center of Chinese spying allegations.
She refused.
</P>
<P>
   She refused again when Republicans asked her to appoint an
independent counsel to investigate allegations of campaign-finance
abuses by both President Bill Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   On both occasions, her actions, though controversial, were
legally defensible. She demanded more prima facie evidence of
wrongdoing than her critics thought necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Such conflicts suggest there is more to Ms. Reno's troubles than
personal error. In both cases, her legal judgment collided with
political opinion and failed to satisfy it.
</P>
<P>
   That tension between the law and politics is intrinsic to her
job. But recently public and congressional demands upon her have
risen so much that it is becoming harder and harder for Ms. Reno _
or anyone else _ to satisfy both parts of the attorney-general's
brief.
</P>
<P>
   The 1789 Judiciary Act requires the president to appoint a
person ``learned in the law'' to advise him on legal matters. Like
any lawyer, therefore, the attorney-general must serve two masters
_ the president and the law.
</P>
<P>
   When the two come into conflict, the only way to resolve it is
for the attorney-general to leave office and trust to the public to
force the president to obey the law.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened in the ``Saturday night massacre''
of 1973, when Richard Nixon kept on firing attorneys-general until
he found one willing to get rid of the Justice Department
prosecutor who was investigating the Watergate affair.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno, in other words, is not the first to run into this
dilemma. She is unusual in the number and complexity of the
conflicts that beset her. But there is an institutional as well as
a personal explanation for that.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the tension inherent in her post was muted
because few people thought it was the main job of the
attorney-general to investigate the government. John F. Kennedy
even appointed his brother as attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate changed both the attorney-general's job and the way it
was perceived by the public _ in diametrically opposing ways.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal led Congress to pass the independent counsel law.
This said that, when any of 49 top officials was alleged to have
committed a crime, the attorney-general could name an independent
counsel to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, this meant setting up miniature departments of
justice, independent of the attorney-general, whenever there was a
problem. The law lapsed in July _ but not before it had done much
to erode the attorney-general's power and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Watergate also led to the establishment of inspectors-general in
federal agencies to audit and investigate them. The inspectors
report to Congress, which means that they too serve two masters
while simultaneously competing with the attorney-general.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the same time, Watergate gave the public a sense that
the attorney-general ought to have more political independence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno herself is a perfect expression of that expectation.
She has been almost ostentatiously independent of the president,
but her greater independence is a matter of public attitude only.
There is no constitutional or legal mandate for it.
</P>
<P>
   The weaknesses of this arrangement _ the attorney-general is
expected to do more but has fewer powers _ have been ruthlessly
exposed by the so-called ``criminalization of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not refer to any increase in the tendency of criminals
to become politicians, or vice versa. It refers to the recent
practice of using allegations of wrongdoing as weapons in what are
political, not legal, battles.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Henry Cisneros pleaded guilty to charges of not
telling the FBI how much he was paying his admitted mistress before
he became Clinton's first housing secretary.
</P>
<P>
   No one has pretended that his affair had any relevance to his
ability to do his job. There have been dozens of other such
investigations, most notably Kenneth Starr's. Few have discovered
irrefutable cases of corruption or illegality.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno is the central figure in this pursuit of politics by
other means. Her department must investigate the allegations or
recommend a special prosecutor (it seems about to choose a
respected former Republican senator, John Danforth, to look into
Waco).
</P>
<P>
   Her personal integrity has made her all the more willing to
appoint special prosecutors (when she was a lawyer in Miami, she
called in a special prosecutor to investigate drunk-driving charges
against her own mother). But because the arguments are at root
political ones, legal processes can never resolve them fully.
</P>
<P>
   This is a far cry from the usual charge against Ms. Reno: that
she has abused her office to protect the president. Of that, she is
almost certainly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   She may have been guilty of bad management in the Waco
operation: Danforth's investigation should settle that. But what is
certain is that she has been unable to stop something much more
corrosive: the use of her office by others to fight their political
battles. &QL;

   SALT LAKE CITY _ Tornadoes are almost unheard of in Salt Lake
City, but in August one struck right in the middle of the Outdoor
Retailers Summer Market.
</P>
<P>
   It was the talk of the show _ until, that is, the sellers of
camping gear and climbing boots began to consider their other
problems. Not all of these are immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for goods for hiking, camping, mountaineering and the
like remains strong, with sales worth about $5.5 billion a year.
The green inclinations of baby-boomers, their growing spending
power and their yen to turn vacations into something between a
forced march and a spiritual retreat, have been the making of an
industry that barely existed 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacks at $400, hiking boots at $250, seaworthy kayaks at
$2,000, are all snapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, says Lee Fromson, a vice-president with Cascade
Designs in Seattle which specializes in outside sleeping equipment,
anyone getting into this sector could expect their business to grow
by 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing. For many outdoor-gear sellers, sales are
flat _ or worse.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, baby-boomers are getting older. They are no longer
so eager to tote a 50-pound pack for a week in the Tetons, nor
hoist themselves up icy Mount Rainier in Microsoft's backyard (Al
Gore's recent ascent of that peak notwithstanding).
</P>
<P>
   Many sellers of the ponderous recreational vehicles seen
lumbering down the interstates during the summer now report that
their fastest-growing market consists of people between 35 and 50
who have finally hung up their boots.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of outdoor equipment are aging, too, and find it hard
to fathom what younger people want.
</P>
<P>
   There are other challenges. At the Salt Lake City show, there
was hardly a black or brown face in sight: outdoor sport remains a
white enclave, meaning that makers of outdoor equipment are simply
ignored by a huge and growing portion of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is proving a formidable competitor, not only
because most outdoor-gear makers run small businesses that lack the
know-how or financing to launch websites, but because surfing the
Net takes up leisure time that used to be spent hiking or biking.
</P>
<P>
   Even the strong economy works against the outdoors industry,
which has found that people who hike in Montana in hard times would
rather lounge in Italy once they have money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some in the industry are optimistic. Certain activities,
notably kayaking and rock climbing, are proving popular with young
enthusiasts and are showing strong sales growth.
</P>
<P>
   Several large clothing and investment companies are snapping up
distressed outdoor-gear makers with strong brand names and applying
up-to-date stock-keeping, manufacturing and marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   And there is hope that today's teenagers, many of whom are
fanatically green, will adopt the hobbies that their parents once
embraced. Until then, equipment makers can only pray that their
latest ultra-light tent or load-lightening pack will put some
spring into the steps of grey-haired hikers _ and dollars into
tills. &QL;

   TUNICA, MISS. _ What a shame Elvis did not live to see it.
Thirty miles from Graceland a new Las Vegas has sprouted in the
Delta, and lights blaze along the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   Times have certainly changed. In 1990, Tunica County was
officially listed by the Census Bureau as the poorest county in the
United States, a place famous mostly for open-ditch sewers and
clapped-out cars rusting in cotton fields.
</P>
<P>
   Now thousands of visitors descend every day, and think it
heaven. Last year, Tunica's casinos grossed a record $2 billion in
gaming revenues. Taxes on that revenue generated more than $126
million for the county between December 1992 and the end of 1998,
and sales taxes rose by $213.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mississippi, which takes 8 percent of the casinos'
gross revenues, received more than $250 million in taxes.
Unemployment is almost nonexistent in Tunica, and income per head
has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   Once, the key to prosperity was to leave the South for the
north. Now the flow has reversed. Casino workers from Chicago,
Atlantic City and even abroad descend on the Delta to deal cards
and serve drinks in gambling dens built to resemble Irish castles
or Southern antebellum mansions.
</P>
<P>
   Tunica is now the fifth most profitable gambling area in the
country, outranked only by the Las Vegas Strip, Atlantic City, the
Foxwoods complex in Connecticut and a clutch of casinos close to
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi legalized casino gambling in 1992. As in several
other states, the legislation required the casinos to float on
water.
</P>
<P>
   But whereas the other states allowed gambling only on
riverboats, Mississippi added an ingenious loophole that let
gambling halls be constructed on barges that float in moats. This
means that casinos can spring up further away from rivers, and with
giant fountains playing on every side.
</P>
<P>
   When the casinos first opened, visitors had a choice of 20
hotels in all of Tunica County. Today there are more than 6,000
hotel rooms, and on most nights most of them are filled. The
31-story Gold Strike Casino Hotel is the tallest building in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although most visitors still arrive by bus, the tiny airport is
being upgraded with a $32 million extension to the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos in Tunica, as in most places, are keen to lure families
to stay an extra day and spend their winnings at golf courses,
amusement parks and theatres. The next wave of development is
therefore in this direction.
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Isle of Capri casino plans to build two Wayne
Newton theatres, where the ex-lounge lizard and Las Vegas superstar
will perform several nights each year.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just classic Vegas names that jet into Tunica now.
Duran Duran (to be slightly more up-to-date) recently played to a
sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Only the neighbors are sulking. Last year, fewer tourists than
usual went to Beale Street in Memphis, Tenn., one of the
birthplaces of the blues, and this was widely blamed on the fact
that nearby Tunica is awash in cheap liquor and discounted motel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis's Hard Rock Cafe, which opened only a year ago, no
longer even offers live music, citing tough competition from Tunica
to lure popular bands.
</P>
<P>
   And Tunica is only just starting to dream about the extravagant
things it can do. This summer, the city began constructing an $18.5
million exhibition center, covering 132,000 square feet (12,260
square meters), for trade shows, rodeos, car shows, concerts,
banquets, tractor-pulls and other attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mississippi was fighting the demonic aspects
of high-stakes gambling in its state legislature, no one could have
foreseen the impact the industry would have on the poorest part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Now, seven years later, there are few doubters left. Like it or
not, Tunica was sick of being poor. With wise investment, it hopes
it will never go hungry again. &QL;

BAYLOR FUMBLE GIVES UNLV MIRACLE WIN AT WIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ When he vowed to resurrect the glory days of
Baylor football, this was not the type of ``Miracle on the
Brazos''that first-year coach Kevin Steele envisioned. But the
Bears fell victim last night to what Steele termed a
``one-in-a-million deal''when Nevada-Las Vegas cornerback Kevin
Thomas returned a fumble 99 yards as time expired to give the
Rebels a stunning, 27-24 victory at Floyd Casey Stadium. Rest
assured, none of the 32,272 in attendance _ or the shell-shocked
Baylor players _ will forget Steele's decision to try to pound in
an extra touchdown against a UNLV defense that was out of timeouts
and trailed, 24-21, when the Bears came to the line of scrimmage
with eight seconds remaining. Instead of having quarterback
Jermaine Alfred kneel with the football, thereby killing the
remaining time, Steele said he opted to ``create an attitude''in
his struggling offense and allowed tailback Darrell Bush to take a
handoff between the tackles. Bush fought his way toward the goal
line, where the ball was stripped by Tyler Brickell and Andre
Hillard. It bounced off the turf and into the arms of Thomas, who
sped untouched down the left sideline as the final seconds ticked
off the clock. Fans and Baylor players fell silent as UNLV players
created a huge dogpile in the south end zone. Most did not move
until the public address announcer confirmed that, yes, the Rebels
(2-0) had won and the Bears (0-2) had lost a second consecutive
heart-breaker to start the Steele era. ``We played with fire and we
got burned,''said Steele, whose team fell in overtme to Boston
College, 30-29, last week. ``We learned a very expensive lesson.
``The million-dollar question is, `Why?' And that falls on my
shoulders. I've got an explanation, but it doesn't hold water after
what we just went through.'' Steele said he was seeking to instill
a killer attitude in an inconsistent offense that previously had
failed twice on pivotal fourth-down plays, both in the first
quarter. Instead, the Bears snatched defeat from the jaws of
victory and authored a result perhaps more stunning than the
initial ``Miracle on the Brazos''_ the Bears' 1974 team that won
its first Southwest Conference championship in 50 years despite
being picked last in most pre-season polls. This time, the
unexpected twist of fate had a more immediate return. In the span
of eight seconds and 99 yards, UNLV hit the lottery. Thomas said he
expected to score as soon as he scooped the ball. ``When I picked
it up, the only thing that went through my mind was, `I hope they
don't call it back,''' said Thomas, who saw nothing but a clear
sideline ahead. ``I knew no one was going to catch me.'' After
Thomas capped his game-winning score by removing his shirt, like
U.S. women's soccer heroine Brandi Chastain, several Baylor players
slumped to the turf in disbelief. Jeff McInerny, UNLV's defensive
coordinator, stood at midfield in the postgame bedlam, shaking his
finger toward the stunned Baylor players. In hindsight, said
Steele, running out the clock would have been the textbook call. It
would have preserved a victory for a team coming off consecutive
2-9 seasons. Instead, Steele made a prophet of UNLV coach John
Robinson. Asked at a Monday news conference to comment on Baylor's
heart-breaking loss to Boston College in its season opener,
Robinson said such an outcome was typical of the Bears. ``When you
play Baylor, it's always a physical game. But they always do
something to screw things up. That's been the history of their
program,'' Robinson said. Steele said Robinson's comment had no
bearing on his decision to go for an in-your-face touchdown in the
final minute. He simply wanted to build confidence in his offense,
a move that Alfred seconded. ``I'd run the same play again,'' said
Alfred, the only Baylor player who took part in postgame
interviews. ``I wanted to put more points on the board. But this is
hard. It's like a shot in the heart.'' Steele said his decision
will be chronicled as ``one of the dumbest things that ever
happened'' in college football. ``The flaming arrows are going to
start coming from every direction,'' Steele said. ``This is
unbelievable ... to lose on a one-in-a-million deal. I can't tell
you how bad I hate this right now.''

QUARTERBACK APPLEWHITE PACES LONGHORNS OVER RUTGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ With 5:28 remaining in a 38-21 Texas victory
last night, the moment many among a record throng of 41,511 at
Rutgers Stadium had been waiting for finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Simms, son of Phil Simms, former local hero,
and orangeclad turncoat, entered the game.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled, the crowd responded with its most enthusiastic ovation
of the evening _ a triumphant chorus of boos that turned to cheers
when, on his third snap, Simms fumbled the ball, and the Longhorns
were forced to punt.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the evening was not a total wash for the home crowd _
although much of it was a severe trial for the Scarlet Knights
(0-2), thanks to the other Texas quarterback, Major Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   Running the Longhorns' season record to 2-1, Applewhite once
again provided most of the zing in the offense, completing 19 of 32
passes for 244 yards and two touchdowns and keeping Texas on the
march through most of the game despite a ground attack (141 yards)
that remained suspect.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knights closely watching ace receiver Kwame Cavil (6
catches, 42 yards), the key receiver turned out to be Ryan Nunez,
who grabbed 7 balls for 104 yards, as Applewhite recorded his 13th
consecutive performance featuring at least 200 yards and one score.
</P>
<P>
   For the Scarlet Knights, the worst of it was picking up one of
Texas' recent bad habits _ giving the Longhorns 14 points on two
blocked punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that was important was the `W,''' Texas coach
Mack Brown said. ``Even if it was 14-0 I would still be excited.
This wasn't an ugly win.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second week in a row, the Longhorns opened with three
first-quarter touchdowns, in this instance constructing a 21-3 lead
on a blocked punt and two Applewhite scoring passes.
</P>
<P>
   The first blow came 62 seconds into the game when Terrol Dillon
crashed through to block a punt by Rutgers' Charlie Titus, with
Jeremy Jones picking up the loose ball and running 11 yards for the
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Scarlet Knights struck back quickly with an 18-yard run from
Jacki Crooks and a completion by quarterback Mike McMahon, but a
35-yard scoring run by Crooks was wiped out by a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, McMahon hit L.T. Smith for 40 yards to the 5-yard
line, but a running play lost a yard and two passes fell
incomplete, and Rutgers settled for Steve Barone's 23-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   But with Rutgers bottled up, Texas got the ball at the hosts'
42-yard line after a punt. On the second play thereafter,
Applewhite _ who hit seven of his first eight passes for 97 yards _
evaded the rush and hit tight end Mike Jones for 28 yards and the
score.
</P>
<P>
   On the next drive, the Longhorns required three plays to move 56
yards, with Applewhite hitting Nunez for 23 yards and then Montrell
Flowers for 21 yards and the score.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Texas launched a 10-play,
83-yard drive climaxed by Victor Ike's 30-yard scoring sprint. A
late field goal by Barone left it 28-6 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns extended it with a Kris Stockton field goal, but
the Knights responded with an 11-play, 85-yard drive to move to
within 31-14 as the fourth quarter opened.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster once again struck the Rutgers kicking game, however.
Attempting to punt from his 15, Titus fumbled the snap and Marcus
Wilkins recovered for the Longhorns at the 2-yard line. Chris
Robertson's one-yard dive with 11:39 left severely wounded the
Knights' comeback plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights nevertheless scored once more, but Brown now felt
safe enough to insert Simms and give the home crowd a lift.

STARS YOUTH MOVEMENT SHOWS QUICK RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ If the battle for open winger spots continues to heat
up, Stars general manager Bob Gainey could look like a genius after
letting go of veteran wingers Pat Verbeek, Dave Reid and Brent
Severyn in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars used a team effort to suffocate the Colorado
Avalanche, 3-0, before an announced crowd of 16,103 last night at
Reunion Arena _ getting strong team defense, consistent goaltending
and a great all-around effort from all four centermen. However, the
real story was the increased intensity of the Stars young wingers
as they battle for what could be two open roster spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making it really hard on us,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``I didn't see a weak player.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the competition to claim a place on the defending
Stanley Cup champions, the wingers continue to push each other to
greater heights. Aaron Gavey came up with a big assist and was one
of the Stars' top defensive forwards. Jamie Wright chipped in an
assist and four hits. Jon Sim was all over the ice, delighting the
crowd and drawing two key penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, they complemented the Stars' team-first system
by forechecking hard, creating turnovers and avoiding positional
mistakes on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to stray from the schedule,'' Wright said.
``Not too many bad things happened out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when Wright and Sim were able to play on a line with center
Mike Modano, who was his usual flawless self. And not when Gavey
was able to get a charge from a scrappy Jamie Langenbrunner and a
hungry Derek Plante.
</P>
<P>
   Those two lines dominated an Avalanche team missing most of its
star players. Peter Forsberg is out with a shoulder injury. Joe
Sakic didn't play. Neither did Sandis Ozolinsh, Claude Lemieux or
Adam Foote. The Stars, meanwhile, took advantage of strong play
from Modano, Jere Lehtinen, Langenbrunner, Derian Hatcher and
Sergei Zubov to help the youngsters. In the end, the Stars outshot
the Avalanche, 31-17 and handed goalies Marty Turco and Manny
Fernandez an easy shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Avalanche goalie Philippe Sauve, a 19-year-old who is expected
to return to junior hockey, played well, but was overwhelmed.
Langenbrunner scored at the 3:17 mark of the first period off a
smooth feed from Gavey, who was set up behind the net. Stars
defenseman Richard Jackman added a power play goal in the third
period and Modano finished the scoring, chipping in a rebound off a
Wright shot.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, 24, who was a part of the Stars two seasons ago and was
sent to the minors last season, said the trip back to the Michigan
K-Wings served as great inspiration. Gavey, who at 25 is on his
third NHL team after stints with the Tampa Bay Lightning and
Calgary Flames, said he is determined to not give the Stars a
reason to send him back to the minors. And Sim, 21, is defiant in
saying he's not going to let the older players get an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing my game and believing I can play at this
level,'' Sim said.
</P>
<P>
   While the team performance might establish the Stars as a great
deal deeper than the Avalanche _ something that could be crucial
after Colorado lost Theo Fleury, Valeri Kamensky and Sylvain
Lefevbre to free agency _ it really only means a 1-0 start to the
preseason. The Stars today travel to play the Phoenix Coyotes at
America West Arena in a scheduled 7 p.m. start and will get an even
deeper look at the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but it's fun,'' Wright said. ``I can feel we're
pushing each other, and that's good. Nobody wants anything handed
to him. It's a lot more self-gratifying when you earn it.''

HEUPEL, SOONERS ROUT INDIANA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORMAN, Okla. _ It mattered little to last night's sellout crowd
of 74,119 that Oklahoma stooped to conquer Division I-AA Indiana
State.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite fitting, actually, in that the 49-0 blowout marked
the head-coaching debut of baby-faced Bob Stoops, who turned 39 on
Thursday. But what did matter to the packed house was that the
Sooners overwhelmed the overmatched Sycamores in a style to which
the rabid OU following hopes once again to become accustomed.
</P>
<P>
   This was all for which an offense-hungry throng had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The execution was really pretty sharp,'' Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
   So was junior-college transfer quarterback Josh Heupel. Already
being touted as the best OU quarterback since all-time
total-offense leader Cale Gundy (1990-93), Heupel led the rout by
throwing Gundy-type figures and a school-record five touchdown
passes before the largest crowd to witness a home opener in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   The cool left-hander broke Gundy's game-completion record and
tied his school record of 341 yards passing before retiring after a
33-yard scoring strike to Ryan Daniel with 10:40 left in the game.
OU did not score again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh played really well,'' said tight end Matt Anderson, one
of 13 receivers who caught at least one pass from Heupel.
</P>
<P>
   Heupel's numbers included an OU-record 31 completions in 40
attempts with one interception that Stoops said wasn't his fault.
His other touchdowns went for 19 yards to wide receiver Andre
Woolfolk, six to running back Josh Norman, five to wide receiver
Jarrail Jackson and 11 to wideout Julius McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a great atmosphere to come into in your first game,''
said Heupel, who dealt praise to the other members of the offense
as well as he distributed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, give credit to the receivers. They did a great
job. And if the offensive line protects me like they did tonight,
we'll be successful in this offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Heupel's numbers are modest for some programs. But don't confuse
Oklahoma with Brigham Young. And don't confuse the Sycamores with a
Big 12 team. But a start is a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josh did an excellent job directing the day,'' Stoops said.
``I felt good about \Rthe passing game\S, but believe it or not, it
can be better and should be better. We had a few overthrows and
some drops. We can improve on that, and I believe we will as we go
on. We'll add wrinkles as we go, but what you saw tonight is
typical of what we should be able to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we'll meet stronger opponents. \RIndiana State\S
was outmanned. We recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners amassed 507 yards total offense and saw some
productive running by senior running back Michael Thornton, who
accumulated 85 yards on 19 carries and scored OU's second TD on a
10-yard dash up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Three different receivers caught at least five passes, led by
Woolfolk's five for 61 yards. Anderson's five went for 55, and
Jackson had five for 54. Linebackers Rocky Calmus and Torrance
Marshall led a defense that limited the Sycamores' wishbone offense
to 195 yards.
</P>
<P>
   By the half, Heupel and the Sooners had already buried memories
of the offensive-sorry Sooners of past season under former coach
John Blake. OU led 28-0. Heupel had thrown for three touchdowns and
177 yards and engineered 279 yards of total offense _ including a
98-yard scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, the '98 Sooners averaged only 16.7 points, 109.9
yards passing and 293 yards total offense per game. All but the
latter figure ranked last in the Big 12. The Sooners were 11th in
total offense.  &LR; tagtop:Mike Jones, (817) 390-7760
 &LR; tagbottom:jonz &LR; star-telegram.com
Quick hits OU scheduled Indiana State as a replacement for Arkansas
State, which had committed to the game before discovering it
already had a contract for the date. ... Former QB Brandon Daniels,
expected to be one of OU's top receivers this year, sat out last
night's game for violating a team rule over the summer. ... LB
Rocky Calmus, who led OU's defensive effort, suffered bruised ribs
just before the half, but returned to play in the third quarter.
... OU's last scored this many points in a 51-10 win in 1995
against North Texas. ... Cale Gundy threw his school-record 341
yards against Texas Tech in '91 and hit his 25 completions against
Virginia in the '91 Gator Bowl.

AT TCU, IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR A QUARTERBACK CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSTON, Ill. _ TCU coach Dennis Franchione said he doesn't
know what he will do. He shook his head. He looked away. He'll
watch the films, he said, then figure something out.
</P>
<P>
   His darting eyes, filled with agony, told a different story.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as it's going to be, Franchione has to make a change
at quarterback, and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that the Horned Frogs suffered a devastatingly
disappointing 17-7 loss to Northwestern yesterday at Ryan Field. It
was ``how'' they lost.
</P>
<P>
   They were embarrassingly pathetic on offense. Pitiful. And the
main problem _ but not the only one _ is senior quarterback Patrick
Batteaux.
</P>
<P>
   This is a difficult truth for Franchione to swallow. He is
almost fanatically loyal, but if he's as smart as I think he is,
sometime this week he will take a walk with Batteaux and break the
news: freshman Casey Printers will be the Frogs' starting
quarterback in two weeks at Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   It is a move that is inevitable if the Frogs are to salvage this
season and, with an extra week to prepare, the timing is perfect.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if there's ever a perfect time to break a heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that young man \RBatteaux\S,'' Franchione said softly
after the Frogs fell to 0-2. ``I love what he's done for this
program since he's been here. I mean, he didn't ask to be the
quarterback. He's the guy we won the Sun Bowl with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before anybody gets too critical of Pat Batteaux, they need to
appreciate that he's the first quarterback to win a bowl game in 41
years around here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that we don't appreciate what Batteaux did last year.
But big-time college athletics is, of necessity, a
what-have-you-done-for-me-lately business. Batteaux, putting it as
gently as possible, is simply not good enough as a passer to start
for a major college program.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, against a defense geared to stop the Frogs' option
play and tailback LaDanian Tomlinson, Batteaux completed 10-of-23
passes for 96 yards. This, on the heels of a similar collapse in
the second half last week against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He threw low. He threw high. Time after time he threw behind
receivers. The idea of actually leading a receiver seems to be a
foreign concept to him. With his feet always moving, more often
than not Batteaux has the touch of an inebriated bricklayer.
</P>
<P>
   Printers, who came on in the fourth quarter after Batteaux
fumbled away a pitch inside the 5 with the Frogs trailing 14-7, hit
9-of-13 for 109 yards. The difference, even in such a brief cameo
appearance, was startling.
</P>
<P>
   It says here that the Frogs, despite allowing the Wildcats to
hang around and burn them with three big plays _ including an
87-yard punt return for a touchdown _ would have still pulled this
game out if Franchione had gone to Printers earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Batteaux didn't \Rfail\S cover the punt, he didn't run
the wrong depth on the pass routes, he didn't miss tackles,''
Franchione insisted. ``Patrick Batteux didn't lose this ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but more importantly, he didn't put his team in a
position to win it either, which is what a quarterback must do in
this offense.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there isn't plenty of blame to go around,
including a hefty share for the coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   After easily marching 80 yards in 10 plays, capped by
Tomlinson's 1-yard TD dive, the Frogs all but abandoned their
bread-and-butter option play which was working so well, using it
only sporadically the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to keep 'em off balance, tried to mix our
plays,'' Franchione explained. ``In retrospect, you're probably
right. We should have run at 'em a little more, should have stayed
with it a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' offensive approach also demands a lot of Batteaux.
Many of his incomplete passes were on rollouts to his left, forcing
him to throw across his body and on the run, a difficult play for
the best of passers and virtually impossible for those with lesser
ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the turnover down there inside the 5 is his fault,''
Franchione said. ``The missed passes and some of the other things
are his fault. But not all the fault today lies with Pat Batteaux.
I'll take a lot more of it than Pat Batteaux.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision Franchione faces regarding his quarterbacks may be
his most important since coming to TCU. But the idea of hurting
Batteaux is almost more than he can bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just kills me in this game for anybody to crucify that
kid,'' Franchione said. ``They don't make them better than that
one. Maybe we can't win with him and we'll have to make that kind
of decision. But I'll take every Pat Batteaux that the good Lord
will ever let me coach.''
</P>
<P>
   When they take that walk sometime this week, that might be a
good way to start the conversation.

 &HT;    PORTUGAL SUPPORTS FORMER COLONY EAST TIMOR
 &HT;    By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal _ Although Portugal is too poor and powerless
to protect the people of its former colony, East Timor, news
reports of widespread murders by pro-Indonesian militiamen have
stimulated an outpouring of pro-Timorese sentiment among the
Portuguese people.
</P>
<P>
   Handmade posters and ``Peace in Timor'' T-shirts proliferated in
downtown Lisbon after violence exploded in the tiny Indonesian-held
territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, a hastily organized benefit concert drew an
estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people. The affair culminated with a
candlelight march that attracted teenagers, families pushing
strollers, troops of Boy Scouts in uniform and elderly couples
marching with their canes and candles.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from sales of concert tickets, which cost about $1.15
each, went to an East Timor relief fund, as did profits from $10
``Peace in Timor'' T-shirts that are being sold all over Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to support the East Timorese because they used to
be a territory that belonged to Portugal. We tried to set them
free,'' said Nuno Carvalho, 52. ``We are not here because of money,
but we are taking a position to press the U.N. to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Carvalho said he had never heard of any of the rock groups that
performed but came anyhow because of his concern over the plight of
the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   The concert was ``quite spontaneous,'' Ilena Esteves said as she
handed out flyers outside the concert hall in Lisbon's Park of the
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The city is plastered with handmade posters and computer-printed
flyers with messages such as: ``Timor: U.N. In, Already,'' and
``Don't Let East Timor Become a Giant, Independent Graveyard,'' and
``Timor Is Waiting for Your Help.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, one of the poorest countries in Europe, no longer is
the power it was when it had colonies all over the world. The
Portuguese can do little to help East Timor but plead with the rest
of the world to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   The average taxi driver in Lisbon can explain that Indonesia
took over East Timor 24 years ago when other Portuguese colonies
were gaining their independence. Many taxi drivers, like thousands
of Lisbon residents, are flying white scarves from their cars to
show their solidarity with the East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture swept Lisbon on Thursday when a local radio station
asked listeners to wear white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been broadcasting just on Timor 24 hours a day since
last Sunday at 7 p.m.,'' said Cristina Lai Men, a journalist at TSF
Radio. The station has mixed news on the situation in East Timor
with Timorese music.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Jose Sousa, an East Timorese who has lived in
Portugal for four years, the response in Lisbon has been
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only here, they know we are suffering. This is the only help
we are getting,'' he said, as he marched around the Park of the
Nations with his wife, pushing their son in stroller.

   ELKINS _ A Florida man killed himself Friday after New York
police interviewed him about a body found in an oil drum stored for
decades in a house he once owned. The unraveling of Howard Elkins,
of the Crescent Lakes gated community, started late this summer
when Ronald Cohen sold his split-level home in Jericho, N.Y., for
$455,000. Elkins had owned the home 27 years before. All that
separated Cohen from his money was the disposal of a rusting,
345-pound oil drum that had been rotting in an attic crawl space
for more than 25 years. Cohen opened the barrel Sept. 2 and found
the mummified body of a pregnant woman.(Lambert, Palm Beach Post)

 &HT;    Drum hiding body ignored for years
 &HT;    By Clay Lambert
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A suburban Boca Raton man killed himself
Friday after New York police interviewed him about a body found in
an oil drum stored for decades in a house he once owned.
</P>
<P>
   The unraveling of Howard Elkins, of the Crescent Lakes gated
community, started late this summer when Ronald Cohen sold his
split-level home in Jericho, N.Y., for $455,000. Elkins had owned
the home 27 years before. All that separated Cohen from his money
was the disposal of a rusting, 345-pound drum that had been rotting
in an attic crawl space for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen opened the barrel Sept. 2 and found the mummified body of
a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning police questioned the 70-year-old Elkins about
what Cohen found.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon Elkins walked to the unoccupied home of a
family friend and shot himself dead, a Palm Beach County sheriff's
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't know if the suicide and drum are related. But a
homicide detective for New York's Nassau County Police Department
had been curious enough to fly to Florida to ask Elkins what he
knew about the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County Police Sgt. Robert Edwards returned to Long Island
on Saturday night. A source in the department's homicide squad said
Edwards was investigating a murder and that Elkins ``hadn't been
eliminated from suspects'' in the developing case. A Palm Beach
County Sheriff's Office log entry confirms Elkins' suicide and
lists him as ``a suspect in a 30-year homicide in Nassau County,
N.Y.''
</P>
<P>
   Police credit the airtight drum for preserving clues decades
after the woman's death. On the day she was found, the unidentified
woman measured 4 feet 9 inches and weighed 59 pounds. She wore a
sweater and skirt over high socks and shoes with a discreet heel.
Jewelry also hints at her life: A locket engraved with the words
``Patrice, Love Uncle Phil,'' and a wedding band bearing the
inscription ``M.H.R. XII-59.'' She was also nine months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The Nassau County police source said detectives have turned over
evidence to a forensic anthropologist, anticipating the scientist
will be able to raise currently undetectable fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the woman's death led detectives to Elkins.
</P>
<P>
   Police in New York determined that the drum was manufactured in
1963 and originally held paint that was discontinued after 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Elkins and his wife Ruth owned the home at 67 Forest Drive in
Jericho, N.Y., from 1957 to 1972. The house had two owners between
1972 and the time Cohen bought it in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Elkins had lived in Hollywood before moving into Crescent
Lakes, which is just north of the Broward County line, in 1997. A
man who answered the door to the family home declined to answer
questions Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Ruth and Howard Elkins walked the 1/3-mile loop
around the community daily. The couple also was regularly invited
to cocktail parties at other homes in the 220-family subdivision of
two- and three-bedroom homes worth about $150,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know him well,'' said Joe Schulman, who lives two
doors down from the Elkins' residence on Royal Crown Terrace East.
``I would wave at him over the fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said he heard that Howard Elkins left home for the last
time about 1:30 Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a wallet on him,'' Schulman said. ``All he had
were his keys, so his wife thought he just went swimming at the
community pool.''
</P>
<P>
   About dusk Schulman joined sheriff's deputies and other
neighbors in a search for Elkins. Howard Elkins' son Steve found
his father, with a shotgun between his legs, about 10 p.m. in the
back seat of a Ford Explorer in the garage of a home on Barrister
Drive in Crescent Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Crescent Lakes resident Robert Froment took computer classes
with Elkins at Loggers' Run Middle School. He described him as a
big man with a gray beard who largely kept to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be really down to do what he did,'' Froment said.

   TIMOR-RDP (Dili, Indonesia) _ Conceding that Indonesian forces
have been unable to control the violence in East Timor, President
B.J. Habibie capitulates to international pressure and invites the

</P>
<P>
   TIMOR-REFUGEES (Kupang, Indonesia) _ As the refugees huddle in
makeshift camps here, militia men roam the grounds menacingly. They
harass aid workers and journalists who try to visit the camps. And
they search for refugees who they believe voted for independence
for East Timor in the recent referendum. The situation in Kupang,
the capital of West Timor, is not as desperate as in East Timor,
where anti-independence gangs have killed thousands and destroyed
the capital, Dili. But the fear here is pervasive and paralyzing.
In visits to two large refugee camps on Sunday, it appeared that

phenomenal media attention that has followed, it finds its real

   POWER-FAILURES (Chicago) _ Over and over again this summer, the
lights went out in this muscular, make-it-work city. Cities around
the country have faced similar frustrations during this sweltering

power cable short-circuited, leaving 200,000 homes in the
Washington Heights area powerless for 18 hours, the worst blackout
to hit the City in 22 years. Although the reasons behind the power
failures vary from place to place, they hint at deep-seated
problems at the nation's largest electric power companies.
Utilities that are now the lifeblood of the electronic age are
grappling with deregulation, an aging and long-neglected

at that transaction as an excellent asset match for the companies

NBC STICKS TO SOLO STRATEGY AS ITS MEDIA RIVALS CONSOLIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the wake of Viacom's multimillion-dollar betrothal to CBS,
the media spotlight has swung around to NBC, the last network unwed
to a movie studio and left to stand alone on the crowded,
vertically integrated television dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   But as one executive close to NBC and familiar with its
long-term strategy put it last week: ``Don't cry for NBC. NBC is
not some wallflower that has been left at the altar. NBC is in a
whole different church.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because NBC already has a big, rich parent: General
Electric Co. Far from being jealous of the deal that CBS cut with
Viacom, NBC executives said they looked at that transaction as an
excellent asset match for the companies involved _ but something of
an irrelevance for themselves, because it was simply not a deal
that NBC could ever have made.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, as a unit of GE, still functions on an earnings-per-share
philosophy. The Viacom-CBS deal, like most other big media mergers,
involved the melding of two companies that measure their progress
not on the basis of actual profits but according to a cash-flow
concept known as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or EBITDA (which financiers pronounce EE-bih-da).
</P>
<P>
   For media companies, which tend to subscribe to the philosophy
of spending money in order to make money and are not shy about
borrowing to do so, EBITDA is a generally accepted way to keep
score from financial quarter to financial quarter. The assumption,
loosely put, is that the only payoff that matters is a big one
somewhere in the future. But GE, an industrial powerhouse from the
old school of bookkeeping, aims to make money for its shareholders
each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   So every deal that NBC has considered in the past decade has
been deeply influenced by its status as a GE unit. And no deal that
might dilute earnings could be contemplated. That has meant NBC's
passing up a number of properties it would have liked to acquire,
including the Family Channel, a cable network that NBC coveted as a
potential new distribution outlet for entertainment programs but
that, instead, was snatched up by Fox's owner, News Corp., for $1.9
billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC is very near to closing a deal that, while of much
smaller scale than the Viacom-CBS deal, is of high strategic value
for the network. This week, barring an unforeseen last-minute snag,
NBC should conclude negotiations with Paxson Communications Corp.
to spend just over $400 million for a 32 percent interest in that
company's Paxnet network, a lineup of 73 television stations that
reach about 75 percent of the nation's viewers. The deal is not
expected to dilute NBC's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Viacom-CBS deal, NBC executives, while
declining to discuss their strategy on the record, said they did
not feel pressured by the way the other networks have now all
aligned themselves with big partners that own film studios capable
of producing television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, they say, do they feel hamstrung by GE's insistence on
earnings protection. ``We know the EBITDA game is not the game we
play,'' a senior NBC executive said. ``It forces us to be more
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   So NBC is sticking to the strategy it has long had in place.
That includes adding to its portfolio of Internet holdings and
distribution outlets for its television programming and,
potentially, creating a spin-off company that would combine all
those assets into a separate company with publicly traded shares of
NBC stock.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, NBC could become an EBITDA-based company _
perhaps with GE still holding a major stake, but off the
corporation's earnings-dependent balance sheet. Then NBC would be
free to ``bulk up'' as one senior executive put it, in a deal with
a studio or a large Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of such a move is still uncertain. But speculation
has centered on an NBC spinoff taking place sometime before the end
of 2000, when GE's chairman, John F. Welch Jr., reaches the
mandatory retirement age of 65. One senior NBC executive said of
the spinoff talk: ``It gets a lot of consideration. But it's not in
the cards in the near term.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An NBC spinoff would undoubtedly be a very attractive initial
public offering, several Wall Street analysts said. NBC remains the
most profitable broadcast network by far and its cable offerings,
especially CNBC, are also powerful earnings generators.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NBC earns so much _ more than $500 million a year, by
some estimates _ that it has become an asset of enormous value to
GE, providing about 10 percent of the parent corporation's
earnings, according to an NBC executive. That is one reason why,
executives involved in NBC's strategic planning said, GE is in no
way eager to sell off the company _ despite many years of
persistent rumors that GE would love to unload NBC.
</P>
<P>
   But those healthy broadcast profits do depend on NBC's
maintaining its position as the leading network with young adult
viewers, a serious challenge given the cyclical nature of network
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's pressure on NBC, it is to continue to dominate with
the 18- to 49-year-old viewers,'' Christopher Dixon, a media
analyst with Paine Webber. ``But in the next two years, a rising
tide will lift all boats.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the booming advertising market that has
raised revenues at every network. Dixon noted that NBC, despite
seeing its ratings decline by double-digit percentages in the last
television season, nevertheless showed an increase of about $100
million in advance advertising sales for this fall's season,
compared with last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon agreed that NBC is already so well-positioned _ as the
leader in broadcast media, a force in cable and an active investor
in the Internet _ that it needs to feel no special concern at being
the only network without a link to a big production studio.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the one aspect of the Viacom-CBS combination that
should give NBC pause is the second broadcast stations that CBS
will gain in six of the country's 10 biggest cities if the deal is
approved by the FCC. ``You've got to respond competitively to
that,'' Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Paxson deal would come in. If completed, it
will give NBC more than a second station in six big markets; it
will give the network a full second national distribution outlet
for entertainment programming. NBC has sought such an outlet for
years, looking for a way to re-use entertainment programs it owns,
like the ``Tonight'' show and ``Saturday Night Live,'' and thus
help amortize programming costs.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely believed that NBC opened negotiations with Paxson,
owned by W. Lowell Paxson, following the decision by the FCC last
month to allow companies to own second stations in cities with
multiple television outlets. But in fact, NBC has been chasing
Paxson for more than a year, a senior NBC executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Rogers, president for business development at NBC, spoke
with Paxson several times over the past year and finally won an
exclusive negotiation period to close the deal two weeks ago, this
executive said. That period ends next week. NBC expects to announce
that it has acquired 32 percent of Paxson, with the right to
acquire the rest of the company should the FCC relax restrictions
on the number of stations companies can own nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Even without changes, NBC executives said the Paxson deal would
allow it to add the separate entertainment channel it has long
sought. Unlike Viacom-CBS, which may have to divest itself of an
interest in the UPN network, NBC has no concern about an FCC
regulation that limits network ownership of another network. That
is because Paxnet is not among the six entities that the FCC has
defined as a network.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the station-ownership rules, though, NBC still wants
the FCC to relax the regulations so that it can complete the full
acquisition of Paxson. And on that front, there is one clear
benefit for NBC from last week's marriage announcement by Viacom
and CBS, which have already begun lobbying the agency to change the
rules.

WALL STREET'S LATEST MEDIA WHIZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger C. Altman wants to make a few things clear.
</P>
<P>
   No, he does not consider himself the newest media investment
guru on the block, despite his role in last week's blockbuster
Viacom-CBS deal.
</P>
<P>
   And no, he is not the Altman who was involved in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce scandal in the early 1990s with the late Clark
M. Clifford. (Although he is the Altman who was involved in a
little something called Whitewater.)
</P>
<P>
   And no, he says with the weary sigh of a man who has a
particularly funny last name and has heard the same jokes his whole
life, he is not to be confused with the guy who is married to
Wonder Woman. ``That used to happen all the time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So get this straight: Roger C. Altman is the former deputy
treasury secretary whose boutique investment firm, Evercore
Partners, last week served as a principal adviser to CBS Corp. in
its $37.3 billion merger with Viacom Inc. That is the same Evercore
that became owner of The National Enquirer five months ago and
plans to introduce a revamped Enquirer in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But he is not the man for whom he is often mistaken: Robert A.
Altman, the former BCCI chairman and the husband of Linda Carter,
the actress who played the star-spangled superheroine in the 1970s
action series ``Wonder Woman.'' (He is even occasionally confused
with Robert B. Altman, the film director who made ``MASH'' and
``Cookie's Fortune.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to have a sense of humor about it,'' Roger C.
Altman said in an interview in his office, a typical banker's suite
off Park Avenue that features both expensively panoramic views of
Manhattan and enough modern art to clue visitors that the quarters'
inhabitant is not a single-minded financial wonk.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With last week's Viacom-CBS deal, in which Evercore earned an
estimated $10 million fee as the principal adviser to CBS, Altman
sealed his growing reputation as a politically connected player on
the media merger scene. But he points out that his seeming
overnight success has been a quarter-century in the making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had been in this business less long than I have
been,'' said Altman, who is 53. ``If you go back to the early '80s,
you'll see that I was in charge of investment banking at Lehman
Brothers. I was on the management committee. I was on the board of
directors. It's not like I started my career four years ago. Sure,
our first deal was Westinghouse acquiring CBS, but that was 25
years after I started.''
</P>
<P>
   For many members of the public, though, Altman arrived on the
scene during President Clinton's first term. In 1993, Altman was
seen as a rising star in Washington. But he was forced to resign
his post as deputy treasury secretary in August 1994 under a cloud
of criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. At the time of
the Whitewater hearings, he was criticized by members of the Senate
Banking Committee for delivering what was later determined to be
inaccurate testimony about the extent of communication between the
White House and the Treasury over the Whitewater affair. Five years
later, it is not clear, even to Altman, whether his forced
resignation left a permanent blemish on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know is the honest answer,'' he said. ``We have had
some good fortune recently, but I do not know the answer to that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   It was after he resigned from the Treasury that Altman _
operating out of borrowed space at a friend's law firm, with no
support staff or relationship with any investment bank _ worked his
existing network of connections to become the lead adviser in 1995
to Westinghouse Electric Corp. in its successful bid to acquire
CBS.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he founded Evercore with Austin Beutner and
another partner, and since then has been involved in a half-dozen
transactions for CBS. (There are now three other partners in the
firm.) Other deals have involved Dow Jones, NBC, Court TV,
Tele-Communications, Time Warner and, notably, American Media,
which publishes The National Enquirer. Beutner mainly runs the
firm's investment operations, while Altman mostly doles out advice.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Altman's ties to Westinghouse-cum-CBS can be traced to the
1980s, when he was vice chairman at Blackstone Group, an investment
firm where he worked with Pepsico. Two Pepsico executives, Michael
H. Jordan and Fredric Reynolds, subsequently moved to Westinghouse,
where as chairman, Jordan called on Altman to help engineer the
acquisition of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jordan resigned last year from CBS (the name that
Westinghouse took on), Reynolds, still CBS' chief financial
officer, remained friendly with Altman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they went to Westinghouse, we were able to work with them
in this new capacity,'' Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And fortunately, the relationship encompassed Karmazin more
recently,'' he added, referring to Mel Karmazin, the CBS chief
executive, who is to become president and chief operating officer
of Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Closing the Viacom-CBS deal could take several months as the
Federal Communications Commission vets the terms. The FCC will
examine the overlapping ownership in six cities where CBS and
Viacom both operate television stations; the national market
penetration of the two companies' station holdings, which reach a
total of 41 percent of the population, and Viacom's 50 percent
ownership of another broadcast network, UPN. Unless the FCC alters
or waives its rules, the companies will need to reduce their
station holdings to bring the national penetration to 35 percent or
lower, and Viacom will need to scale back its stake in UPN to less
than one-third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether those issues involve us in any of the steps they might
take, we don't know yet,'' Altman said. ``There are a host of other
tasks, and how many of them we will be involved in I do not know.
Karmazin and Redstone are the main leaders here, not us.'' Sumner
M. Redstone is the chairman of Viacom.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds self-effacing, it is. Altman declines the
opportunity to characterize himself as the newest media investment
gunslinger to ride into town. And he says he has no plans to start
up one of those schmoozy media-kingpin conferences _ like the
investment banker Herbert A. Allen Jr.'s annual conference in Sun
Valley, Idaho _ that Ken Auletta is fond of writing about in The
New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, no, no,'' he said, waving the firm's prospectus under a
reporter's nose. ``These are my clients, and as you can see, some
of them are media companies, but certainly not all of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the list of Evercore clients also includes companies as
varied as Schlumberger, the French nuclear power company Framatome,
General Mills, Kmart and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Altman raised eyebrows when Evercore, which
both advises and acquires companies, purchased American Media Inc.
Altman _ a close friend of the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton
_ suddenly became an owner of The Enquirer, a notorious tabloid
newspaper that regularly splashed Monica Lewinsky's lipsticked
visage across its front pages.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, that newspaper even featured as its cover story
an article alleging that the first lady has had several love
affairs: ``Hillary's cheating dates as far back as the Clintons'
days in Arkansas,'' the story read in part, ``and it continued even
after they moved into the White House.'' And to think that only
five months ago, Mrs. Clinton attended a small private dinner in
her honor at Altman's Upper East Side home.
</P>
<P>
   But Altman is unfazed by any perceived involvement with The
Enquirer, which has spent $50 million on a new advertising campaign
and redesign that will have its debut two weeks from today. Already
underway is a television campaign that features a trim,
authoritative-sounding woman alluding to the tabloid's new
journalistic standards and describing it as the most popular
newspaper in America.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   American Media also publishes other newspapers and magazines
that are off the radar of most of traditional journalism: The
Weekly World News, the weekly tabloid Star and Country Weekly, a
magazine about the country music industry. ``American Media reaches
an audience of 20 million people each week,'' Beutner, who
shepherded the American Media deal, said. ``We think the ability to
deliver interesting content to that large an audience, and deliver
that large an audience to advertisers, and providers of commerce _
whether through direct-response marketing or e-commerce _ is
compelling. And we think the scale of that business can grow
many-fold over the next several years.''
</P>
<P>
   And while smart-alecks at Manhattan cocktail parties may tease
him about the next alien landing, the fact that Altman now owns The
Enquirer seems to have caused no stir in the investment banking
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it is widely known at all in this world,'' said
Robert D. Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International. Hormats served with Altman in Washington during the
Carter administration, when Altman was an assistant treasury
secretary and Hormats was deputy U.S. trade representative.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, meanwhile, sees the properties of American Media _ The
National Enquirer (a current headline: ``Teen Bride Living Happily
Ever after With Prince Charming, 74!''), Star (``Fuming Fans Give
Kathie Lee a Big Thumbs Down: Stop Dressing Like a Slut!''), The
Weekly World News (``Bat Boy Found in Cave'') and Country Weekly
(``Dolly Takes Charge!'') _ as an investment, not a journalistic
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think American Media is a good investment, plain and
simple,'' Altman said. ``We are not sitting there working on each
week's copy. We are not involved in the weekly or monthly or, for
that matter, any editorial decision of any kind. I think if you
went around and asked any number of reasonably well-established
buyout firms, they approach it the same way. It is management's job
to manage the company. We are financial guys, and we do not manage
the companies.''
</P>
<P>
   David J. Pecker, the former chief executive officer of
Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines who is now the chief executive of
American Media, confirmed that _ to his surprise _ Altman had taken
a hands-off approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Austin first called me and started talking about the
National Enquirer deal,'' he said of Beutner, ``my immediate
concern was that The Enquirer and Star were going to continue to be
pretty hard-hitting, and I asked him, `What is Roger Altman going
to say?' Because at the time, Hillary Clinton and Monica were on
the cover almost every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Austin said, `I can guarantee you will never have a call
from him,''' Pecker said. ``And I never have.''

WAS IT THE MET? NO, `JUICE' SET MTV'S RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The combination of Manhattan's Metropolitan Opera
House, Brooklyn's Chris Rock and MTV's high-glitter roster of
performers attracted a huge crowd to Lincoln Center Thursday night
for the annual MTV Video Music Awards show. And the show fared well
around the rest of the country: 8.1 million viewers tuned in,
making it by far the most-watched entertainment program in the
history of cable television.
</P>
<P>
   In the 71 million households that receive MTV, of those that had
TV sets turned on that evening, 18 percent were watching the awards
show. The television audience was 37 percent bigger than last year,
when the Video Music Awards show was held in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being at the Met and having Chris Rock as host gave us an
incredible opportunity to really generate buzz,'' Judy McGrath,
president of MTV, said Friday. Conveniently, last week's issue of
Time magazine crowned Rock ``the funniest man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's also the overall juice of the channel right now,''
Ms. McGrath added. ``We went into it driving almost 40 percent more
audience than we had the same time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   That is in prime time. But MTV's overall ratings keep growing,
too. ``Total Request Live,'' its live afternoon show, has increased
ratings 150 percent in its time period, also aided by some New
York-generated buzz: the crowds of young people who gather in Times
Square to watch through the giant plate-glass windows of MTV's
second-floor studio as the host, Carson Daly, interviews the latest
hot singer or celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Similar throngs milled outside police barriers at Lincoln Center
last week for the Video Music Awards show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to go to the Grammys and all the other award shows,''
Ms. McGrath said. ``But we're the people who are there every day in
the music business. We come in there every day and put `Total
Request Live' on, and the musicians and performers know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of the awards show know they are likely to see some
surprises, too _ anything from a star-spangled breast exposed by
the rapper L'il Kim, to a speech by Adam Horovitz of the Beastie
Boys asking for better security to protect women from assault and
rape at outdoor concerts, to MTV's big coup this year, Paul
McCartney, who joined Madonna in presenting the final award of the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to get that magic mix,'' Ms. McGrath said, ``the
funny, the profane, the sentimental and the smart.''

VIETNAMESE PAPER ANGERS ITS COMPETITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vietnamese-language publishers in Silicon Valley are angry with
The San Jose Mercury News for creating a free Vietnamese weekly
that the publishers say unfairly undermines their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than a dozen catch-as-catch-can Vietnamese
newspapers in San Jose, Calif., and surrounding Santa Clara County,
a region with a large Vietnamese population. And these other
Vietnamese-language publications now say they dread the idea of
competing for advertising revenues with a newspaper owned by Knight
Ridder, a company that had $3.1 billion in revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took over by storm our community,'' said Tam Nguyen, the
managing editor of the twice weekly Saigon USA. ``That's why we
feel resentful. It's a repression, not a service to our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at The Mercury News, however, see little need for
remorse. ``Our commitment here is to serve the whole of this
community today and in the future,'' said Jay Harris, the publisher
of The Mercury News and the free weekly, Viet Mercury. ``We were
looking at a large part of the county that we're not serving. That
conflicts with our journalistic values, but it's also dumb
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury News introduced the Viet Mercury in January, in what
is generally thought to be the first foray of a major U.S. media
company into producing an ethnic newspaper in a language other than
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   About 25,000 copies of Viet Mercury are distributed free each
Friday to 500 restaurants, medical offices, news racks and other
locations with a high level of Vietnamese patronage around Santa
Clara County. The newspaper was introduced after more than two
years of market research showing that 58 percent of ethnic
Vietnamese newspaper readers preferred to get news in their own
language rather than in English. There are about 110,000
Vietnamese-speaking residents in the Silicon Valley area _ perhaps
as many as 200,000 when including the San Francisco Bay area just
north and east of the valley _ the largest concentration of
Vietnamese residents in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Knight Ridder has a history of experimenting with publishing in
foreign languages. (The first newspaper bought by Herman Ridder, in
1892, was New York's German-language Staats-Zeitung.) The company
began a Spanish-language version of The Miami Herald, El Herald, in
1975, and it was revamped and re-introduced as El Nuevo Herald in
1997. And the Mercury News has published a free Spanish-language
weekly newspaper in San Jose, Nuevo Mundo, since 1996. The Mercury
News maintains a news bureau in Hanoi, and the paper has
occasionally run articles translated into Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   The Viet Mercury is a tabloid, with a single article or topic
dominating the front page _ like last week's cover story about
local school districts trying to get Vietnamese parents more
involved in their children's educations. The paper also carries
dispatches from Houston, Southern California, Paris and other
centers of Vietnamese population, as well as stories by The Mercury
News' reporter in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the coverage is related to Vietnamese topics; the
newspaper also ran articles on the war in Kosovo, for example. The
San Jose-based staff of eight covers the local area, and its
stories are sometimes translated for use in the main paper, and
vice versa, said De Tran, Viet Mercury's editor, who came to the
United States in 1975 at age 12 and was a reporter for The Mercury
News, then The Los Angeles Times and again for The Mercury News
before taking his current job.
</P>
<P>
   In creating Viet Mercury, Tran said, the newspaper has
introduced American media standards of impartiality and fairness
into a culture that has long supported advocacy journalism.
``Vietnam still operates under the Napoleonic Code of law, the
French legal system,'' he said, alluding to the country's status as
a former French colony. ``That means you are guilty until proven
innocent. A lot of the time, Vietnamese newspapers, when they cover
a story, don't use `alleged,' don't use `suspect.' They say, `This
guy did this; this guy did that.' We use words like `suspects,' or
`allegations.'''
</P>
<P>
   The real issue for Tran's competitors is their accusation that
the Viet Mercury is offering cheap advertising in an effort to
drive them out of the market. Executives at one newspaper, Gia
Dinh, estimated the Viet Mercury's operating costs at $300 per
page, while another publisher said Viet Mercury was offering
introductory $45 rates for half-page advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris, Viet Mercury's publisher, while declining to reveal
the paper's advertising rates, said its prices had been higher than
most of the competitors' rates _ even before a recent increase in
Viet Mercury's rates, which he said were now the highest in the
market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are other sources of resentment. Some of the other
publishers, as well as some readers, take exception to the Viet
Mercury's use of Ho Chi Minh City in referring to Vietnam's
capital, rather than Saigon, as it was known before Communists
seized power in the former South Vietnam in 1975. Many Vietnamese
who fled Communist rule still refuse to use the city's new name.
</P>
<P>
   And feelings within the Vietnamese-language publications were
not soothed by Tran's comments in an interview with the trade
magazine Editor and Publisher last year, in which he said
Vietnamese newspapers ``steal stuff'' to fill their pages. And many
are still stinging from a letter Harris sent to other Vietnamese
publishers that remarked on a large number of copies of Viet
Mercury that he said were being stolen from news racks _ a letter
the publishers construed as an accusation of sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   But Tran said the reception from readers had been good. And
Harris said that while Viet Mercury had not been expected to turn a
profit until several years into its operation, the number of pages
already far exceeds what had been forecast. The Sept. 3 issue, for
example, was 176 pages _ about 80 percent of it advertising. The
original business plan had projected issues of only 48 pages by
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of their presence in our community, I think it brings
to the people another way to run a newspaper,'' said Thuan Nguyen,
the president of the San Jose Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. ``It
forced the Vietnamese-owned newspapers to find ways to improve
their product.''

MICROWORKZ TRIES TO PUT $299 PC BEHIND IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago, Richard Latman was riding the wave of instant
Internet fame. His Seattle-based start-up, Microworkz, had just
announced a personal computer priced at $299, including a year of
Internet service and bundled software.
</P>
<P>
   The Microworkz Web site was quickly overwhelmed by people making
inquiries or placing orders for the machine, which was called the
Webzter Jr. Within weeks, the company had taken orders for
thousands of systems, and Latman told eager buyers he could deliver
100,000 units in the first round of shipments.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement struck such a clear chord with consumers that
other start-ups quickly offered their own free or nearly free PCs
combined with Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts and competitors said the Microworkz offer
sounded too good to be true. And in hindsight, it was.
</P>
<P>
   Since announcing the Webzter Jr., the company has been accused
of bad management, shabby service and failure to deliver machines
that had been paid for. Earthlink Networks, the Internet service
that was a key component of the Webzter Jr. deal, terminated its
agreement this summer and filed a lawsuit accusing Microworkz of
breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz eventually killed the Webzter Jr., and Latman
announced last month that he was stepping down as president. The
company has hired an interim chief operating officer and is
conducting a search for a president.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Business Bureau of Western Washington and Oregon has
received dozens of complaints about the company's failure to
deliver orders within 30 days, and Latman says that both the
attorney general's office in Washington state and the Federal Trade
Commission are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Latman, whose career has included stints as a bond trader and
owner of a small bridal business that failed, attributes his
company's troubles to the surprising demand, unseasoned management
and Earthlink. ``We're just a small company with a great idea that
got burned and is trying to rebuild itself,'' Latman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Latman, who remains the Microworkz chief executive, also
acknowledges that he blundered by charging credit cards long before
orders could be filled. ``We were in violation of the FTC's 30-day
rule, which we didn't even know about _ that's how novice we
were,'' he said. To make matters worse, Latman says, several
employees stole from Microworkz by crediting their personal credit
cards rather than the customers' cards.
</P>
<P>
   But he insists his company can refocus on the new product he
hopes will save it: the iToaster, a $199 Internet device that uses
a pared down version of the Be operating system. The company began
taking ``reservations'' for iToasters in mid-July, but did not
start charging credit cards until the week before the product began
shipping in very limited quantities on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Latman says, Microworkz is filling orders within a few
weeks, though the company is about to switch from direct sales on
the Web to retail warehouse chains.
</P>
<P>
   For Internet access, the company signed a deal last month with
AT&AMP;T Global Networks valued at $300 million to provide a service
subsidized by on-screen advertising. An AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, Janet
Wyles, said it was a simple pay-for-service deal, adding, ``AT&AMP;T
has a contract and we expect to be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Latman acknowledges that it will be some time before the company
is able to untangle Webzter Jr. orders, the value of which he
declined to reveal. Meanwhile, his staff has shrunk from nearly 200
earlier this year to 65, though Latman says much of that is because
of the outsourcing of iToaster manufacturing.

BRIDGING TWO WORLDS TO MAKE DOWNLOADABLE MUSIC PROFITABLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Internet startup company plans to introduce a
new Web site on Monday that is designed to bridge the competing
worlds of online digital music and the traditional recording
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Garageband.com will focus on the thousands of small and
struggling musicians and groups in the United States. Many have
found it impossible to sign with a major recording studio but have
also discovered that they cannot make a profit by giving their
music away over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by two Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, Tom Zito and Amanda
Lathroum, with Jerry Harrison, a music producer who was a member of
the rock group Talking Heads, the San Francisco-based company says
it hopes to entice undiscovered musical groups with the promise of
recording contracts and distribution agreements.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it plans the use digital audience polling as a
way to improve the company's odds for releasing commercially
successful CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Garageband.com is taking a new approach to the Internet MP3
phenomenon, which has frightened the nation's $13.5 billion
recording industry with the specter of mass distribution of pirated
music over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is an Internet standard for the digital distribution of
music, and in the last two years it has spawned an explosion of Web
sites, including MP3.com, Shoutcast.com and Broadcast.com, offering
Web surfers access to music via their personal computers. But these
sites do not offer pirated copies of commercial recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they aggregate the works of musicians who produce their
own recordings and offer their music for free to anyone who cares
to download the MP3 files. And while some musicians use the sites
to promote their CDs, the vast majority do not have contracts with
record labels.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the interest and controversy the MP3 standard has
created, it has yet to generate a viable business model for
sustaining small and innovative musical groups, said Zito,
Garageband.com's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MP3 advocates say record companies are toast,'' Zito said.
``We believe record companies know a tremendous amount about
marketing and promotion and getting music into the hands of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he argued, the value of all music downloaded over the
Internet last year was less than $1 million, suggesting that a
viable Internet music economy is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the exact shape of such an economy is still being
determined as the recording industry and consumer electronics
manufacturers struggle to agree on a format that will protect
copyrighted music without alienating consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet offers recording artists the ability to reach
fans directly in a way that has never been possible,'' said Roger
McNamee, a managing director of Integral Capital Partners in Menlo
Park, Calif. ``Garageband has an interesting spin if they can
figure out a way to scale it without becoming just like the record
companies.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the new company was formed last year when Zito
visited Harrison's home and saw a large pile of demo recordings
sitting on his floor. They had been sent by aspiring music groups
hoping that he would help them produce a CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `Is there anything good there?' Harrison
recalled. ``I responded, `How would I ever know? I will never have
time to listen to even a fraction of them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zito approached Ms. Lathroum, who was then an executive and
market researcher at the Netscape Communications Corp., and asked
if it would be possible to use the Internet to create an effective
audience rating system for music.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting Web service will permit musicians to upload
recordings that will be rated by music enthusiasts on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By next year, Garageband.com plans to begin awarding a recording
contract for the most popular music each month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that this is an Internet version of Dick Clark's
``American Bandstand,'' but I'm pretty sure few people on the Net
are old enough to remember American Bandstand,'' Zito said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Garageband.com is hoping to attract listeners who are willing to
sample unknown recording artists by offering prizes like backstage
passes to concerts and visits to recording studios.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis will be on the people who make the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating an online community by musicians for
musicians,'' said Zito. ``Obviously, we believe the fans will come
where the musicians are, because that's where they'll hear the best
music.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only about 600 of the 30,000 CDs published each year
are profitable, Zito said. The promise of Garageband, he said is
that by employing sound statistical techniques he hopes to get a
reliable indicator of which recordings will be popular _ and
profitable.

FILMS, PARTIES AND HIGH HOPES IN TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A crimson tapestry of rosebuds, flaring red from
spotlights hidden in the gloom, silhouetted the chattering crowd of
publicists, journalists, filmmakers and actors, or ``talent'' as
they are called, as in ``Has the talent arrived yet?'' or ``Where
do we stand to see the talent?'' Waiters snaked their way through
the room carrying trays of citrusy cocktails on which rose petals
floated.
</P>
<P>
   This midnight post-gala party, thrown by Dreamworks at Monsoon,
an aggressively chic downtown restaurant here, was to celebrate
``American Beauty,'' a scabrous comedy about tormented suburbanites
that has emerged as an early favorite at the 24th Toronto
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at a more cavernous nightspot called the Courtroom,
Disney was giving an even bigger party to celebrate Lawrence
Kasdan's new ensemble comedy, ``Mumford,'' about a seemingly
guileless small-town psychologist, which was also well received at
the festival. A band played upstairs, a second group performed in a
small room near the front door, and waiters carried platters of
sushi, pizza and shrimp tempura through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day Toronto festival, which opened on Thursday night with
the world premiere of an Atom Egoyan film, ``Felicia's Journey,''
will present 319 films, including 64 world premieres and 107 North
American premieres, before closing on Saturday with ``Onegin,'' the
director Martha Fiennes' adaptation of Pushkin's epic poem,
starring her brother Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto has emerged in the last decade, and especially over the
last five years, as among the most important and popular stops on
the international festival circuit, both as the premiere launching
pad for the Hollywood studios' award-hopeful prestige films and,
increasingly, as a marketplace for smaller films searching for a
distributor or producers of medium-size films peddling
foreign-release rights.
</P>
<P>
   Piers Handling, the festival's director, said he did not
consider this year's event to be all that different from those of
recent years, with its mix of big-studio releases and comparatively
obscure works from every continent. ``Over the past five years the
festival has built up slowly, bit by bit,'' Handling said. ``The
U.S. film industry looks to Toronto in a very serious way, and an
international group comes as Toronto is showing a lot of films with
foreign rights available.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heart of the festival, he said, remains the public
screenings at theaters scattered around the city. A dizzying list
of films is made available to Toronto's appreciative and
sophisticated audience, largely nurtured by the festival. ``What we
are is a very large public festival,'' Handling said. ``Not an
industry confab.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was possible to wander through the lobbies of some of
the city's swanky hotels and spot, say, the Miramax co-chairman
Harvey Weinstein chatting happily at one end of the room while the
actor Ethan Hawke was the center of his own cluster at the other,
and Dick Cook, president of Walt Disney Motion Picture Group, led a
group of executives through the lobby to their waiting cars.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the festival on Tuesday, for instance, have a
choice among 62 programs, including Terence Stamp as a British
tough investigating his daughter's disappearance in ``The Limey,''
from Steven Soderbergh; the Hungarian director Istvan Szabo's new
epic, ``Sunshine''; Woody Allen directing Sean Penn in ``Sweet and
Lowdown,'' about a troubled but trend-setting jazz guitarist; Jim
Jarmusch's ``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai,'' about a Brooklyn
hit man; and films from Spain, Japan, Sweden, Italy, Ecuador, the
Philippines, Jamaica, Germany, Brazil, China, Iran, South Korea,
Argentina, India, Belgium, Mexico, Denmark, Senegal, Yugoslavia and
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Toronto is a wonderful place to launch a film,''
Kasdan said as he relaxed at the post-gala party for his film. He
had brought ``The Big Chill'' to Toronto 16 years ago, he said, and
felt that it might also be the perfect spot to introduce
``Mumford.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The audiences here are very sophisticated, and they're not out
to get you like audiences at some other festivals can be,'' Kasdan
said. ``They're open and appreciative. It's all very Canadian.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Toronto festival is spread across so many theaters
in different parts of town, it has no real central focus, like the
Palais des Festivals in Cannes, and since it takes place in an
already large and humming city like Toronto, it does not seem to
take over the town in the way that the Sundance festival does in
Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   It resembles not so much a single event as a concentrated series
of events, something like a fraternity rush week, with films backed
by the big studios or the major independents rolling into town for
their two or three days in the spotlight. A series of screenings,
some open to the public and some only for press and industry types,
is followed by a couple of days of print and television interviews
in hotel suites and fancy restaurants, perhaps a big gala at the
cavernous Roy Thomson Hall downtown and the post-gala party at some
nearby nightspot, festooned with red carpets and velvet ropes to
keep the hoi polloi away from the talent and their limousines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ride With the Devil,'' a Civil War epic from the director Ang
Lee with a young cast including Tobey Maguire and the
singer-songwriter Jewel, had its brief window in the spotlight on
Friday and Saturday before handing off to ``American Beauty'' and
``Mumford'' on Saturday and Sunday, soon to be followed by Lasse
Hallstrom's adaptation of the John Irving novel ``Cider House
Rules'' (with Maguire, again) and Scott Hicks' adaptation of ``Snow
Falling on Cedars'' with Hawke on Sunday and Monday, to be followed
later in the week by Robin Williams in the Holocaust drama ``Jakob
the Liar,'' Meryl Streep in Wes Craven's ``Music of the Heart,''
Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman in Wayne Wang's adaptation of
the Mona Simpson novel ``Anywhere but Here'' and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Each will gets its hours in the spotlight, its round of
interviews, its gala night.
</P>
<P>
   And all around it, films not chosen for the high-profile galas
but still backed by important studios and distributors will jostle
for their share of the attention. Everyone will be looking for the
unknown, breakout hit, and distributors will hope to unearth,
somewhere in the tangle, next year's ``Blair Witch Project''
waiting to be bought for a song.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the dense, noisy gloom of the ``American Beauty'' party, the
arrival of the stars was announced by the eruption of television
lights near the doorway and the slow, snaking progression through
the crowd to the tables in the back reserved for the talent, the
filmmakers and the studio executives. All others stand and scream
into one another's ears while sneaking glances from side to side.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey smiled and waved and hugged his way across the
room. Chris Cooper, his eyes downcast and gloomy, pushed his way
through, pausing only to acknowledge a handshake of congratulations
from the crowd, his face suddenly erupting into a sweet smile. Only
Annette Bening was absent, on the advice of her doctor, publicists
said, as she is pregnant with her fourth child with her husband,
Warren Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Bentley, a young actor with startling blue eyes capped by
pitch-black eyebrows, who has a juicy role in the film as Spacey's
next-door neighbor, looked almost dazed by all the attention as he
made his way to his seat.
</P>
<P>
   He really had not had a chance to get out in the city at all or
see any other films or take part in any festival activities beyond
promoting ``American Beauty'' and attending its premiere. He has
been a happy prisoner of the marketing monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like fun, though,'' he said.

WASHINGTON POST'S OPINION PAGE; CARTOONING BY THE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge from his most recent books, Fred Hiatt, soon to be
editorial page editor of The Washington Post, has some strongly
held policy views: Anyone with access to 100 lollipops ought to
share them, and baby talk, used judiciously, can be an effective
means of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But trying to intuit the future direction of The Post's
editorial pages from the deconstruction of the children's books
``Baby Talk'' (Margaret K. McElderry, 1999) and ``If I Were Queen
of the World'' (McElderry, 1997) probably has limited utility _
though the analysis may help understand Hiatt's views on his three
children.
</P>
<P>
   More relevant to the public debate, probably, are the 1,500 or
more columns and articles Hiatt, 44, has written in 18 years at The
Post as a state reporter (Virginia); Pentagon correspondent;
foreign correspondent (Tokyo and Moscow) and editorial writer _
work that displays a nuanced approach to issues.
</P>
<P>
   The heir to the pages shaped over 25 years by the trenchant and
irreverent intelligence of the late Meg Greenfield knows he will be
a czar of pundits just as readers show signs of pundititis. In this
divisive din, the editorial pages are ``where you can make a lot of
the connections that a general-subject newspaper should,'' Hiatt
said last week, after being named to the post he will assume in the
next few months.
</P>
<P>
   If, he said, cable TV programs and Internet sites ``are
fracturing the issues as well as the audience, ideally our page can
be a place where they can come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenfield and her deputy and immediate successor, Stephen
S. Rosenfeld, produced a page with often-progressive editorials
facing often-conservative columns, but The Post's views have been
hard to generalize. On some issues it takes predictable stands: for
gun control, campaign finance reform and abortion rights. But it
also allows that school vouchers may do some good for some children
_ a view associated with the political right.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes may occur will happen gradually, Hiatt said,
but he is looking for new thoughts and voices. The chance to speak
to The Post's 809,000 readers is, after all, better than 100
lollipops. And Hiatt is all for sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A Cartoonist's Drawing That Drew Questions
</P>
<P>
   The article in The Indianapolis Star on Wednesday focused on a
curious local practice: passing the proceeds of a political
fundraiser in honor of one candidate immediately to another.
</P>
<P>
   But some reporters at The Star, owned by Central Newspapers
Inc., noticed the mention that The Star's cartoonist, Gary Varvel,
had illustrated invitations to the fundraiser, a $250-a-head
birthday party for the Marion County prosecutor Scott Newman. Most
proceeds will go to Sue Anne Gilroy, a Republican candidate for
mayor of Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters questioned Varvel's involvement in a letter to
their editors.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's publisher, Dale Duncan, said Friday that he had met
with Varvel's boss, the editorial page editor John H. Lyst, that
morning. ``We're in agreement that it's inappropriate for him to do
some of the things he has been doing,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``You just don't want to be that closely tied into
people or organizations that are routinely covered by the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of the Star staff were not unique. Douglas C.
Clifton, editor of The Cleveland Plain Dealer, said: ``The rules of
cartoonists should be the same as the rules for the political
writer. Would you allow our political writer to write advertising
content for a political candidate? I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying he made ``a stupid mistake,'' Varvel said he thought the
sketch was for a birthday party, not a political event. ``My
instincts were down,'' he said. ``I don't make a habit of trying to
get people elected.''

INTERLOCKING BRICKS BUILD ON THE IDEA BEHIND LEGOS; NEW INDUCTEES
IN INVENTORS HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ohio)  (rm) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if building a real house were as easy as snapping together
Legos, those brightly colored plastic bricks that kids use to build
miniature structures?
</P>
<P>
   This is a thought that occurred to Dominic Cerrato, a school
administrator, while he was trying to construct a barn on his farm
in Bloomingdale, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty good at electrical wiring and carpentry, but I
didn't know a thing about masonry,'' Cerrato said. ``I started to
wonder why someone hadn't invented some kind of interlocking wall
system.'' He decided to invent his own interlocking blocks, and he
recently received a patent for what he says is the first truly
mortarless brick.
</P>
<P>
   Cerrato's blocks lock together, just as Lego bricks do. However,
the locking system is different. A standard-size Lego brick has
eight cylinder-like protrusions on the top, while the bottom is
hollowed out so that another block's protrusions can snap in
underneath. Cerrato's blocks rely on a tongue-and-groove
construction similar to that used by carpenters. The blocks slide,
rather than snap, onto each other. Cerrato's bricks are stacked
onto a metal track that has been bolted into a concrete footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build real structures without being an expert mason.''
Cerrato said. ``With this if you make a mistake, you can just pull
it apart. It's goof-proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerrato acknowledged that perhaps a half dozen companies already
manufacture interlocking blocks. ``But they are hollow blocks,'' he
said. ``While in fact they dry-stack their blocks, you have to go
back and pour the mortar back down inside.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Cerrato's blocks have no mortar, what prevents them from
toppling over like some Lego tower built by an overly ambitious
7-year-old?
</P>
<P>
   At the wall corners, post-tension steel rods are placed at the
bottom and top to help lock the blocks in place. In addition, each
of Cerrato's blocks has two vertical holes that go all the way
through the brick. When the bricks are stacked, the holes line up
with each other all the way through the wall. Once a wall is built,
steel pins are dropped down the holes, and these pins give the wall
its strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can slide them down from the top, because all the holes
will line up,'' he said. ``More rods, thicker rods make for less
movement in the walls. Fewer rods, smaller rods make for greater
fluidity in the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer modeling experiments suggest that this fluidity will
make the blocks better able than traditional brick and mortar to
withstand earthquakes, according to Cerrato. ``As the wall begins
to flex slightly, Those pins act as internal backbones,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this gain in flexibility means a loss in building height.
Cerrato acknowledges that his blocks are good for a structure no
higher than two stories.
</P>
<P>
   And don't look to Cerrato's blocks for a traditional brick
facade. These are, after all, essentially cinder blocks. But
Cerrato hastens to point out that they can be aesthetically
appealing cinder blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can change the color very easily by putting in different
resins,'' he said. ``We can give it a rough texture or put in bands
or other architectural details.'' The blocks are at
www.cercorp.com.
</P>
<P>
   Cerrato, who received patent 5,899,040, hopes to license his
patent. &QL;

DEBATE ON INTERNET TAXES TAKES POLITICAL TURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics and business appear headed for a clash when an elite
group of high-technology and government leaders appointed by
Congress to draft sales tax policies for the Internet meets in New
York this week.
</P>
<P>
   At their first meeting this summer, in Williamsburg, Va., most
in the group, the 19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce, seemed to agree that Internet sales should be subject to
the same taxes levied on sales in the physical world. The key
question, they said, was how to devise a more uniform tax rate or a
system that would make it easy for companies, whether big or small,
to collect the taxes levied by more than 30,000 state and local
jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's chairman, Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, a
Republican with an aggressive antitax agenda, says he is not
convinced Internet sales should be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   That view has triggered suspicions among some business members
that their colleagues from the political arena may be inclined to
stifle any solution that could be construed as a new tax levy.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to a high-technology representative on the commission,
who asked not to be identified, said a workable solution was being
circulated that called for businesses to collect sales taxes on
Internet commerce if state and local governments agree to adopt a
single tax rate for each state or commit to new technologies in the
form of free, easy-to-use software to enable companies to calculate
any tax rate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the commission members, plain as day, can see a deal
right in front of them,'' said the aide. ``But the commission staff
is pushing it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore denies trying to stifle debate on any proposal and says
he simply wants to insure that all sides get a fair hearing,
including whether sales taxes even have a place on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some folks who are in the commission and around the
commission who do not believe that this is the issue,'' Gilmore
said. ``They assume already that taxes should apply to the Internet
and electronic commerce, and they do not believe any discussion
ought to be held about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission was created last year as part of federal
legislation imposing a three-year moratorium on any new state or
local taxes on Internet access or sales.
</P>
<P>
   Composed of eight business representatives, eight politicians
from state and local governments and three members of the Clinton
administration, the panel was supposed to begin work in December.
But that was delayed when groups representing state, county and
city governments _ concerned about losing the tax revenues that pay
for many crucial operations _ complained that congressional leaders
had appointed too many business representatives. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adjustments were made, and those same state and local groups
expressed pleasant surprise when many of the key business members
sided with them at the commission's first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&AMP;T;
Theodore Waitt, chairman and chief executive of Gateway, and David
Pottruck, president of Charles Schwab, voiced support for taxing
Internet commerce as long as a new, simpler and equitable system
could be devised.
</P>
<P>
   Although state and local governments the last four decades have
been unable to agree on a simple way to collect sales taxes from
mail-order companies, some are optimistic that the threat of losing
huge revenue opportunities from taxes on Internet sales might
inspire a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the present system is a mess and needs to be
addressed through simplicity and uniformity,'' said Neal Osten,
director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Commerce
and Communications Committee. ``We need to make it easier for
companies to comply.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also contains strong tax opponents, however, like
Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, who has
proposed using the insurgence of the Internet as an opportunity to
get rid of sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the commission can reach a consensus and draft a
comprehensive proposal for Congress by next year, Gilmore says that
at least it can clearly define the issues for Congress. In addition
to sales tax, the group is expected to study international tax
issues on the Internet and taxes on Internet access. He said the
group hoped to have a final report to lawmakers next spring.

HABIBIE INVITES U.N. PEACEKEEPERS TO EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Conceding that Indonesian forces had been
unable to control the continuing violence in East Timor, President
B.J. Habibie on Sunday capitulated to international pressure and
invited the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to the
troubled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have lost their lives since the beginning of
the unrest, lost their homes and security,'' he said in a televised
address. ``We cannot wait any longer. We have to stop the suffering
and mourning immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an international force would have to work hand in hand
with Indonesian troops, who appear divided over whether to enforce
or undermine their government's policy of allowing East Timor to
choose independence.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement is potentially risky for him, and may
ruin his chances of hanging onto his office once a long electoral
process concludes in November. But his statement drew praise _ and
some caution until the details are known _ from international
leaders, who have expressed horror at the campaign of terror and
killings since the former Portuguese colony voted on Aug. 30 to
separate from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great step forward for the people of East Timor,
because it's their welfare, their future, their safety, their
freedom that this will be all about,'' said Prime Minister John
Howard of Australia, who has been one of the foreign leaders most
insistent on intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister John Moore of Australia, which is spearheading
a potential force, said it might take three to five days to deploy
once the United Nations and Indonesia worked out details of its
mission and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was flying to New York
to discuss these details with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Indonesian military fully supports the foreign presence,
Moore said, a force of about 7,000 foreign troops would be
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. national security adviser Sandy Berger said the United
States would contribute only ``a limited number'' of troops in a
supporting role for an undetermined period. Speaking to reporters
in Auckland, New Zealand, where President Clinton is attending an
economic summit, he said, ``This could be a limited United States
participation in a fundamentally Asian force.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand have all said
they are ready to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement was greeted with ``absolute jubilation''
among the 1,000 refugees who have camped inside the besieged U.N.
compound in Dili, the East Timorese capital, said a British
journalist, Marie Colvin, who is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see it as their salvation,'' she said. ``Nobody can stop
smiling. They feel like they were under a death sentence for 10
days and that they are now going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement on Sunday was a humiliating reversal of
Indonesia's long-time insistence that as a sovereign nation it
would not accept a foreign military presence.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie is running for re-election in a parliamentary vote in
November but is coming under harsh attack here for allowing the
potential loss of what Indonesians consider their 27th province _
although the world has never recognized its 1975 invasion and
annexation of a territory abandoned by its colonial Portuguese
rulers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Habibie's ability to enforce his policies or
command his military are reinforcing a widespread perception that
he is an ineffectual leader. The introduction of foreign troops
onto Indonesian soil is certain to intensify the nationalist
backlash that has already begun here. Many in the military see this
as the most humiliating moment in their history.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie made his announcement Sunday in both Indonesian and
English. The Indonesian version of his remarks included language
that seemed intended to soften the blow to national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided to invite the international peacekeeping force
in order to assist us _ together with the Indonesian military, in a
cooperative manner _ to restore security to the troubled
province,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unchecked violence in East Timor has also raised questions
about insubordination in the military and about the ability of the
armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, to enforce the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   The president's announcement came one day after Wiranto visited
East Timor and implied that he had lost control of some of his
troops there who he said are emotionally committed to retaining
East Timor, where they have fought against separatist guerrillas
for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   A military policy of arming local militias to try to influence
or derail the vote through intimidation may have taken on a life of
its own. The introduction last week of five new battalions of
Indonesian troops and a declaration of martial law in the territory
seemed to have little effect in calming the violence, although Dili
was quiet when a top U.N. delegation visited on Saturday. That
suggested to some of the visitors that the military had the power
to turn the violence off and on at will.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie alluded to the military's situation in East Timor when
he said: ``The Indonesian defense forces tried to stabilize the
situation in East Timor since the declaration of martial law on
September 7. At the same time, they had to recognize that there are
limits to what more they would achieve. They have done their utmost
in a very complex and complicated situation under very difficult
psychological constraints.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Reports continued to emerge on Sunday of a brutal campaign of
killings, arson and forced relocation of thousands of people by the
militias in East Timor, a remote territory that had a population of
800,000 before the current violence began.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the killings seemed to be aimed at eliminating the
territory's educated class and its social leaders. Priests and nuns
in this largely Roman Catholic territory have become targets. So
have students and other young men, according to refugees and aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign monitoring group said that on Thursday, militia
members aboard the ferry Dobon Solo that was traveling from Dili
systematically searched out, killed and dumped into the sea 35
young men, most of them students, who were aboard. It said the
report came from a young man who hid in a box and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups and human rights workers said the greatest emerging
danger to the people of East Timor was now starvation, which was
also the chief cause of the death of some 200,000 people during
Indonesia's years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people have fled into East Timor's barren
mountains. One of the main tasks of an international force would be
to secure supply lines to feed and save these refugees, who remain
under threat _ and periodic attack _ from the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie spoke on Sunday after holding emergency meetings with
military commanders and his Cabinet and informing Annan by
telephone of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under a transition process envisioned in the U.N. plan _ agreed
to by Indonesia and Portugal in May _ the United Nations would take
over administration and security in East Timor once the Indonesian
Parliament ratifies its independence at a session later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's announcement accelerates the plan for the deployment of
U.N. security forces and appears to amount to a de facto
recognition of the vote for independence _ an unambiguous result of
78.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though East Timor is different from the rest of the country in
having a Portuguese, rather than Dutch, colonial background and in
having been annexed 30 years after Indonesia became an independent
nation, the possibility of its separation is a direct blow to
Indonesia's still tenuous sense of nationhood. It increases
concerns about separatist movements in other provinces,
particularly Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's Indonesian-language text repeatedly addressed these
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that he was not acting unilaterally but was
consulting other branches of government; he portrayed his policy in
East Timor as part of his effort to bring greater democracy,
legality and stability to Indonesia and he voiced confidence in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the military has undertaken its best
efforts to resolve an extremely difficult and complicated situation
without abandoning its responsibility for the unity and security of
the whole country,'' he said.

SCHROEDER'S POWER ERODES FURTHER AS PARTY SUFFERS DEFEATS IN STATE
VOTES
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The political plight of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
intensified Sunday as his Social Democratic Party was thrown out of
government in the eastern state of Thuringia and suffered severe
setbacks in the Ruhr, Germany's industrial heartland.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary plunge in support for Schroeder, who swept to
power a year ago, was most eloquently symbolized by his party's
failure to win municipal elections in Dortmund. The city is so tied
to the labor movement that it was called ``the capital of the
Social Democratic Party'' by former Chancellor Willy Brandt.
</P>
<P>
   Coming after defeats in the Saarland and in Brandenburg a week
ago, the results Sunday amounted to an unmistakable message that
Schroeder has squandered his wide popularity through what seems to
be a mixture of unfortunate hesitations, unconvincing policy and
serious errors of style.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that the chancellor's repeated appearances
in luxury Brioni suits, his penchant for fat Cuban cigars and his
much-publicized August-long vacation in the Italian resort of
Positano have not helped at a time when he is arguing for austerity
as a bitter, but necessary, pill for a state-heavy German economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have a series of party scandals in cities that include
Cologne and Dortmund _ involving insider-trading, tax-fraud and
prostitution _ helped the Social Democrats at a time when they
appear unsure of their message.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is trying to modernize his party with a Tony
Blair-type message of entrepreneurship and personal responsibility,
while struggling to retain traditional Social Democratic support
among state employees and workers. But he has been unable to secure
wide backing and appears to have lost votes in the center and on
the left.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been able to keep his electoral promise to cut
unemployment, still running at over 10 percent nationwide and over
20 percent in many parts of the former East Germany. The powerful
German economy is stalled.
</P>
<P>
   In Thuringia, projections by state television networks based on
preliminary returns indicated that the Christian Democrats were
gaining about 8 percent to take a clear majority, with 50.4 percent
of the vote. As a result, the Christian Democrat state premier,
Bernhard Vogel, will no longer have to govern in a coalition with
Schroeder's party.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats' vote appeared to plunge about 10
percentage points, to 19.7 percent _ less even than the Party of
Democratic Socialism, the former East German Communists, which the
projections indicated took 21.4 percent, 5 percentage points higher
than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   These projected results suggested that the Party of Democratic
Socialism is consolidating itself as the party of preference for
left-of-center Germans from the former East who are disillusioned
with a decade of German unity.
</P>
<P>
   If this proves to be the case, Schroeder's party could be
confronted with serious difficulties in finding the votes it needs
in the east to win national elections. It has apparently not come
up with a successful strategy for dealing with the former
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a link in state government and the upper house of
parliament, the defeat in Thuringia further erodes Schroeder's
support in the upper house, or Bundesrat, where he will now have to
negotiate with the Christian Democrats on legislation, including a
bitterly contested budget calling for spending cuts of about $16
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In municipal elections in Dortmund, where the Social Democrats
had won about 60 percent of the vote in every local election since
1952, the Christian Democratic candidate, Volker Geers, took 45.6
percent of the vote, the projections indicated, 3 percentage points
more than his Social Democratic rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Social Democrats are a spent force in Dortmund,'' Geers
declared, buoyed by widespread disillusionment with high
unemployment and a series of scandals, including one involving the
former Social Democratic mayor, Josef Drabig, who was found in a
car with a prostitute earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Geers still faces a runoff with the Social Democratic
candidate, Gerhard Langemeyer, because a victory with at least 50
percent of the vote is required in such elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democrats apparently lost the city of Cologne by a
crushing margin and seemed to be losing in other major cities of
North Rhine-Westphalia, including Essen and Dusseldorf. The state
is Germany's largest, with 17 million inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schroeder's ``Red-Green'' coalition does not appear to
be in immediate danger, the government now faces an extremely tough
winter. If the chancellor cannot rally support by the time of state
elections in North Rhine-Westphalia next spring, his hold on power
will begin to appear tenuous.

NIGHTMARE STILL NOT OVER FOR EAST TIMOR REFUGEES

   KUPANG, Indonesia _ ``Go away, quick. It's very dangerous here.
Go back to your home,'' said a panic-stricken man, as he pushed
visitors into their car and hurried back to his wooden shelter.
</P>
<P>
   For this man and the other dispossessed people of East Timor,
fleeing their homeland has not been enough to escape a campaign of
terror. Burned out of their houses and hunted down by
machete-wielding gangs, they have fled or been forcibly moved by
the tens of thousands to neighboring West Timor _ only to encounter
fresh danger.
</P>
<P>
   As the refugees huddle in makeshift camps, militia men, wearing
bright red bandannas and black T-shirts, roam the grounds
menacingly. They harass aid workers and journalists who try to
visit the camps. And they search for refugees who they believe
voted for independence for East Timor in the recent referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are caught here, the militias will kill them,'' said
one young man, who sat in a ragged encampment next to a football
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Kupang, the capital of West Timor, is not as
desperate as in East Timor, where anti-independence gangs have
killed thousands and destroyed the capital, Dili. But the fear here
is pervasive and paralyzing.
</P>
<P>
   In visits to two large refugee camps on Sunday, it appeared that
the army and police were unwilling or unable to control the gangs,
which effectively run the camps. Although the Indonesian government
is supplying food and water to the refugees, international relief
agencies are reluctant to send staff there.
</P>
<P>
   West Timor is firmly under Indonesian control, unlike the East,
which was seized by Indonesia in 1975. But for President B.J.
Habibie, who has invited peacekeeping troops to restore order in
East Timor, the presence of anti-independence militias in solidly
Indonesian West Timor is a sign that the political turmoil is
spreading to other parts of this far-flung island nation.
</P>
<P>
   For the nearly 100,000 people who have fled or been forced out
of East Timor, the gangs mean that their nightmare has not ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just unbelievable what they have done to us,'' said Yanto
DaCosta, a hollow-eyed 19-year-old who fled East Timor on Sept. 7
after a militia group set fire to his family's house shortly before
dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Awakened by screams and flames, DaCosta escaped by clambering
out a window. As he ran from the house, he glanced behind him and
saw his father being ordered at gunpoint to leave his car. Because
his father owned a photocopy store whose customers were known to
favor independence, DaCosta feared that his father was killed by
the gangs. The rest of the family also fled, and DaCosta did not
know their fate.
</P>
<P>
   DaCosta remembered the week of East Timor's referendum as a
swirl of ugly images. In the aftermath of the ballot on Aug. 30, in
which the people voted overwhelmingly for independence from
Indonesia, DaCosta said, the anti-independence militias became
enraged. After initially aiming their attacks at pro-independence
people, they began killing and burning indiscriminately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter: old, young, boys, girls _ they killed them
all,'' he said. ``You can't believe how mean they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other refugees interviewed here, DaCosta claimed he would
have preferred East Timor to have elected to remain part of
Indonesia. But he seemed baffled by the anger and destruction that
the vote unleashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the militias lost in the referendum,'' he said,
``they feel they can win if they get to run East Timor by
themselves. If East Timor has to build a new country, they believe
it should be from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees expressed similar shock at the sudden eruption of
anger. Several said they believed the fury was magnified because
the anti-independence factions did not expect to lose the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should face the fact that we lost,'' said a 42-year-old man
who fled Dili with his family on a ship three days ago. As the man
offered his thoughts, an older man shouted at him. The younger man
later said he could be beaten or even killed by gangs for speaking
to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian government estimates that 93,000 people have fled
East Timor since the violence erupted last week. Most have been
forced by troops to board trucks into West Timor, where 55,000 have
ended up in a sprawling camp at Atambua, near the border. Another
22,000 have come to Kupang, a seaside town on the western tip of
Timor, surrounded by scrub brush and desolate hills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the government said 20,000 are trapped on the East
Timorese side of the border, unable to cross or fearful of doing
so. And these numbers do not take into account people who have fled
and are hiding in the hills around Dili.
</P>
<P>
   Several international aid agencies are concerned that the
conditions in the refugee camps could deteriorate rapidly. Some are
in remote areas, barely accessible by trucks. The agencies estimate
that the government's food rations will last only five weeks,
according to an internal report.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report said that anti-independence militia groups in East
Timor ``are heavily involved in interrogating'' refugees in hotels,
houses, the harbor, and other transportation hubs. ``This situation
has created trauma and fear,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that fear is aimed at foreigners who, in the eyes of
anti-independence militias and even some of the refugees, are
responsible for setting in motion the events that led to the
destruction of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians, in particular, are being singled out for
suspicion, in part because Australia has repeatedly offered to take
a leading role in mobilizing a peacekeeping force for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very volatile, so we have to be careful,''
said one aid worker. He said his agency had sent only Indonesian
staff into the camps, after stripping off their armbands.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, militia groups patrolling a large refugee camp
just outside Kupang have attacked visitors from the U.N. Human
Rights Commission, aid groups from Australia and Hong Kong, and a
reporter from the Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Local religious leaders have demanded that the provincial
governor instruct the police and the army to confiscate weapons
from militia members. One leader, Dr. B. Fobia, warned that if the
governor did not act, it would cause a ``small conflict that will
lead to fatal consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   In the camps, the refugees survive by keeping to themselves.
Some try to ward off trouble by advertising their allegiance to a
unified Indonesia. One elderly man wore a T-shirt emblazoned with
the phrase ``Otonomi, Yo,'' which means ``Autonomy, Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's referendum was structured as a vote for or against
autonomy. By voting down the option of autonomy within Indonesia,
the East Timorese declared that they wanted to break off
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the refugees are simply exhausted and scared.
With their homes destroyed, many of their relatives dead, and the
life of their new country seemingly snuffed out before it had
begun, few seemed to care much about the political issues behind
this calamity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody talks about politics here,'' said one man, as he smoked
a cigarette and peered furtively around the corner.

A SUDDEN FRIENDSHIP BLOSSOMS BETWEEN GREECE AND TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Greece _ The day after Athens was struck by its most
serious earthquake in decades, millions of television viewers
watched in awe as Turkish rescue workers pulled a Greek child from
under a pile of rubble. Announcers struggled to control their
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Turks!'' one of them shouted as his voice began to
crack. ``They've got the little boy. They saved him. And now the
Turkish guy is drinking from a bottle of water. It's the same
bottle the Greek rescuers just drank from. This is love. It's so
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Greece and Turkey are both members of NATO, there are
perhaps no two allied neighboring nations whose dealings have been
marked with so much conflict and mistrust. But in the last four
weeks, their relations have improved with a spectacular suddenness
that no one had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Although serious political differences between the two countries
still remain, both sides are now displaying a willingness to
resolve them that they have not shown for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Greek-Turkish relations had been improving slowly for several
months, but it took earthquakes in both countries to push the two
countries toward a more genuine friendship. Each sent rescue teams
to help the other, and their gestures were greeted by waves of
ecstatic publicity and popular emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in the middle of a new phenomenon that you could
call seismic diplomacy or earthquake diplomacy,'' said Nicholas
Burns, the U. S. ambassador to Greece. ``Images that people saw on
TV had tremendous political symbolism, and there's an opportunity
for both sides to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day now passes without a new sign of warmth between
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of August, the commander of the Greek Navy traveled
to Turkey, toured towns devastated by the Aug. 17 earthquake, and
made a moving call for peace at a ceremony marking the retirement
of his Turkish counterpart. While he was there, a Greek naval
vessel called at a Turkish port for the first time in more than a
quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Greek and Turkish business leaders agreed to
revive a cooperation council whose activities were suspended
earlier this year in one of the periodic spats that have poisoned
relations between the two countries. Then, leading Greek and
Turkish news commentators agreed to begin publishing their columns
in each other's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of European foreign ministers in Finland this
month, Greece took the significant step of announcing that it would
no longer block Turkey's application for membership in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, teams of Greek and Turkish diplomats met in Athens
to plan cultural exchanges and discuss cooperation in tourism,
environmental protection, trade and other areas. While they were
meeting, Turks observed the anniversary of their 1922 military
triumph over Greece with a restraint they had never shown before.
</P>
<P>
   Normally the anniversary of the Turkish triumph at Smyrna, now
known as Izmir, is marked by Turkish troops dressed in period
costume who symbolically bayonet actors playing Greek soldiers,
throw others into the sea and lustily tear down and trample a Greek
flag. This year, there was only a muted ceremony limited to a
wreath-laying and playing of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been writing a `Greek-Turkish' piece almost every Sept.
9 for 25 years now,'' columnist Rauf Tamer wrote in the Istanbul
newspaper Sabah. ``I pulled them all out of the archives. I tore
them all up and threw them away. I am now starting a new Sept. 9
series. This is the real starting point, a fresh beginning, the
first step toward the 21st century.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Costis Stephanopoulos of Greece was host of
a reception in honor of Turkish earthquake relief workers, telling
them that Greeks ``will always remember you with profound feelings
of friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greek Embassy in Ankara reported that a Turk had telephoned
and offered to donate one of his kidneys to a Greek earthquake
victim. A Greek had made a similar gesture after the Turkish quake.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Greece and Turkey has not yet evaporated. Each
has recently embarked on a new, hugely expensive military buying
spree that unsettles the other.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has made vague threats against Greek islands in the
Aegean Sea. Cyprus, divided since Turks invaded the north in 1974,
remains partitioned into ethnic Greek and Turkish sections, and the
positions of Cypriot leaders, who are beholden to Athens or Ankara,
remain rigid.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about these problems, Foreign Minister George
Papandreou of Greece replied: ``I don't think that all of a sudden
everything has been solved. But a climate exists that could allow
for a breakthrough on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou's appointment as foreign minister this year was a key
factor leading to the change in climate between Greece and Turkey.
His predecessor, Theodore Pangalos, was a flamboyant figure who
denounced Turks as ``thieves and rapists.'' But he fell from power
in the scandal that followed the capture in February of the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who had been hiding in Kenya under
the protection of Greek diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   That episode stirred many Turks to emotional denunciations of
Greece, and relations seemed to have reached a new low. In
retrospect, it may be seen as a positive turning point because it
led to the emergence of Papandreou, a conciliator who evidently
believes that he has a chance to change the course of his country's
history by ending its enmity with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou shares much with his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem.
Both men are foreign-educated intellectuals who shun demagogic
rhetoric. They speak by telephone every few days. In the past,
Greek and Turkish foreign ministers often went months without
speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their good personal relationship, both Papandreou and
Cem must work within political constraints. Papandreou's party
faces a national election next year, and if he is seen as
surrendering too much to Turkey, political enemies may seek to
portray him as weak and naive.
</P>
<P>
   Cem must deal with militant nationalists in the coalition
government he represents. He also faces the harsh reality that in
Turkey, key changes in foreign policy can be made only with the
permission of military commanders. Whether the commanders are ready
to embrace Greece after generations of hostility remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important question is whether there can be change in
Turkey, and the key to that is the military and its attitude toward
civil society,'' said Thanos Veremis, a professor of political
history at Athens University. ``The Turkish military is highly
conservative, and it wants to preserve its political power. I
frankly can't see how that logjam will break.''
</P>
<P>
   Veremis said Greeks would respond most positively to a statement
from Turkey that it harbors no designs on Greek islands, especially
if the statement came from a senior military commander like Gen.
Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of the general staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Greece don't pay attention to what Turkish
politicians say, because we see that they don't count,'' he said.
``But if Kivrikoglu comes out and assures Greece that there's never
going to be war over the islands, that would go a long way because
we know he's the ultimate arbiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Regional developments in the last few months have helped bring
Greece and Turkey closer together. The two foreign ministers
consulted regularly during the Kosovo crisis. Their relationship
may also have been strengthened by the recent easing of tension
between Israel, a traditional friend of Turkey, and the
Palestinians, whom Greece has long supported.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that has helped improve the political climate is
the changing attitude of the Turkish and Greek press, both of which
have for years sought to win readers and viewers by fanning the
flames of chauvinistic nationalism. Since the quake in Turkey last
month, they have made an abrupt about-face, and are now vocal
cheerleaders for the cause of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign governments are encouraging the countries' new-found
friendship, among them the Clinton administration. President
Clinton is to receive Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey at the
White House this month, and he is expected to visit both Turkey and
Greece in November.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Clinton's trip, the European Union will hold a
crucial summit meeting in Helsinki. Turkey is hoping that Greece
will help persuade the 15-nation union, many of whose members have
been critical of Turkey's human rights record, to add Turkey to its
list of prospective members. If that does not happen, momentum
toward Greek-Turkish friendship may be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The naysayers are lying in wait, and unless there's real
progress, hardliners on both sides will try to undermine this
process,'' warned David Philips, a specialist in conflict
resolution who has been hired by the State Department to suggest
ways of bringing Greeks and Turks together. ``That's why it's so
important that the leaders of both countries understand the
importance of this moment and seize the opportunity that's staring
them in the face.''

E-MAIL OFFERS INSIGHTS TO MICROSOFT TRIAL STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
 (rm) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft Corp. and the government filed new
declarations in court on Friday, revising the voluminous findings
of fact each side filed last month in the federal antitrust suit
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   But more revealing may be the internal Microsoft discussions
that play out in a long series of e-mails that the government
subpoenaed from the company and entered into evidence with little
notice last month. Those discussions involved the public relations
campaign that the company quickly devised when news broke last
November that the Netscape Communications Corp. _ which the
antitrust suit casts as a victim of Microsoft's monopoly _ was
being acquired by America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's filings were the last written submissions of evidence
before final oral arguments in the case begin on Sept. 21. The
documents gave each side a chance to refine its points and take
jabs at the arguments offered by the other side.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The government brief, which argues that Microsoft's initial
filings ``ignore most of the evidence against it,'' also seeks to
capitalize on concessions that Microsoft witnesses made on the
stand.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the government's Friday filing alluded to a
concession that a Microsoft witness, Richard L. Schmalensee, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, made during a
closed court session of which the details had not been previously
been made public. To make the case that Microsoft is a monopoly,
the Justice Department wanted to demonstrate that the company was
able to raise the price of the Windows operating system without
fear that price increases would dampen demand. To support that, the
brief says, ``After first denying it, at trial Microsoft ultimately
conceded that it was able to raise the price of Windows 95  &UR; after
 &LR; Windows 98 came out.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Friday filing, for its part, ranged from dismissive
to contemptuous of the government's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs advance a number of hopelessly speculative
assertions of consumer harm'' that are ``vague and lacking in
substance,'' Microsoft wrote. Among the assertions, the company
said, is the contention that ``consumers would enjoy greater choice
in operating systems if greater competition and innovation had
occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers, Microsoft said, ``should have had more
demonstrable injury to consumers in mind before entangling
Microsoft and the court in this lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In its new filing, Microsoft argued once again that America
Online's purchase of Netscape Communications rendered the
government's antitrust suit irrelevant. While the company's
continued advocacy of that position is hardly surprising, the
formative discussions behind it have only now become known, as a
result of the company e-mail the government entered into evidence
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stance appears to have evolved during a heated
debate among the company's senior public relations officers on
Sunday, Nov. 22, 1998, two days before the America Online-Netscape
Communications deal was announced. Parallel discussions may have
taken place within the Microsoft legal team, but no evidence of
that has surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   A small, speculative note about the negotiations, the first
public notice of the proposed Netscape deal, ran on the Dow Jones
news service on the morning of Nov. 22. Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft
public relations executive, spotted it that day at 12:14 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan's initial instinct was to keep the response low key:
``We don't comment on rumors,'' he wrote to his colleagues via
e-mail. ``We remain mum.''
</P>
<P>
   But very quickly, hotter heads took over.
</P>
<P>
   By lunchtime, reporters started calling asking for comment, and
Greg Shaw, a more senior public relations officer, offered the
observation, ``This deal certainly underscores the fact that
competition is vigorous in this industry.'' It was a point, Shaw
said, that the company should try to get raised in every news
article, ``saying this undermines the core of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Mark Murray, the point man in the company's public
relations effort in the antitrust case, drafted a detailed plan of
attack for ``the next 24-48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom one to mince words, Murray opened his strategy memo by
saying, ``This deal blows an enormous hole in the government's
case.'' He added, ``The government should hire a contortionist to
explain why they're suing Microsoft, in the face of such powerful
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Murray laid out the public relations strategy and assigned
workers to each of a dozen or so tasks. First, he dictated,
Microsoft's lead lawyers would make comments to the cameras on the
federal courthouse steps the next morning, just before the trial
opened. A Microsoft worker was assigned to ``assemble B-roll and
radio sound bite packages of the courthouse step comments and
disseminate to all media.''
</P>
<P>
   Government affairs specialists ``should call sympathetic
columnists,'' Murray added. And they should ``outreach to
congressional state/local officials and our core supporters.'' Rick
Rule, a Microsoft lawyer, ``should call the top 10-12 antitrust
`experts' who get quoted on our case, and try to sell them on the
idea that this fundamentally undermines the government's case,''
Murray wrote.
</P>
<P>
   After some additional back and forth, Brad Chase, Microsoft's
chief marketing officer, weighed in at 9:10 p.m. and issued the
following instruction: ``In all seriousness, if any form of this
deal happens, we need all of our friends in politics to go nuts.
This gives them an opening to drive a truck through, and they
should be let loose.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last Friday, Murray said he could not see how
the e-mail messages had anything to do with the legal case. ``I am
sure there were frantic e-mails at the Justice Department that
day,'' Murray said. ``They were probably tearing their hair out
about what this would do to their case.''
</P>
<P>
   As the defendant, Microsoft is not able to subpoena Justice
Department e-mail for the trial.

AD COLUMN: MERCEDES-BENZ DOES NOT SHIFT MANY GEARS IN 2000
CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever notice the resemblance between the Mercedes-Benz logo and
the peace symbol? The first campaign for Mercedes-Benz USA from its
new agency resembles recent campaigns from its previous agency even
more closely.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there is anything wrong with that. Still, the
considerable publicity generated by an abrupt switch between the
two New York agencies last winter, plus the acrimony _ as evidenced
by a lawsuit seeking $25 million in damages _ led to some
predictions that the campaign promoting the Mercedes-Benz lineup
for the 2000 model year would differ from what went before.
</P>
<P>
   But the television and print campaign by the new agency, Merkley
Newman Harty, echoes the work of its dismissed predecessor, Lowe &AMP;
Partners/SMS, in content, style and attitude. The warmly emotional
tone is back, intended to present the brand as less austere and
more approachable. Returning, too, are elements like the one-word
titles that appear in the lower right corner of the screen during
television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Another constant is the wry, cheeky sense of humor that imbued
past ads. Telly Savalas, for example, is shown playing the
lollipop-loving detective Theo Kojak with a full head of hair.
Rhett Butler tells Scarlett O'Hara, ``Frankly my dear, I don't give
a hoot.'' And Mercedes-Benz employees are portrayed as sufficiently
dedicated to their jobs to replace the dummies in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   Those significant similarities between the campaigns are just
what executives at Mercedes-Benz USA, a division of DaimlerChrysler
AG, say they wanted. The new effort begins Monday and continues
through the fourth quarter with a budget of $50 million to $60
million _ the brand's largest model-year introductory spending
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a continuation, building on what came
before,'' said Mike Jackson, president and chief executive at
Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J. ``What makes it strong is
consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had wonderful success in this glorious economy, which
has been satisfying,'' he added, referring to record sales that
have almost doubled in the last three years. ``But the strategies
Mercedes-Benz has been pursuing since the early '90s are what has
driven our success.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson discussed the campaign last week at a meeting at the
Merkley Newman office in New York City, where he was joined by
colleagues and agency executives.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim W. Eberhardt, vice president for marketing at
Mercedes-Benz USA, said: ``We had always been satisfied with the
ultimate creative product from the former agency. That was never a
bone of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, company executives have attributed the dismissal of
Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.,
to what they described as increasing difficulties in achieving what
they wanted from the agency during the creative process. The
dismissal also came after the retirement of Marvin Sloves, former
co-chairman at Lowe, who had worked closely with Jackson and
Eberhardt on Mercedes-Benz advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic is suing Sloves for $25 million, accusing him of
influencing Mercedes-Benz to leave his former agency and breach of
fiduciary duty. Sloves has denied the allegations and is fighting
Interpublic in New York State Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Though there was widespread industry speculation that
Mercedes-Benz USA had wanted Sloves to join the agency that
replaced Lowe, that has not happened. Other senior executives who
worked at Lowe on the account, with total billings estimated at
$125 million, did leave for Merkley Newman, which is a unit of
Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a combination of continuity and new people who added
some new strategic insight, some new creative strength,'' said Alex
Gellert, partner and group account director at Merkley Newman, who
had been executive vice president and group account director on
Mercedes-Benz at Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the partners and executive creative directors at
Merkley Newman responsible for the 2000 campaign _ Andy Hirsch,
Marty Orzio and Randy Saitta _ had been group creative heads on
Mercedes-Benz at Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is a theme, ``The Mercedes experience,'' that
celebrates the factory and dealer employees behind the scenes as
much as the brand's logo, heritage, products and driving
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to ``create advocates for the brand'' among car
buyers, Jackson said, because ``there's still nothing as powerful
as the word-of-mouth referral from those enthusiastic about your
product.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is ``not `Mercedes-Benz is the best car,''' he added,
``but `Mercedes-Benz is the best car for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The initial commercial, and a related print ad, present humorous
mistakes like the hairy Kojak, the misspoken Butler and the Mona
Lisa with a toothy smile. ``Change one thing and it's just not the
same,'' they assert. ``But if every part is exactly right ...
magic. Welcome to the Mercedes experience.''
</P>
<P>
   One commercial is evocative of perhaps the best spot created by
Lowe in the six years that agency handled the account. The spot
used production techniques to make it seem as if people driving and
building Mercedes-Benzes decades ago were joining Marlene Dietrich
in singing ``Falling in Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, special effects and recreated footage are combined
with contemporary actors dressed in period costumes to offer an
unusual retrospective of Mercedes-Benz safety tests since the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Ten TV commercials will appear on local and national broadcast
and cable stations and networks. Fourteen print ads will run in
newspapers and magazines. There will also be Internet ads,
brochures and materials for dealer showrooms.

OPERA REVIEW: RESOUNDING WITH NOVEL IDEAS, NOT NOVEL ACOUSTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Madama Butterfly'' opened the New York City Opera's fall
season last Saturday night. Familiar and beloved repertory has been
given a fresh look. Singing was always competent and sometimes
more. Workability and sincerity added up to an affecting evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Mark Lamos production, which emanates from the Glimmerglass
Opera company, has the good idea of eliminating Cio-Cio-San's house
altogether, demonstrating in the process what a stage-cluttering
presence it usually is. We are left with a broad set of steps,
sliding screens and our own powers of imagination. The infrequent
crowd scenes are given room to maneuver, and they do so nicely. A
background of blue skies, alternately revealed or denied by the
movable and transparent screens, renders the idea of indoors and
outdoors by simple means.
</P>
<P>
   Puccini's ever-lovely music is less a study of orientalism than
an Italian's daydream of faraway places, one unencumbered by the
niceties of geographic accuracy. The pentatonic gestures,
ingeniously wed to homegrown melody, are, of course, more Chinese
than Japanese. Here the composer's modest advances on traditional
harmony are also convenient buzzwords for the exotic East. We hear
``Madama Butterfly'' too much; but if we must, let it be in
productions like this, where new ideas exist not just for the sake
of newness.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieutenant Pinkerton, Rafael Rojas labors honorably. The
quality of his tenor voice, and the taste and style with which he
uses it, have their limits, and there was indeed more labor than
beauty in this performance. This is also a particularly cloddish
Pinkerton, crude perhaps to excess given the discreet portrayals
going on around him onstage. The supporting characters are
uniformly good: James Maddalena's Sharpless filled with character,
Goro deftly done by John Daniecki, and Kathryn Honan-Carter an
ardent Suzuki.
</P>
<P>
   The center of attention was also the object of our admiration.
Oksana Krovytska sang beautifully as Cio-Cio-San. The voice works;
its sincerity grips the ear, and it is tempered by a judicious
musicality.
</P>
<P>
   It also carries easily in this ungainly theater, which brings us
to the subtheme of last Saturday's performance: a recently
installed ``acoustical enhancement system,'' to use the description
of the City Opera's general and artistic director Paul Kellogg.
With it, reverberation patterns are altered, but we are told that
music will not necessarily be louder. Among lovers of the human
voice, antennas are sure to rise and alarm bells made to sound, for
use whatever words you will, electric current is being used to help
along what God, and singing teachers, gave the human body to begin
with.
</P>
<P>
   So art, too, contributes to the turmoils over genetically
engineered beef, artificially juiced-up corn, duplicating sheep and
other present scientific forays into natural processes. As a
general principle, we should be alarmed. Broadway offers the
grossest example of what might be in store for plugged-in opera.
There, music is bloated and distorted, and even more injurious,
ears have been made lazy. Opera will not survive the indolent
listener.
</P>
<P>
   The City Opera, on the other hand, has a particular, not a
general problem. I have witnessed two acoustical makeovers at the
New York State Theater in the last 20 years; and even though those
grotesque dead spots onstage are gone and music brought a little
nearer, this is a terminally dead space for opera, and one more
makeover is not going to justify the money it would cost for a
little improvement.
</P>
<P>
   I think Kellogg and his company would dearly love to get out of
their current home altogether. But until they can gather the money
and the nerve (it is funny how the first inspires the second), such
tactics as ``acoustical enhancement'' may be the best that can be
done.
</P>
<P>
   If acoustical monkey business was going on at last Saturday's
performance, I freely admit that I didn't hear it. As usual,
mediocre voices did not carry; good ones (Ms. Krovytska's in
particular) did.
</P>
<P>
   Singing from the back of the stage was barely audible, and so
was it ever. The orchestra, conducted by Joseph Rescigno, did sound
particularly loud. Start asking why, and the dubiousness of most
acoustical debate becomes clearer. A very good or a very bad hall
will make its presence known, but halls are small components in the
amalgam of sound that reaches our ears as music. What is being
played? How is it orchestrated? What is the quality of the voices?
What kind of balances can the conductor manage?
</P>
<P>
   Remember that we go to theaters to hear operas not acoustics.
The more we think like engineers, the less we think like music
lovers. Perhaps the judgments over the City Opera's modest
adventure should be left to the singers. This is a company centered
on young voices, and the State Theater has made them strain
uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   The measure of ``acoustical enhancement'' will be in ease of
delivery and health of technique, not in the contemplation of
analog processors, directional microphones, channels and surging
Con Edison bills.
</P>
<P>

TV REVIEW: AT THE EARTH'S CORE, NATIVES IN BIKINIS
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the bowels of the earth, at the far side of a subterranean
sea, an intrepid band of explorers, slogging through a four-hour
miniseries, comes upon a jungle village and a crowd of dancing,
chanting natives. ``Amazing!'' one traveler says. ``Caucasian
primitives!''
</P>
<P>
   They are indeed palefaces. Maybe the pigmentation has something
to do with the wan light below the earth's crust, a result of
electromagnetic charges in the atmosphere. Or so we're told in
``Journey to the Center of the Earth,'' a shamelessly loose
adaptation of the Jules Verne novel being shown in two parts on the
USA Network Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   But what's even more amazing than the racial makeup of the
aborigines is, well, their makeup. Could that curvaceous huntress
in the animal-hide bikini be wearing lip gloss? It seems so.
</P>
<P>
   But then these young, buff, sexually restless natives appear to
be less from a fantastic nether world than from the hipper sections
of Los Angeles, by way of central casting's costume department. If
not clad in cleavage-baring skins, they wear standard-issue grass
skirts, paint their faces in the usual way and carry regulation
spears.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to pick on the extras. The marquee stars _ Treat
Williams, Bryan Brown, Jeremy London (of ``Party of Five'') and
Tushka Bergen (of the Whit Stillman film ``Barcelona'') _ aren't
entirely convincing, either. But this goofy, old-hat, early ``Star
Trek'' rendering of primitive types underscores how stale so much
of the production is.
</P>
<P>
   That's a pity because it's not as if the executive producers
(Robert Halmi Jr. and David V. Picker) had weak source material.
Verne's 1864 fantasy, thrusting staid Victorians into mystery and
adventure, is rich with cinematic possibility (and far better
realized in the spirited 1959 film with James Mason). But the
makers of this version flub the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Even some not-bad digital effects (including an eerie
underground ocean vista) and postcard shots of New Zealand can't
overcome a barrage of ponderous dialogue (``You should love this
man; he would give up his life for you'') and simply bland acting.
</P>
<P>
   As for plot, Verne wouldn't recognize it much. Here a
free-thinking scientist, Theodore Lytton ( Williams), traces not
the rediscovered trail of a 16th-century Icelandic explorer, as
Verne had it, but that of Casper Hastings, the wayward husband of a
rich, beautiful Bostonian, Alice Hastings (Ms. Bergen). Casper, it
seems, had disappeared on a volcano expedition in New Zealand seven
years before. Now his wife wants to find him, and to lead the
search she hires Lytton, who could use the money; he moonlights as
a prizefighter to help finance his research.

   Lytton, drawn by a Maori legend, presently finds the hole that
will take him far below Down Under. Along for the trip is a
diffident nephew ( London), a Falstaffian guide (played with gusto
by Hugh Keays-Byrne) and the lovely Mrs. Hastings, who shows up
uninvited, apparently to supply romantic possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Once underground, the party encounters a flock of hungry
pterodactyls, a race of intelligent but surly reptilian creatures
and, finally, Casper Hastings himself (Brown), who has turned into
a power-mad lord of the jungle, not unlike Kurtz in ``Heart of
Darkness.'' Brown, at least, seems to be enjoying himself, playing
the villain with some abandon. But then, finding himself cast as a
Joseph Conrad character in a supposed Jules Verne tale, he might
have just thrown up his hands and said, Oh, what the hell.

BELL ATLANTIC AND VODAFONE, ONCE ENEMIES, ARE SAID TO BE NEAR A
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far they have come in nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The international wireless giant Vodafone Airtouch PLC and the
Bell Atlantic Corp., hostile adversaries in January, are poised to
become best friends in a venture that would consolidate the two
companies' U.S. cellular telephone operations into a separate
company with 23.5 million subscribers and a value of between $70
billion and $80 billion, according to people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Although people close to both companies cautioned Sunday that
the negotiations could still break down as their advisers worked on
the final details, the companies' boards were expected to meet in
the next few days to consider the deal in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Other than issuing a statement Sunday confirming that the
discussions were taking place, Bell Atlantic officials declined to
comment. A Vodafone Airtouch spokesman said his company would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Such a pact might have seemed unthinkable early this year, after
Vodafone Group, Britain's largest wireless carrier, snatched
Airtouch Communications, the largest U.S. cellular company, from
Bell Atlantic's embrace in a two-week bidding war that Vodafone won
with a $60 billion offer. Vodafone Airtouch, as the combined
companies became known, emerged as the world's largest cellular
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   A better outcome, many analysts said at the time, would have
been for Vodafone and Bell Atlantic to have split the spoils. Bell
Atlantic, the largest land-line local telephone company in the
United States and a wireless player on the East Coast, should have
bought Airtouch's American wireless properties, those analysts
said, with Vodafone Group taking Airtouch's international wireless
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' logic was that Bell Atlantic, with 14 million
cellular customers, could take better advantage of the expanded
national cellular footprint that Airtouch's 9.5 million U.S.
subscribers would give it, while Vodafone might be better off
concentrating on folding Airtouch's holdings in Europe into its own
extensive European network.
</P>
<P>
   And now Vodafone Airtouch and Bell Atlantic, the heated bidding
fury having given way to cooler reflection, have apparently
concluded that those analysts were right.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic, a joint venture with Vodafone Airtouch would
give it the national cellular footprint it has craved for several
years. And Vodafone Airtouch would get an expanded American
presence to rival the national wireless networks of AT&AMP;T and
Sprint. Vodafone Airtouch and Bell Atlantic customers would have
the advantage of a coast-to-coast network, while consumers
generally might benefit from the downward pressure on prices that
presumably would result from greater competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination becomes the most credible national wireless
play,'' said Richard Klugman, a telecommunications analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc. ``This all fits and very well and
makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ivan G. Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's chairman and chief
executive, lost the Airtouch bidding in January, people close to
him said he was outraged _ frustrated in part because Bell
Atlantic's respectable but not stellar stock performance made it
hard to engage in a bidding war with Vodafone, which as a
fast-growing upstart had a high-flying stock to use as currency in
the Airtouch deal.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg, who got his first job in the telecommunications
industry as a 19-year-old assistant telephone repairman for New
York Telephone, has aspirations of building a wireless
communications empire to rival both AT&AMP;T and Sprint. His
announcement in the summer of 1998 of a $53 billion acquisition of
GTE by Bell Atlantic, a deal that is still pending, was a step in
that direction. His next move, which began late last year, was his
thwarted pursuit of Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Vodafone won the bidding, its chairman, Chris Gent,
said publicly that he still hoped to form a partnership with Bell
Atlantic. And people close to the current talks say that he and
Seidenberg began discussing a joint venture in July.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and Airtouch had been partners in a joint venture
called Primeco Personal Communications, which was formed in 1994 to
bid on wireless licenses in metropolitan markets in the United
States that neither company yet served.
</P>
<P>
   But after Airtouch became part of Vodafone, the Primeco
relationship became strained, and in April Bell Atlantic dissolved
the venture, leaving the partners to divide its holdings. That left
Vodafone Airtouch without a cellular presence in the Eastern United
States and Bell Atlantic seemingly even farther away from its goal
of building a national cellular network.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One key player in breaking the impasse, according to people
close to the current talks, has been Bell Atlantic's chief
financial officer, Frederic V. Salerno. He has known Gent since the
days when Salerno oversaw the international and wireless operations
of the Nynex Corp., before it was acquired by Bell Atlantic in
1997. Salerno ``always thought that it made sense'' to combine
Vodafone's U.S. wireless operations with Bell Atlantic's, a person
close to the talks said. ``He took losing Airtouch to Vodafone less
personally than Ivan.''
</P>
<P>
   Another critical diplomatic role was played by Sam Ginn, the
former chairman and chief executive of Airtouch, who last winter
had initially favored an acquisition by Bell Atlantic, but finally
elected to go with the highest bid. People close to the talks said
Ginn, now at Vodafone Airtouch, encouraged Seidenberg to begin
talking with Gent in July.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg has conceded that combining the U.S. cellular
operations is a logical idea, said people close to the discussions,
with one caveat: that Bell Atlantic retain control of the
operations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said negotiations heated up about 10
days ago, soon after Vodafone and Bell Atlantic formally split the
Primeco assets. Vodafone demanded equal control in the venture,
they said, but Bell Atlantic executives balked. As a compromise,
Vodafone agreed that Bell Atlantic would own about 55 percent of
the combined company and Vodafone would own the rest _ with the
right to sell its stake back to Bell Atlantic over the next three
to seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Another key point Gent has been willing to concede, these people
say, is that Lawrence T. Babbio Jr., Bell Atlantic's president and
chief operating officer, would oversee the joint venture. ``Chris
is very level-headed,'' said an executive who knows Gent but is not
involved in the deal and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

   Vanity Fair is out with its fifth ranking of the ``50 Most

 &UR; Herman &LR;  is not on the list. Never mind. Among the local lights:
</P>
<P>
   - No. 7 is  &UR; Steve Jobs  &LR; of Apple, who Vanity Fair says once
poured a glass of water on an employee's head during a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   - Tied for No. 11 are  &UR; Andrew Grove &LR;  and  &UR; Craig Barrett &LR;  of
Intel (who are the only Bay Area heavies about whom Vanity Fair
could find nothing at all of human interest or whimsy to report.)
</P>

 &UR; Koogle &LR;  of Yahoo. Filo and Yang, sumo wrestling fans, are said to
have dressed in inflatable sumo customes and ``had it out in the
Yahoo parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   - No. 29 is  &UR; John Doerr &LR; , a venture capitalist whose dinner
guests are often chilled. His home in Silicon Valley is a series of
freestanding pavilions between which guests scurry to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   - No. 30 is  &UR; Larry Ellison &LR;  of Oracle, who ``is plagued by a
well-deserved reputation as an irresponsible playboy.''
</P>
<P>
   - No. 31 is  &UR; Margaret Whitman &LR;  of eBay, who used to promote Mr.
Potato Head for Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   - No. 34 is  &UR; Scott McNealy &LR;  of Sun Microsystems, who was
rejected by the San Francisco Golf Club, an ``old-money institution
that isn't very welcoming to brash new computer money.''

years. I see everyone else working and I'm not doing d-. I'm in
total limbo. I'm a man without a country.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallone, whose comments were quoted in the New York Daily News,
told Faludi that Hollywood turned on him after he made ``Cop

cahoots with Miramax's  &UR; Harvey Weinstein &LR; , who wanted him to make
more Rambo movies.

   ``I feel like the case of the Greek persona wearing the mask,''
he said of the macho roles he played before then. ``And he takes it
down, and you don't recognize who this person is. ... I don't
exist. It's like people see right through me.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. &UR; Jacqueline Stallone &LR; , Sylvester's mom, told TV Guide Online
that she's augmented her astrology business with ``Rumpology,'' an
art she said she learned from a French woman. ``The crack of your
behind corresponds to the division of the two hemispheres of the
brain,'' she said. ``The buttocks represent areas of your

   WASHINGTON _ It is not an accident that Flo, a feisty
sixty-something woman, is the star of the pharmaceutical industry's
latest advertising campaign in the battle over adding prescription
drug coverage to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a coincidence that the White House held an event not
long ago to focus on Medicare as a women's issue. Or that the
Democratic women of the Senate formed a working group last year to
examine what the various proposals to restructure Social Security
would mean to women. Or that the Older Women's League, an advocacy
group, issued a report on Mother's Day this year titled, ``The Face
of Medicare is a Woman You Know.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this reflects a basic demographic and political reality
that increasingly colors the debate over restructuring Medicare and
Social Security: old age is largely a country of women.
</P>
<P>
   Women not only tend to live longer; they also are more
economically insecure, have more chronic health conditions and as a
result, eventually, become more dependent on those basic safety-net
programs, health policy analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, that means they are becoming a prime audience,
target and symbol in the great struggles over entitlements. For the
defenders of generous health benefits, highlighting this vulnerable
group is a powerful marketing approach with broad political appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women perceive it as a two-fold issue: One, they're more
likely to have all the problems of old age because they're likely
to live longer,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. ``And
second, whatever caregiving responsibilities exist, women expect to
fall squarely on their shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster who also works for the
pharmaceutical industry, said, ``When you do focus groups, women
say, `Look, I'm going to live longer. I could outlive my income.'
Women just presume there's a higher chance they'll need a
government safety net more than men.''
</P>
<P>
   The demographics are clear: At birth, American women's life
expectancy is 79.1, six years longer than men's. Women account for
54 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 65 and
74, and 61 percent of the Medicare population between the ages of
75 and 84. They account for 71 percent of the 85-and-over medicare
population. Reflecting this skew, women make up more than
two-thirds of the nursing home population and two-thirds of the
users of home health care services.
</P>
<P>
   Older women also have higher poverty rates than their male
counterparts: 17 percent of the women on Medicare have incomes
below the federal poverty level ($7,740 in 1996) compared with 11
percent of the men on Medicare, according to a report by the Older
Women's League, released by the Clinton administration. Nearly 7 in
10 of the Medicare beneficiaries living below the poverty line are
women, that report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we live longer than men, and the bad news is
that we live longer than men,'' said Judith L. Lichtman, president
of the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Ann F. Lewis, a presidential counselor, said, ``When you start
talking about the fact that women live longer, are paid less, are
far less likely to have pensions with their work, and far more
likely to carry the responsibility for caregiving in our families,
every woman in the audience starts to nod.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lichtman and other advocates say women's groups have long
recognized that ``aging is a women's issue,'' because of women's
work patterns, caregiving responsibilities, economic status and
longevity. But in the last few years, as Social Security and
Medicare appeared to be headed for overhauls, advocates say these
groups have tried to organize to ensure that women's interests are
protected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you're hearing more about this now is the programs
that women and men, but especially women, rely on for old age,
Social Security and Medicare, are under new strains,'' said Joan
Entmacher of the National Women's Law Center, an advocacy group
that focuses on women's legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski, D-Md., said the Democratic women in
the Senate began meeting on the issue a year ago when Social
Security restructuring appeared imminent and the debate over
privatizing the program was taking off. Any major restructuring is
now considered unlikely until after the 2000 election. A few months
ago, the Democratic women produced a checklist of necessary
ingredients for any Social Security overhaul, including preserving
the program as a guaranteed benefit with protection against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others wanted to talk about macroeconomics,'' Ms. Mikulski
said. ``We wanted to talk about it at the macaroni-and-cheese
level.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear political rationale for presenting Social
Security and Medicare as women's issues, just as liberal advocates
a decade ago tried to cast welfare and poverty as children's
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving and improving expensive entitlement programs for
frail and economically vulnerable widows is much more appealing
than doing so for affluent retirees. ``It puts a human face on
it,'' Ms. Mikulski said of the focus on women. ``And I believe a
far more realistic face. We're not talking about the gilded golf
cart here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats and their sympathetic advocacy groups have been
hitting this issue particularly hard, the focus on women is
bipartisan. Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., and a senior woman on
the House Ways and Means Committee, argues that Republicans have
``been the lead party'' in trying to protect older women's economic
security through such measures as tax credits for caregivers and
the purchase of long-term care insurance. ``I think part of my job
is to educate them about what we're doing and why we're doing it,''
Mrs. Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, these demographic undercurrents are powerful
in the struggle over whether to add prescription drug coverage to
Medicare, as was proposed by the Clinton administration this year.
The administration and the Older Women's League argue that this
coverage gap is a particular hardship for older women, who spend a
greater share of their income on health care than men, 22 percent
compared with 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders, for their part, argue that they will target
assistance for prescription drugs to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   The drug industry, which fears that a major new government
benefit will lead to price controls, is sounding alarms in the
person of Flo, who warns that ``the White House plan puts
bureaucrats in charge of our medicines.'' The campaign presents Flo
_ ``an actress but her story and concerns are real,'' according to
campaign literature _ as one of the two-thirds of the Medicare
population that has private drug coverage, and plays to worries
among this group that their insurance will be replaced by a
less-generous and more-intrusive government plan.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements say they are produced by ``Citizens for
Better Medicare,'' a coalition of business, drug industry and some
patients groups, but a spokesman for the group said they were
primarily paid for by the pharmaceutical industry. The
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of American have taken
the lead in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates who support new prescription drug benefits have
reacted angrily to the Flo advertisements. ``The Flo campaign is
really outrageous,'' said Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn. Deborah
Briceland-Betts, executive director of the Older Women's League,
said her organization had mounted an anti-Flo campaign: ``The
message is Flo is a fake, and she doesn't represent the majority of
older women in America who are trying to figure out how to cover
the costs of drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over Flo is a symbol of what is to come, advocates
on both sides agree. ``We're all talking to women on these
issues,'' said Ms. Lichtman, of the National Partnership. ``They
are, we are.''

THEATER REVIEW: A BRIMMING BATHTUB AS THE FOCUS OF DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Stella! ... glug, glug, glug . . . Stella!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the sound of Stanley Kowalski's immortal mating call, as
delivered from an overflowing bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The ragged cry, which can be heard in Ivo van Hove's new
production of Tennessee Williams' ``Streetcar Named Desire'' at the
New York Theater Workshop, is a lot more adenoidal and scratchy
than the famous bull-like bellow of Marlon Brando. So when this
Stanley's head is plunged under water and held there by a
justifiably irritated neighbor, you may feel like cheering. Here at
last is retribution for five noisy decades of second-rate Kowalski
interpreters and Brando impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   And that is about as close to catharsis as this rattling
deconstruction of Williams' masterwork comes. Van Hove, a Dutch
director famed for his iconoclastic takes on classics, has chosen
to create a ``Streetcar'' with none, but none, of the niceties and
illusions that the play's besieged heroine, Blanch DuBois, lives
by. Although Williams' text is basically intact, the production
itself is all about stripping down: both to the thematic bones of
the play and to full-frontal nudity by the three leading actors.
</P>
<P>
   You should also know that Stanley (played here by Bruce
McKenzie) is not the only character to spend time in the company of
sudsy water and a rubber duck. Stella (Jenny Bacon), Stanley's
ever-smitten wife, finds sexual bliss in that same tub, while you
can't keep her visiting sister, Blanche (Elizabeth Marvel), out of
the darn thing. At one point, she even flops into it fully clothed
and head first, to re-emerge looking like a swamp monster.
</P>
<P>
   If this production, which I will always think of as ``A Bathtub
Named Desire,'' sounds like an antic, outlandish hoot, it really
isn't. Van Hove, who played similar (and marginally more
illuminating) tricks with Eugene O'Neill's ``More Stately
Mansions'' two seasons ago, has the severe logic of the steely
literature teacher who parses works of art into diagrams.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason, for instance, for the dominance of that
bathtub. Van Hove sees the play, with its clash between the
fantasist Blanche and the realist Stanley, as an elemental war
waged between water and fire. It is ``the description of an
inevitable process of destruction,'' he writes in an introductory
program note. This is not out of keeping with what Williams himself
wrote about ``Streetcar,'' and you do not feel, as you often do
with deconstructionists, that van Hove is imposing unwarranted
meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, unfortunately, is he providing anything in the way of fresh
insights, unless you count a scrawny, charisma-free Stanley as a
revelation. Set on a sparsely furnished stage defined by stark
grids of light (the production designer is Jan Versweyveld), with
ominously dissonant music by Harry de Wit, this ``Streetcar''
wallows in the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Blanche, that noted hater of naked light bulbs, keeps to the
shady part of the stage, and when she is dragged out of it, she
screams like a vampire at sunrise. Stella, on the other hand, basks
crucifix-style on her back in a square of bright light after
satisfying sex with Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   When early in the evening Stanley says he is rifling through
Blanche's legal papers, McKenzie instead brutally frisks Ms.
Marvel's body like a would-be rapist, turning the real rape later
in the play into a muffled afterthought. And when Mitch
(Christopher Evan Welch), Stanley's awkward, gentle pal, is first
introduced to Blanche, she does a provocative shimmy in black
lingerie to show what is really going on in her head beneath the
polite small talk.
</P>
<P>
   Just how necessary is this? It doesn't require heavy labor to
expose the sexual elements of ``Streetcar.'' A nude, explicitly
coital version of, say, a Somerset Maugham drawing room comedy
would at least generate some novelty. To apply the approach to
``Streetcar'' is to be as crude as Stanley himself.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the primal, universal conflict that gives this drama
its greatness as much as the way Williams translated that conflict
into vividly particular characters. And, with one exception, those
characters aren't to be found in van Hove's production.
</P>
<P>
   That merciful exception is Ms. Marvel's Blanche. Like the other
members of the cast, she shuns purely naturalistic delivery and
moves in ways that often contradict what she is saying. But Ms.
Marvel, a consistently inventive and adaptable young actress,
delivers a performance of remarkable poise and stamina that also
locates the tragic, self-defeating conflict within Blanche.
</P>
<P>
   Looking strangely like the infamous 1950s socialite Anne
Woodward, this Blanche is mechanically manic-depressive, switching
abruptly between hyped-up, giddy flirtatiousness and deep-voiced,
slow-moving melancholy. The contrast emphasizes, in surprising
ways, the glum fatalism in the character, the sense that she has
surrendered before her climactic breakdown. And I started hearing
the full, despairing content in Blanche's soliloquies, especially
the one about what ``soft'' people must do to survive, in ways I
hadn't before.
</P>
<P>
   Like much in this production, Ms. Marvel's interpretation
sometimes has the feeling of an exploratory workshop exercise still
awaiting integration into a complete performance. But there is no
denying the poetic dignity in her presence. Considering she spends
much of the evening wet and naked, that is saying quite a bit.

LURE OF SNAILS PALES WITH A FRIENDLY PAIL OF STEAMED MUSSELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife Alice recalls that as a child she always thought she
would one day marry a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. Oh, during my life I have cultivated some interesting
green molds in forgotten containers at the back of the
refrigerator. But I invariably harvested my ``crops'' down the
garbage disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Other forms of farming sounded too risky, too complicated and
involved an intolerable amount of sweating. Of course if I had
known about snail farming, Alice might have gotten her wish.
</P>
<P>
   After being served a few of the critters during a recent trip to
France, I conducted a bit of research and discovered that snails
were once plucked off vines to preserve the grapes. They also
represented a culinary bonus to vineyard workers. But pesticide use
decimated the population of wild snails.
</P>
<P>
   Today, not more than 30 or 40 snail farmers produce the escargot
served in European restaurants and those that arrive on our grocery
shelves in cans or jars.
</P>
<P>
   A snail farm, I learned, consists of row upon row of rough
wooden planks, each about a foot long, tilted over strips of grass
and irrigation tubes. The snails grow in tight clusters beneath
these planks. At the age of 6 months the snails are ready to be
taken indoors and starved for one month, to rid them of any
impurities. They are then cooked in a vegetable-wine broth and
ready to be stuffed into cans, jars or returned to their snail
shells with copious amounts of garlic butter to produce the classic
appetizer ``escargot a la bourguignonne.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago I ordered this delicacy in a Paris brasserie. A snooty
waiter delivered the snails, along with a pair of forceps to grip
the shells.
</P>
<P>
   I loaded one shell into the forceps, but as I approached the
snail with a fork, the teeth of the snail gripper slipped on
spilled butter and the infernal contraption fired the shell across
the room on four bounces. The waiter was not impressed or amused.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact I was accompanied by my wife, the waiter seemed
to sense that she was not married to a snail farmer.
</P>
<P>
   I'd rather eat Penn Cove mussels or littleneck clams anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' Mussels
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds mussels
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup diced, peeled red pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 fresh tomato (or two Romas) diced
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup dry, white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons oregano
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons basil
</P>
<P>
   Clean and wash the mussels if needed.
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot heat the olive oil and saute the onion, pepper
and garlic for 2 minutes. Add the tomato sauce, chopped fresh
tomato, the wine and herbs. Lower heat and simmer 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to eat, toss the mussels into the pot, cover and turn
up the heat. When the mussels are all open, dish up into three
bowls and serve with crusty French or Italian bread.
</P>
<P>
   Dijon Mussels
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds cleaned mussels
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large pot. Add the garlic, stir-cook 30
seconds, then add the wine and mustard. Mix, then toss in the
mussels. Cover the pot and steam the little buggers until they
open. Serves two as a main dish or four in appetizer portions.
</P>
<P>
   Hood Canal Clams
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   72 hard-shell clams (or 5 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   16 ounces canned tomatoes, put through blender
</P>
<P>
   1 cup white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 stick butter (optional)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons dried basil
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in the clam pot. Saute the garlic 30 seconds then add
the remaining ingredients, cover and boil until all the clams are
open.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat, let sit 5 minutes and serve in soup plates
with chewy Italian bread.
</P>
<P>
   This serves four but do not furnish your guests with clam
grippers or they are liable to break your dining room window.

NO LEERING OR SIMPERING FOR THIS ROMEO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before Maxwell came back for his encore on Friday
night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden, the stage was set
with about a dozen lava lamps that glowed orange when he returned.
The lamps functioned the way his songs do; they set up a warm,
undulating, potentially hypnotic backdrop for romance. ``I admit
it,'' he said with a smile between songs. ``I made the records for
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell has emerged as the nice guy among rhythm-and-blues
Romeos, harking back to Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson while he
keeps his distance from hip-hop's roughneck machismo. He continues
to burnish a sincere persona that has garnered him two
million-selling albums, ``Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite'' and
``Embrya'' (both on Columbia), and he sold out three nights to
audiences dominated by squealing women. His opening act, the
comedian Melanie Comarcho, drew laughs and hoots of solidarity with
a female perspective on hip-hop's raunchy, materialistic carnality.
</P>
<P>
   In his songs Maxwell is assured but never pushy, lusty but
always respectful, and he insists he is seeking true love more than
a one-night stand. Taking his virility for granted instead of
touting it with hyperbole, he promises devotion with a boyish grin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get to know you,'' he insists. ``I can feel your
pain.'' He tells his intended that he will watch black-and-white
movies with her, take time for conversation, comb her hair and
serve her Cap'n Crunch, presumably for breakfast the next morning.
He dressed in good-guy white through his set, then switched to
tough-guy black for the encore.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's music is patient and suave, a promise of leisurely
sensuality. Languid vamps are paced by equable bass lines and
stitched together by wah-wah rhythm guitar, while his voice sinks
into the texture as a smooth but modest tenor. When he lets himself
grow most enamored, his voice rises to a supple, gorgeously
controlled falsetto, as if he were so close to his lover that his
voice had merged with hers.
</P>
<P>
   Where most current love songs either simper or leer, Maxwell
presents love as a force of nature, so intense that it can be
shattering. At the center of his set were ``Know These Things:
Shouldn't You'' and ``Gravity: Pushing to Pull,'' two pensive songs
from ``Embrya'' about love's trusting and terrifying intimacy. The
slowly tolling guitars in ``Know These Things'' summoned old scars
and the potential for violence; the bolero undercurrent in
``Gravity'' signaled an uncontrollable obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage the music suffered from a bottom-heavy mix; drums and
bass sometimes became a bludgeon rather than a heartbeat. Maxwell
showed off some limber dance moves and occasionally knelt in
supplication, and as he crooned about a desire so strong it could
break him down, he basked in affection. Women kept bringing
bouquets to the stage, and near the end of the concert one fan
rushed forward to hand him a box of Cap'n Crunch.

<P>
   TIMOR-REFUGEES (Kupang, Indonesia) _ As the refugees huddle in
makeshift camps here, militia men roam the grounds menacingly. They
harass aid workers and journalists who try to visit the camps. And
they search for refugees who they believe voted for independence
for East Timor in the recent referendum. The situation in Kupang,
the capital of West Timor, is not as desperate as in East Timor,
where anti-independence gangs have killed thousands and destroyed
the capital, Dili. But the fear here is pervasive and paralyzing.

   POWER-FAILURES (Chicago) _ Over and over again this summer, the
lights went out in this muscular, make-it-work city. Cities around
the country have faced similar frustrations during this sweltering
summer. In New York City, on one of the hottest days of the year, a
power cable short-circuited, leaving 200,000 homes in the
Washington Heights area powerless for 18 hours, the worst blackout
to hit the City in 22 years. Although the reasons behind the power
failures vary from place to place, they hint at deep-seated
problems at the nation's largest electric power companies.
Utilities that are now the lifeblood of the electronic age are
grappling with deregulation, an aging and long-neglected
infrastructure, new and sometimes confusing transmission systems,
and unprecedented demands for the electricity needed to power a
booming U.S. economy. By Pam Belluck and David Barboza.

`THE CATASTROPHIST': LOVE AMID CONGO TURBULENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Gillespie, the protagonist and seeing-I of Ronan Bennett's
marvelous new novel, ``The Catastrophist,'' is himself a writer,
the author of three novels, now working on a fourth. As he puts it,
he is a ``watcher,'' completely ``l'homme-plume.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is the writer's preference, for the margins, for
the avoidance of agglomerations and ranks.'' In a crisis he finds
himself thinking of Ruskin and ``his injunction: Does a man die at
your feet, your business is not to help him, but to note the color
of his lips.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty is that James has fallen in love with one Ines
Sabiani, a young Italian whom he meets in London through his
publisher and whom he describes as ``vital, subversive, impatient
and always a part of others' lives.'' Ines is a correspondent for
L'Unita, which she calls ``the Communist paper of Italy,'' and her
commitment to her work draws James out of the margins, first to
Ireland, giving him a chance to visit his mother in Belfast, and
then to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the ``The Catastrophist'' it is November 1959.
James is flying to join Ines in Leopoldville, capital of the
Belgian Congo, where she has found her latest cause in the person
of Patrice Lumumba, leader of the pro-independence party, the
Mouvement National Congolais, whom she insists she was the first to
recognize ``for the hopes he inspired and embodied.''
</P>
<P>
   At first you think that James' attraction to Ines is merely a
device to draw him into the heart of the Congo. And in fact Bennett
_ who like his protagonist is from Belfast, and who now makes his
home in England _ does an effortless job of sketching the
complicated political situation there. Through Ines, James meets
cynical journalists, Belgian settlers opposed to the independence
movement and assorted other memorable natives and colonials.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these are Mark Stipe, a beefy, authoritative
American who says he works ``at the consulate,'' and Auguste
Kilundu, Stipe's driver, who treats James with amused deference.
Stipe charms James, becomes his drinking partner, lends a
sympathetic ear to his most intimate troubles, even introduces him
to Lumumba and suggests that he start writing articles using inside
information that Stipe will be happy to feed him.
</P>
<P>
   What is Stipe really about? He's with the Central Intelligence
Agency, of course, insisting, ``I'd be happy with an independent
Congo as long as it were stable and well run.'' He tips James off
to the day that independence will come, enabling him to foresee a
picture, frightening to settlers, that is realized when thousands
of blacks march through Leopoldville.
</P>
<P>
   As James' narrative describes the scene: ``They walk at a
deliberate step, their eyes straight and implacably ahead,
expressions set with a confidence I have not seen before on black
faces: it is mixed with ostentation, borders on hostility. They
whip the air with palm fronds to make the violent hiss I first
heard in the apartment. The sound sends shivers down my spine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the love story of James and Ines keeps tugging at the
reader's sleeve, so arrestingly told that you have the unfair
thought that it must be based on an incident in the author's life.
Ines is driven, passionate and unself-consciously sexy. (After
seeing ``Love in the Afternoon,'' she remarks that Audrey Hepburn
``looks like me. ... Yes, ... she is very like me.'')
</P>
<P>
   James reports: ``I fell in love with Ines in bed. I fell in love
with her in the street, and in bars, and in the company of others,
watching the expressions on her face as she talked and argued,
listening to the little grunts and sighs and sharp inhalations of
breath. Most of all, I believe, I fell in love because she was
promising me a way out of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Congo brings out everything that is flawed in their
affair. She wants him to become politically engaged. He disdains
her inability to be objective. He thinks of her as a fuzzy
romantic. She calls him ``in Italian it would be catastrofista _ a
catastrophist'' and says, ``Is there this word?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only ever heard it used in a geological sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As usual! English is always so poor. The meaning of this word
is much bigger. If you are catastrofista no problem is small.
Nothing can be fixed; it is always the end.''
</P>
<P>
   James becomes close to Stipe, whom Ines dislikes and mistrusts.
She then takes up with Auguste, Stipe's driver, who evolves from
servitude to defiance of Stipe and James. In the background the
Congo tragedy plays itself out _ Lumumba's drift from American to
Soviet support; America's consequent shift to backing the eventual
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, the subsequent death of Lumumba and his
companions _ yet never once do large events become detached from
the intimate foreground.
</P>
<P>
   In that foreground James is eventually trapped into a commitment
that perfectly reflects the conflict between his mind and his
heart, which, despite the tortured choice he makes, he never can
reconcile.
</P>
<P>
   The result is irresistible: as melodrama, as psychological
portrait and as a story of moral conflict. Previously James has
reported how early in his career his publisher ``reminded me that
Stendhal had once said that politics in a work of art is like a
pistol shot going off at a concert.'' Yet in ``The Catastrophist''
Bennett has written a political novel with many shots going off but
with every sound in tune.

   TIMOR-PORTUGAL _LISBON, Portugal _ Although Portugal is too poor
and powerless to protect the people of its former colony, East
Timor, news reports of widespread murders by pro-Indonesian
militiamen have stimulated an outpouring of pro-Timorese sentiment
among the Portugese people. (Nesmith, Cox News Service) MOVED

   GHB _ It is labeled as a solvent and sold by the shot in some
bars. Some people get it at vitamin and health food stores. You
don't have to be 21 to buy it, but it packs a wallop that leaves as
many as 10 people a week comatose in Atlanta emergency rooms. The
Food and Drug Administration banned uncontrolled sales of the drug
gamma hydroxybutyrate, called GHB, in 1990. But for the last
decade, sellers have found ways around the law, selling the
ingredients to make the easily formulated drug or selling slightly
altered chemical compounds, called GBL, BD or 2(3H)-Furanone
di-hydro, as solvents. When an suburban Atlanta teen-ager overdosed
recently, it sparked an investigation into the drug's availability
that is still continuing. (Quinn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   ELKINS _ A Florida man killed himself Friday after New York
police interviewed him about a body found in an oil drum stored for
decades in a house he once owned. The unraveling of Howard Elkins,
of the Crescent Lakes gated community, started late this summer
when Ronald Cohen sold his split-level home in Jericho, N.Y., for
$455,000. Elkins had owned the home 27 years before. All that
separated Cohen from his money was the disposal of a rusting,
345-pound oil drum that had been rotting in an attic crawl space
for more than 25 years. Cohen opened the barrel Sept. 2 and found
the mummified body of a pregnant woman.(Lambert, Palm Beach Post)

CHIP SET IS INTRODUCED THAT MIGHT CUT COST OF CELL PHONES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analog Devices Inc. plans to introduce a new chip product Monday
that it says will reduce the cost of the radio part of cellular
phones, while increasing battery life.
</P>
<P>
   The chip set, a tiny assembly of components, allows for 1,000
hours of standby time for cell telephones. Users could leave the
phone switched on for a month and a half between charges, Analog
Devices said, though it would have to be charged more often,
depending on the frequency and length of calls.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip set, called Othello, is aimed initially at a new
generation of cellular telephones based on a transmission format
called GSM, which has already gained broad acceptance in Europe but
so far is used in only a few metropolitan markets in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But Analog Devices said the lower cost and power requirements of
the new chip set will also allow for the creation of fast wireless
connection devices for palm-size computers and laptops. Analog
Devices aid Othello enabled wireless data rates of up to 30 times
faster than the 14.4 kilobits a second available today, which would
aid wireless versions of data-intensive applications like Internet
browsing, electronic mail, games and video.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Analog Devices closed on Friday at $56.25 on the New
York Stock Exchange, close to their 52-week high of $57.50. The
company, which is based in Norwood, Mass., has benefited from a
stronger-than-expected market for analog chips _ processors that
convert real-world information, like the human voice, into
electrical signals.
</P>
<P>
   Strong sales of analog products also played a big role in the
National Semiconductor Corp.'s surprise return to profitability in
its most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analog chips process ``linear signals,'' where information like
sound or video is represented by continuous fluctuations of voltage
and current, rather than broken down into a pattern corresponding
to the ones and zeros of digital code. The growth of digital
communications has, perhaps surprisingly, prompted a growth spurt
for analog devices, which play a major role in cell phones,
monitors and modems, as well as many consumer electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices said it achieved the performance breakthroughs in
its new chip set by reducing the number of chips needed to convert
radio frequency signals of 900 megahertz to 1,900 megahertz down to
so-called base-band rates of one or two megahertz, where digital
signal processors can more easily convert them to digital form.
Othello is the first commercially available chip set to use this
direct-conversion technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go all the way in one integrated circuit, to base-band
levels where digital processors can take that and generate speech
or data,'' said Russ Johnsen, vice president, communications
products division, for Analog Devices. ``Every other radio goes
through multiple intermediate steps. When you eliminate all those
intermediate frequencies it drives a lot of the cost out of the
system.'' With only two chips, the Othello chip set also consumes
far less power, extending battery life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analog Devices estimates that the Othello chip set will lower
the cost of the radio frequency part of a cellular phone from
current levels of $15 to 18 to less than $10. The company is
producing small samples of the chip set, but expects to begin
volume shipments by the middle of next year. So far just one
manufacturer, Siemens, has said it will use the chip set in a cell
phone, but Johnsen said Analog Devices was in talks with all the
major producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has actually been able to make a radio good enough for
the carriers to approve it using this direct conversion
technology,'' said Barney Dewey, an analyst with the Andrew Seybold
Group. ``So if they've cracked the code on that, this really is a
significant breakthrough. The one issue that's still unclear to me
is if they can get the major players to sign on.''

SUMMER BLACKOUTS HINT AT POWER INDUSTRY'S PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., La., Ind., Wis., New England, Pa., Md., Fla.)  (lb) 
 By PAM BELLUCK and DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Over and over again this summer, the lights went out
in this muscular, make-it-work city.
</P>
<P>
   There was the blistering midsummer weekend when temperatures
topped 100 degrees and up to 100,000 homes in the Chicago area lost
power _ a weekend in which officials recorded more than 50
heat-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   There was the day the power company, faced with trouble in two
transformers, plunged Chicago's downtown Loop into darkness in the
middle of the afternoon, leaving 2,300 businesses in the dark,
trapping people in elevators, short-circuiting federal court
proceedings and even silencing the cacophony at the Chicago Board
of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the Sunday when power failures prevented the
city's Field Museum of Natural History from opening its doors on
what was supposed to be one of the summer's busiest weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Seething with anger, Mayor Richard M. Daley denounced
Commonwealth Edison, the giant utility whose power system was at
fault because, among other things, it had failed to replace
insulators made of plastic that were so old and faulty that most
utilities got rid of similar ones decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sick and tired of them,'' the mayor said of the power
company, ``and they had better change.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities around the United States have faced similar frustrations.
In New York, on one of the hottest days of the year, a power cable
short-circuited, leaving 200,000 homes in the Washington Heights
section of Manhattan powerless for 18 hours, the worst blackout to
hit the city in 22 years. In New Orleans, power-plant failures led
to blackouts that disrupted service for more than half a million
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the power failures vary, but they all hint at
deep-seated problems at the nation's largest electric-power
companies. Utilities that are now the lifeblood of the electronic
age are grappling with deregulation, aging and long-neglected
equipment, new and sometimes confusing transmission networks and
unprecedented demands for electricity to power the technology
behind a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Utility experts are warning that the industry's emergency power
reserves are getting dangerously low, largely as a result of a
decade-long reluctance by utilities to build new power plants,
because of the costs and uncertainty of power demands.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been a significant number of blackouts in the
last few years, the high temperatures this summer thrust the
utilities' problems into a particularly harsh spotlight, raising
questions about whether they are adequately prepared to cope with
the nation's soaring energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been several high-profile outages that have caused
people to get excited about reliability issues,'' said Eugene
Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the North American Electric Reliability
Council, an industry trade group in Princeton, N.J. ``It's not that
the system is falling apart. But as you look at the next 10 years,
you don't want to wait for things to fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has announced an investigation
of the power failures. Some elected officials have filed suit
against power companies over failures or taken steps to lure
competing utilities in the hopes of creating alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   And regulators in several states are considering forcing
utilities to pay a penalty for periods when they fail to provide
power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've heard as much complaining about electric
utilities and shortages and outages in a long time,'' said Robert
Burns, a senior researcher at the National Regulatory Research
Institute, which does studies for state public utility commissions.
``It's been decades since there have been this many problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the nation's utilities are redoubling their efforts
to make sure this summer's experience is not repeated. Some are
scrutinizing maintenance practices or, like Commonwealth Edison in
Chicago, firing top-level executives. Others are trying to
accelerate the pace at which they are building new plants, with
their earlier reluctance overcome by the need for more power.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, executives at the nation's biggest utilities say
the high-profile power failures are not representative of the
industry. Yet many of them acknowledge that the utility industry is
struggling through a period of major change. The advent of
deregulation of the industry that began with the federal government
meant new competition, new challenges and new sources of power.
</P>
<P>
   Many utilities now have to open their transmission lines to
competitors, which has spawned the buying and selling of power
across regions. Florida utilities now sell to the Southeast,
Wisconsin utilities sell to the East, and New England power
companies sell to the Middle Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have utilities that are running power from region to
region, so you have a lot of traffic,'' said Patrice Hagmann, a
spokeswoman at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group in
Washington for shareholder-owned electric companies. ``You may need
a traffic cop to control things.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government previously regulated transmission lines
that crossed state boundaries. States have the power to control
utilities within their borders, and many still do, while other
states have freed the companies of controls in the hope that
competition will bring less expensive electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, where a series of power failures inflamed a city and
its outspoken mayor this summer, the problem was faulty
transformers and wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outages revealed a number of weaknesses and shortcomings
in our system,'' said David Helwig, interim senior vice president
of transmission and distribution at Commonwealth Edison. ``Quite
frankly, many of the problems can be traced to maintenance that
wasn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has suffered through power failures before, including a
serious power failure in a heat wave in 1995 in which there were
more than 400 heat-related deaths over a monthlong period.
</P>
<P>
   Although industry experts say that Commonwealth Edison, which is
owned by Unicom Inc., has improved the operation of its five
nuclear plants in recent years, its substations, cables and the
distribution networks that serve the greater Chicago area have long
been neglected.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Commonwealth Edison crews still use an old
plastic, Bakelite, as the insulator in its cables. ``That stuff was
starting to be replaced years and years ago,'' said Burns at the
National Regulatory Research Institute. ``Talking about Bakelite is
kind of like talking about having a rotary phone. There shouldn't
be as much of that stuff out there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that outdated and inadequate plants could continue to
short-circuit the city's power and eventually turn into a political
liability, Daley insisted that Commonwealth Edison institute
round-the-clock inspections of its equipment. In recent months,
Commonwealth Edison has acknowledged major technical and public
relations blunders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This level of service under these conditions is a disgrace to
us,'' John Rowe, the chief executive, said at a news conference
after the latest power failure. ``It's a personal disgrace to me. I
will not tolerate it, and you will not have to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth Edison has tried to make amends by holding public
forums, offering cash refunds to some customers and promising swift
changes at the top. Rowe fired two high-level executives and
promised to spend $1.4 billion over the next three years to upgrade
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a few weeks ago, Chicago began courting a subsidiary of
Wisconsin Energy Corp. with the promise of donating land to help
the utility build a new power plant, opening the door to an
alternative source of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, there are similar concerns about an aging
power system and soaring demand. Indeed, the administration of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has already filed suit against Consolidated
Edison, charging the utility with ``gross negligence'' in the
Washington Heights blackout.
</P>
<P>
   But Con Edison officials say they are operating one of the most
reliable utilities in the nation, yet one that is at times
vulnerable to extreme weather and extreme demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the underground equivalent of an earthquake with all
the heat and humidity,'' said Mary McCartney, a spokeswoman. ``If
we didn't take the network off-line it was basically going to
destroy itself.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day the power failed, energy consumption hit a record
11,850 megawatts in the New York City region, Ms. McCartney said.
The utility's capacity is 12,000 megawatts, with an 18 percent
buffer, clearly straining the system and raising questions about
whether Con Edison has enough power to meet demands and extreme
weather conditions. The utility admits that, this summer, demand
was 10 percent higher than it had projected.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison buys the bulk of its power from other utility
companies, in places like Pennsylvania and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have been equally burdened this summer, but for
differing reasons. In Louisiana, the big utility, Entergy Corp.,
said that unusually high demand for power in the four states it
serves created an extensive power failure; four or five power
plants malfunctioned at about the time the Tennessee Valley
Authority decided to stop shipping power to the utility, because of
heavy demand in other regions. Crippled by these events, Entergy
decided to shut down power to hundreds of thousands of its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was extraordinarily high demand and we just didn't have
enough power to cover it,'' said Carol Clawson, a spokeswoman at
Entergy, which is based in New Orleans. ``One of the dilemmas
utilities have is: How do you prepare for this kind of thing? Do
you go out and build extra power plants to prepare for a
once-in-a-decade event? And do you charge customers for that? Do
you build additional generation because you think one day in July
it will be really, really hot?''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns about periodic power failures,
Richardson, the energy secretary, announced in July an initiative
to help prevent major power failures, including the creation of a
team of experts to investigate blackouts, pushing for new standards
to reduce energy consumption, and trying to determine whether there
is a shortage of power plants and transmission facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should not have to wonder whether the lights will go
out when the thermometer hits 90 degrees,'' Richardson said.
``While the causes of recent power outages are still being
reviewed, the fact is that some systems are being stretched to the
limit. Clearly there is cause for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts, however, point out that the nation's utilities
are not in crisis mode; service is generally reliable. But power
companies need to move swiftly if they are going to meet growing
customer demands.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent figures available show that the nation's
consumption of electric power rose to 3,367 billion kilowatt hours
in 1998, up from 2,578 billion kilowatt hours in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials say the power plants now being built may not
keep up with growing consumption. In 1990, there was a 22 percent
cushion of extra power available for emergency use in the United
States. That figure fell to 16 percent in 1997, and it is expected
to drop to 10 percent by 2007 if consumption continues to grow at
the current pace, according to the Edison Electric Institute.
</P>
<P>
   While the utilities say they are working aggressively to meet
the challenges, Robert K. Johnson, the executive director of the
Electric Consumers' Alliance in Indianapolis, said regulators need
to keep a watchful eye on the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that the outages, while they may individually be
explainable in different ways, collectively could be symptoms of
transitional problems in the industry that need to be addressed,''
Johnson said.

AFTER PROMISING A REVOLUTION, TWO COMPANIES SHOW PROGRESS IN GROUP
BUYING  
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BOB TEDESCHI   
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is ground zero for outsized declarations from
companies that promise to revolutionize, reinvent or obliterate
parts of the retail industry with business plans unimaginable in
pre-Web days.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, two companies with similar business models,
Mercata and Accompany, were started amid such fanfare, promising to
revolutionize e-commerce by attracting groups of buyers interested
in a certain product and extracting wholesale prices from
manufacturers and distributors. As middlemen, the companies would
exact a fee on each sale. In a win-win-win strategy, manufacturers
would sell items in bulk, customers would get lower prices, and
Mercata and Accompany would join the pantheon of e-commerce stars.
</P>
<P>
   But several months later, the revolution seems far off, with
neither site having spent enough money on marketing to attract
large numbers of users. There are some promising signs, however:
More manufacturers are showing interest, giving the sites access to
more brands, and the number of buyers seems to be increasing on
both sites. And with more marketing money on the way, analysts say,
the companies could start realizing their goals.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the group-buying method, combining the aspects of an
online auction and a low-risk opportunity to find inexpensive
goods, seems well suited to the Internet. Typically, the sites
offer goods for limited amounts of time and mark down the price as
more people make offers.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, for example, Mercata offered a Ryobi drill at a
starting price of $40. As more visitors bid, the price dropped.
When the so-called power buy was finished four days later, 500
people had bought the drill for $34 _ well below the suggested
retail price of $89. Even those who had bid higher got the $34
price, while those who had made lower offers clicked away
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Accompany, which sells more high-technology goods, uses a
similar bidding method. Earlier this month, Accompany listed a Palm
V organizer for $350, a price comparable with those of lower-price
online retailers. Once Accompany had more than 20 bids at that
amount, the price dropped to $325, where it stayed until the
bidding was closed two days later, with 75 buyers. Accompany
negotiates with the manufacturers beforehand to determine a scale
of prices based on the number of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The risk for early buyers, of course, is that they will jump in
at the higher price and risk having to pay it if no one else joins
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is a cross between the prisoner's dilemma and the
bystander effect,'' said Greg Kahn, chief executive of Webehavior,
a research firm. ``If they all cooperate, they will reap a greater
benefit, but cooperation puts them at risk _ as in the prisoner's
dilemma. That leads everyone to wait for someone else to jump in
first _ which is the bystander effect.''
</P>
<P>
   These group dynamics, he said, ``can really only be eliminated
by setting the initial price at or below the market price.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies seem poised to do that. Accompany can offer lower
prices in part because it does not ship products; the manufacturers
ship directly to buyers. Accompany charges suppliers between 2
percent and 8 percent of the sale for each bulk purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata, which sells a wider range of goods, employs a hybrid
approach. Some of its suppliers ship directly to customers, others
through distributors. When necessary, Mercata accepts inventory
from the manufacturer and ships through Hanover Direct, a
subsidiary of Keystone Fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Mercata and Accompany declined to disclose traffic or revenue
figures, but executives from both companies said they remained
optimistic. ``So far, we've exceeded all expectations,'' said Tom
Van Horn, Mercata's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising statistic, he said, is the popularity of
power buys, as their time-limited group offerings are known.
``We've held power buys where our participants exceeded 1,000
people,'' he said. ``When you go after a specific product in a
limited window of time, that's a number that's very valuable to a
manufacturer.'' He predicted between 10,000 and 20,000 buyers for
some sales by year's end, based in part on his plans to spend $20
million to $30 million on marketing in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marc Johnson, an e-commerce analyst with Jupiter Communications,
sees such marketing as imperative because ``this is a situation
where critical mass is absolutely crucial, so marketing and traffic
is like oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing is getting more difficult and expensive, Johnson said,
given the growing demand for prime advertising spots on portal
sites like America Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   But the group-buying sites have something other online retailers
lack: stickiness. As with auction sites, customers return to the
Mercata and Accompany sites frequently to check on their purchases.
Because portals need return customers to bolster their advertising
revenue, they have been willing to view group-buying sites as
partners rather than as tenants. Both companies have negotiated
partnerships in which the bidding will occur on a portal site _
Mercata on Microsoft's MSN, Accompany on Excite _ and they say more
such deals are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Another key to success is the participation of major brand-name
manufacturers. Both companies report some hesitation by companies
reluctant to do business over the Internet using a new retail
approach. But executives from both companies said they had made
significant progress in signing up suppliers. ``In manufacturing
circles, people discuss things,'' said Van Horn, of Mercata. ``So
signing Toshiba, RCA, Harman Kardon and Sharp helped us add
Panasonic, Canon and Philips.''
</P>
<P>
   Salim Teja, Accompany's co-founder and vice president for
strategic development, also said ``things are getting better'' with
manufacturers _ particularly those, like 3Com, that have
significantly increased production on certain items and now want to
avoid having excess inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on everyone's radar screen now, which is what we wanted
to do,'' Teja said. ``Now that we have some momentum and customers,
people are willing to take a step back and re-evaluate us.''

CON ARTISTS INCREASINGLY TARGETING BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY SMALL
ONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers aren't the only people who get ripped off by con
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses _ especially smaller ones _ are growing targets of
increasingly clever schemes to rip them off.
</P>
<P>
   Every year businesses lose hundreds of millions of dollars to
con artists selling listings in fake directories,
too-good-to-be-true office supply deals, bogus loans and
non-existent charities.
</P>
<P>
   They get away with it because many businesses don't have
adequate procedures for approving bills before they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has reached such proportions that a group of
agencies plans to meet next week in Washington, D.C., to brainstorm
strategies companies can use to reduce their vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The round table includes the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the
Yellow Pages Publishing Association, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Small Business Administration, the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, the American Chamber of Commerce Association, the
Department of Justice, the National Association of Attorneys
General and the National Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   Poor communication within companies is one of the main reasons
businesses get taken, said Robyn Frankel, a St. Louis consultant
who has chaired the business scam round table since it began three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Yellow Pages Publishers Association and
the Council of Better Business Bureaus, for example, showed that 90
percent of individuals who pay bills in companies have other major
responsibilities besides handling accounts payable. In addition, 40
percent of companies don't require a second approval before bills
are paid.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it easier for bogus bills to get paid
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Although the schemers target companies large and small, it's the
smaller ones with fewer checks and balances that get taken most
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a numbers game,'' Frankel said. ``It's who's not
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   When businesses let their ``fingers do the walking,'' for
example, the fingers often walk off with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ``walking fingers'' logo was never trademarked, phony
Yellow Pages billing schemes cost companies about $550 million a
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Pages is the most widely targeted medium for con
artists, making Yellow Pages advertisers especially susceptible to
phony solicitations, Frankel said. Sometimes a crook will simply
clip a company's legitimate Yellow Pages ad and send it to the
business with a ``renewal'' notice and bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scams never go away,'' she said. ``There's always a new
twist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also a fertile new medium for scam artists.
Billings for Internet directories, for example, are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent tactic is sending a mailing to ``confirm your
address.'' Although the mailing may say ``This is not a bill'' on
the front, there may be fine print on the back stating that
confirming the address results in a billing and automatic renewal
for every directory issued thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Or people may get phony refund checks that, once cashed, trigger
all kinds of unwanted billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going out of business'' sales with rock-bottom prices on
office supplies are another hook so-called ``paper pirates'' use to
scam businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Shady ``service reps'' sometimes show up at company doors with
work orders, then walk out the door with expensive office equipment
that needs to be ``repaired.'' Neither the rep nor the equipment is
seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses don't bother to report rip-offs, which allows
the schemes to proliferate. One of the goals of the round table
meeting is to increase business awareness about the scams and
encourage more reporting, Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some steps companies can take to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Look at all bills carefully, and doublecheck them against your
files for pending contracts to make sure the mailing relates to
legitimate advertising or merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   If something seems questionable, contact the local Better
Business Bureau to see whether there is information on the company
originating the invoice.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect a scam, alert the state Attorney General's
Office, the local postal inspector or the Council of Better
Business Bureaus. Agencies receiving complaints now feed them to a
central database maintained by the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Warn others in the company if suspect billings are making the
rounds. Don't make commitments to unknown people over the phone.
Get contracts in writing. When dealing with publications, get
verifiable circulation figures, publication dates and sample copies
before signing up.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Powerful Hurricane Floyd, which will be a threat to Eastern
Seaboard later in the week, will begin to affect the central and
southern Bahamas Monday with bands of rain and increasing winds.
The center of storm, where winds will exceed 120 mph, will stay
over the ocean Monday as it moves to the west-northwest along the
southern flank of a sprawling high pressure area over the central
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Dry weather with plenty of sunshine will linger near most of the
East Coast. After a cool dawn, afternoon temperatures will average
at or slightly above seasonal values from New England to the Middle
Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front accompanied by a narrow band of thundershowers will
affect the eastern parts of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and
Tennessee Valley. Monday night, the front will begin to slow down
as high-level steering winds shift and begin to blow nearly
parallel to the front over the Eastern States. These high-level
winds from the south are expected to draw Hurricane Floyd north
near the Southeast coast Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the cold front, windy and very cool weather will
spread from the northern Plains to the western Great Lakes. Clouds
and scattered showers will occur in the chilly air from the eastern
Dakotas to the northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, offshore winds will bring unseasonable heat to the
Northwest coast. Most of the Southwest will be very warm with ample
sun, however, clouds and afternoon thundershowers will be scattered
from eastern Arizona to western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Past Peak &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Floyd strengthened north of the Antilles during the
weekend as the historical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season
passed. In about 90 percent of the years since 1886, at least one
tropical storm or hurricane has raged in the Atlantic on Sept. 10
and 11. No other dates have had more storms. Atlantic water
temperatures peak in early September, providing optimum conditions
for tropical storms which draw energy from the warmth of the ocean.
At the same time, the strong high-level winds associated with the
jet stream which are capable of tearing a storm apart are typically
still far to the north. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Extended Forecast &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Thursday _ Wind and rain associated with Hurricane
Floyd will affect parts of the Southeast coast on Wednesday. Damp
weather and increasing wind is expected to reach the Middle
Atlantic and Northeast coasts during Thursday. Meanwhile, high
pressure will promote dry and cool weather in the Middle West and
much of the Southeast. Most of the West will be warm and dry. Some
thunder will occur over the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Saturday _ Rain will end in the Northeast as gusty winds
from the northwest develop. Very cool air and a few afternoon
showers will cover the Great Lakes and interior Northeast. The
Southeast will stay mainly sunny with comfortable humidity.
Meanwhile, the Plains will be dry and warmer although clouds will
increase in the north. The Northwest will turn cooler while the
Southwest stays very warm with afternoon mountain thunder. &QL;

   POWER-FAILURES (Chicago) _ Over and over again this summer, the
lights went out in this muscular, make-it-work city. Cities around
the country have faced similar frustrations during this sweltering
summer. In New York City, on one of the hottest days of the year, a
power cable short-circuited, leaving 200,000 homes in the
Washington Heights area powerless for 18 hours, the worst blackout
to hit the City in 22 years. Although the reasons behind the power
failures vary from place to place, they hint at deep-seated
problems at the nation's largest electric power companies.
Utilities that are now the lifeblood of the electronic age are

BUCHANAN LOOKING AT LAUNCHING REFORM PARTY BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lagging badly in his quest for the Republican
presidential nomination, Patrick Buchanan said Sunday that he was
strongly leaning toward switching to a run for the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door really is wide open,'' said Buchanan, a proven
electoral spoiler. ``We are very close to making that decision,''
he said on NBC-TV complaining that the Republican contest was
``closed and rigged'' with the big-money candidacies of Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas and Steve Forbes, the self-financed millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction from Reform Party officials was mixed but
far from forbidding at the possibility of Buchanan creating a
three-way contest of the presidential campaign. His presence on a
Reform ballot might be expected to drain conservative support from
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican nomination whose early
dominance has left Buchanan and the rest of the GOP field
struggling for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he starts meeting people in the party, I think people
will be willing to go and work their hearts out for him,'' said Pat
Choate, who was the vice presidential nominee of the Reform Party
in 1996 and remains a popular figure in the party. He said that he
had talked with Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's sister and chief
strategist, nearly every day for the last six weeks, and that he
believed Buchanan would announce his defection within the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the party's biggest success
story, has been wary of Buchanan as a ``retread'' and prefers to
press the search for a more centrist presidential candidate. ``He
has social issues that he puts very strongly on the front burner,
and we in the Reform Party tend to leave social issues aside,''
Ventura said last summer in trying to discourage speculation of a
Buchanan crossover.
</P>
<P>
   Dean M. Barkley, who was chairman of Ventura's campaign and
remains a close adviser, said Sunday in an interview that
Buchanan's stances on abortion and other social issues would pose
``a huge hurdle for Buchanan to sell himself to the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley conceded Buchanan's proven popularity could make him
a serious contender for the nomination next year under the party's
complex open petition system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a huge recruiting battle between those who
support Buchanan and those who hopefully will unite behind a
centrist candidate,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he would decide on a possible Reform bid by
mid-October. ``We're leaning in that direction right now _
strongly,'' he said on ``Meet the Press,'' emphasizing that he
would like to speak with Ventura and with Ross Perot, the
millionaire who created the Reform Party as his 1992 presidential
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we have is a one-party system in Washington,
D.C., that is masquerading as a two-party system, and I think what
we need is a real opposition party,'' he said, describing the GOP
as a ``Xerox copy'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had no immediate reaction to Buchanan's threat to defect.
The Bush campaign office noted that Bush previously had expressed
his hope to Buchanan directly that he stay in the party as a proven
conservative leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, a tireless, fiery campaigner who won the 1996 New
Hampshire Republican primary, clearly was using his appearance on
national television Sunday to try to reclaim some of the political
spotlight that lately has been scarce in his campaign rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time maybe to take a bye in the regionals and go straight
to the finals,'' said Buchanan, using a sports allusion in his
threat to drop from the GOP primary route and focus instead on the
Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Russell J. Verney, the Reform Party chairman and a longtime aide
to Perot, said Bay Buchanan called him within the past two weeks
and sought a detailed briefing about the requirements for seeking
the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform rules require a prospective nominee to make a
good-faith effort to qualify for the ballot in the 29 states, plus
the District of Columbia, where the party does not have an
automatic slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained the scope of the task, which I'm sure is an
eye-opener to anyone who hasn't been through it,'' Verney said.
``It ranges from states where just a fee or a few hundred
signatures are required, to states where you have to get 30,000 or
40,000 signatures within very strict time limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that on July 1, party officials would determine
which candidates had made a sufficient effort to be placed on the
ballot for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late July, ballots are to be sent to people who
signed a petition, or are on the rosters of state Reform Party
organizations, or request one. Voting will be by telephone, mail or
Internet. The result will be announced at the Reform Party
convention next August in Long Beach, Calif. Delegates can overturn
the result with a two-thirds vote, but Verney said that was simply
a safety valve in case only a fringe candidate qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Perot had not changed his position that he would
support whoever is nominated by the party. ``He's made no
indication that he has any interest in it,'' Verney said. On Jan.
1, Verney is to be succeeded as chairman by John J. Gargan of
Florida, who had been endorsed by Ventura of Minnesota and was
elected at the party's national convention in July.

PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS RETURN HOME FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ As a group of Puerto Rican nationalists
returned home to the cheers of supporters and relatives, the
political firestorm surrounding their release from prison continued
unabated here.
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared that most Puerto Ricans supported their
release, only a minority of islanders share the radical
pro-independence politics of the nationalists, who were released on
Friday under a conditional clemency offer extended by President
Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   If supporters of independence welcomed them as heroes, some
supporters of statehood derided them as terrorists. Still, many
islanders said they felt the nationalists had more than paid for
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   They had served almost 20 years each on sentences ranging from
35 to 90 years. All of them had been imprisoned on sedition and
weapons convictions stemming from their involvement in the Armed
Forces of National Liberation, a pro-independence group blamed for
130 bombings in the United States that killed six people and
wounded dozens of others from 1974 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing they are released, because it was too harsh
a sentence. They should have been released years ago,'' said Asha
Cintron, 26, a bartender in Old San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fighting for a cause,'' said Iris Vega, 32, an
artist. ``They haven't killed anyone. They haven't raped anyone.
Why should they be in prison more than 20 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Cortes, 44, was the first of the former prisoners to
arrive in San Juan, late Friday. Elizam Escobar, Adolfo Matos,
Dylcia Noemi Pagan, Alicia Rodriguez, Ida Luz Rodriguez and Carmen
Valentin arrived on Saturday. Ricardo Jimenez and Luis Rosa had not
yet arrived by late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Alberto Rodriguez and Alejandrina Torres, decided to
stay in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving in San Juan, all the prisoners thanked their
supporters, while lamenting the fact that other Puerto Rican
nationalists remained imprisoned. Despite their standard parole
conditions, which bar them from meeting with one another or with
other convicted felons, they said they would continue to struggle
for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the celebrations at the airport, members of the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party, meeting at the weekend for
their annual convention, worried about the effect the issue of
clemency for the radicals could have on relations between the
United States and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The party's secretary-general, Jorge Davila, a former tourism
director, said the controversy involving the release of the
nationalists and the backlash on the mainland against Clinton's
clemency offer could hurt tourism, one of Puerto Rico's main
sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the controversy could shape the outcome of the
struggle over the off-shore island of Vieques. The Puerto Rican
government wants the U.S. Navy to stop military maneuvers on the
island and return the land the Navy controls there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vieques issue has brought about a rare consensus of the
island's pro-statehood, pro-commonwealth and pro-independence
factions. Clinton has appointed a panel to investigate whether
there are feasible alternatives for Vieques. The panel will release
its recommendations this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expressing concern over the nationalists' release
was Carlos Romero Barcelo, the former governor of Puerto Rico who
is now the island's sole representative to the U.S. Congress.
Romero Barcelo, who has called the prisoners terrorists, told
reporters he was worried that the controversy might harm the
statehood movement's main goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we ask for equality for Puerto Rico if in Puerto Rico
people defend those who have declared war on the United States?''
Romero Barcelo said.
</P>
<P>
   While Puerto Ricans revel in their national pride, there is
little outright support for independence, which garnered less than
3 percent of the vote in a 1998 referendum. The statehood movement,
which has been growing, pulled down 46 percent of that vote.

REDGRAVE DELIVERS A FEAST TO ARTS-STARVED KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ First NATO arrived in Kosovo with tanks
and guns for security, then the United Nations with money and
shelter, and now Vanessa Redgrave has come to minister to the
Kosovars' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as the U.N. Children's Fund special representative
for the performing arts, Ms. Redgrave, the British actress,
organized a three-day festival of dance, music and theater this
weekend, persuading some illustrious names to come to war-ravaged
Pristina, the Kosovo capital, to perform along with Albanian
artists for a culture-starved population.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few days she has been a familiar sight around
Pristina, wearing an air of slight eccentricity amid the bustle of
last-minute organizing. She is a distinctive figure, whether
pushing her troupe of helpers through the border controls or
standing on the steps of Kosovo's National Theater, bending her
tall, slim frame and peering through rose-tinted glasses to talk to
her Albanian colleagues, all of whom seem smaller than she.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening event in the theater, the director and playwright
Enver Petrovci, a Pristina native, likened her to Mother Teresa,
who inspired a network of medical clinics all over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Mother Teresa did here for medicine, Vanessa Redgrave did
for cultural humanism,'' he said. ``So I will introduce her as
Mother Vanessa.''
</P>
<P>
   The praise may have been rather elaborate, but there were some
powerful emotions running through the performances that made for an
exceptional, if somewhat jumbled, occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers of the Martha Graham company flew in from New York to
perform two pieces, ``Lamentation'' and ``Errand Into the Maze,''
which Ms. Redgrave had specifically requested for their examination
of pain and suffering. The dancers performed without their sets,
which arrived in Pristina as the performance was already under way.
The pianist Katharina Wolpe played a Schubert Impromptu, hobbling
onto the stage after a crashing fall in the pitch-black wings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Redgrave was to have performed a monologue from ``The
Cursed,'' a 10-year-old play by Petrovci that was never performed
here. With her voice weakening, and too rushed to learn her words,
Ms. Redgrave passed that one by, but spoke at length to introduce
her colleagues and explain her whole mission, severely testing her
translator in the process.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, there was no doubt that the
festival, titled ``The Return,'' was a symbol of their new-won
freedom, the end of the war and their return to their homes and
cultural life from the refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first time something big is happening here in 10
years,'' said Alberta Troni, 23, a music professor at Pristina
University.
</P>
<P>
   With the growing isolation of Yugoslavia during 10 years of wars
and sanctions, Kosovars had had virtually no contact with the
outside world, let alone such guest appearances as these. The
ethnic Albanians had no access to the theaters and concert halls or
the university in Pristina, which became the domain of Serbs only.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 10 years the Serbs never allowed us to play here,'' Ms.
Troni said. ``The concerts we held were in private houses or a
small hall.'' This was the first time she had even attended a
performance in the theater, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to set up their own faculty of arts after being expelled
from the university, the ethnic Albanians had only one piano for
teaching, practicing and performing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the majority of the Serbs living in Kosovo have fled
following NATO's arrival, the Albanians have now taken over the
theaters, concert halls and university. They have plenty of pianos
now, although not a single trained piano tuner in the city.
</P>
<P>
   As for the artists, despite qualms about danger, precarious
stages and other installations, and an arduous journey into Kosovo,
they said the unusual circumstances made it worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sets did not arrive, but in a sense it was very
appropriate to be in that rough sense, stripped of that comfort,''
said Terese Capucilli, principal dancer and associate artistic
director of the Martha Graham Company, who performed ``Errand Into
the Maze'' with Martin Lofsnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rare for an artist to have the opportunity to share what
we do and love what is our life in a situation like this,'' she
said. ``The response was very, very warm. One young actor said to
me, `If your intention was to touch our souls, you have done
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wolpe, a Holocaust survivor, found herself reading the music
she was to perform on the bus ride into Kosovo. ``It's your worst
nightmare, going on stage doing a piece you do not know,'' she
said. ``But I found it a great honor to play for these people, who
have not heard anything but gunshots for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater aims of the whole event, that of peace and
tolerance, lay more mute. Dennis McNamara of Unicef touched on it
in a speech. ```The Return' signifies the return of artistic
life,'' he said. ``But for Kosovo it is much wider, the return to a
free, liberated Kosovo, a free society and free communities. In the
broader sense it means tolerance, living together and living in a
normal society.''
</P>
<P>
   His words came amid the background of a still violent Kosovo,
where the Albanians are now safely home, but their return has been
marred by revenge attacks on the other minorities in Kosovo, namely
the Serbs and the Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   As the festival continued Sunday with more music and a gala
evening, the nobler aims appeared rather remote. The French rock
star Patricia Kaas was expected to arrive on a French military jet
and play along with the British stars Lulu, Big Country and half a
dozen other bands. For the young audience, the boys and girls of
Pristina, the festival was just simple good fun.

THE GREAT-GRANDMOTHER WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By   WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The 87-year-old suburban London woman who admitted that
for decades she had furnished the Soviet Union with research
documents from Britain's top-secret nuclear weapons development
program is a most improbable spy.
</P>
<P>
   Melita Norwood made her unrepentant confession Saturday in the
well-tended garden of freesia and daisies in front of her two-story
stucco home in Bexleyheath, southeast London. She was dressed in a
wide-collared lavender floral print blouse and gray tweed skirt and
clutched a handwritten piece of paper with slightly trembling
fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I did not to make money but to help prevent the
defeat of a new system which had, at great cost, given ordinary
people food and fares which they could afford, a good education and
a health service,'' she read in a firm voice.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining her motive, Mrs. Norwood said, ``I thought perhaps
what I had access to might be useful in helping Russia to keep
abreast of Britain, America and Germany. In general,'' she added,
``I do not agree with spying against one's country.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several cries of ``traitor!'' from the crowd in her
street. As she retreated into her house, she murmured, ``No, no,
no,'' to shouted questions asking whether she regretted her
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Norwood had been obliged to confront the press gathered at
her gate by disclosures of her past in The Times of London. She
told the newspaper that ``in the same circumstances, I know that I
would do the same thing again.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper will begin on Monday to serialize a book published
in Britain as ``The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the
West,'' by a Cambridge professor, Christopher Andrew. It is based
on the six trunkloads of documents brought to the West by Vasily
Mitrokhin, 77, the former chief archivist of the KGB's foreign
intelligence section, who defected to Britain in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's newspapers predicted that the excerpts from Andrew's
book and an accompanying BBC documentary called ``The Spying Game''
would unmask up to a dozen more Britons who worked for Soviet
intelligence, including a former Scotland Yard officer and a person
described tantalizingly by the author as ``a prominent public
figure who is now dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Secretary Jack Straw has asked Britain's internal Security
Service, MI5, for a full report on the case, but a Home Office
spokeswoman said Sunday that the government would have no comment
on the other names emerging. ``It is a longstanding policy not to
confirm or deny the details of security service investigations,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom King, chairman of the Parliamentary Security and
Intelligence Committee, promised an investigation by lawmakers,
saying, ``Questions need to be asked about who knew what when, and
why there were no prosecutions.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Britain was headed into another of the spy
expose frenzies that have occurred periodically with the unmaskings
of men like Kim Philby, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt
and John Cairncross who followed their Communist sympathies into
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Where those men hid their activities behind their upper-class
backgrounds, elite educations and urbanity, Mrs. Norwood disguised
hers with her complete suburban unremarkableness.
</P>
<P>
   She worked as a secretary at the British Non-Ferrous Metals
Research Association, the home of the Tube Alloys project. That was
the anodyne name given to Britain's nuclear weapons research
program that is sometimes compared with the more famous American
project conducted in Los Alamos, N.M. Mrs. Norwood regularly
removed files from a safe after hours, copied them and turned them
over to Soviet agents in meetings in the leafy southeastern suburbs
where she has lived for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with The Times of London, she said that her
husband, Hilary, a mathematics teacher who died in 1986, shared her
Communist ideology but disapproved of her actively aiding the
Russians. On nights when she was delayed getting home by her
appointments with her KGB handlers, she said, she would blame it on
traffic tie-ups _ an excuse he accepted though he knew it to be
sham.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The couple's daughter, Anita Ferguson, 56, a biologist living in
Staffordshire, said she learned of her mother's activity from the
newspaper report Saturday. ``When I first saw all the details, I
just felt complete disbelief,'' she said. ``It was a very big
shock, I had no idea, no idea at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ferguson said she would stand by her mother ``whatever she
may have done'' and expressed relief that she had never been told
the truth before. ``It's probably better I didn't know,'' she said.
``I would not have liked to have kept such a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Norwood became a great-grandmother last year, and she told
The Times of London that while she thought that people who had
lived through the era would understand her motives, she worried
what the youthful members of her family would make of the
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   In the BBC interview for broadcast next Sunday, Mrs. Norwood
explains that in addition to sympathizing with the social gains
that the Soviet experiment promised, she thought that in the
postwar era, the Soviet Union represented the only counterbalance
to capitalism and that the West should not be allowed an advantage
as great as sole possession of nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they should somehow be adequately defended because
everyone was against them, against this experiment, and they had
been through such hardship from the Germans,'' she told her
television interviewer. ``In the war the Russians were on our side,
and it was unfair to them that they shouldn't be able to develop
their weaponry.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She was born Melita Sirnis in 1912 near Southampton, the
daughter of an English mother and a Latvian father who was a
follower of Leo Tolstoy. Her father died when she was 6, but her
mother remained active in leftist causes, instilling in her
children strong sentiments against all war and sympathy for
countries like Germany that the family viewed as victims of
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   She went to Southampton University for a year and in 1932, soon
to become a secret member of Britain's Communist Party, she got her
secretarial job at the metals association office in north London.
</P>
<P>
   In the BBC interview she is vague about how she came to start
working for the KGB five years later, saying only, ``Somebody said
that my work might be an interesting source of material.'' She
claims failing memory as a reason for not being able to recall the
names of any of the people she dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Letti'' to her friends, she was identified in KGB
documents by the code name ``Hola.'' Asked if she had ever been
frightened of being caught, she said, ``I suppose so, but I can't
remember pondering it.''
</P>
<P>
   On her retirement in 1972, KGB files complimented her as ``a
committed, reliable and disciplined agent, striving to be of the
utmost assistance.'' When she visited Moscow with her husband in
1979, she was given an honor for her work, the Order of the Red
Banner, which she accepted, and offered a financial reward, which
she turned down.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   People in the neighborhood said they were aware that Mrs.
Norwood, locally famed for the quality of her homemade chutney,
held radical views for their largely Conservative-voting area.
Along with the geraniums in her windows there are anti-war and
nuclear disarmament stickers, and on a cupboard shelf visible
through the kitchen window is a mug with Che Guevara's bearded face
on it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon she strolled in her garden at the request of
photographers but refused to answer any questions. ``I'm sorry to
get you all out like this on a Sunday,'' she told the waiting
journalists. ``But I suppose it's all right as long as you are
getting paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At Dillons Newsagents, Peter Dodd, the assistant manager, said
he had been surprised years ago when he first saw her orders for
Communist publications. ``I thought, `Who is this nutter?''' he
said. ``But she was just the normal grandmother who came in once a
week to pay her bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Simmons, 67, a retired chief technician at the University of
Greenwich, who lives nearby commented: ``I've known her for 20
years, and she never gave a hint of anything like that. It's quite
a shock to be told that the sweet old lady round the corner has
been a KGB spy.''

PUERTO RICO AN ISSUE OF THE HEART FOR A CLINTON LOYALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the late unpleasantness here _ something
about the president and an intern _ no member of Congress was more
loyal to the man in the White House than Jose E. Serrano of the
South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the president was impeached, Serrano strode to the
well of the House and let loose. ``The Republican right wing in
this country doesn't like it when we say coup d'etat, so I'll make
it easier for them: golpe de estado _ that's Spanish for
overthrowing a government.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``From Day 1, they wanted to get rid of Bill
Clinton. They're blinded by hate today. This place is full of hate,
because of what they tried to do to our president.''
</P>
<P>
   He closed with a little street talk for the president's enemies,
straight from his Bronx boyhood: ``Bullies get theirs, and you're
going to get yours, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So it might have seemed strange when Serrano kicked over Hillary
Clinton's apple cart last week. After she came out against her
husband's conditional offer of clemency to 16 imprisoned members of
a radical Puerto Rican nationalist group, Serrano said he was
``rescinding my encouragement of her candidacy'' for the Senate in
New York. He suggested that ``it's time to go out and find out who
else is interested'' and warned that the stance of hundreds of
thousands of Hispanic people toward Mrs. Clinton might now be
``abrazos cruzado'' _ folded arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three months ago, 99.9 percent of people in the Bronx didn't
have a problem with Hillary Clinton,'' he said. ``Now it's
divided.''
</P>
<P>
   And now Serrano may be off the White House Christmas-party list.
But in politics there is passion as well as loyalty, and Serrano is
a passionate man.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who loved Frank Sinatra so much (the first English
he heard as a toddler in Puerto Rico was on a Sinatra 78, and he
owns every recording the man ever made) that he personally saw to
it that Ol' Blue Eyes received the Congressional Medal of Honor in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who loved performing so much that when he gave up
his dreams of being a singer, an actor or a comedian, he did the
next best thing: He became a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I traded my dream for one microphone for another,'' he said.
``A lot of what I do I do with a poet's heart, with the heart that
poets have to look at the world, where they show anger and they
speak about love.''
</P>
<P>
   He also loves Puerto Rico and hates what he sees as its colonial
status. ``There isn't a day that this island doesn't run through my
brain and my heart,'' he said. ``I see the United States as my
father and Puerto Rico as my mother, and I'm tired of seeing my
father mistreat my mother. Either legitimize the relationship or
let her go.''
</P>
<P>
   Serrano was brought to the Bronx from Mayaguez as a child by his
factory-working father and his mother, who worked as a seamstress
in a sweatshop and fostered his love of performing. After
graduating from a vocational high school in 1961, he served in the
Army medical corps during the Vietnam War and won election to the
state assembly in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the '70s and '80s that the Puerto Rican nationalists
carried out 130 bombings in the United States, including a
lunch-hour attack on Fraunces Tavern in lower Manhattan, which
killed four people. The 16 offered clemency were not linked
directly to the deaths and maiming in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Serrano (pronounced sa-RAH-no, with a rolled R), who after
nearly 10 years in the House is the ranking Puerto Rican member of
Congress, decided last Monday that he was taking a stand against
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a call, while watching a baseball game, from the White
House, telling me that Mrs. Clinton is going to come out for
rescinding the clemency,'' he said. ``My initial reaction was of
outrage, anger, pain, sadness, disappointment. And if you hurt me,
it lingers.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hillary Rodham Clinton ran headlong into Jose Serrano's
heart. It might have been politic for Mrs. Clinton's campaign to
consult Serrano, who wins 95 percent of the vote in his district, a
margin rarely seen anywhere, and is the longest-serving Puerto
Rican politician in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded last Friday that ``the consultation process was not
what it should have been.'' He remains miffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the same arrogance and inability to understand issues and
people that allowed them to advise her to make that blunder, they
now are beginning to downplay my role in a senatorial election,''
he said of Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ``I'm not one who says, `I'm
very powerful, I control votes,' but you shouldn't try to test
that, because you might be shocked at what you find.''
</P>
<P>
   After the clemency was denounced by an overwhelming vote in the
House last Thursday, Serrano, speaking of the Fraunces Tavern
bombing, said: ``You have to be an animal or inhuman not to feel
that that was wrong, not to feel the pain of people who lost a limb
or lost a life. But this is an issue of reconciliation. How can the
greatest democracy on earth hold a colony in 1999 in the
Caribbean?''
</P>
<P>
   Some have even accused Serrano, who places himself ``to the left
of the left'' on the political spectrum, of supporting terrorism
against the United States. Nonsense, he replies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the country where I grew up,'' he said. ``This is the
country where my five children were born. This is the country where
my wife was born. This is the country where I buried my parents,
and this is where I will be buried someday.''

   KOREAN-LAWSUIT (Undated) _ Now 76, Jae Sik Choe, who emigrated
from to Tacoma in the 1980s with his wife, last week filed a
first-of-its-kind lawsuit in federal court there: a class action on
behalf of all Koreans living in the United States who were
subjected to forced labor in Japan. It asks for unspecified damages

too-good-to-be-true office supply deals, bogus loans and
non-existent charities.

   OWEN-FOOD-COLUMN (Undated) _ After being served a few snails

But pesticide use decimated the population of wild snails.

Recognizing that, so far, so-called streaming, or continuous, audio
is not always of the highest fidelity on the Net, Meyrowitz plans
an all-talk network, which he calls Eyada.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Herman, who was host of the morning show on the New York
rock station WNEW-FM for 26 years, is Eyada.com's program director.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Eyada.com will offer one channel of programming about
the entertainment industry, with 15 hours of programming each
weekday and four hours each on Saturday and Sunday evenings. The
lineup of hosts for the entertainment channel, which begins
officially transmitting on Wednesday, includes Lionel, host of
Court TV's ``Snap Judgment''; Richard Johnson, editor of Page Six,
the gossip page of the New York Post; George Rush and Joanna
Molloy, the New York Daily News husband-and-wife gossip columnists;
and Bob Berkowitz, the former host of Real Personal, a discontinued
sex advice program on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Eyada.com plans to introduce an all-talk channel for
sports, and it expects to add channels on teen-agers, women and
business by the end of 2000, Meyrowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyrowitz, who said he had raised just under $10 million from
private investors for the start-up, hopes to reach 20,000 listeners
a day, ranging in age from 20 to 40. The network intends to sell
both banner ads and audio commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Allen, a senior analyst for Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., criticized Eyada.com's planned programming, which
she said ``is not uniquely suited to the new medium.''
</P>
<P>
   She also predicted listeners would ignore the advertising. ``If
there's one thing that's clear, it's that Internet users do not
like ads and avoid them,'' Ms. Allen said. ``There's no reason to
think they'll listen to radio ads online.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst for Jupiter Communications
in New York, said that if the network could establish its brand, it
might be able to create a niche for itself before the likes of Don
Imus and Howard Stern hit cyberspace. ``They're not online yet, but
I promise you they will be in a year,'' Mooradian said.

   E-GAMBLING SOFTWARE GIVES PLAYERS AN EDGE
</P>
<P>
   In the world of Internet gambling, participants routinely risk
large amounts of cash with Web site operators of uncertain scruples
who may run afoul of local anti-gambling laws. Now, Reliable
Software Technologies of Dulles, Va., has identified a new peril
associated with gambling online: badly engineered software.
</P>
<P>
   The company has found a flaw in one implementation of a game
known as Texas Hold 'em Poker that could enable a player to quickly
determine the exact ordering of every card in a shuffled deck while
a game was in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this information, even the weakest of poker players
should know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em,'' Gary McGraw,
vice president for corporate technology, wrote to a security
mailing list.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors of the affected version of Texas Hold 'em Poker
_ ASF Software Inc. in Duluth, Ga. _ quickly corrected the flaw
when it was brought to their attention, but McGraw said similar
problems might still exist in this and other types of Internet
gambling software. At least three online casinos, planetpoker.com,
purepoker.com and deltacasino.com, appear to be using the
vulnerable version of the software, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ASF vulnerability lies in a faulty implementation of what is
known as a random- number generator to produce a shuffled deck of
cards before each round of play. The order of each shuffled deck is
completely determined by one number, known as the seed. In this
case, the program chose a seed based on the time, measured in
milliseconds since midnight. By synchronizing their program with
the system clock on the server generating the seed, McGraw and his
associates were able to narrow the number of possible decks to
about 200,000 possibilities. Then, given the cards dealt and the
community cards in the center, they could quickly compute which
deck was being used.
</P>
<P>
   This type of vulnerability has been well-known to security
experts ever since a similar problem was identified three years ago
in Netscape's implementation of Secure Socket Layer, a program that
enables secure connections with e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We published an exhortation on this back in 1996, so it's sad
_ but not entirely surprising _ to see more people falling prey to
this trap,'' said David Wagner, a computer security researcher at
the University of California at Berkeley who, along with his
colleague Ian Goldberg, identified the Netscape bug.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers will spend an estimated $1.2 billion online this year,
according to Christiansen Capital Advisors, a research firm based
in New York.

CLINTON SAYS U.S. TROOPS WILL HAVE LIMITED ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ President Clinton said Monday that
American troops would have a ``limited but important function'' in
the peacekeeping force that Indonesia is reluctantly permitting
into East Timor, although Asian officials insisted the United
States will inevitably be drawn into a central role if troops are
to be inserted quickly enough to bring a halt to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at his hotel here Monday morning, Clinton
described an array of tasks for American forces, from airlifting
troops from several nations into East Timor to supplying them with
intelligence capabilities and communications. Acknowledging that
many of the forces had not trained together as NATO forces did
before their insertion in Kosovo earlier this year, Clinton added:
``We might be asked to provide some command and control.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that the United States did not anticipate
providing ground troops and said that ``The Australians are willing
to take the lion's share of the role.'' Since Friday, a small team
of American military officials from the Pacific Command in Hawaii
have been in Australia to develop a plan for moving the
peacekeepers into place, perhaps beginning as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that they believe the U.S. participation
can be held to about 600 troops, though Australian officials and
Asian diplomats who have been briefed on the plans say they expect
the figure to be much higher. ``The assets offered by the Americans
are very pleasing to the Australian defense community,'' John
Howard, the Australian prime minister, said here, where he has
frequently been meeting Clinton on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   The back-room negotiations over the composition and timing of an
East Timor peacekeeping force dominated much of the first day and a
half of a summit meeting that is supposed to focus on restarting a
series of trade and economic initiatives in the wake of the
recovery from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was clearly far more engaged on a host of security
issues. On Sunday he held an unusual trilateral meeting with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea, jointly committing to penalizing North Korea if it conducts
a long-threatened missile launch, and dangling a resumption of aid
and economic cooperation if it publicly declares it is freezing
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met for the first time with the new Russian prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, and in an unusually direct acknowledgment
of Russian corruption that the White House has often downplayed in
the past, the president told him that corruption could ``eat the
heart out of Russian society.'' Critics of the administration's
Russia policy say those warnings should have been delivered far
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But East Timor has dominated much of the conversation among the
leaders of 21 ``economies'' represented here _ the phrase is used
to allow the participation of Taiwan and Hong Kong _ and Clinton
was awakened at 1 a.m. this morning to be told that Indonesia's
president, B.J. Habibie, had finally agreed to allow in the
peacekeeping force he had resisted for so long.

ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ARRINGTON'S ENTHUSIASM AND DAYNE'S PATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what we know as the college football season begins to
find its legs.
</P>
<P>
   First, Florida State's Peter Warrick is a worthy front-runner
for the Heisman Trophy and Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton should vault
to second place after the two took turns trampling each other's end
zones late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Penn State's LaVar Arrington lost what little chance he
had for the award but probably insured that he would become the top
pick in the National Football League draft by playing well and
acting badly in a 20-17 victory over Pittsburgh. The linebacker
blocked the game-tying field-goal attempt, snatched an interception
and, most impressively, pounded and bullied a punter. A punter!
</P>
<P>
   Third, Wisconsin's Ron Dayne needs tougher opposition if he
wants to separate Warrick and Hamilton from the Heisman. And
finally, the sense of time of the Swiss might better serve Notre
Dame than the luck of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play one more second of that game,'' said
Coach Bobby Bowden after Florida State, top-ranked in the
Associated Press poll, outlasted Georgia Tech, 41-35, in
Tallahassee. ``I never thought I would see the day that an offense
would score that many points on us. I think Tech had a chance to
win up to the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Florida State's Travis Minor smothered an onside-kick
attempt with 1 minute 35 seconds left, Georgia Tech did have a
chance in a high-wire game that showed Warrick belonged alongside
Johnny Rodgers, Desmond Howard and Tim Brown _ the only true
receivers to win the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable sequence, Florida State (2-0) and Georgia Tech
(1-1) rang up touchdowns on seven consecutive series, combining for
five of them in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught a 26-yard touchdown pass, lined up at quarterback
in the shotgun and ricocheted 17 yards for a touchdown run, and
finished with 167 yards on 8 catches.
</P>
<P>
   And the 5-foot-10-inch Hamilton, the South's version of Doug
Flutie, fired right back. He was 22 of 25 for 387 yards and 4
touchdowns. He ran for another score and completed his final 14
passes of the game, touchdown throws of 11 and 22 yards among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit, and they hit back,'' said Hamilton, who was knocked
out of the game the last two times the teams met. ``They made plays
and we made plays back. They just made more plays than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Penn State, which was ranked second going into
the weekend, was considered to be the big-play team of the new
season after crushing victories over Arizona and Akron. But the
Nittany Lions looked Victorian in surviving over the 34-point
underdog Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, a 6-foot-3-inch, 242-pound all-American, slapped
around Pitt's 6-0, 189-pound punter Greg DeBolt in the early going.
But he finished by getting a hand on a 52-yard field-goal attempt
by Nick Lotz with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the emotional Arrington blindsided DeBolt
after his punt and jumped on him as a penalty flag flew. He then
leaped to his feet, ignored the referee and shoved DeBolt again.
Another flag flew, and Arrington was penalized 30 yards for two
personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst did not seem to bother the college game's arbiter
of taste and sportsmanship, Joe Paterno. He spoke calmly to
Arrington on the sideline and the linebacker remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to nitpick all of the time,'' Paterno said
afterward. ``He should have walked away, but it was a good lesson
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel sorry for the Badgers' Dayne. But don't feel sorry for that
dawdling bunch from South Bend, Ind. Dayne, the Wisconsin man
mountain, rolled for 158 yards in a 50-10 thrashing of Ball State.
He only played three quarters _ one more than he did the previous
week in Wisconsin's rout of Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is not only in search of the Heisman, but also the career
rushing record set last year by Ricky Williams of Texas. With
Cincinnati next for the Badgers, both will be part-time pursuits.
He needs the Big Ten schedule to get there in a hurry before he
loses any more ground to Warrick and a Hamilton in the Heisman
race.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame again proved it cannot do anything in a hurry. For
the second week in a row, the Irish ran out of clock _ this time
after driving to Purdue's (2-0) 1-yard line in a 28-23 loss. The
Irish (1-2) had already turned the two-minute drill into
slow-motion chaos. It caught up to them when they called a timeout
with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Davie called two plays intended to move them three
feet for the score. Unfortunately, the first one allowed
quarterback Jarious Jackson to call an audible, if necessary, for
an option play. He had not.
</P>
<P>
   But fullback Joey Goodspeed thought he had. He relayed it to
tailback Tony Fisher. They went right. Jackson went left as
planned, but instead of finding Fisher ready for a handoff, he was
hit by linebacker Mike Rose. The play lost 9 yards. End of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coaching staff, we had a couple of mistakes,'' said
Davie, who last week heard the gun sound as his team was trying to
win the game from Michigan's 12.
</P>
<P>
   The season is still young, but there are some truths on the
college landscape. Look for the Heisman Trophy winner to streak out
of the South. The Great Dayne will rumble toward them out of
Wisconsin when he gets a chance.

RESENDING TO CORRECT SLUG LINE  
 CON ARTISTS INCREASINGLY TARGETING BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY SMALL
ONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumers aren't the only people who get ripped off by con
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses _ especially smaller ones _ are growing targets of
increasingly clever schemes to rip them off.
</P>
<P>
   Every year businesses lose hundreds of millions of dollars to
con artists selling listings in fake directories,
too-good-to-be-true office supply deals, bogus loans and
non-existent charities.
</P>
<P>
   They get away with it because many businesses don't have
adequate procedures for approving bills before they get paid.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has reached such proportions that a group of
agencies plans to meet next week in Washington, D.C., to brainstorm
strategies companies can use to reduce their vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The round table includes the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, the
Yellow Pages Publishing Association, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Small Business Administration, the Council of Better Business
Bureaus, the American Chamber of Commerce Association, the
Department of Justice, the National Association of Attorneys
General and the National Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   Poor communication within companies is one of the main reasons
businesses get taken, said Robyn Frankel, a St. Louis consultant
who has chaired the business scam round table since it began three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by the Yellow Pages Publishers Association and
the Council of Better Business Bureaus, for example, showed that 90
percent of individuals who pay bills in companies have other major
responsibilities besides handling accounts payable. In addition, 40
percent of companies don't require a second approval before bills
are paid.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it easier for bogus bills to get paid
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Although the schemers target companies large and small, it's the
smaller ones with fewer checks and balances that get taken most
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a numbers game,'' Frankel said. ``It's who's not
paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   When businesses let their ``fingers do the walking,'' for
example, the fingers often walk off with the money.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ``walking fingers'' logo was never trademarked, phony
Yellow Pages billing schemes cost companies about $550 million a
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Pages is the most widely targeted medium for con
artists, making Yellow Pages advertisers especially susceptible to
phony solicitations, Frankel said. Sometimes a crook will simply
clip a company's legitimate Yellow Pages ad and send it to the
business with a ``renewal'' notice and bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``These scams never go away,'' she said. ``There's always a new
twist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is also a fertile new medium for scam artists.
Billings for Internet directories, for example, are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Another frequent tactic is sending a mailing to ``confirm your
address.'' Although the mailing may say ``This is not a bill'' on
the front, there may be fine print on the back stating that
confirming the address results in a billing and automatic renewal
for every directory issued thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Or people may get phony refund checks that, once cashed, trigger
all kinds of unwanted billings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going out of business'' sales with rock-bottom prices on
office supplies are another hook so-called ``paper pirates'' use to
scam businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Shady ``service reps'' sometimes show up at company doors with
work orders, then walk out the door with expensive office equipment
that needs to be ``repaired.'' Neither the rep nor the equipment is
seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses don't bother to report rip-offs, which allows
the schemes to proliferate. One of the goals of the round table
meeting is to increase business awareness about the scams and
encourage more reporting, Frankel said.
</P>
<P>
   There are some steps companies can take to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Look at all bills carefully, and doublecheck them against your
files for pending contracts to make sure the mailing relates to
legitimate advertising or merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   If something seems questionable, contact the local Better
Business Bureau to see whether there is information on the company
originating the invoice.
</P>
<P>
   If you suspect a scam, alert the state Attorney General's
Office, the local postal inspector or the Council of Better
Business Bureaus. Agencies receiving complaints now feed them to a
central database maintained by the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   Warn others in the company if suspect billings are making the
rounds. Don't make commitments to unknown people over the phone.
Get contracts in writing. When dealing with publications, get
verifiable circulation figures, publication dates and sample copies
before signing up.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the Yellow Pages Publishers Assoc.
at 1-800-841-0639cq ; the Consumer Response Center at the FTC
(1-877-FTC-HELP)cq, or the U.S. Postal Service Mail Fraud Complaint

GENERAL SAYS CIVILIANS MUST TAKE CONTROL IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Lt. Gen. Sir Mike Jackson speaks his
mind. At the start of his command in Kosovo, he refused to obey
NATO's supreme commander and seize Pristina airport ahead of
Russian forces. Now, nearing the end of his tour of duty, he warned
that soldiers have done about all they can to restore order, and
civilian authorities must take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that the soldiers are now more and more policemen,'' he
said in an interview at his headquarters this past weekend. ``They
are a sticking plaster on the wound that is due to the continuing
desire for revenge. And that has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were echoed in a separate interview Sunday with
another senior officer in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. Both men
said that preventing the violent deaths that still occur almost
every day in Kosovo, and creating the multiethnic society that NATO
said it went to war for, is a task that will take years and is not
a job for the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are guarding flats and we must continue to, but we must
tackle the cause of their fear,'' Jackson said of the Serbian and
other Kosovo minorities who now rarely venture outside their homes
without protection.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Mike, as he likes to be known, said that he was heartened by
the statements of Albanian military and political leaders, who have
spoken out against the revenge attacks, but that a permanent
solution lies in building civilian institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other means are needed; it is not a security job,'' he said
firmly. ``You cannot expect soldiers to change people's minds _
that has to be done in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The other senior commander in KFOR, as the Kosovo peacekeeping
force is known, agreed. ``There is no chance to change minds in the
short term,'' the officer said, requesting anonymity. Efforts to
encourage Serbs and Albanians to work together in joint bodies are
small-scale and need constant supervision, he said, adding that the
answer lies in giving people homes and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Set to leave Kosovo on Oct. 8 and hand over command to Gen.
Klaus Reinhardt of Germany, Jackson is heading home to England and
a promotion to general and commander in chief of Britain's Land
Forces. His departure may well prove a watershed in Kosovo, and
signal a shift of responsibility from KFOR toward the U.N. civilian
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he was reluctant to discuss his refusal to obey
NATO's supreme commander in Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, who ordered
him to seize Pristina airport ahead of the arrival of a Russian
force on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed convinced that he had been right to act as he did.
His actions became the subject of heated debate in Washington last
week after Gen. Henry Shelton confirmed Jackson's resistance to
Clark under a little known NATO procedure that allows a NATO
officer to consult his national commanding officer if he wishes to
disobey an order from a superior Alliance officer of another
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson confirmed that he had communicated the contents of
Clark's order to the commander of the British national contingent
of the force at the time. That commander, Maj. Gen. Richard Dannit,
then consulted with his superiors in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's reservations won the day, when senior military
commanders in Britain and the United States decided together to
rescind the order.
</P>
<P>
   At the weekend, Jackson deflected a question about whether he
had dismissed the idea because it threatened to provoke World War
III. But he stressed that it had been, at the time, of paramount
importance to keep to the withdrawal plan worked out for the
Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of factors, but what was very clear in
everybody's mind was that we had just signed the military-technical
agreement which required the entry into Kosovo to be
synchronized,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also appeared fully to support NATO's system that allows each
member nation to retain sovereignty over the commitment of its own
troops. ``Nations have volunteered forces, and if they feel
uncomfortable they have the right to say no. Nations, not least
America, retain full command of their national forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, a speaker of Russian who began his military career as a
member of the British Intelligence Corps, is clearly also something
of a diplomat and is sympathetic to Russian participation in
peacekeeping in Kosovo. For him, the May meeting of Russia and the
seven leading industrial nations at which the principles for a deal
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic were adopted also
encapsulated the rules on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from that meeting that it would be inconceivable
that there would not be a Russian contingent in KFOR,'' he said.
Despite the aggravations that the Russian takeover of Kosovo's main
airport caused, he insisted that cooperation was going
``exceptionally well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is considerable praise for them from the men under whose
command they are,'' he said, referring to the NATO brigade
commanders under whose command the Russian troops fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the interview at his headquarters above the Kosovo capital,
Pristina, Jackson sat sideways in a chair in his workmanlike
office, his leg flung over the arm of a chair. As he discussed the
achievements of his force, his face, seemingly so war-weary, with
heavy bags under the eyes, lit up in a smile for the only time
during the 45-minute interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at what the tasks were, I have some satisfaction
over our achievements, and over some I certainly don't,'' he said.
``The first task was to get the refugees back. Well, they're back.
The second was to create conditions for UNMIK (the U.N. Mission)
and others to do their work. And they are working.''
</P>
<P>
   The general has won the respect of both Albanians and Serbs,
despite the continuing violence. His forthright speaking on local
television persuaded many Serbs that NATO would be evenhanded, and
his pressure on the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army has
forced them to take a public stand against revenge attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As he winds up his command, Jackson has one more job, to oversee
the complete demilitarization of the KLA, which he insists has so
far been as complete and satisfactory as is realistic in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The former rebel force has said it has 1,000 more weapons to
hand in, and Jackson said he was confident they would produce them
by the Sept. 19 deadline.

COMMENTARY: CLEMENCY FOR CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is as if Bill Clinton looked us directly in the
eye, and waggling his finger, said: I want you to listen to me. I
never discussed clemency for terrorists with that woman, Ms.
Clinton. Not a single time; never.
</P>
<P>
   That is in essence his line in pretending he was not using the
power of the presidency to help get the first lady a job in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A strong Hispanic vote in the city is vital to her election. His
departing political counsel, Charles Ruff, cooked up a brief to
spring the ringleaders of an '80s terrorist campaign. Many Puerto
Ricans who condemn their violence and cause feel sympathy for them.
</P>
<P>
   Although a charge of ``sedition'' has been an abomination in
America since 1801, these were no mere protesters exercising free
speech. These convicted gunrunners incited followers to ``armed
struggle'' that resulted in 130 bombings that killed six people and
maimed scores more.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring opposition by law enforcement officials, the least
clement president in recent history _ who turned down 3,000 other
pleas _ OK'd this one.
</P>
<P>
   Then his political ploy backfired. When Hillary saw she was
losing more upstate and suburban votes than would come from New
York City Hispanics, she frantically reversed field. Too late; most
of the convicts grabbed the deal to walk and are now hailed as
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not discuss it with her,'' insists the president who
discusses every political angle with her. Try that for credibility:
He supposedly panders to an ethnic group his wife needs without
even a hint from her, and when the misuse of his pardon power to
shore up her campaign becomes a front-page controversy _ they never
talk. He did it all for Jimmy Carter and Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clintonites got the queasy feeling that both Clintons
were weaving another tangled web of deceit, the president plunged
in deeper, suggesting that the enablers of terror had been wrongly
convicted _ in his words, ``in effect by guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the McCarthy investigations of the early
1950s know what the phrase  &UR; guilt by association  &LR; means. It has the
clear meaning of ``smear.'' Those attacked for their friendships
with the guilty are in themselves innocent _ unfairly besmeared by
those using the sneaky technique of ``guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   That gives us this spectacle: Surprised by the widespread
disgust at his pandering to an ethnic group to boost his wife's
candidacy, the president then struck back by demeaning police,
prosecutors and jurors who put these criminals in jail. Those
apostles of armed struggle, Clinton would have us believe, were
merely victims of ``guilt by association'' with those incited to
carry out the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   That's typical Clinton: brazen it out. And Hillary will stick by
his story that they never discussed it at all. They will claim to
be ``not discussing'' the timing of Jonathan Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
   What they cannot deny discussing, because both are famously
familiar with influencing banks, is their $1.35 million mortgage
assistance loan from the Democratic fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   This financial angel is a witness in a criminal investigation in
the teamsters' fraudulent swap of funds with the DNC. McAuliffe's
continued close association with the president and potential
senator is of value to him.
</P>
<P>
   He deposits $1.35 million in Bankers Trust at a low interest
rate. The bank then profits by lending that McAuliffe deposit to
others at a much higher interest rate. It shares that profit with
the Clintons by reducing the interest on their mortgage loan,
reportedly saving them about a thousand a month on carrying
charges. ``In effect,'' to use the Clinton phrase, Bankers Trust is
the Clintons' money laundry for private largesse.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS may not consider this benefit a gift, and the Office of
Government Ethics happily goes into the tank for the boss. But
federal employees are forbidden to accept even a lunch from
outsiders lest they be influenced; what are they to think when the
president and first lady can go on the take for a grand a month?
</P>
<P>
   Both ``never discussed'' political clemency and the sleazy
mortgage are ethical outrages. But the greater outrage is the way
so many shrug and say: that's the Clintons for you.

 &HT;    Thrashers believe in Maracle
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. _ He was the only goalie on the roster to
show up in training camp with a freshly painted mask, a
menacing-looking bird with eyes on the top of the mask and a beak
down near his chin.
</P>
<P>
   For added karma, Norm Maracle had his artist paint dream
catchers in either side of his chin. It's all part of the package.
The mask fits in well with the tattoo of a Native American on his
right shoulder and the blur of animal caricatures on his left
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, see I consider my glove hand my strength, so I've got a
bunch of crazy stuff over here,'' the Thrashers goalie said,
rolling up a T-shirt to expose his left shoulder. ``See, I've got a
black panther breaking through the skin, here's a skeleton, here's
a face that looks this way. One face looks behind the net. He can
tell me where the puck is. I have about 10 faces here.''
</P>
<P>
   There probably is room for only two goalie faces on the
Thrashers' final roster. Presumably, the NHL will count Maracle as
only one.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old was the most impressive goalie in the first week
of training camp for the Thrashers, which bodes well for the
franchise's future. How so? General manager Don Waddell, who spent
a year as Detroit's assistant GM, zeroed in on Maracle early as the
Red Wings' donation in the June expansion draft. Though Maracle
will enter this season as Damian Rhodes' backup, he is considered
the goalie of the future and performances in scrimmages have some
team officials wondering if the future isn't far off.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Maracle, hardly an imposing athletic specimen
at a 5 feet 9, 175 pounds, has made a nice emotional recovery from
three months ago, when he was so upset about leaving the Red Wings'
organization that he cried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little sad about it,'' he said. ``I had been with the
same organization for five years. But now I'm excited about it
because I may get a chance to play more.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracle, who had a 2.27 goals-against average and .918 saves
percentage in 16 games with Detroit, brings with him undeniable
talent but questions about his dedication. A drunken driving arrest
last season, which Maracle has publicly apologized for several
times, and questionable conditioning were two things that raised a
red flag with Andy Moog, the Thrashers' former goaltending
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Maracle was one of five goalies Moog recommended to Waddell
before the expansion draft, but the current Vancouver
consultant/assistant coach said, ``He has a lot to prove. He's
carrying a little baggage with him. In talking to some people in
Detroit, I felt like he didn't understand how much work it took.
Some felt he was a little immature.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracle was neither thrilled nor surprised by Moog's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard the comments about my dedication a little bit,'' he
said. ``But you can't say I'm not dedicated because I want to play
every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracle admits his conditioning is lacking at times, and he
wants to hire a fitness coach, saying, ``I need somebody with me.''
As to the DUI, he said, ``It was a mistake and it will never happen
again. That's not the type of guy I am at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell said of Maracle, ``I know this kid. I know he's focused
to be a No. 1 goalie. If this had happened to somebody I didn't
know, we would've had a lot more conversation about it.''

COMMENTARY: UNDERGROUND DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It could happen. I'm not saying it will happen. But
the stars are moving ever closer to a favorable alignment. A subway
line under Second Avenue in Manhattan _ a dream that has tantalized
commuters for most of this century _ is now approaching the realm
of the possible. Don't bet the mortgage just yet. The cynics and
the naysayers are still holding the high cards. But it could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are one of the unlucky thousands who ride to work
while being poked and jostled by the unruly elbows, backpacks and
umbrellas on the hopelessly and sometimes dangerously overcrowded
Lexington Avenue line, you know for sure that it should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the city's subway system began 100 years ago.
William McKinley was president and Robert Van Wyck was mayor, the
first mayor of all five boroughs. The subways soon became
indispensable and shortly after World War I East Siders were being
told that a Second Avenue subway line was in their future.
</P>
<P>
   They had no idea how far in the future. For one reason or
another _ a Depression, a World War, a lack of vision, a fiscal
crisis _ the Second Avenue subway never happened. Highways and
bridges and tunnels and vast acres of parking lots materialized
during those decades. But no subway under Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Side of Manhattan was developed around the Second and
Third Avenue els,'' said Bob Yaro, executive director of the
Regional Plan Association, which is part of a coalition of civic
and business groups that is calling for work to actually get
started on creation of a Second Avenue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the els came down, the East Side was zoned with the
understanding that there was going to be a Second Avenue subway
replacing those elevated lines. But it hasn't been built.
Consequently, the Lex is jammed well beyond its carrying capacity,
to the point where it just doesn't work. People can't get on and
off the trains. The platforms and stairs can't carry the numbers of
people that are there. It is literally approaching an unsafe
situation at the most crowded stations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s a full-scale Second Avenue line probably would
have cost a few hundred million dollars. Now it would cost several
billion. And yet, Yaro and many others are saying, ``I think it's
time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons to be at least somewhat optimistic. To
get the subway line built you have to have the support of top state
officials. It so happens that Gov. George Pataki very much wants to
build a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand
Central Terminal. That would keep thousands of suburban Long Island
commuters from having to travel to Penn Station on the West Side of
Manhattan and then doubling back to the East Side by subway to get
to work. (It would also add thousands of new passengers to the
daily crush of the Lexington Avenue line.)
</P>
<P>
   And it just happens that the speaker of the state Assembly,
Sheldon Silver, represents the Lower East Side, which is woefully
short of subway service and would benefit tremendously if the
Second Avenue subway were built.
</P>
<P>
   One has to keep in mind, of course, that for Silver's local
constituents to benefit, a full-length Second Avenue line would
have to be built, not the truncated 125th Street to 63rd Street
proposal being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pataki, friend of the suburbanites, meet Mr. Silver, who
says he's a champion of the urbanites. Let's make a deal. If not
now, when? The number of New Yorkers using mass transit has soared
over the past couple of years. And these are the best of economic
times, with the federal, state and city governments all running
surpluses. All we need is a little vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of capacity to move people into the central
business district,'' said Gene Russianoff, the senior attorney with
the Straphangers Campaign, which is also part of the coalition
supporting a new subway line. ``If we want to have the jobs of a
growing economy we have to be able to get the people to them. And
we've maxed out. The Lex is at 140 percent of capacity during rush
hour. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   There is wide support for the new subway line, ranging from the
Auto Club of New York to the New York City Partnership and the
Environmental Defense Fund. The stars are in alignment. All we need
is leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pataki? Mr. Silver?

DE LA HOYA AND TRINIDAD EVENLY MATCHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; This time it seems almost impossible to answer such a question:
Who's going to win the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad fight on
Saturday night in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   Ask 10 people and you'll get 10 scenarios, split five and five
as to the projected winner. All 10 will be perfectly plausible.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason the long-awaited welterweight
title-unification bout is so intriguing: If ever there was a
tossup, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   They're both undefeated: De La Hoya 31-0 with 25 knockouts,
Trinidad 35-0 with 30 KOs. Each is 26 and in his prime. De La Hoya
is 5-foot-11, Trinidad 5-10. They're both hard punchers with solid
boxing skills. And they're both winners.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas, the odds are essentially ``pick 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   So who will have his hand raised when it's over?
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, of course.
</P>
<P>
   How did we come to that conclusion? Another good question.
</P>
<P>
   The fighters' capabilities are so similar that it's incredibly
difficult to differentiate between them. They both box well, punch
well, are vicious, get up from a knockdown, have guts, train hard
and have that certain something that makes superstars. So we'll
concentrate on the one most significant advantage each one appears
to have.
</P>
<P>
   For Trinidad, that might be hunger.
</P>
<P>
   The idol of Puerto Rico has made good money but nothing like De
La Hoya's head-shaking haul, which doesn't sit well with Trinidad
because he's been the IBF champion since 1993 _ four years longer
than De La Hoya has held the WBC 147-pound title _ and is convinced
he's better than the Golden Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad also hasn't fought much recently _ five times in three
years _ because of problems with his promoter, Don King. Earlier in
his championship run, King failed to get him big fights. Later his
career, he was put on hold when he tried unsuccessfully to break
his contract with the promoter.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the frustration simmered inside him. Now he's
bursting to show the world what he can do and it might be that De
La Hoya has the misfortune of standing in his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what worries me,'' said one executive involved in the
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, De La Hoya admits he has found it difficult to
maintain his motivation amid all his success.
</P>
<P>
   Between personal appearances, endorsement and commercial
obligations, problems inside his camp and his young family, boxing
has became a smaller and smaller part of his life. Emanuel Steward,
his former trainer, predicted De La Hoya would lose in part because
of the distractions, and he might be right.
</P>
<P>
   If he's wrong, it might be because of De La Hoya's distinct
advantage: experience.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, who is less than a month older than De La Hoya, has
four more fights than his rival. However, his level of competition
has been far inferior to that of De La Hoya. Who has he fought? His
most significant opponent was Oba Carr (whom De La Hoya also
defeated) in 1994. Since then, he has faced not a single opponent
worth mentioning, unless a 35-year-old Pernell Whitaker, just out
of drug rehab in February, is to be taken seriously _ and he isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Trinidad has never been in the ring with the likes of
De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, De La Hoya, once criticized for his lack of
competition, has faced several meaningful tests. Most
significantly, he outpointed a younger (33), determined Whitaker in
1997 and did the same to Ike Quartey in an unforgettable bout in
February, in which De La Hoya outslugged the immensely strong
Ghanian in the 12th and final round to clinch the victory.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya also has had considerable big-fight experience. His
bouts with Rafael Ruelas, Whitaker, Julio Cesar Chavez and Quartey
have taken place under the glare of tremendously bright lights,
which a fighter must endure to understand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such experience _ in terms of both the level of
opposition and magnitude of promotion _ cannot be underestimated.
In the end, it will be the difference in the fight: De La Hoya will
win because he's been there several times and Trinidad hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   What about the hunger issue?
</P>
<P>
   Great fighters get up for big fights and De La Hoya is a great
fighter. He knows that this is a pivotal moment in his career _
perhaps !ital!the pivotal moment. The guess here is that he'll be
able to put everything else aside when he steps into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: De La Hoya by decision.
</P>
<P>
   __ Calling it quits: Pat Goossen and his son P.J. Gosssen are
finished with boxing, the elder Goossen said.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Goossen has fought, trained, managed and promoted for the
past 30 years. P.J. Goossen, who lost a one-sided decision to
Hector Camacho in his most recent fight, is the last of three
brothers to step into the ring. He finished with a record of 19-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in my family will fight again,'' said Pat Goossen, the
brother of promoter Dan Goossen and trainer Joe Goossen. ``Boxing
is a losing proposition, a dead-end street.
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS: JIANG EMBRACES A NEW `OLD FRIEND'
</HEADLINE>
   (With CHINA-JIANG) 
(rk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Last year, in the aura of Bill Clinton's buoyant
visit, the Chinese called the American president a great statesman
and the United States a strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly this spring, as ``U.S.-led NATO'' bombed
Yugoslavia and then hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Clinton
was described as a fiend, and the United States as an evil empire.
</P>
<P>
   With their meeting in New Zealand on Saturday, President Jiang
Zemin is once again dancing with ``my old friend'' Clinton, as he
put it a few days ago. Beijing newspapers Sunday morning featured
pictures of the two smiling leaders shaking hands and did not even
mention the Belgrade Embassy disaster, which killed three Chinese
and prompted days of angry demonstrations outside the American
Embassy in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Warier and perhaps wiser than before, China and the United
States are starting to restore normal relations. They seem
determined to seal the bond by finally, after years of tortured
negotiations, agreeing on terms for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   These wild gyrations in Chinese-American relations are a
reminder of the subterranean passions that have always buffeted
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   But China's rapid return to smiles also reflects a more basic
truth, Chinese foreign policy experts and Western diplomats say.
For economic and strategic reasons, they say, China's leaders see
no good alternative to cooperative relations with the United States
in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Recent events, including the American pursuit of the war in
Kosovo and Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's pugnacious assertions
of virtual independence, have sharpened the sense in some quarters
here, especially the military, that a showdown with the United
States over Taiwan may occur at some point.
</P>
<P>
   But for the immediate future, China's leaders hope their hand
will not be forced on Taiwan, because they are far more anxious to
concentrate on overhauling the economy and building up national
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large consensus here that the relationship with the
United States is the cornerstone of our global strategy,'' said Jin
Canrong, an expert on international politics at the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences. To speed China's modernization and avoid a
costly arms race in Asia, he said, most officials believe that ``we
have to deal with the United States in a steady way.''
</P>
<P>
   China's renewed push to join the World Trade Organization shows
how deeply its foreign policy has become intertwined with domestic
goals. Entry into the trade body, the leaders feel, will aid their
drive to shake out state enterprises and create a market-driven
economy _ their only path to prosperity at home and greatness
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, with unemployment growing and sporadic
reports of social unrest, the pruning of state enterprises slowed,
and powerful industries lobbied against making deep concessions to
the West on trade. Rumors spread this summer that Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji, the main torch-bearer for economic reform, had
threatened to resign.
</P>
<P>
   But by summer's end it appeared that the leaders had
unequivocally decided to plunge ahead with ambitious economic
reforms regardless of the short-term risks, and in so doing to
resume trade talks with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Jiang has staked his own prestige on the state
enterprise overhaul, blitzing the country to deliver speeches with
titles like ``Fortify Confidence, Deepen Reform, and Create a New
Situation for State Enterprise Development.'' Proposals to speed
along change _ consolidating and saving key state firms while
letting others go private or bankrupt _ will be the centerpiece of
a Communist Party meeting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Entry into the WTO, officials here have concluded, is essential
to that task.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Zhu have been heard invoking an old saying: ``Let the
water flow to wash the sand away.'' In this case, the water is the
stiff competition that will result from trade organization
membership, washing away the inefficiencies of hidebound
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rhetoric about entering the WTO on relaxed,
developing-country rules, the Chinese have already agreed to make
sharp cuts in farm and industrial tariffs and to begin opening
industries like automobiles, telecommunications and banking to
outside competition.
</P>
<P>
   Membership, if it is achieved, will of course bring some direct
economic benefits. A study by the China International Capital
Corp., an investment bank in Beijing that is a joint venture by the
government and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, concluded that the
resulting freer trade would increase the gross domestic product by
between 0.5 percent and 1 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But that same report pointed to some of the hazards: millions
more farmers would become redundant, for example, with no obvious
new opportunities opening up soon. And China's fledgling social
security systems are not ready for a new surge in industrial
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States and China have cautioned that a
trade agreement has not been clinched.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Taiwan remains the most dangerous and convoluted
issue in Chinese-American relations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continued bluster in the official press, Chinese
officials have assured the Americans that they are not planning any
military action unless Taiwan takes further steps toward formal
independence. And for now, China appreciates Clinton's restatement
of American support for ``one China'' and counts on Washington to
restrain Taiwan from precipitous moves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chinese also resent American arms sales to Taiwan and
they know that if they ever do attack Taiwan, the United States is
likely to join the battle.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE COMPLETE STORIES OF EVELYN WAUGH'' &QL; 
(Little, Brown, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His style,'' said Edmund Wilson, ``has the desperate
jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking
ship.'' Evelyn Waugh was wicked and funny, and his fellow writers
were happy to apply the same tactics to him. Here are his works of
short fiction, 39 stories collected for the first time in hardcover
for American readers (the book was adapted from a scholarly edition
published last year in Great Britain). They include ``By Special
Request,'' in which Waugh suggests an alternative ending to his
novel, ``A Handful of Dust,'' and ``Charles Ryder's Schooldays,'' a
chapter in the life of the hero of ``Brideshead Revisited,''
published 16 years after Waugh's death. To coincide with this
volume, Back Bay Books has reissued ``Brideshead Revisited,''
``Decline and Fall,'' ``Vile Bodies,'' ``A Handful of Dust'' and
``Scoop'' in paperback. The books are like Waugh himself _
handsome, with viciously funny stories inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME'' &QL; 
By Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a LOT more about her, and it is dumbfoundingly
interesting. Houston does nothing, really, except talk about
herself in these essays, yet unlike her filmed recitations for
television's ``Sunday Morning,'' these monologues pull you in, and
before you know it, you've stayed for the duration. Maybe it's the
swagger in what she has to say, the stockpile of experience, the
competence at things that are foreign to many women, and many men,
for that matter. If you've read her short-story collections
(``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' ``Waltzing the Cat''), you know that
Houston is on intimate terms with adventure, with wilderness, with
danger, and with difficult men who thrive on all three. She has
been a hunting guide in the mountains of Alaska, and she has run so
many white-water rivers in so many countries that she can't
remember them all. She was addicted to risk for a long time, but
she's getting over it. She has a ranch now, and is learning to call
it her own. Finally, she has good friends and, it seems, a
boyfriend who goes against type. In one of these essays she takes
him winter camping and he admits that he has never slept on the
ground before. What's amazing is that she doesn't hold it against
him. Her essays are about mountains, rivers, horses, dogs, hunters
and _ we sure didn't see this one coming _ her lifelong obsession
with her weight. ``Even to this day,'' she writes, ``call me stupid
and I'll laugh in your face; call me a bad writer and I'll discuss
art with you all day long; but call me fat and you'll send me
sobbing to the bathroom, and I'll wear tent dresses for the next
six days.'' It might be the most ordinary thing we've ever heard
about Pam Houston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BEST SHOTS: THE GREATEST NFL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(DK, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Barry Sanders on Page 70,'' writes Joe Namath
in his foreword. ``Just look at his feet, his legs, his body
movement, his motion _ how his body weight is leaning so hard to
one side. Look at that right foot of his! And he's still going at
full speed, you know, he's not falling down. I mean, he's exploding
somewhere.'' It's true, you'll be impressed. Sanders, photographed
in 1995 by Allen Kee, is cutting so hard that his body is hanging
out over thin air and the twist of his pivot foot has distorted the
leather of his shoe _ AND HE'S NOT FALLING DOWN. Or look at Lynn
Swann on Page 84, making, in 1976, one of the most spectacular
catches in Super Bowl history. Or at Terry Glenn, turning to draw
in a Drew Bledsoe pass that has just emerged from a dense fog that
hides anything more than a few feet above the field. Or at
linebacker Chuck Bednarik celebrating over the prostrate form of
Frank Gifford, who looks like road kill in a helmet. There's lots
of drama here, but our favorite is a quiet photograph that puts the
others to shame. It shows, quite simply, Walter Payton running a
path created for him by his Chicago Bears teammates. It's an
understated moment that reveals football at its best _ the
precision teamwork, the finesse, the choreography of the game.
(That's the Giants' Mark Ingram on the book jacket, celebrating in
the end zone.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LISTEN TO THIS!'' &QL; 
By Alan Reder and John Baxter (Hyperion, $16.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reder and Baxter spent four years interviewing popular musicians
about their favorite artists and recordings. The result is this
volume, which offers educated and honest opinions (Dave Matthews
says he listens to Keith Jarrett's album, ``The Koln Concert,''
because ``it calms me down, like watching windshield wipers'')
about today's music from some of the people who know it best. The
Beatles are mentioned more than any other group or artist. Other
favorites include James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, Muddy
Waters, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Elvis
Presley, Charlie Parker, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Charles and
Bob Dylan. But not all of the names are famous, so it's possible to
discover new territory for your own listening pleasure. The authors
note, for example, that Dave Matthews, Ani DiFranco and Victoria
Williams all list among their favorites ``an obscure but very
special album'' by Mary Margaret O'Hara called ``Miss America.''
The book includes a master list of artists, and its index will
inspire you, too. Among the musicians polled are Pat Metheny,
Waylon Jennings, Joan Armatrading, Vassar Clements, Michael Doucet,
Pete Seeger, Sonny Rollins, Willie Nelson, Branford Marsalis, Bobby
McFerrin, Herbie Hancock and Dr. John. &QL;

ONCE UPON A TIME, LITERATURE. NOW WHAT?

 By JAMES SALTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first great task in life, by far the most important one, the
one on which everything else depends, can be described in three
words. Very simply, it is learning to speak. Language _ whatever
language, English, Swahili, Japanese _ is the requisite for the
human condition. Without it there is nothing. There is the beauty
of the world and the beauty of existence, or the sorrow if you
like, but without language they are inexpressible.
</P>
<P>
   Animals are our companions, but they cannot, in any comparable
sense, speak. They do not have, even the most majestic or
intelligent of them _ whales, elephants, lions _ a God. In whatever
form, our apprehension and worship of God is entirely dependent on
language: prayers, sermons, hymns, the Bible or other text. Without
language God might exist but could not be described.
</P>
<P>
   In the richness of language, its grace, breadth, dexterity, lies
its power. To speak with clarity, brevity and wit is like holding a
lightning rod. We are drawn to people who know things and are able
to express them: Dr. Johnson, Shakespeare. Language like theirs
sets the tone, the language of poets, of heroes. A certain level of
life, an impregnable level, belongs to them.
</P>
<P>
   There is not just one language, however. There are two, the
spoken and the written. The spoken is like breath, effortless and
at hand. The written is another matter. Learning to read and write
is a difficult business, the second portal. Once through it, you
are into the open, as it were, the endless vistas. The biblios is
there for you. I made up the word. It means library, archive, vast
collection. A made-up word here or there is not much. Shakespeare
made up nearly one in 12 of the more than 20,000 he used overall;
at least no previous use of them is known. The King James Bible by
comparison contains only some 8,000 different words.
</P>
<P>
   In the biblios are books, manuscripts, newspapers, printouts of
Web sites, letters, all manner of things. The books are the most
important. It is from reading them that one gets the urge to be a
writer, or so it used to be. The first book that I believe I read
in its entirety and on my own was ``All Quiet on the Western
Front.'' I can't say that reading it made me want to be a writer,
or that I became an avid reader, but the confidence and simplicity
of the prose made a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
   I remember lines from it even today. Sixty years have passed. I
later heard that Erich Maria Remarque had been the editor of a
German fashion magazine and decided to quit his job and write a
novel. You're crazy, they told him. But the issues of Die Dame, or
whatever it was, the lunches and dinners and perhaps the models
have all disappeared, but not the novel.
</P>
<P>
   I understood, of course _ it was dogma _ that a true education
was based on being well read, and for 10 years or more I read all I
could. These were wonderful years of voyage, discovery and
self-esteem. I would never catch up with those for whom reading was
a passion, but I had climbed high.
</P>
<P>
   I read less now. Perhaps it's loss of appetite. I read fewer
books _ reading is a pleasure, and I'm supposed to be working _ but
I am not less interested in them. They have not moved from their
central position in my life.
</P>
<P>
   At one time I thought frequently about death. It was when I was
barely 30 and said to myself, ``More than a third of your life is
gone!'' Now, for a different reason, I have started to think about
it again. I like the image of the ancients, the crossing of a
river. Sometimes I think of what, when the time comes, I might want
to have with me. I can go without an expensive watch, without money
or clothes, without a toothbrush, without having shaved, but can I
go without certain books and, more than books, things I have
written, not necessarily published?
</P>
<P>
   The other day I was reading an essay by Deborah Eisenberg, a
writer I have never met, called ``Resistance.'' Very well written,
it brought to mind the lucidity and aplomb of Virginia Woolf. The
subject of the essay was writing, and I came, midway, to a sentence
that ended, ``part of the same disaster that has placed virtually
every demanding or complex literary experience beyond our culture's
confines.''
</P>
<P>
   I stopped there. I was unable to go on until I had sorted out a
number of thoughts that had been aroused. ``The same disaster ...''
It brought to mind Kazantzakis' observation that the Apollonian
crust of the world had, in modern times, been broken. From
somewhere beneath, the Dionysian had poured forth.
</P>
<P>
   Then the last words of the sentence, ``our culture's confines.''
There came the persistent question: What is culture and what has
become of ours? The dictionary definition is vague, ``the sum total
of the attainments and learned behavior patterns of any specific
period or people.'' Let me list instead what I consider the
components. I would say culture is language, art, history and
customs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We know that what is called popular culture has overwhelmed high
culture with consequences not yet fully realized. Pop culture's
patrons, youth and a large number of those who were formerly young,
have rewarded it with immense riches, advancing it further. Junk
like George Lucas' ``Star Wars'' trilogy or quintet becomes the
most consuming and widely discussed, sometimes in terms appropriate
to masterworks, artistic endeavor. Are we witnessing a mere
collapse of taste or the actual genesis of a new myth worthy of
replacing the outdated Trojan War or of standing beside it? As with
the glorious stock boom, age-old standards of value are henceforth
cast aside.
</P>
<P>
   We seem to have seen it already, those of us old enough to
remember. It was then called ``Flash Gordon,'' with similar
location and cast, a cruel and omnipotent villain, a beautiful
girlfriend of the hero, a wise old counselor, futuristic weapons,
spacecraft, distant planets, air armadas. It was only a comic strip
then. Schoolboys followed it. In its new form it has become a mine
for academics and for those undergraduate courses called film
studies.
</P>
<P>
   When I wrote movies, which I did for about 15 years, thinking of
Graham Greene and John Steinbeck, who were writers as well as film
writers, I was for a long time unaware of what it all looks like
viewed from above, a writer as someone who must be employed
preliminary to the real work. And the balance between what I wrote
and what was made was low, about four scripts written for each one
shot, with the best work often ending up in the trash. The waste
was depressing and also the venal stench that is the perfume of the
business. Still, the ascendance of movies is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   The life-giving novel, like the theater, despite occasional
flare-ups, belongs to the past. There is a limited audience.
Celine, in an interview in The Paris Review, said, ``Novels are
something like lace ... an art that went out with the convent.''
Literature is not dead _ students still read Dostoyevsky and
Whitman _ but it has lost its eminence. The tide is turning against
it.
</P>
<P>
   I have heard figures of authority say that the Beatles' songs
will be played 300 years from now, and that Richard Wagner, were he
alive today, would be a movie director. Can these things be true?
We are not in a position to know, nor can we even be sure which way
the great ship is turning.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few things seem certain. The future, as DeLillo put it,
belongs to crowds. The megacities, like cancer, have appeared with
their great extremes of poverty and wealth, their isolation from
what was called the natural world with its rivers, forests, silent
dawns and nights. The new populations will live in hives of
concrete on a diet of film, television and the Internet. We are
what we eat. We are also what we see and hear. And we are in the
midst of our one and only life.
</P>
<P>
   More and more I am aware of people who are successful in every
visible way and who have no sensitivity to art, no interest in
history, and are essentially indifferent to language. It's hard to
imagine that anything in their experience other than the birth of a
child might elicit from them the word transcendent; ecstasy for
them has a purely physical meaning, and yet they are happy. Culture
is not necessary for them although they like to keep up with movies
and music and perhaps the occasional best seller. Is culture
essential, then? Not pop culture but something higher, something
that may endure?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. Whether humankind or nations advance or decline is
a matter of unimportance to the planets and what lies beyond. If
civilizations reach a new zenith or if they founder is a concern
only to us and not really much of a concern since individually we
can do so little about it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it is frightening to think of a glib, soulless,
pop culture world. There is the urge toward things that are not
meaningless, that will not vanish completely without leaving the
slightest ripple. The corollary to this is the desire to be
connected to the life that has gone before, to stand in the ancient
places, to hear the undying stories. Art is the real history of
nations, it has been said. What we call literature, which is really
only writing that never stops being read, is part of this. When it
relinquishes its place, what is there to substitute for it?
</P>
<P>
   It was Edwin Arlington Robinson, I think, who when he lay dying
asked that his bed be taken out beneath the stars. That's the idea,
anyway, not to breathe your last looking at some TV sitcom, but to
die in the presence of great things, those riches _ the greatest of
all riches, in fact _ that can be in the reach of anyone.

PUERTO RICAN NATIONALISTS RETURN HOME FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: INSERTS number of released nationalists in 2nd graf.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ As a group of Puerto Rican nationalists
returned home to the cheers of supporters and relatives, the
political firestorm surrounding their release from prison continued
unabated here.
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared that most Puerto Ricans supported their
release, only a minority of islanders share the radical
pro-independence politics of the 11 nationalists, who were released
on Friday under a conditional clemency offer extended by President
Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   If supporters of independence welcomed them as heroes, some
supporters of statehood derided them as terrorists. Still, many
islanders said they felt the nationalists had more than paid for
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   They had served almost 20 years each on sentences ranging from
35 to 90 years. All of them had been imprisoned on sedition and
weapons convictions stemming from their involvement in the Armed
Forces of National Liberation, a pro-independence group blamed for
130 bombings in the United States that killed six people and
wounded dozens of others from 1974 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing they are released, because it was too harsh
a sentence. They should have been released years ago,'' said Asha
Cintron, 26, a bartender in Old San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fighting for a cause,'' said Iris Vega, 32, an
artist. ``They haven't killed anyone. They haven't raped anyone.
Why should they be in prison more than 20 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Cortes, 44, was the first of the former prisoners to
arrive in San Juan, late Friday. Elizam Escobar, Adolfo Matos,
Dylcia Noemi Pagan, Alicia Rodriguez, Ida Luz Rodriguez and Carmen
Valentin arrived on Saturday. Ricardo Jimenez and Luis Rosa had not
yet arrived by late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, Alberto Rodriguez and Alejandrina Torres, decided to
stay in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving in San Juan, all the prisoners thanked their
supporters, while lamenting the fact that other Puerto Rican
nationalists remained imprisoned. Despite their standard parole
conditions, which bar them from meeting with one another or with
other convicted felons, they said they would continue to struggle
for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   Far from the celebrations at the airport, members of the
pro-statehood New Progressive Party, meeting at the weekend for
their annual convention, worried about the effect the issue of
clemency for the radicals could have on relations between the
United States and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The party's secretary-general, Jorge Davila, a former tourism
director, said the controversy involving the release of the
nationalists and the backlash on the mainland against Clinton's
clemency offer could hurt tourism, one of Puerto Rico's main
sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the controversy could shape the outcome of the
struggle over the off-shore island of Vieques. The Puerto Rican
government wants the U.S. Navy to stop military maneuvers on the
island and return the land the Navy controls there.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Vieques issue has brought about a rare consensus of the
island's pro-statehood, pro-commonwealth and pro-independence
factions. Clinton has appointed a panel to investigate whether
there are feasible alternatives for Vieques. The panel will release
its recommendations this month.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expressing concern over the nationalists' release
was Carlos Romero Barcelo, the former governor of Puerto Rico who
is now the island's sole representative to the U.S. Congress.
Romero Barcelo, who has called the prisoners terrorists, told
reporters he was worried that the controversy might harm the
statehood movement's main goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we ask for equality for Puerto Rico if in Puerto Rico
people defend those who have declared war on the United States?''
Romero Barcelo said.
</P>
<P>
   While Puerto Ricans revel in their national pride, there is
little outright support for independence, which garnered less than
3 percent of the vote in a 1998 referendum. The statehood movement,
which has been growing, pulled down 46 percent of that vote.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
LANDOVER, Md. _ Dallas coach Chan Gailey couldn't breathe. Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman couldn't see. And others with neither
problem simply couldn't stand to watch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But unlike in the first quarter, when the same ball slipped
through Raghib Ismail's hands, this 76-yard bomb was caught, and
Rocket launched himself into the end zone, thus completing one of
the biggest comebacks in Dallas Cowboys history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite trailing by 21 points with less than 11 minutes to play,
the Cowboys plugged away to defeat the Washington Redskins 41-35 in
overtime Sunday in a season opener played before a record crowd of
79,237 at Redskins Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it suspended in air or anything,'' Gailey said.
``But when he caught it, I think I breathed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was third-and-two at the Cowboys' 24, and Gailey suspected
the Redskins were probably thinking run. He hoped Emmitt Smith was
as good an actor as he had been a rusher all day. Smith simulated a
run off a perfect Aikman play fake, the safeties bit, and the
Cowboys matched the best comeback in their history. They last
overcame a 21-point deficit against New Orleans in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to (throw to) Rocket there in the first
quarter with it, and the safeties bit up then, and we didn't come
down with it,'' Aikman said. ``I thought it was a great call when
the call was made. I thought it had a chance to work. I won't get a
chance to really appreciate how Rocket sold the route until I watch
it on film, but I thought it was a great call, and it was executed
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally on that play, you make the play, and you have your
back to the line of scrimmage, and you look for the safeties to see
whether they bit. But the way that game was going, I came out of
the fake, and I couldn't see anybody. The whole time the ball was
in the air, I thought a safety was going to come out of left field
and intercept it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Redskins' safeties _ and the whole Washington defense,
for that matter _ had quit making plays at the end of the third
quarter after shutting out the Cowboys since their first two
possessions.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Cowboys to score four touchdowns in the fourth
quarter and beyond, one on a one-yard run by Smith and three on
passes by Aikman. Aikman connected with Michael Irvin on touchdowns
of 37 and 12 yards, the second tying the game (with Richie
Cunningham's bounce-through extra point off the left upright) at
35. Aikman then threw the 76-yarder to Ismail for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great quarterback,'' Redskins rookie cornerback Champ
Bailey said. ``He knew exactly what he was doing at the end and
just picked us apart. He was strong and composed and wasn't broken
by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since the Redskins continued to give Dallas chances.
With the game tied, the Redskins got possession at their 20 with
1:46 to play. They never moved a yard, punting after three failed
pass attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys then got the ball with 1:22 remaining, but two plays
later, Darryl Pounds intercepted Aikman, and momentum again shifted
to the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had great momentum on our side at that time,'' Aikman said.
``The interception at that point was devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas corner Kevin Mathis, playing for the injured Kevin Smith,
made what could have been a fatal mistake, getting flagged for pass
interference on a ball intended for Michael Westbrook. It was a
24-yard penalty, advancing the Redskins to the Dallas 23 with 12
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But in what had become a comedy of errors, the snap on the
field-goal attempt was bobbled, forcing holder Mark Turk to
scramble for the end zone. Turk then fumbled as the clock ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is probably the wildest football game I've ever
been a part of,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   The difference seemed to be veteran leadership. Despite having
trailed by 21, the Cowboys insisted they never felt out of it, and
the results proved they never let down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any big Knute Rockne speech on the sideline
before we took the field (for overtime),'' Gailey said. ``But we'd
been moving the ball. I think there was a lot of confidence when we
walked out there. It didn't matter if it was the minus-five or the
50, I think our guys had confidence they were going to take it down
there and stick it in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that confidence didn't waver when the Cowboys had six
consecutive drives in the second and third quarters end in four
punts and two interceptions. The Cowboys ran only 24 plays in those
drives, amassing a mere 58 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awfully big show of character by our football team,
and I was really impressed,'' Gailey said. ``There were some
executions that were not good on both sides of the ball. There were
times when it looked like we were getting pushed around on the
field. There were times that it was three downs and out, and our
character never faded on the sidelines, and that's what wins.''
</P>
<P>
   That and an offense featuring Aikman, who completed 28 of 49
passes for 362 yards and five touchdowns. He completed passes to
nine players, including tight end David LaFleur, who scored the
Cowboys' first two touchdowns on receptions of 15 and 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And in an offense that now features the speedy Ismail to pull
defenders off Irvin, the two proved to be a formidable combination.
Ismail caught eight balls for 149 yards, Irvin five for 122.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the Cowboys struggled, largely because of the
absence of corners Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith. The
unavailability of Sanders, still recovering from toe surgery, was a
game-time decision, and he could play as soon as next week against
Atlanta. Smith, who has a bad back, is out indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys allowed the Redskins to score 32 unanswered points
to go from a 14-3 deficit to a 35-14 lead. New Washington
quarterback Brad Johnson threw for 382 yards and two touchdowns.
Stephen Davis ran for 109 yards and another pair of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have some games like this,'' Dallas safety
George Teague said. ``But the message to get out of this is that we
can overcome it. And we're not going to give up 35 points very
often.''
</P>
<P>
   They passed the test this time, but it's not one they want to
take again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys on this team have never been put to that kind of
test,'' said Emmitt Smith, who finished with 109 yards rushing on
23 carries. ``At this level here, it's easy to crawl under the
bench and suck on your wounds and feel sorry for yourself. I'm glad
to see we have a group of guys who just won't quit.''

A VIGOROUS CARDINAL O'CONNOR RETURNS TO PULPIT AFTER SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW      
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his first public appearance since doctors removed
a small tumor from his brain, Cardinal John O'Connor on Sunday
nimbly climbed six steep steps to the pulpit of St. Patrick's
Cathedral, where he delivered a 20-minute homily that blended a
serious message about helping those ``who have the least'' with
gracious humor about his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a truly marvelous funeral,'' he said, relishing
the warm applause from about 2,500 people who filled the Cathedral
for the cardinal's annual Mass in honor of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, 79, did not offer details about the type of tumor
discovered on his brain, but he described the operation to remove
it as ``extraordinarily successful.'' The doctors have told him, he
said, that he should recover after radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal was released from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center on Sept. 4 after a 10-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Sunday's Mass, the cardinal showed no sign of ill
health. As always, he sprinkled his remarks with effortless wit and
a deft political touch. ``I look down and see Mayor Ed Koch and
think it must be Midnight Mass at Christmas,'' he said at the
outset of his homily, as Koch laughed along from his seat up front.
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious level, the cardinal announced an initiative to
protect immigrants from what he described as the ``cruel
underside'' of immigrant life.
</P>
<P>
   With the New York City Central Labor Council, he said, the
archdiocese is forming the Commission on the Dignity of Immigrants.
Staffed by Labor Council volunteers and immigration specialists
from Catholic Charities, the commission will set up a telephone
line that immigrants can call with concerns about wage and hour
violations, housing discrimination or naturalization problems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will also make policy recommendations to
government agencies on immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal, who has forged close ties with organized labor in
New York, reminded congregants that he is the son of a union man.
In fact, he quipped, when his prognosis was unclear, ``I insisted
that my casket have a union label.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal deflected speculation that he may retire in
January, when he turns 80. He confided that he had received ``a
beautiful letter'' from Pope John Paul II, presumably wishing him a
speedy recovery. The cardinal said he is going to send the pope all
the newspaper stories listing who might succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't yet told me I'll be succeeded, if or when,''
O'Connor said. ``But I'll pass on to him these names.''

TESTAVERDE LOST FOR SEASON IN JETS' 30-28 LOSS TO PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The game was not yet 23 minutes old, the
Jets' season of a Super Bowl dream had not even reached its first
halftime when Vinny Testaverde went down Sunday, on his knees,
hunched into a human ball. Howling. With his left Achilles' tendon
ruptured, with a pain in his head and in his heart that told him it
was over for him for the year, right then, right there, on a Jets'
fumble that bounced around and with Testaverde spinning, twisting,
trying to pounce on it. Snap. It was over.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field he went, in a cart, with all Jets eyes following
him, with the 78,227 fans in Giants Stadium watching in a deep
trance. The New England Patriots were mesmerized, too. How can such
a thing happen? In the first game? With your starting quarterback?
With an All-Pro quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Snap.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, the Jets spent the rest of the game wondering one
thing: How are we going to recover from this? They asked themselves
that daunting question for this game and for the season. For the
game, they could not, losing 30-28 on an Adam Vinatieri 23-yard
field goal with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   For the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose your quarterback, everybody is going to have to
adjust,'' said Jets' Coach Bill Parcells. Parcells knows Testaverde
_ who a few hours after the game was scheduled for surgery _ faces
a grueling recovery that will last at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not putting the white flag up,'' Parcells said. ``We
will have to adjust and make the most of it and see what we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly what safety Steve Atwater expected when in
the offseason he arrived from the two-time Super Bowl champion
Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be difficult to win the Super Bowl either way,
with Vinny or without him,'' Atwater said. ``We've got great guys
here and we'll want to pull together and get the job done. We have
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Bryan Cox said: ``Vinny is a big part of what we do.
It's tough, man. They ain't going to cancel the schedule. You guys
were talking, `Super Bowl, Super Bowl, Super Bowl.' Now you'll be
saying, `We're dead, we're dead, we're dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was some of the Jets who nearly said that. They
were emotional, of course, after the Testaverde loss, after this
crushing season-opening defeat at home to a nasty divisional rival.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them was receiver Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in a million years did I think I was going to lose my
starting quarterback,'' Johnson said. He was relatively composed
during his post-game news conference, with cameras rolling and
lights flashing and writers penning his every word, and then
Johnson actually said what a lot of the Jets privately felt. His
comments were full of expletives and he said: ``There's nothing you
can do. You can't do anything. There's nothing ... ''
</P>
<P>
   And he pounded his fist on the lectern and, full of dejection,
left the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had pounded his fist nearly a dozen times on the turf
when injured.
</P>
<P>
   He went down with 7:12 left in the second quarter with the Jets
trailing by 10-7. It was an unusual injury, one where he was not
hit, on a first-and-10 play at the New England 18-yard line. He
made a handoff to back Curtis Martin, Martin was stripped behind
the line of scrimmage by Willie McGinest and the ball bounced near
the Patriots' 25. As Martin dived for the ball, Testaverde spun and
tried diving for it. Martin got it. Testaverde wound up writhing in
pain. Snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew,'' Parcells said when asked just how the injury
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Testaverde's left foot had been caught in the
Astro-Turf. It twisted and the Achilles' tendon snapped.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, the game would undertake a surreal,
hangover-like complexion.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde had been off to a great start _ completing 10 of 15
passes for 96 yards with a touchdown and an interception. Tom Tupa
(6 of 10 for 165 yards with two touchdown passes) entered, and on
his first play threw a 25-yard scoring strike to Johnson. The Jets
were ahead, 14-10, despite the shock of the Testaverde loss. And
then the Jets gained a safety to end the half and left the field
ahead by 16-10.
</P>
<P>
   But at halftime the reality of what had happened to the Jets
must have sunk in, both to the Jets and to the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets played the third quarter in a funk. The Patriots began
blitzing Tupa relentlessly. Tupa had been inserted because the Jets
could not have used quarterback Rick Mirer without losing Tupa for
the reast of the game, according to league rules concerning a
team's three quarterbacks. That rule is waived at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. Thus, Mirer, Parcells' choice for the backup
quarterback, had to wait and then played all of the fourth quarter.
Tupa played all of the third.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, the Jets were blitzed by 17-0 before
answering. McGinest recovered a Tupa fumble in the end zone, Terry
Allen dashed 22 yards for a touchdown on a third-and-2 run and
Vinatieri booted a 21-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That blow to Vinny shocked us for a while,'' said Jets
linebacker Roman Phifer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were kind of wobbly right there,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   And then Cox helped lead a resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   With 3:53 left in the third quarter, Tupa tossed a 7-yard
touchdown pass to tight end Fred Baxter on third-and-goal. Patriots
27, Jets 22 entering the fourth quarter. Fewer than five minutes
into it, Cox intercepted a pass from Drew Bledsoe and returned 27
yards for a touchdown. Jets 28, Patriots 27.
</P>
<P>
   On their last two scores, the Jets tried two-point conversion
passes that failed. On their first possession of the fourth
quarter, at the Patriots' 14, rather than attempt a 24-yard field
goal, the Jets ran a fake field-goal attempt and Tupa ran for the
first down, missing it by less than a foot. The Jets called for
instant replay, questioning the official's spot, but the call was
not overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking the extra points and the field goals in those situations
might have given the Jets 5 more points and maybe the victory. Then
again, nothing was certain on this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some things there we thought would work and they
didn't, but if they had, who knows?'' Parcells said. ``God's
playing sometimes. That's life in the big city. This can be a very
humbling game. It can turn very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells knows there is little sympathy for his team from his
opponents. ``Nobody cares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots offered respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to seize the game and it started to turn but we
didn't do it,'' said Patriots Coach Pete Carroll. ``They were too
gallant, they stayed with it, they wouldn't go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Jets did.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chris Slade intercepted a tipped Mirer pass at the
Jets 49 with 3:30 left. New England behind Bledsoe (21 of 30, 340
yards, 1 touchdown, 1 interception) moved methodically to the Jets
3. New England converted the field goal, allowing the Jets time for
one more play, Mirer's frantic toss that was batted down near the
Patriots' 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots three-game losing streak to the Jets was snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in after the game and heard something by coach in the
locker room but I don't remember,'' Martin said. ``I heard it but I
didn't hear it. I was in my own little world. I feel bad for Vinny.
Vinny is the leader of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   So many Jets in their ``own little world.'' Dazed. The shock.
The dream. Now the Jets must snap out of it. There are, for
certain, 15 games left.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Vinny went out of the game it lifted the black clouds
over our heads,'' said Patriots receiver Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   And, for now, placed them squarely over the Jets.

WILLIAMS FAMILY PROFITS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-USOPEN)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's just like Irving Berlin used to say: Sisters,
sisters, there were never more devoted sisters. As soon as
17-year-old Serena Williams, who seized the U.S. Open singles
championship and $750,000 Saturday night by throttling Martina
Hingis, it was time to go back to the hard courts and play more
hardball. She and her best pal/big sister/doubles partner for life,
19-year-old Venus, had a doubles final to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to let Venus down at all,'' said Serena, who
didn't, as she and Venus defeated unseeded Chanda Rubin and
Sandrine Testud, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, in the women's doubles final. After
all, it was Venus, huddled in a hooded sweatshirt in the corner of
the family box, who Serena looked to for emotional restoration upon
letting a pair of championship points escape in her final against
Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Venus over there really making sure, pumping me up; it
really helped me,'' said Serena, relieved that her sibling, who she
has never defeated in a professional match, didn't mind being
beaten to the first Grand Slam singles crown on the family mantel.
</P>
<P>
   But Serena said her sister's depression over not beating Hingis
in the semis and create a Williams family dream final was a source
of inspiration to hang tough against Hingis, the player who clamped
down when Venus cramped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen her that down before,'' said Serena, who
described herself and her sister as ``predominantly bitter'' after
each other's losses. ``That really encouraged me to be even more
tough out there, just to have to see her that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on a day that began with an early morning photo shoot in
Central Park, Serena Williams ignored the 21 messages on her cell
phone, put her game face on one more time and joined her sister for
their doubles victory.
</P>
<P>
   Besides partly fulfilling the prediction of their father,
Richard, that this Open would see an all-Williams final, the
sisters captured their second career Grand Slam doubles crown (the
1999 French Open was the first) and pocketed $330,000. In total,
the Williams girls took $1.29 million to the bank for their
two-week Open travail, $915,000 of it reeled in by the little
sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whooo,'' yelped the big winner. ``I guess Uncle Sam's really
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a packed agenda: besides winning her first Grand Slam
title in her first Grand Slam final, Serena, now ranked fourth in
the world, let it slip that, along with her crusade for Hingis' top
spot, she would like to flex her muscles in a different arena and
rival Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's legacy in the wrestling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by puppies, the latest of them a Jack Russell terrier
named Jackie that accompanied her on the court for the doubles
award ceremony, Williams has also expressed a desire to become a
veterinarian someday.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the fifth-seeded Williams sisters reached Sunday's
final with a straight-set dismissal of 12th-seeded Mary Pierce and
Barbara Schett late Saturday night, Serena swapped college talk
with Chelsea Clinton, on the party line with her father, President
Clinton, for a congratulations call. The outcome of that was an
invitation to the White House and the offer of a guided tour of
Stanford from Chelsea when Serena hits town this week for the Fed
Cup championship against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it's a nice campus; I'll have to check it out,'' said
Serena, who foresaw another trip, or at least a commercial, in her
future. ``Disneyworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, still giddy from her singles and doubles sweep, said she
was considering entering the men's event next year, just for the
challenge of it. When she realized she still hadn't had time to
celebrate her championship, her slightly subdued sibling piped in.
``She'll celebrate with her credit card,'' Venus said.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE TURF THAT KILLED THE JETS
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Stretched out face down, Vinny
Testaverde, was pounding the artificial turf with his right fist in
frustration. Or maybe in retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had to tell the New York Jets quarterback that the
Achilles' tendon in his left heel was ruptured. He knew. In the
second quarter of the Jets' opener Sunday, he also knew he now was
out for the season in which he was supposed to lead the Jets to
Super Bowl XXXIV.
</P>
<P>
   And without Testaverde, the Jets may well be out of contention
for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even more frustrating, Testaverde knew he hadn't been hit,
hadn't even been touched. When he saw Curtis Martin fumble, he
tried to pursue the loose ball, but he suddenly collapsed with one
of sports' most painful injuries apparently caused by one of
sports' most treacherous dangers _ artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Coach Bill Parcells would say later when asked
if the turf had caused Testaverde's injury. ``I'd hate to say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But just about everybody else on the Jets was talking about the
turf as if it were a killer at large. According to a Jets' official
in the locker room when Testaverde arrived there, the quarterback
``didn't say anything, but that's two guys we've lost getting their
foot stuck.'' Three really.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days earlier, wide receiver Wayne Chrebet broke his left
foot when he simply tried to cut on the new artificial turf that
had been installed that week at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time in Sunday's 30-28 loss to the New England
Patriots that Chrebet was accompanying Testaverde to Lenox Hill
Hospital in Manhattan for surgery Sunday night, running back Leon
Johnson damaged ligaments in his left knee. He will undergo surgery
and also is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to cut,'' Johnson said. ``My foot got stuck in
the turf. I couldn't pick it up. My knee felt like a cookie
crumbling.''
</P>
<P>
   For this summer's early pro football exhibition games, Giants
Stadium had a grass field to accommodate the MetroStars' soccer
season. But the night after Chrebet got hurt, the MetroStars' best
player, Sasa Curcic, injured his right knee the same way Chrebet
and Testaverde did _ with nobody around him.
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough evidence to tear up the new artificial
turf at Giants Stadium and install grass permanently. God's grass.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority
that operates Giants Stadium, the Giants have supported grass.
Parcells has wondered if grass would still provide a smooth field
late in the season after some 25 pro, college and high-school
games, especially if a rainstorm turned the grass to mud.
</P>
<P>
   In citing Testaverde's injury as ``non-contact,'' Parcells
added, ``God's playing sometimes; that's life in the big city.''
Especially in the National Football League, where injuries often
determine the winner of the Super Bowl each year. But if God's
playing sometimes, He may prefer to be playing on His grass.
</P>
<P>
   And having lost Testaverde, Chrebet and Johnson to this new
artificial turf, Parcells might decide that mud is better than
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   When Testaverde went down, he had completed 10 of 15 passes for
96 yards and the Jets, although losing 10-7, were on the Patriots'
25.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the rest of the Jets' season, Parcells talked about
how, ``We've got 15 games to go. We're going to have to figure out
how to approach those games and get going.'' Most of the Jets'
players spoke bravely, too. So did Keyshawn Johnson for awhile,
until he was overcome by the frustration of losing their
quarterback and offensive captain.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson described Testaverde as ``irreplaceable, but when you
lose somebody like that, you've got to dig deep.'' He soon reverted
to reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do?'' he asked, standing at the microphone in the
Jets' interview area. ``There's nothing you can do. You can't do
anything. There's nothing. We couldn't throw. We're throwing
interceptions . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson banged the podium with both hands, threw a towel in the
air and stalked out, his eyes flashing in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Although Testaverde and Johnson are considered out for the
season, that means the playoffs and the Super Bowl as well. Jumbo
Elliott knows all about a ruptured Achilles' tendon. He needed
surgery for one late in the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long process,'' said Elliott, meaning the rehab. ``You
can't put any weight on it. You've got to work on the scar tissue,
but our guys,'' meaning the Jets' medical staff, ``are the best in
the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Chrebet is expected to be playing in another five weeks, but the
medical staff can't put Testaverde and Johnson together again until
it's time for training camp next year, if then.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde will be 36 on Nov. 13 and coming off such a serious
injury, he might not be as agile and as effective as before unless
he can completely trust his left heel.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, Parcells now will turn to Rick Mirer, the
quarterback he obtained from the Green Bay Packers during training
camp, for next Sunday night's game in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells inserted Tom Tupa Sunday, and Tupa completed 6 of 10
passes for 165 yards and 2 touchdowns, but Mirer, who was 4 of 11
for 28 yards, was the ``emergency'' quarterback who couldn't be
used until the fourth quarter without the Jets losing Tupa as both
a quarterback, punter and holder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick had a couple of chances,'' Parcells said, ``but the ball
got tipped at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Tipped by cornerback Ty Law to linebacker Chris Slade. Then the
Patriots won on Adam Vinatieri's 23-yard field goal with 3 seconds
remaining. By then Testaverde, and Chrebet were in an ambulance on
the way to the hospital, and Johnson's left knee was being fitted
for a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyor Milloy, the Patriots' strong safety, understood how the
Jets' offense had been decimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artificial turf was new and stiff,'' Milloy would say
later. ``I changed shoes after our first defensive series. I
recognized the feeling I had in college at the University of
Washington when I broke two bones in my foot on artificial turf.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Giants play the Washington Redskins next Sunday at
Giants Stadium, who will be the artificial turf's next victim? &QL;

CLINTON SAYS U.S. TROOPS WILL HAVE LIMITED ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
 
(UPDATES grafs 3-4 with Clinton saying there would be an American
presence on the ground in East Timor, but no ground troops; DELETES
6th graf with original quote from Clinton; ADDS 8 grafs at end with
details on East Timor talks.) (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ President Clinton said Monday that
American troops would have a ``limited but important function'' in
the peacekeeping force that Indonesia is reluctantly permitting
into East Timor, although Asian officials insisted the United
States will inevitably be drawn into a central role if troops are
to be inserted quickly enough to bring a halt to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at his hotel here Monday morning, Clinton
described an array of tasks for American forces, from airlifting
troops from several nations into East Timor to supplying them with
intelligence capabilities and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that would require some presence on the ground in East
Timor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that the United States did not anticipate
providing ground troops. ``The Australians are willing to take the
lion's share of the role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that many of the forces had not trained together
as NATO forces did before their insertion in Kosovo earlier this
year, Clinton added: ``We might be asked to provide some command
and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, a small team of American military officials from
the Pacific Command in Hawaii have been in Australia to develop a
plan for moving the peacekeepers into place, perhaps beginning as
early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that they believe the U.S. participation
can be held to about 600 troops, though Australian officials and
Asian diplomats who have been briefed on the plans say they expect
the figure to be much higher. ``The assets offered by the Americans
are very pleasing to the Australian defense community,'' John
Howard, the Australian prime minister, said here, where he has
frequently been meeting Clinton on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   The back-room negotiations over the composition and timing of an
East Timor peacekeeping force dominated much of the first day and a
half of a summit meeting that is supposed to focus on restarting a
series of trade and economic initiatives in the wake of the
recovery from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was clearly far more engaged on a host of security
issues. On Sunday he held an unusual trilateral meeting with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea, jointly committing to penalizing North Korea if it conducts
a long-threatened missile launch, and dangling a resumption of aid
and economic cooperation if it publicly declares it is freezing
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met for the first time with the new Russian prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, and in an unusually direct acknowledgment
of Russian corruption that the White House has often downplayed in
the past, the president told him that corruption could ``eat the
heart out of Russian society.'' Critics of the administration's
Russia policy say those warnings should have been delivered far
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But East Timor has dominated much of the conversation among the
leaders of 21 ``economies'' represented here _ the phrase is used
to allow the participation of Taiwan and Hong Kong _ and Clinton
was awakened at 1 a.m. Monday morning to be told that Indonesia's
president, B.J. Habibie, had finally agreed to allow in the
peacekeeping force he had resisted for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Monday morning praised several nations that had
pressured Jakarta to change its mind. He added, ``It's important to
get the details worked out and get the force in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from his list was America's closest ally in
the Pacific, Japan, which is Indonesia's largest supplier of
foreign aid. Tokyo had declined to join Clinton in threatening a
cut off of aid and other economic ties if Indonesia failed to stop
the violence or let in the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held open the possibility of lifting the sanctions
threats as soon as Habibie carried through on the commitments he
made Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' he said, ``we can resume our work with the
people of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials and diplomats say they expect the force to
reach about 7,000 personnel, though it could take weeks to reach
that level. About 4,500 would likely come from Australia, with New
Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Sweden,
France, Britain and Portugal all supplying far more modest numbers
of troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would provide the aircraft and ships to
transport armored vehicles and other equipment to East Timor, and
Clinton suggested Monday morning that process could start within
days.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, congressional leaders expressed support as long
as the commitment remained limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously what's been happening there is shocking and
appalling,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader
from Mississippi. Speaking on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' he endorsed
American logistical help but said ``if it involved troops on the
ground, I think then a lot more questions are going to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists were concerned about the response from
the militias responsible for the death and destruction. ``This is
the period of maximum danger,`` said Sydney Jones, executive
director of Asia for Human Rights Watch. ``A lot depends on how
soon troops can get there. The U.N. and other world leaders have to
make clear that they are going to hold Indonesia responsible for
any further terror that takes place.''

   MICROSOFT AND U.S. REFINE ARGUMENTS IN ANTITRUST CASE
</P>
<P>
   In court filings on Friday, Microsoft and the government made
their last written submissions of evidence before final oral
arguments in the software giant's federal antitrust case begin on
Sept. 21. The documents gave each side a chance to refine its own
points while taking jabs at the arguments offered by the other.
</P>
<P>
   But more revealing may be a series of e-mail messages that the
government subpoenaed from Microsoft. Those discussions involved
the public-relations campaign that the company devised when
Netscape, cast as a victim of Microsoft's monopoly, was being
acquired by America Online. The spin was that the purchase of
Netscape rendered the government's antitrust suit irrelevant.

   BARNES &AMP; NOBLE TO DROP TIMES LIST

   While online booksellers wage a fierce price war over New York
Times best sellers, Barnes &AMP; Noble is preparing to phase out its
use of the newspaper's weekly list at its superstores. In place of
the Times list of books, for which Barnes &AMP; Noble typically offers

   PROMISED REVOLUTION SLOW IN COMING
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, Mercata and Accompany, promised to revolutionize
e-commerce by attracting groups of buyers interested in a certain
product and extracting wholesale prices from manufacturers and
distributors. Several months later, neither site has attracted
large numbers of users. But more manufacturers are showing
interest, and the number of buyers seems to be increasing. And with
more marketing money on the way, analysts say, the companies could
start realizing their goals.

   $299 PC IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Richard Latman's Microworkz announced that it
was selling a personal computer, the Webzter Jr., for $299,
including a year of Internet service and bundled software. Many
analysts and competitors said the Microworkz offer sounded too good
to be true. And in hindsight, it was. Since announcing the Webzter
Jr., the company has been accused of bad management, shabby service
and failure to deliver machines that had been paid for. Microworkz
eventually killed the Webzter Jr., and Latman announced last month
that he was stepping down as president.

HO-HUM ABOUT A SO-SO GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ No one looked very upset, really, as the Cal State
Northridge football players made their way to the team buses that
took them away from one of the school's worst losses.
</P>
<P>
   Not a great sign, considering this program was on the ropes this
summer and the only way to drum up support in the San Fernando
Valley is by either: (a) winning the games the Matadors are
supposed to win, or (b) not getting embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happened Saturday night as CSUN took a 71-14
beating at the hands of host Kansas. Sure, the Jayhawks are a
Division I program and a member of the Big 12 Conference, one of
the strongest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But KU has been PU for most of its history, and if CSUN can't
score more than two touchdowns against a defense more fit to stop a
wishbone offense than the run-and-shoot, there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   If the Matadors' skill-position defenders, who pride themselves
on their speed and coverage ability, get burned repeatedly by
Kansas receivers who don't have much experience, that's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   What's worse is CSUN's apparent willingness to accept the
56-point loss. Where was the anger?
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Jaumal Bradley, who represents CSUN's soul,
called the game ``a learning experience.'' Defensive lineman
Shawnbay Jones, another senior, said the Matadors ``now know what
it takes'' to compete against teams of a higher caliber, and
``physically, it was harder than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but 71-14?
</P>
<P>
   Kansas suited up 30 more players than Division I-AA CSUN; the
Jayhawks had better depth. But those aren't a bunch of former high
school All-Americans on the Kansas roster.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN appeared to give more effort in making excuses after giving
up the most points in a single game in school history.
</P>
<P>
   One player said the officials, who are from the Big 12, made ``a
few bad calls.'' But the Jayhawks committed 14 penalties, almost
twice as many as the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady, who didn't play particularly
well in his first game on regional TV, said: ``We beat ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady was at least warming to the idea that even though the
Matadors had nothing to lose, playing the patsy to Kansas in the
Jayhawks' home opener, CSUN didn't play well.
</P>
<P>
   One college football publication picked the Matadors to finish
second in the Big Sky Conference, and the coaches and players have
basically shrugged off the conference's coaches' poll that picked
CSUN to finish next-to-last.
</P>
<P>
   But the players, especially those who have two or more years of
eligibility, must realize that a loss such as Saturday's doesn't
help when students are deciding whether to vote yes in October for
a proposed fee referendum that would raise money to build a new
football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys out there,'' Bradley said, referring to the
Jayhawks after the game, ``know that we didn't roll over.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Matadors didn't quit. But they didn't play the way they
are capable of playing, and they know that. They needed to show it
a little more. &QL;

With 203 yards in two games, Jaumal Bradley is on pace to pass his
1998 rushing total in CSUN's next game. Bradley had runs of 28, 27,
18 and 17 yards Saturday and his game total of 109 is a
career-best. Rest of the team had 9 yards. &QL; 
Grade: B &QL; 
RECEIVERS  &QL; 
Preseason All-American Aaron Arnold had a reception on CSUN's first
offensive play and then disappeared; he had only three the rest of
the game. There were a few dropped passes. Drew Amerson (6 catches,
113 yards, 1 TD) is developing as a complement to Arnold. &QL; 
Grade: C &QL; 
OFFENSIVE LINE  &QL; 
Matched Kansas' defensive line in size but allowed Jayhawks to
streak inside and knock down two passes. Brady was only sacked
twice and he had decent protection most of the time. Opened good
holes for Bradley. &QL; 
Grade: B &QL; 
DEFENSIVE LINE  &QL; 
Put pressure on Kansas QBs but didn't have a sack. Blown off the
line by Jayhawks' offensive line; KU had 353 yards and five TDs on
the ground, and junior David Winbush, honorable mention All-Big 12
last year, had 134 yards. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
LINEBACKERS  &QL; 
Highlight: Jack Heaslet, an undersized (5-10, 218) senior who had
six tackles, including one that was unassisted in the open field.
Lowlight: Cos Abercrombie, who had 17 tackles in first two games
last year, had only two against KU. &QL; 
Grade: C &QL; 
DEFENSIVE BACKS  &QL; 
Yes, this unit is missing two starters, but the Jayhawks looked
like Florida Saturday, completing 19 of 25 passes, three for TDs.
No INTs and too many missed tackles. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
SPECIAL TEAMS  &QL; 
Great start on Terrence Jones' 32-yard return of Kansas' first
kickoff. Nightmarish after that. A penalty wiped out excellent fake
punt. Gave up an average of 32{ yards on punt returns and kickoffs.
KU had a 72-yard punt return for a touchdown. &QL; 
Grade: D &QL; 
COACHING  &QL; 
Kearin accepts blame for 56-point loss, second-worst in school
history. Players were prepared for Jayhawks, who were simply better
in all phases. But for the second game in a row, CSUN came out
listless and committed too many penalties. &QL; 
Grade: C &QL;

MEXICO'S RIGHT NOMINATES PRAGMATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT 
 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Vicente Fox Quesada, the lanky former Coca-Cola
executive known for his high-shine cowboy boots and down-home
style, was chosen Sunday as the National Action Party's
presidential candidate in a nationwide primary. The outcome makes
him the man for the governing party to beat in the election next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's nomination in the vote within the party _ the pro-business
opposition group known as the PAN _ was a foregone conclusion,
since he was the only candidate. But the balloting by registered
members of the party was still a novelty, because for decades it
picked its presidential nominees in closed conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 56, broke the mold of Mexican politics by starting his
presidential run in 1997, three years before the election and long
before any other politicians had begun to focus on the race.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show that he is the most popular challenger to the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has not
lost a presidential election since its founding 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A national poll on Aug. 30 by the newspaper Reforma showed Fox
tied at 39 percent with Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the choice of
most PRI leaders, including President Ernesto Zedillo. In a matchup
against another PRI politician who has surged in public opinion,
Roberto Madrazo Pintado, the poll showed Fox trailing by one point,
with 38 percent to Madrazo's 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fox's solid appeal among voters who dislike the
governing party, up to now he has been forced to mount an
outsider's campaign, with little enthusiastic support from the
best-known leaders of his party and critical cash shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, while the PRI dominated news coverage
by holding the first televised debate ever among the men who hope
to be its candidate, Fox's campaign disappeared from the media. PAN
officials said he had run out of money. To dramatize his
predicament, Fox created a ruckus at the sober congressional
session on Sept. 1, when Zedillo made his annual state of the union
address.
</P>
<P>
   First a jovial Fox marched out onto the floor of the Congress,
shaking hands and clapping backs of other PAN members, breaking
protocol rules that restrict the floor to elected lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked out halfway through Zedillo's speech, saying he
had ``more important things to do'' and telling reporters that his
antic was the only way he could think of to get on television.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Fox's campaign said they hoped that after his
official nomination Sunday, party leaders would rally round him,
eliminating doubts among PAN supporters about his legitimacy and
opening the spigots of contributions from the business community.
</P>
<P>
   Fox comes from a pragmatic wing of the party and has avoided its
traditional Catholic, conservative fundamentalism. He says he will
adopt free-market policies to create jobs and shape public
education to train Mexicans for the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   He steers clear of issues like opposition to abortion, a deeply
held conviction among many party members that is not popular with a
majority of Mexican women.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox has shown that he knows how to harness the power of
television, which in this campaign may be a decisive factor for the
first time. At a rally in his home state of Guanajuato on Friday,
his two children sent him off by handing him a huge satin banner
showing the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's much-revered patroness.
The television cameras lapped it up.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo's government fired back with a statement saying Fox was
breaking laws establishing the separation of church and state.

DISAPPOINTED DEMOCRATS OFFER CHANCE FOR BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Mo., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are a lot of things in Bill Bradley's
biography that Joan Lydic likes, from his Rhodes Scholarship to his
Hall of Fame career with the New York Knicks to his three terms as
a senator from New Jersey. And oh yeah, he is a down-to-earth guy.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Lydic, 55, a family therapist from St. Louis who
attended a rally last week for Bradley in Keokuk, Iowa, has another
reason for supporting him over Vice President Gore, his sole rival
for the Democratic presidential nomination: He was never part of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm uncomfortable, being a mother, with what went on there,''
Mrs. Lydic said. ``It sickened me. I know Al Gore is different. But
if Al Gore were principled, he should have wanted to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lydic and other disenchanted Democrats represent both the
central opportunity and the major challenge for Bradley as he gears
up his insurgent rivalry with Gore, the party's presumptive
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in a campaign swing through Missouri and Iowa last
week, it was clear that many of Bradley's supporters are fueled, at
least in part, by a deep disillusionment with Clinton _ and, by
extension, with Gore. And while few blamed Gore for the
administration's ethical problems, many said they believed the vice
president had been badly tarnished by his close association with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Bradley, from a moral point of view,'' said Merel
Young, 68, a retired teacher from Keokuk. ``I think that makes him
more electable than Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   But building a base among anti-Clinton Democrats is not likely
to be enough for Bradley to wrest the nomination from Gore, whose
support in the Democratic establishment runs deep. To win, Bradley
would have to assemble a broader coalition that picked off Gore's
supporters on the party's right and left, analysts say. And while
the election is still a long way away, Bradley will have to hustle
to widen his appeal by the early primaries this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, two-thirds of Bradley's appeal is soft,'' said Fred
Siegel, a professor of history at the Cooper Union for the
Advancement of Science and Art in New York. ``People like him
because he's an adult, he seems like a fully formed human being
with a backbone, who is not going to be tossed by the winds. And
he's not caught up in the Clinton scandals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To vault to the next level, he has to go further,'' Siegel
added. ``He has to lay out specifics for what a Bradley presidency
would look like.''
</P>
<P>
   So far Bradley has been unwilling to do that, avoiding major
policy pronouncements on the issues he says will define the coming
election: the economy, health care, race relations and foreign
policy. Those will come in the fall, when voters are more focused
on the race, his campaign says.
</P>
<P>
   But in his recent speeches, Bradley has provided clear
indications of how he plans to establish himself as the anti-Gore
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of every speech is a liberal critique of the
Clinton administration's economic policies: that the nation's
roaring prosperity has not trickled down to struggling
working-class and poor Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult argument to make, because the strong economy
is probably Gore's greatest political asset. But with a New
Deal-like pitch to traditional liberalism, Bradley evokes the
spirit of his father, a small-town banker, who he says refused to
foreclose on a single home during the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stock market is skyrocketing and family farms are going
bankrupt,'' Bradley told 18 people at a diner in Newton, Iowa,
``you shouldn't feel good about where the economy is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has also placed race relations front and center in his
campaign, saying, ``The only thing deserving of hate is hate
itself.'' Polls indicate that blacks _ who represent 30 percent or
more of the Democratic primary vote in some Southern states _
remain loyal to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of Bradley's desire to grab black votes from
Gore's left, he appeared before a Harlem organization run by the
Rev. Al Sharpton last month _ even though his visit angered
centrist white voters and Jews who view Sharpton as divisive.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley is doing more than trying to outflank Gore in the
party's liberal wing. He is a staunch advocate of sweeping gun
restrictions and changes to the campaign-finance system. Both are
issues of concern not just for liberals but also for middle-class
reformers and centrist suburban voters.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have extensive proposals on both issues, but
Bradley's go significantly further. He has called for the licensing
of all gun owners, registration of all guns and a ban on so-called
Saturday night special handguns, as well as for public financing of
congressional campaigns and free television time for candidates.
</P>
<P>
   To broaden the appeal of his economic message beyond the very
poor, Bradley advocates making it easier for workers to form
unions, expanding access to health care and bolstering pensions.
</P>
<P>
   And for independent voters, Bradley offers a populist,
Perot-like critique of Clinton and Gore's leadership styles,
asserting that politics today is ``obsessed with the mechanics of
winning, which is polling, fund raising and spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by focusing on the importance of character and virtue
in politics, Bradley seems to be directly addressing the
small-town, moderate Democrats who tend to vote in the Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary, where he must perform well next
year to survive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It helps Bradley that most of this does not seem forced. He can
fairly claim that he has been concerned about race relations since
he was a boy and that the civil rights movement inspired him to
enter politics.
</P>
<P>
   And he was talking about the importance of character in politics
long before Monica Lewinsky became a household name.
</P>
<P>
   He also seems to benefit from his unhurried, easy manner. In
Keokuk he shook hands and signed basketballs until the last
supporter had drifted off, leaving him alone in the fading
afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of a good old country doctor,'' Katie Wood, 48,
of Hannibal, Mo., said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley can be maddeningly short on specifics, and even some
supporters say his gauzy appeals to human goodness may begin to
lose voters if they do not soon include hard details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the campaign just two weeks, and people are
already asking me where he stands on things,'' said Nancy Parrott,
a Bradley organizer in southeastern Iowa. ``Right now, we are just
giving them resumes.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bradley often dodges questions on broad policy matters, he
can be quite specific on issues that concern Iowa voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottumwa, he told farmers that he supported Justice Department
oversight of agricultural mergers that threaten small farmers. In
Des Moines, he told peace activists that he opposed sending U.S.
troops to East Timor. And in Grinnell, he told college students
that although he opposed legalizing gay marriages, he supported
giving homosexual partners legal rights and protections comparable
to those of married couples.
</P>
<P>
   By nature cautious and methodical, Bradley admits to fearing
that candor will cause him problems as the campaign heats up.
</P>
<P>
   When a woman in Newton asked him about his position on public
financing of private schools, Bradley acknowledged that he had
voted for a pilot voucher program while in the Senate, a position
strongly opposed by the powerful teachers unions. But he added that
he did not consider vouchers ``the answer to the problems of public
education.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried to be as candid with you as possible,'' Bradley
told the woman. ``That leads to the maximum possibility of
distortion.''

CLEMENS AND YANKEES LOSING THEIR GRIP AS RED SOX SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens had a baseball and the evolving pennant
race resting in his sweaty fingers Sunday. What Clemens could
accomplish with that ball in those fingers would help determine
whether this surprising tussle with the Boston Red Sox would become
even more serious for the Yankees and more serious than anyone ever
dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched commendably for most of the afternoon, but he
sputtered in a critical juncture in the eighth inning, and that was
enough to doom the Yankees in a disheartening 4-1 loss at Yankee
Stadium. Forget serious. Suddenly, this skirmish with the calm Red
Sox has become extremely serious for the nervous Yankees after they
were swept during this three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks the Yankees' once-cozy bulge of eight and
one-half games in the American League East has shrunk to three and
one-half with 20 games to play, and so many players were vowing not
to panic that it seemed as if they were panicking. Jeff Nelson even
mentioned how the Yankees have the wild-card spot as their security
blanket. That is true, but it is a revealing statement from the
defending World Series champions, who have not seen the Red Sox
this close to them since July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston's resiliency should serve as a very loud wake-up call
for us,'' said David Cone, whose face was flushed and whose voice
was loud enough for teammates to hear him. ``Whether we needed it
or not, we certainly got one this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious. From Joe Torre asking reporters to stop
comparing the stumbling 1999 Yankees to the memorable 1998 Yankees
to Derek Jeter saying he was shocked that the Red Sox had swept the
Yankees in the Bronx for the first time since June 1986 to Clemens
curiously claiming that Sunday's start was no more pivotal than any
others, it was a stunned and confused clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, winning all those games, I still wasn't confident
until the champagne popped,'' Torre said. ``This game has taught
you that anything can happen. History shows that.''
</P>
<P>
   History will show that Clemens, who was feisty enough to shout
at Jose Offerman after a strikeout and who surrendered only two
hits in seven innings, allowed three more hits on his first six
pitches in the eighth to enable the Red Sox to snatch a 2-1 lead.
Trot Nixon ripped a liner that forced Clemens to duck, and Offerman
slashed a hit-and-run single past third baseman Scott Brosius, who
had crept in about 25 feet anticipating a bunt and missed snaring
the ball by inches.
</P>
<P>
   With runners on first and third, no outs and the score tied, the
Yankees needed Clemens to be overpowering and record a strikeout or
a pop out. Clemens got the pop fly as Darren Lewis hit a bloop to
shallow center field, but Bernie Williams got a late jump on the
ball and it dropped a few feet in front of him after he rushed
forward. A 200-foot single began Williams's inning of adventures,
conquered Clemens and gave the Red Sox a lead they never
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   After Clemens walked Reggie Jefferson to load the bases, Torre
replaced him with Nelson. Nomar Garciaparra followed with a
sacrifice fly to center to deliver the third run and O'Leary's
bloop single in front of Williams off Mike Stanton made the score
4-1. The Red Sox were celebrating at the Stadium again while
Clemens bolted to the exercise room after losing for the fifth time
in his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held us down and got it done,'' said Clemens, whose
fastball had reached 96 mph. ``They had some bloop singles, but
sometimes you need those in close ball games to get you through.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, it is the Red Sox who are more likely to collapse in
September. Normally, it is the Yankees who are more apt to play
like they own the stadium. But those roles were not fulfilled on
this lost weekend in which Boston excelled and made the Yankees
sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Bret Saberhagen was so relaxed starting his first game
in 26 days that he told a clubhouse attendant: ``It'll be a fast
game today. I promise.'' Saberhagen was serious. Other than Chuck
Knoblauch's seventh leadoff homer of the season, Saberhagen did not
allow a run over five innings, and four relievers stifled the
Yankees on two hits over the last four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had first and second and no outs in the sixth, but
Paul O'Neill slapped into a double play and Williams struck out.
Chili Davis actually swung at a 3-0 pitch while leading off the
seventh with the score still 1-1 and grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were listless while the Red Sox were aggressive and
rammed into catcher Joe Girardi on two plays at the plate (they
scored once).
</P>
<P>
   ``Why panic?'' Torre said. ``It doesn't do any good. If you
panic, nothing good can happen, other than scaring other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Yankees need to be scared. They have lost five of
their last six games and eight of 12. The Yankees started the
weekend needing one measly victory to remain relatively relaxed,
and they ended it with Clemens losing to his old team and with his
new team losing its secure grip on first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in firm control of the division and now we're not,''
Cone said. ``We still have a four-game lead in the loss column, but
we're a lot worse off than we were three days ago.''

HABIBIE INVITES U.N. PEACEKEEPERS TO EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Inserts new graf that begins ``President Clinton ...''
Deletes graf that began ``U.S. national security ...'')  (lb) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Conceding that Indonesian forces had been
unable to control the continuing violence in East Timor, President
B.J. Habibie on Sunday capitulated to international pressure and
invited the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to the
troubled territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have lost their lives since the beginning of
the unrest, lost their homes and security,'' he said in a televised
address. ``We cannot wait any longer. We have to stop the suffering
and mourning immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an international force would have to work hand in hand
with Indonesian troops, who appear divided over whether to enforce
or undermine their government's policy of allowing East Timor to
choose independence.
</P>
<P>
   The president's statement is potentially risky for him, and may
ruin his chances of hanging onto his office once a long electoral
process concludes in November. But his statement drew praise _ and
some caution until the details are known _ from international
leaders, who have expressed horror at the campaign of terror and
killings since the former Portuguese colony voted on Aug. 30 to
separate from Indonesia, which invaded it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great step forward for the people of East Timor,
because it's their welfare, their future, their safety, their
freedom that this will be all about,'' said Prime Minister John
Howard of Australia, who has been one of the foreign leaders most
insistent on intervention.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking to reporters in New Zealand, where
he is attending a meeting of Asian-Pacific countries, said the U.S.
contribution would be ``limited but important,'' like providing
intelligence and communications. ``All of that would require some
presence on the ground in East Timor,'' he said. ``But no one has
asked us for any combat troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister John Moore of Australia, which is spearheading
a potential force, said it might take three to five days to deploy
once the United Nations and Indonesia worked out details of its
mission and organization.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie said Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was flying to New York
to discuss these details with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   If the Indonesian military fully supports the foreign presence,
Moore said, a force of about 7,000 foreign troops would be
adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand have all said
they are ready to take part.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement was greeted with ``absolute jubilation''
among the 1,000 refugees who have camped inside the besieged U.N.
compound in Dili, the East Timorese capital, said a British
journalist, Marie Colvin, who is there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see it as their salvation,'' she said. ``Nobody can stop
smiling. They feel like they were under a death sentence for 10
days and that they are now going to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement on Sunday was a humiliating reversal of
Indonesia's long-time insistence that as a sovereign nation it
would not accept a foreign military presence.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie is running for re-election in a parliamentary vote in
November but is coming under harsh attack here for allowing the
potential loss of what Indonesians consider their 27th province _
although the world has never recognized its 1975 invasion and
annexation of a territory abandoned by its colonial Portuguese
rulers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Habibie's ability to enforce his policies or
command his military are reinforcing a widespread perception that
he is an ineffectual leader. The introduction of foreign troops
onto Indonesian soil is certain to intensify the nationalist
backlash that has already begun here. Many in the military see this
as the most humiliating moment in their history.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie made his announcement Sunday in both Indonesian and
English. The Indonesian version of his remarks included language
that seemed intended to soften the blow to national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided to invite the international peacekeeping force
in order to assist us _ together with the Indonesian military, in a
cooperative manner _ to restore security to the troubled
province,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unchecked violence in East Timor has also raised questions
about insubordination in the military and about the ability of the
armed forces chief, Gen. Wiranto, to enforce the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   The president's announcement came one day after Wiranto visited
East Timor and implied that he had lost control of some of his
troops there who he said are emotionally committed to retaining
East Timor, where they have fought against separatist guerrillas
for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   A military policy of arming local militias to try to influence
or derail the vote through intimidation may have taken on a life of
its own. The introduction last week of five new battalions of
Indonesian troops and a declaration of martial law in the territory
seemed to have little effect in calming the violence, although Dili
was quiet when a top U.N. delegation visited on Saturday. That
suggested to some of the visitors that the military had the power
to turn the violence off and on at will.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie alluded to the military's situation in East Timor when
he said: ``The Indonesian defense forces tried to stabilize the
situation in East Timor since the declaration of martial law on
September 7. At the same time, they had to recognize that there are
limits to what more they would achieve. They have done their utmost
in a very complex and complicated situation under very difficult
psychological constraints.''

   Reports continued to emerge on Sunday of a brutal campaign of
killings, arson and forced relocation of thousands of people by the
militias in East Timor, a remote territory that had a population of
800,000 before the current violence began.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the killings seemed to be aimed at eliminating the
territory's educated class and its social leaders. Priests and nuns
in this largely Roman Catholic territory have become targets. So
have students and other young men, according to refugees and aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign monitoring group said that on Thursday, militia
members aboard the ferry Dobon Solo that was traveling from Dili
systematically searched out, killed and dumped into the sea 35
young men, most of them students, who were aboard. It said the
report came from a young man who hid in a box and survived.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups and human rights workers said the greatest emerging
danger to the people of East Timor was now starvation, which was
also the chief cause of the death of some 200,000 people during
Indonesia's years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people have fled into East Timor's barren
mountains. One of the main tasks of an international force would be
to secure supply lines to feed and save these refugees, who remain
under threat _ and periodic attack _ from the militias.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie spoke on Sunday after holding emergency meetings with
military commanders and his Cabinet and informing Annan by
telephone of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under a transition process envisioned in the U.N. plan _ agreed
to by Indonesia and Portugal in May _ the United Nations would take
over administration and security in East Timor once the Indonesian
Parliament ratifies its independence at a session later this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's announcement accelerates the plan for the deployment of
U.N. security forces and appears to amount to a de facto
recognition of the vote for independence _ an unambiguous result of
78.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Though East Timor is different from the rest of the country in
having a Portuguese, rather than Dutch, colonial background and in
having been annexed 30 years after Indonesia became an independent
nation, the possibility of its separation is a direct blow to
Indonesia's still tenuous sense of nationhood. It increases
concerns about separatist movements in other provinces,
particularly Aceh and Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's Indonesian-language text repeatedly addressed these
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that he was not acting unilaterally but was
consulting other branches of government; he portrayed his policy in
East Timor as part of his effort to bring greater democracy,
legality and stability to Indonesia and he voiced confidence in the
military.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that the military has undertaken its best
efforts to resolve an extremely difficult and complicated situation
without abandoning its responsibility for the unity and security of
the whole country,'' he said.

BUCHANAN LOOKING AT LAUNCHING REFORM PARTY BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS graf at end with list of other possible Reform Party
candidates) (rk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lagging badly in his quest for the Republican
presidential nomination, Patrick Buchanan said Sunday that he was
strongly leaning toward switching to a run for the Reform Party
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door really is wide open,'' said Buchanan, a proven
electoral spoiler. ``We are very close to making that decision,''
he said on NBC-TV complaining that the Republican contest was
``closed and rigged'' with the big-money candidacies of Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas and Steve Forbes, the self-financed millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   The initial reaction from Reform Party officials was mixed but
far from forbidding at the possibility of Buchanan creating a
three-way contest of the presidential campaign. His presence on a
Reform ballot might be expected to drain conservative support from
Bush, the front-runner for the Republican nomination whose early
dominance has left Buchanan and the rest of the GOP field
struggling for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he starts meeting people in the party, I think people
will be willing to go and work their hearts out for him,'' said Pat
Choate, who was the vice presidential nominee of the Reform Party
in 1996 and remains a popular figure in the party. He said that he
had talked with Bay Buchanan, Buchanan's sister and chief
strategist, nearly every day for the last six weeks, and that he
believed Buchanan would announce his defection within the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota, the party's biggest success
story, has been wary of Buchanan as a ``retread'' and prefers to
press the search for a more centrist presidential candidate. ``He
has social issues that he puts very strongly on the front burner,
and we in the Reform Party tend to leave social issues aside,''
Ventura said last summer in trying to discourage speculation of a
Buchanan crossover.
</P>
<P>
   Dean M. Barkley, who was chairman of Ventura's campaign and
remains a close adviser, said Sunday in an interview that
Buchanan's stances on abortion and other social issues would pose
``a huge hurdle for Buchanan to sell himself to the Reform Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barkley conceded Buchanan's proven popularity could make him
a serious contender for the nomination next year under the party's
complex open petition system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a huge recruiting battle between those who
support Buchanan and those who hopefully will unite behind a
centrist candidate,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he would decide on a possible Reform bid by
mid-October. ``We're leaning in that direction right now _
strongly,'' he said on ``Meet the Press,'' emphasizing that he
would like to speak with Ventura and with Ross Perot, the
millionaire who created the Reform Party as his 1992 presidential
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we have is a one-party system in Washington,
D.C., that is masquerading as a two-party system, and I think what
we need is a real opposition party,'' he said, describing the GOP
as a ``Xerox copy'' of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had no immediate reaction to Buchanan's threat to defect.
The Bush campaign office noted that Bush previously had expressed
his hope to Buchanan directly that he stay in the party as a proven
conservative leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan, a tireless, fiery campaigner who won the 1996 New
Hampshire Republican primary, clearly was using his appearance on
national television Sunday to try to reclaim some of the political
spotlight that lately has been scarce in his campaign rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time maybe to take a bye in the regionals and go straight
to the finals,'' said Buchanan, using a sports allusion in his
threat to drop from the GOP primary route and focus instead on the
Reform nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Russell J. Verney, the Reform Party chairman and a longtime aide
to Perot, said Bay Buchanan called him within the past two weeks
and sought a detailed briefing about the requirements for seeking
the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform rules require a prospective nominee to make a
good-faith effort to qualify for the ballot in the 29 states, plus
the District of Columbia, where the party does not have an
automatic slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained the scope of the task, which I'm sure is an
eye-opener to anyone who hasn't been through it,'' Verney said.
``It ranges from states where just a fee or a few hundred
signatures are required, to states where you have to get 30,000 or
40,000 signatures within very strict time limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that on July 1, party officials would determine
which candidates had made a sufficient effort to be placed on the
ballot for the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in late July, ballots are to be sent to people who
signed a petition, or are on the rosters of state Reform Party
organizations, or request one. Voting will be by telephone, mail or
Internet. The result will be announced at the Reform Party
convention next August in Long Beach, Calif. Delegates can overturn
the result with a two-thirds vote, but Verney said that was simply
a safety valve in case only a fringe candidate qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Perot had not changed his position that he would
support whoever is nominated by the party. ``He's made no
indication that he has any interest in it,'' Verney said. On Jan.
1, Verney is to be succeeded as chairman by John J. Gargan of
Florida, who had been endorsed by Ventura of Minnesota and was
elected at the party's national convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   Other individuals who have been mentioned as possible Reform
Party candidates include Donald Trump, the flamboyant developer;
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the former independent governor of
Connecticut; Sen. Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, who is running
a third-party candidacy; and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a
Republican candidate who has expressed no interest.

CLINTON SAYS U.S. TROOPS WILL HAVE LIMITED ROLE IN EAST TIMOR 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ADDS graf 10-12 with U.S.-China talks) (rk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ President Clinton said Monday that
American troops would have a ``limited but important function'' in
the peacekeeping force that Indonesia is reluctantly permitting
into East Timor, although Asian officials insisted the United
States will inevitably be drawn into a central role if troops are
to be inserted quickly enough to bring a halt to the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at his hotel here Monday morning, Clinton
described an array of tasks for American forces, from airlifting
troops from several nations into East Timor to supplying them with
intelligence capabilities and communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that would require some presence on the ground in East
Timor,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that the United States did not anticipate
providing ground troops. ``The Australians are willing to take the
lion's share of the role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that many of the forces had not trained together
as NATO forces did before their insertion in Kosovo earlier this
year, Clinton added: ``We might be asked to provide some command
and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Friday, a small team of American military officials from
the Pacific Command in Hawaii have been in Australia to develop a
plan for moving the peacekeepers into place, perhaps beginning as
early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   American officials say that they believe the U.S. participation
can be held to about 600 troops, though Australian officials and
Asian diplomats who have been briefed on the plans say they expect
the figure to be much higher. ``The assets offered by the Americans
are very pleasing to the Australian defense community,'' John
Howard, the Australian prime minister, said here, where he has
frequently been meeting Clinton on the sidelines of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
</P>
<P>
   The back-room negotiations over the composition and timing of an
East Timor peacekeeping force dominated much of the first day and a
half of a summit meeting that is supposed to focus on restarting a
series of trade and economic initiatives in the wake of the
recovery from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was clearly far more engaged on a host of security
issues. On Sunday he held an unusual trilateral meeting with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan and President Kim Dae-jung of South
Korea, jointly committing to penalizing North Korea if it conducts
a long-threatened missile launch, and dangling a resumption of aid
and economic cooperation if it publicly declares it is freezing
such tests.
</P>
<P>
   And while Clinton's security officials were jousting this
morning with Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous nation,
his economic team was engaged in an increasingly complex
negotiation with the most populous nation _ China.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton and President Jiang Zemin agreed that both
countries had to plunge into an effort to get China into the World
Trade Organization in the next three months. But negotiations on
Sunday were fitful, although the Chinese had desperately wanted the
deal in April when Clinton walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning as the U.S. trade representative, Charlene
Barshefsky, re-entered meetings with her Chinese counterpart, it
looked increasingly unlikely that the major obstacles to the deal
could be resolved before Clinton and Jiang complete simultaneous
state visits to New Zealand on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met for the first time with the new Russian prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, and in an unusually direct acknowledgment
of Russian corruption that the White House has often downplayed in
the past, the president told him that corruption could ``eat the
heart out of Russian society.'' Critics of the administration's
Russia policy say those warnings should have been delivered far
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But East Timor has dominated much of the conversation among the
leaders of 21 ``economies'' represented here _ the phrase is used
to allow the participation of Taiwan and Hong Kong _ and Clinton
was awakened at 1 a.m. Monday morning to be told that Indonesia's
president, B.J. Habibie, had finally agreed to allow in the
peacekeeping force he had resisted for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Monday morning praised several nations that had
pressured Jakarta to change its mind. He added, ``It's important to
get the details worked out and get the force in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from his list was America's closest ally in
the Pacific, Japan, which is Indonesia's largest supplier of
foreign aid. Tokyo had declined to join Clinton in threatening a
cut off of aid and other economic ties if Indonesia failed to stop
the violence or let in the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held open the possibility of lifting the sanctions
threats as soon as Habibie carried through on the commitments he
made Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens,'' he said, ``we can resume our work with the
people of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials and diplomats say they expect the force to
reach about 7,000 personnel, though it could take weeks to reach
that level. About 4,500 would likely come from Australia, with New
Zealand, Canada, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Sweden,
France, Britain and Portugal all supplying far more modest numbers
of troops.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would provide the aircraft and ships to
transport armored vehicles and other equipment to East Timor, and
Clinton suggested Monday morning that process could start within
days.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, congressional leaders expressed support as long
as the commitment remained limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously what's been happening there is shocking and
appalling,'' said Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader
from Mississippi. Speaking on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' he endorsed
American logistical help but said ``if it involved troops on the
ground, I think then a lot more questions are going to be asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists were concerned about the response from
the militias responsible for the death and destruction. ``This is
the period of maximum danger,`` said Sydney Jones, executive
director of Asia for Human Rights Watch. ``A lot depends on how
soon troops can get there. The U.N. and other world leaders have to
make clear that they are going to hold Indonesia responsible for
any further terror that takes place.''

MCWAYIZENI KA DINIZULU, MAVERICK ZULU LEADER, IS DEAD AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mcwayizeni Ka Dinizulu, the most senior prince of the Zulu
people of South Africa, died on Tuesday, the South African
government has announced. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   Mcwayizeni was a controversial figure in Zulu life. In 1990, he
joined the African National Congress, which became South Africa's
governing party in 1994 when South Africans voted for their first
democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   But his backing for the ANC earned him the enmity of many of his
fellow Zulus, and several attempts to kill him were reported over
the years. Most Zulus are loyal to the Zulu nationalist Inkatha
Freedom Party, led by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, the prince was a bitter opponent of
Chief Buthelezi. And Inkatha and the ANC have a history of bloody
strife in what is now KwaZulu Natal province in eastern South
Africa, on the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the two parties' relations have improved, and the prince
was praised after his death by Deputy President Jacob Zuma, who
said the prince had played a key role in contributing to peace in
KwaZulu Natal.
</P>
<P>
   But after the new, democratic government was formed, Inkatha and
the Congress had some conflicting goals, as Leonard Thompson, a
historian of South Africa and retired Yale professor, wrote in the
1995 revised edition of his book, ``A History of South Africa''
(Yale University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Chief Buthelezi _ as president of Inkatha, which had become the
majority party in KwaZulu Natal, and as Minister of Home Affairs in
the new government _ ``contended for the maximum of devolution of
power to the provinces within the new South Africa,'' as Professor
Thompson put it, while the governing party ``showed that it was
determined to whittle away the powers of the provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   The prince was a close supporter of the Zulu monarch, King
Goodwill Zwelithini, who was his nephew. Shortly before the 1994
elections, the king, at the urging of church leaders who feared an
upsurge in interparty violence during the voting, urged ``each and
every Zulu'' _ partisans of both Inkatha and the ANC _ to put a
stop to violence.
</P>
<P>
   The prince acted as regent before the monarch's coronation in
1971, and it is said that he wielded great influence until the dawn
of the new political era in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed the role of senior adviser to the king and was
instrumental in the omission of Chief Buthelezi from a planned
group of royal advisers.
</P>
<P>
   After the watershed events of 1994, the prince was less of a
presence in the Zulus' public life. Chief Buthelezi is still his
party's leader and national Minister of Home Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   When the prince's death became known with the government's
announcement on Thursday, the Zulu royal family put off a
traditional, annual fete, known as the reed dance, which had been
planned for Saturday. During the celebration, girls give the
monarch reeds for use in his and his cattle's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The prince is survived by his wife, Thoko; seven children and
seven grandchildren.

OFF THE WALL: FEEL THE POWER FROM AFAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wanna know how a typical Los Angeles male aged 18 to 34 spent
the opening Sunday of the '99 NFL season?
</P>
<P>
   Read it and weep:
</P>
<P>
   ++ Crack of dawn: Watched NFL pregame shows from clubhouse TV at
local golf course, waiting for starter to call name. Name was never
called. Woulda shot 114 and walked off after nine holes anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Morning-ish: Watched more NFL pregame shows from gym TV while
straddling idle cybex. Tried to strike up conversation with
Jennifer Esposito-looking female on next machine. Discussion began
on nuances of instant replay. She challenged his explanation. Buff
guy on Stairmaster ruled in her favor. He not only lost a timeout
but was banished to Blinkie's Donut Emporium.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Brunchtime: Watched early NFL games from bar TV at the
Cheesecake Factory, an excuse to flip through the menu and check
out the ads. ``Loser, Party of 1'' was never called.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Early afternoon: Watched end of Dallas-Washington NFL game
from bank of TV monitors at local Good Guys store while sucking
down McFlurry. Screamed and pumped fist at Troy Aikman's overtime
TD pass. Got sour look from haggard clerk who was awakened in
small-appliances department. Left McFlurry cup to drip on stack of
overpriced toaster ovens.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Later afternoon: Watched 49ers-Jags on portable TV held by
guy at front of line of other applicants for job as key grip in new
Pamela Anderson movie. Asked person during interview if she's back
together with Tommy Lee Jones. Received a blank stare.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Kinda later afternoon: Tried to watch ``NFL Prime Time'' game
from home TV hooked up to illegal cable box left behind by previous
renter. Audio in Mandarin Chinese. Chris Berman finally
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Early evening: Watched Cleveland-Pittsburgh game on TV from
limo in Shrine Auditorium parking lot, waiting for clients to
return from Emmy Awards. Was supposed to pick up Camryn Manheim's
family but told by dispatcher to wait for a call to get Sarah
Jessica Parker's twin sister instead. Call never came. 'Cause twin
doesn't exist. Guys back at office had a great laugh. Took home one
of the guys who plays an anchor on ``Sports Night,'' but he knows
nothing about the day's games, let alone football.
</P>
<P>
   ++ Night: Watched NFL highlights on all local and cable news
shows. Again. And again. And again. And still couldn't figure out
why the Chargers' score never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   __ And what do we learn from this little dramatization?
</P>
<P>
   L.A. still loves the NFL. It fits in our day just fine. On TV.
We just aren't controlled by it.
</P>
<P>
   Public funding? Here, Tags, take these pennies, a 25-cents-off
coupon from Arby's and a crusty Tic-Tac out of our pockets as you
reconvene the owners today and bang that Wednesday-deadline drum
again.
</P>
<P>
   We hear it. We just won't jump.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, you have the problem.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bill Cosby has been mentioned as a possible sucker to buy
part of the Balti-less Ravens, which Art Modell is trying to dump
in part to pay off debt. Slimy owners do the darndest things. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Dem 'Boys in Dallas, at $663 million, are the most valuable
NFL franchise today according to a Forbes magazine list based on
revenue and operating income. Last year, they were only worth $413
mil. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The greatness of the Raiders? They're next to last at $299 mil.
Maybe discounted more on the way home from GBay. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ The Denver Post found out that the Broncs wanted to keep John
Elway on the active list so his $5 million salary would create
space under the cap for next season. But then he went and did those
Coors spots _ active NFL players aren't allowed to endorse alcohol
_ so the Broncos' hand was forced.
</P>
<P>
   Drink up. &QL;

RETURNEES WILL HELP BUT PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The worst loss of Bob Toledo's tenure came four
years ago on a crisp fall day in Ann Arbor, Mich., when Michigan
manhandled the Bruins 38-9. UCLA was confused and ineffective on
offense and helpless on defense as the Wolverines rushed for 300
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's 22-point loss at Ohio State, although decisive, was
not demoralizing or humiliating as was last year's loss at Miami.
The Bruins took a 10-0 lead and were within 21-17 throughout the
third quarter. They comported themselves as well as could be
expected without 11 suspended players and with 13 freshmen and
sophomores in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Their performance should improve when the suspensions end today.
Seven starters will return, including five on defense. Not all are
assured of regaining their starting jobs, but their presence in any
capacity will add experience and depth.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there are problems, and some have little to do
with the suspensions. For the Bruins to compete with USC and the
Arizona schools _ the Pac-10's early-season favorites _ they must
resolve the problems before a critical Oct. 2 date at Arizona
State.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback, of course, is the primary concern. While Cade
McNown reportedly obtained an improper parking permit, he's not
returning this week. Instead, the Bruins have two choices: Drew
Bennett and Cory Paus, and one week to decide. (Toledo plans to
pick a starter before the Pac-10 opener against Stanford on Sept.
25.)
</P>
<P>
   Paus, a freshman, probably will make more mistakes because of
unfamiliarity with the offense. But he has two years on Bennett, a
junior, and thus more potential. Given that UCLA's best days are
ahead, maybe Paus is the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges
believe Bennett's athleticism and experience are worth two or three
victories this year and possibly next, maybe he's the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Toledo and Borges will earn their pay.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterbacks' performance is directly related to the
offensive line, and the offensive line's performance is somewhat
related to the suspensions. Sure, having Oscar Cabrera at left
guard and Jim Ghezzi to relieve the tackles will help. But their
presence won't solve the rudimentary problems of communication and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Cabrera back, the Bruins will have two redshirt
freshmen (guard Mike Saffer and tackle Blake Worley) and a
sophomore (center Troy Danoff) in the lineup. They need game
experience and they also must get used to playing with Cabrera and
tackle Brian Polak.
</P>
<P>
   Is the line any better this season than it was in 1996, when
Andy Meyers, Shawn Stuart and Kris Farris replaced Jonathan Ogden,
Matt Soenksen and Mike Flanagan? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem is the defensive backfield. Cornerback Marques
Anderson has been suspended for the fall quarter, leaving starter
Ryan Roques and reserve Eric Whitfield as the only players
returning this week.
</P>
<P>
   Are they enough? Don't count on it. One cornerback, Joe Hunter,
is a redshirt freshman with decent potential. The other is a
senior, Jason Bell, who has moxie but little athleticism and a bad
heel.
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Stephens, Julius Williams and Audie Attar, strong
safety is such a mess that holder Joey Strycula has gone unnoticed
as the starting free safety. The best player in the group might be
freshman Ricky Manning, who graduated from high school a few months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And that pretty much says it all. &QL;

MOMCILO DJUJIC, SERBIAN PRIEST AND WARRIOR, DIES AT 92
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID BINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Momcilo Djujic, a Serbian warrior-priest who fought as a Chetnik
commander in epic World War II battles in Yugoslavia, died Saturday
at a hospice in San Diego. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Djujic, who lived in San Marcos, Calif., was in the view of some
Serbs the last great ``Vojvoda,'' the designation in Serbia for a
military commander distinguished by bravery, devotion to the
Orthodox Church and loyalty to the now-exiled monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Vojvoda'' was conferred on Djujic in June 1942,
by Gen. Dragoljub ``Draza'' Mihailovic, the commander of the
royalist Chetniks, after Djujic had already been fighting Nazi
Germans, Croatian Fascists and Communist Partisans for a year in
the mountains and valleys of his native region on the border
between Croatia and northwestern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   So fierce was the fighting in Yugoslavia in World War II that
Djujic, a tall, bearded commander in traditional black lambs wool
cap with a skull and crossbones insignia, never met Mihailovic
during the war because they were in different combat zones.
</P>
<P>
   They had begun fighting Axis forces almost simultaneously in the
months after Hitler's invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, an
invasion that unleashed brutal ethnic, religious and political
rivalries between the countries Serbs, Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks into the war, Croatian nationalist forces surrounded
the home of Djujic, a priest. He grabbed a rifle, escaped across
the mountains with his family and found refuge in the hills above
the Croatian coast. By July 1941 he had organized a Chetnik
uprising in northwestern Bosnia, seizing the city of Drvar from the
Ustashe, as the Croatian fascists were known. The revolt soon
spread to neighboring Croatia's coastal region, Dalmatia.
</P>
<P>
   How was it to strip off his priest's cassock and become a
warrior? ``That decision didn't come easily,'' he said in 1990,
``but the forests were full of refugees and I could see the Ustashe
in front of my nose in my parish. The people were crying, they
needed deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1942, Chetnik officers brought Djujic a radio
transmitter. He battled on, and for a short time boasted of holding
all of Dalmatia. A 1942 letter from Mihailovic praised and thanked
him for his ``gigantic efforts,'' recognized by the later award of
high royal decorations.
</P>
<P>
   His acts of wartime bravery included the rescue of six American
airmen shot down over Yugoslavia. But he also encountered charges
that he collaborated with Communists and the Ustashe on occasion _
both sworn enemies of the royalist Serbian Chetniks _ and in 1946
Tito's Communist government branded him a war criminal on charges
of being responsible for the death of 1,500 people during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Djujic said later, ``I never made a compromise, never an
agreement, either with the Communists or the Ustashe.''
</P>
<P>
   Djujic was born Feb. 27, 1907 in the village of Kovacic, in the
region known as Tromedja, or junction, where Croatia meets
northwestern Bosnia and their mixed populations of Serbs and Croats
converged.
</P>
<P>
   He attended high school in the Croatian coastal city of Sibenik
but at 22 went to the Orthodox theological seminary in Sremski
Karlovci, graduating in 1931. Consecrated a priest, he was assigned
to a parish near his birthplace. There his passionate sermons soon
won him the the nickname, Pop Vatra _ ``Father Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Djujic's first and only encounter with Mihailovic came when the
body of King Alexsander, who was assassinated in Marseilles in
1934, passed through the priest's native region. Djujic was chosen
to stand by the coffin as the funeral train proceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating future ethnic conflict, Djujic met after the king's
death with a Serbian paramilitary leader and the president of the
Chetnik movement, Kosta Pecanac. With their assistance, even before
war erupted, he organized and began to arm 11 Chetnik bands in his
region. ``I knew that the country would not survive,'' he said
later, ``because nobody can put Serbs and Croats in the same bag.''
</P>
<P>
   His toughest moment in battle, he said, was on Dec. 3, 1944,
battling Communist Partisans in Dalmatia. His men were outnumbered
five to one. Losses were heavy on both sides. ``It was also a big
victory,'' Djujic recalled, ``because Tito gave his general an
order to take me alive. Later the Partisan general wrote: `Though
we had the strongest forces, Djujic slipped away from us like a
fish through our hands.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the war ended, Djujic hoped to combine with other anti-Tito
forces to build a kind of redoubt in northern Yugoslavia. Instead,
he was ordered by Allied forces to surrender. His division was
taken to southern Italy, from there to Germany and then dispersed
to European countries, the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Djujic was in Paris from 1947 to 1949, then moved to the United
States, where he became active in Serbian emigre circles and the
Orthodox Church, although not serving as a priest.
</P>
<P>
   He enraged some emigre Serbs when he endorsed a church patriarch
in Belgrade authorized by the Communists, but remained strongly
inimical to Tito. Finally he retired to San Marcos, writing poems
and jokes published in America and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 he pronounced Vojislav Seselj, then an anti-Communist
dissident, a Serbian ``Vojvoda.'' Seselj is now head of the Radical
Party and a government coalition partner of President Slobodan
Milosevic. ``I was naive when I nominated Seselj Vojvoda,'' Djujic
said in 1998. ``I ask my people to forgive me. The greatest
gravedigger of Serbdom is Slobodan Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his sons, Sinisa, of Redondo Beach, and
Radivoje, of Santa Monica; a daughter, Radojka Kinach, of San
Marcos; two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren; a brother,
Bosko, of Torrance, Calif., and a sister, Ika Djuric, of Escondido,
Calif. His wife, Zorka, died in 1995.

SUICIDE FOLLOWS THE DISCOVERY OF A BODY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mystery of a pregnant woman murdered long ago and hidden for
decades in a steel drum under a home on Long Island until her
mummified remains were found 11 days ago has taken another strange
twist. A day after being questioned by detectives last week, the
original owner of the home apparently killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Howard B. Elkins, 71, the first of five owners of the white
split-level home at 67 Forest Drive in Jericho, N.Y., where the
body was found, was interrogated by Nassau County homicide
investigators on Thursday at his retirement home in a condominium
community in Boca Raton, Fla. He was not taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, the police said, he left home and did not
return. His worried family called the authorities to report him
missing. Later that evening, he was found by a son in the garage of
a friend's house in Boca Raton, the victim of an apparently
self-inflicted shotgun blast to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The police, at least publicly, drew no connections between
Elkins' death and the discovery of the woman's body under his
former home, or his questioning in that mystery. ``We are aware
that the man did commit suicide in Florida,'' Officer Doreen
McGuinness, a Nassau County police spokeswoman, said Sunday. ``But
we're still investigating, and we are not drawing any conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the death of Elkins seemed to suggest, investigators
said they were no closer to unraveling a tangled case whose grim
discoveries, tantalizing clues and twisting plot might have been
drawn from one of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   Who was the woman?
</P>
<P>
   Why was she killed?
</P>
<P>
   Why was her body hidden where it would inevitably be found?
</P>
<P>
   The case broke on Sept. 2, when Hamid Tafaghodi, having just
bought the Jericho house for $455,000, found a rusted 55-gallon
drum, weighing 345 pounds, in a 36-inch crawl space. He insisted
that Ronald Cohen, the seller, take it away.
</P>
<P>
   After garbage men refused to handle it, apparently fearing that
toxic waste might have been inside, Cohen and a real estate agent
pried the lid off, found another container inside and spotted a
hand and a shoe. They called the police, who removed the body of a
woman, her full-term fetus, her apparel and other items, all
remarkably well preserved, apparently because the drum had been
airtight.
</P>
<P>
   The body, shrunken over time, was 4 feet 9 inches tall, weighed
59 pounds and was clad in a skirt, button-down sweater, high socks
and a shoe with a mid-level heel. Around the neck was a religious
scapular and a locket with the words, ``Patrice, Love Uncle Phil.''
A wedding band on the left hand bore an inscription ``M.H.R.
XII-59.'' There was another ring with a green stone, and an
imitation leopard-skin coat and a pocketbook with makeup also were
found. The sex of the fetus could not be determined.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that the woman, who was 25 to 30 years old at
the time of her death, had been killed by blunt force head trauma,
and estimated that she had been dead 25 to 30 years. Despite many
clues and searches of missing persons reports, her identity has not
been uncovered. No fingerprints were obtainable, but the police
hope that DNA samples may provide useful leads. Any DNA taken from
the remains of the fetus might help identify its father, detectives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators learned that the house had been built in 1957 and
had had only five owners: Elkins, who sold it in 1972, Arthur and
Judith Ebbin, who sold it in 1984, Frank and Bernadette Salmaggi,
who sold it in 1990, and Cohen, who sold it to Tafaghodi this year.
Each of the owners, in interviews with the police and the news
media, denied knowing anything about the drum.
</P>
<P>
   But detectives concluded that the murder must have taken place
during a nine-year period between March 1963, when the drum was
manufactured in Linden, N.J., as a container for paint and plastic
pigments, and October 1972, when it was first reported seen at the
house in Jericho. Elkins was the owner throughout that period.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with The New York Times on Sept. 4,
Elkins acknowledged that he had bought the house new in 1957, and
had lived in it for 15 years before selling and moving to Florida
in 1972. He also noted that he had built a den off the kitchen that
created the crawl space in 1966. Asked if he had ever gone into the
crawl space, he replied: ``What for?''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he could not remember the name of the contractor
who had built the addition, but recalled that the job had gone
smoothly. He said that, aside from gardeners, landscapers and
maids, he could think of no one who had had access to the property.

INDONESIA AGREES TO ACCEPT INTERNATIONAL PEACEKEEPING FORCE

Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Bowing to international pressure,
Indonesia agreed Sunday to allow a foreign security force into East
Timor to halt the slaughter of civilians by pro-Jakarta militias.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Pacific Rim nations gathered here
for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum continued to press
Indonesia President B.J. Habibie to allow a rapid deployment and to
step up its lackluster efforts to halt the continuing violence.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie, dropping his nation's defiant stance, announced he
would acquiesce to worldwide demands for a peacekeeping force.
However, he set no time frame nor did he offer any details on what
type of force would be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people have lost their lives since the beginning of
the unrest, lost their homes and security. We can wait no longer.
We have to stop the suffering and the mourning immediately,''
Habibie said during a news conference in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had earlier accused the Indonesian
military of ``aiding and abetting'' the militias, said he welcomed
Habibie's words but wanted to see action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is for President Habibie to make good
on his statement, get the details worked out, get the force in in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters prior to a morning APEC session that
Jakarta should have no say about who is in the security force or
how it is structured. He said U.S. participation would be limited
to a supporting role and may ``require some presence on the ground
in East Timor, but no one has asked for any combat troops.''
</P>
<P>
   Dire conditions continued in East Timor amid reports that the
capital, Dili, had been sacked and thousands had fled into hiding.
Rampaging pro-Indonesian gangs began mounting attacks against
civilians following an Aug. 30 vote in which East Timor, a former
Portuguese colony and heavily Roman Catholic, voted overwhelmingly
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia, whose population is largely Muslim, invaded East
Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year. Two decades of
conflict have claimed the lives of an estimated 200,000 East
Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, Clinton's national security adviser,
said Habibie's announcement ``represents a stepping back from the
brink on the part of Indonesia from what could be a quite
disastrous situation, not only for the people of East Timor, but
for Indonesia and for the region as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was surrounded by military officers, including army
chief Gen. Wiranto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name,
in a scene that lent some credence to the president's statements.
Wiranto and others had offered conflicting statements about the
acceptance of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie informed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of his
decision and immediately sent Foreign Minister Ali Alata to the
United Nations to work out the details. He is expected to arrive in
New York today.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who took the lead in
assembling troop commitments, called the decision a ``great step
forward for the people of East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their welfare, their future, their safety, their freedom
that this has been all about,'' Howard said. The Australian prime
minister used the APEC gathering to personally lobby members to
pressure Indonesia and to contribute to the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   The East Timor crisis dominated the APEC conference which wraps
up late today.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia objected to the force being led by Australia, which
has committed 2,000 troops, but a number of Asian nations pledged
to provide infantry. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and the
Philippines offered contributions. New Zealand, Britain, Canada,
Portugal and Fiji also will provide some of the 5,000 to 7,000
troops expected as an initial deployment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may provide troops for logistical support but
Clinton said there had been no request for combat soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of what our role would be in East Timor, we have had
extensive discussions with the Australians through out defense
channels and we've been asked to provide a limited, but important
function related to airlift, transportation, communications,
intelligence and perhaps in engineering work,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly what the details would be have yet to be worked out
and require more extensive consultations with Congress,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Congress
probably would support a limited U.S. role. ``If it's
communications, logistics, transportation, I think there would be
support for that,'' he said Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it involves troops on the ground, I think then a lot more
questions are going to be asked, and of course there's always the
question of what the cost is going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   International pressure on Indonesian had been growing for days.
The United States and Britain halted military sales and broached
the possibility of economic sanctions. Governments from Asia to
Europe had condemned the Indonesian military's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, hoping to keep the heat on Habibie, said the United
States would not resume normal relations with Indonesia until the
security force is in place. Later today, the president will meet
with Jose Ramos-Horta, an East Timorese independence leader and
Nobel Peace Prize winner.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. Security Council team that visited Dili on Sunday
described it as a ``living hell'' after gangs looted and burned
much of the city. An estimated 600 to 7,000 civilians have been
murdered. Thousands fled to Indonesia's West Timor, which shares
the island. Another 100,000 refugees are thought hiding in the
forests outside Dili where food is scarce.

DEFENSE COMPENSATES FOR LACKLUSTER OFFENSE IN GIANTS' VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ A year ago when the New York Giants played in
Tampa, their offensive performance was so inept that quarterback
Danny Kanell apologized to his defensive teammates afterward. It
was a courtly gesture but the beginning of the end for Kanell and
the dawn of a downward Giants spiral that ruined a season of
promise.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants returned to Tampa on Sunday wary of the bad karma the
place held for them. And like last year's offense, this year's
Giants offense played crudely. But after Sunday's season-opening
game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Giants quarterback Kent
Graham did not offer apologies. He did, wisely, give thanks to his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Five turnovers forced by the Giants' defense turned a clumsy yet
tense game into a 17-13 victory at Raymond James Stadium. And there
was no discord between the Giants' offense and the defense on the
sideline or in the locker room as there was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   That was because the Giants' offense did not turn the ball over
and the defensive players magnanimously accepted that their
offensive brethren were having an off day. They happily rescued the
offense, scoring two touchdowns and setting up a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants may have look hopelessly awkward on offense _ they
had just four first downs _ but the Giants left Tampa gleeful, as
if they had romped, because coaches and players alike had
identified this game as the schedule's most daunting assignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be games like this,'' Giants coach Jim
Fassel said. ``But you've got to figure out a way to win these
games. No, I'm not happy with our offense, but we didn't make
mistakes that cost us the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a mental maturing process on this team. As the game
evolved, we had a sense that we had to do whatever we had to win.
That's an important thing to learn. I feel as good about our team
as I have since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that belonged in the Giants' 1997 season, when the
defense won games and the offense tried not to lose them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tampa Bay's first offensive series, Giants linebacker Jessie
Armstead blitzed, sacking Trent Dilfer the Buccaneers' beleaguered
quarterback, and forcing a fumble. Defensive tackle Christian Peter
grabbed the fumble and dashed 38 yards into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the teams would play for another three hours, Peter's
touchdown set a tone for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us belief that things could be different for us,''
Armstead said. ``We got the old fire in our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Buccaneers came back to take a 10-7 lead, four
second-half interceptions chased Dilfer from the game. The most
damaging came when Dilfer threw from his end zone in the third
quarter. The rookie cornerback Andre Weathers caught the ball _ it
was thrown right to him _ and returned it 8 yards for a touchdown
and a 14-10 Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants never lost that lead as Dilfer was twice picked off
by free safety Percy Ellsworth in the fourth quarter. Dilfer's
backup, Eric Zeier, then came on and was intercepted by Phillippi
Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a look in our eyes today that I've never seen in the
guys before,'' defensive end Michael Strahan said. ``This team is
our nemesis and for us to score first, take the ball away from them
and hold on was a huge first step for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a game of field position. As the Giants took the
lead and realized they could not move the ball against Tampa Bay's
strong defense, the punting of Brad Maynard became pivotal. He
punted 12 times, averaging 43.8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard punted so often because the Giants were going nowhere
offensively. Except when taking over after a Tampa Bay turnover,
the Giants never crossed midfielde. They had just 107 yards
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called new-look Giants offense averaged just 2.2 yards
per passing play and 1.1 yards on 24 rushing attempts. Graham
finished with 91 passing yards while completing 12 of 23 yards. The
rookie Sean Bennett was the leading Giants rusher with 24 yards on
13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, for all the Giants' defensive dominance, the Buccaneers
were still in the game in the final two minutes. That's when the
Giants caught a break from the officiating crew. A 28-yard pass
from Zeier to Karl Williams was nullified by the game officials
after watching replays of the play.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the officials ruled that Williams had caught the
ball after it passed through the hands of safety Shaun Williams,
but after consulting replays decided the ball hit the ground before
Williams pulled it in.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast television replays seemed to show Williams catching
the ball. An incompletion certainly did not appear conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Sparks intercepted a Zeier pass that was
deflected, assuring the Giants' victory.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the first of two Ellsworth interceptions set up a
36-yard field goal by Brad Daluiso that proved to be the winning
score. Ellsworth took advantage twice of Dilfer's wild scrambling
and ill-advised decisions to hoist passes downfield into ample
Giants coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants made a number of mistakes, including nine penalties.
They committed three penalties on punt plays, and the last one
helped cost them the lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the final two minutes of the first half, Maynard pinned the
Buccaneers at their 15-yard line with a 53-yard punt. But the
Giants' Corey Widmer was called for holding, necessitating a
rekick. This time, kicking out of his end zone, Maynard's punt
carried just 37 yards and Tampa Bay took over at its 46-yard line _
a field position gain of 31 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 90 seconds later, Tampa Bay had a 10-7 lead, scoring
on Dilfer's 1-yard pass to Dave Moore.
</P>
<P>
   It was without question the low point in the game for the
Giants, but the defense had other comebacks planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense we wouldn't be denied,'' Strahan said. ``We
knew we had to do ourselves if we had to. But that's OK Today was
an unusual game.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Bird may be to blame for plane's engine explosion
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst and Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jarra Gould had armed herself with a
book and settled into window seat 20A for a three-hour flight to
Houston on Sunday morning when she saw a strange orange light
coming from one of the plane's jet engines. Seconds later, hunks of
torn metal flew by her window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so terrified or felt so close to death,'' said
the Houston resident after her flight returned safely to Palm Beach
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot managed to maneuver the Boeing 737 back to the runway
after the engine exploded, scattering shrapnel through a West Palm
Beach neighborhood. None of the 84 passengers and five Continental
Airlines crew members was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, people reported only minor injuries, most from
scrambling away from what they thought were gunshots but really
were falling engine pieces ranging in size from 200 pounds to a
dime.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Flight 1933 took off on time, at 7 a.m., and was
climbing steadily to the east when the engine caught fire and blew
apart, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators were on the scene Sunday, but said they
would be unable to determine a cause for weeks. Initial reports
from the airport control tower and fire-rescue workers, however,
indicated that a bird was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time in the morning, the black crows and seagulls head
over to the dump on 45th Street for breakfast,'' said Richard
Pleasant, a West Palm Beach police officer. ``They don't miss a
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the explosion rattled windows on the ground and
pierced the plane's tail with large pieces of twisted metal. It
left passengers and witnesses wondering whether the plane could
stay in the air.
</P>
<P>
   After the explosion, the lights in the fuselage flashed on and
off as the plane shook and rattled, said Gould, whose seat was just
behind the left wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the whole plane was going to break apart,'' said
Jean Gardikis, who was flying home to Seattle via Houston. ``After
the explosion, it started flying funny for awhile. I worried that
the plane just wasn't going to hold together.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Matias watched the scene after walking out the door of
440 El Vedado to see if it looked like a good day for fishing.
Instead of clouds, Matias saw red flames spitting out of the left
engine of an airplane and engine parts plummeting toward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the pieces were veering away and some were coming
straight for me,'' said Matias, 45. ``I looked at my boat and
thought I might dive underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 737 made a wide turn to the left, Matias said he prayed
for those aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying, 'Make it. Make it,' `` Matias said.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith was waiting for a co-worker to bring tools to the
roof of The Palm Beach Post's building when he saw the plane take
off. Smith said he has always been intrigued that a machine so
heavy can fly, so he routinely watches the planes take off and
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching it climb and there was nothing wrong,'' Smith
said. ``Then I saw the flames; then I saw the explosion; and then
it rocked the building. I ran to the other side of the (roof)
because I thought it was going to crash. Then it kept climbing and
I knew it was going to be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith worried, though, about the people on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, 'Oh my God, there's a person sitting there watching
that ... to watch that explosion would have been awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Those aboard said most of the passengers remained calm and
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really very quiet,'' John Gardikis said. ``I don't know
whether a lot of people weren't awake because it was so early, or
whether they were praying.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said the pilot banked the plane gradually over the
water and turned back toward the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot did an outstanding job,'' said Jean Gardikis. ``He
didn't say anything over the intercom until it was over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fire trucks and emergency vehicles were waiting along the
runway. Airport officials first considered wheeling portable
stairways onto the tarmac, but then elected to have the plane towed
to the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The tail of the 737 was pierced with a dozen large metal shards
_ some more than a foot long _ that had been thrown from the
exploding engine. Investigators stood on the runway, shaking their
heads as they photographed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Within about 15 minutes of touching down, passengers were in the
terminal making new travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the debris-scattered neighborhood east of the airport, across
Interstate 95, residents were coming out of their homes about that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was out in the street in their underwear and
pajamas,'' said Zaida Leon. ``We were so frightened!''
</P>
<P>
   The airplane parts pelted a five-block swath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! There is just so much,'' said city police Lt. Greg
Parkinson, who walked the neighborhood marking places were debris
fell with fluorescent paint. ``Some of the pieces are as small as a
quarter-inch and some as large as a car hood.''
</P>
<P>
   One metal piece struck so hard that it gouged asphalt on a
street, he said. The parts damaged at least five vehicles,
punctured awnings and riddled rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was one of two operated by Continental on Sunday
between PBIA and Houston, company officials said. The plane was
about 35 people below capacity, said spokeswoman Julie Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Continental bused most of the passengers to Miami to catch
another flight to Houston. Some passengers, like Gould, were stuck
at PBIA until the 6 p.m. Continental flight to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Fowler, of Stuart, put his son Ezra on Flight 1933 at 7
a.m. and then drove home. By the time he arrived, he learned of the
flight's problems and drove back to PBIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the airline and asked them what was going on. All
they told me was that the plane had left on time,'' Fowler said.
``I had to come all the way back to learn that my son had been put
on a bus to Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Gould couldn't find a seat on another flight or with another
carrier, so she was forced to spend the day at PBIA until the
evening flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the ticket agent if I could have a voucher for a
meal,'' Gould said. ``She said, ``OK, here's one for five dollars.'
I said, `Five dollars?' Then she asked another agent if it was OK
to make it eight, which they finally did. They scare you to death
then offer you an eight-dollar meal.''

SPORTS COLUMN: IN THE END, THERE WAS ONLY ONE SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the soft evening sky Sunday, a few puffy clouds
reflected the sunset. Night was falling on 14 days of survival
tennis, in which players fell out of kilter, their backs out of
alignment, their arms and legs twisted.
</P>
<P>
   In these final hours of the U.S. Open, two 29-year-olds who have
known each other since they were juniors resumed their rivalry.
Andre Agassi and Todd Martin flailed away at each other, as they
have for more than a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   The final lacked the drama of the women's final a day earlier
because it did not have a sudden new star like Serena Williams, who
had outlasted Martina Hingis on Saturday evening. Martin was no
Serena Williams, just a decent guy being asked by more than 20,000
fans to produce something memorable, and he resolutely gave them a
fifth set, more than they might have expected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, Andre Agassi started scampering around the
court, a man with a plan. He was in shape from all his sessions
with his trainer, Gil Reyes, he was already the top-rated player in
the tennis computer, and now he was in motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not gamesmanship,'' Agassi said. ``But you do want to
show that you're in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi hunkered low, flicked a few Martin serves off the hard
floor, and after two weeks it looked easy. Agassi survived the
third game, with Martin throwing heat, and he dashed off to the
changeover. After the fifth game, with a 4-1 lead, he darted to his
seat. He raced off after winning the seventh game. And when he
broke Martin in the eighth game, he was suddenly in a hurry. Agassi
won this survivor's tournament with a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7),
6-3, 6-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect somebody to play well,'' said Agassi, who was in
his 10th Grand Slam final. ``But it isn't easy to go into a finals
and play good tennis unless you've been there a lot. It speaks well
to his spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin had been in a final only once, the 1994 Australian Open.
There was the memorable 1995 Wimbledon semifinal where he
squandered a 5-1 lead over Malivai Washington. He is stalwart,
smart, dedicated _ a symbol of this Open. While other players
disappeared with injuries and pains in these past two weeks, he
kept plugging along, even when they had to put an IV in his arm to
pump him full of fluids after a bout with stomach flu.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has shown his grit before. In 1997, with his father,
Dale, dying of leukemia, Martin missed much of the season due to
shin and elbow injuries. But he came back in 1998 and this year he
fought his way back to the No. 4 ranking in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lanky, middle American in appearance, a bit of Henry Fonda or
Jimmy Stewart in his earnestness, Martin has none of the Las Vegas
glitz of his opponent. He once talked about the lessons he learned
in church back in Lansing, Mich:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was lucky in that all though my life, the choice
between right and wrong has been pretty obvious. I put stock in the
power of conscience, too, in that if I think I should do something,
I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That inner life does not necessarily deter him in his tennis. He
has a powerful serve and a resolute baseline game, but not often
the tools of a finalist. He might not have been in the finals if
Pete Sampras' back hadn't slipped out in a practice before the
Open, or if Patrick Rafter's rotator cuff had not torn during a
match, and if a few other gifted players had not suddenly grown
clueless or weary.
</P>
<P>
   But there Martin was, in the fifth set of his national
championship, with a real chance because Agassi had frittered away
two tiebreakers to a man with a hard serve.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had the easier tournament _ 20 sets to get here, as
opposed to the 23 Martin played, which included an injury that put
Magnus Larsson out after one set in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had floated through this tournament, knowing that Sampras
was not waiting for him. He had shaved the hair off his body _ and
frequently whipped off his shirt to demonstrate _ and maybe the
improved aerodynamics helped propel him through the two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the final set Sunday night, he just glided away from Martin,
form coming true. The solid man would be a runner-up once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd deserved to be in the finals,'' Agassi said. ``It was
just disappointing he had to lose. I was just hanging on by a
thread.''
</P>
<P>
   As he walked off the court, Martin said: ``I couldn't think of a
better way to go out than to play a great champion.''
</P>
<P>
   They were words Martin was conditioned to speak in the
midwestern Sunday schools of his childhood. He had given the fans
their money's worth, but in the end, the clean-shaven Agassi just
ran and ran, and literally ran away with this survivor's Open.

 &HT;    Floyd bears down on Bahamas; Florida braces
 &HT;    By Paul Owers and Michael Browning
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Looking like a giant silver buzzsaw,
Hurricane Floyd continued its grim march across the Caribbean
Sunday evening, its screaming 145 mph winds fully as menacing as
those of Hurricane Andrew, which devastated South Florida in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody should be preparing,'' said Tricia Wallace,
meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Miami-Dade
County. ``This is a very large, well-defined storm. We're
projecting landfall between Palm Beach and Daytona. But
hurricane-force winds extend over 100 miles from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, Bill O'Brien, director of emergency management for
Palm Beach County, said forecast tracks had the storm's eye passing
near Cape Canaveral. But the margin of error of those forecasts is
about 250 miles, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still inside the cone of death,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   No hurricane watches were issued late Sunday, but those could
come after a 5 a.m. advisory today, O'Brien said.

   Seen from the windless calm of outer space, through the
radar-equipped eyes of weather satellites, the gigantic storm moved
in a slow, silvery swirl across the blue Atlantic, slewing just
north of due west Sunday evening at 14 mph, bearing down on the
Bahamas with a 145-mph rush of rain-lashed air. The glow of sunset
flashed briefly across the smooth curve of its eastern eyewall,
seen from far above.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as large as the entire state of Florida, the sheer
wingspan of Floyd's cloud-wracked mass of winds and water is so
wide that areas miles from the eye of the storm could be deluged
with rain. Residents watched The Weather Channel with growing fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the size of that sucker! I've been here 12 years and
never worried about hurricanes. I've been very fortunate,'' said
Peggy Hughes as she loaded sheets of plywood into the back of her
van.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be prepared,'' she said, ``because I'm staying and
praying.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District began opening the
floodgates on all canals in Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and St. Lucie
counties Sunday in an effort to lower water levels, enabling them
to cope better with expected downpours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anticipating some fairly heavy rainfall,'' said Ann
Overton, a spokeswoman for the district. ``We haven't opened the
gates full bore, just about halfway, because conditions are drier
now than they were when we were being threatened by Hurricane
Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Okeechobee has been sealed off. No water is being sent
into, or allowed out of, the great body of water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials will decide about 13 hours before projected landfall
whether to order evacuations and open shelters, emergency
management director O'Brien said. That decision will be based
largely on whether forecasters think they can confidently pinpoint
Floyd's landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say, 'We think it'll move north, but we're not really
sure,' we may have to err on the side of caution and use good
judgment,'' O'Brien said. ``Today's going to be a very busy day.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the southeastern arc of coastal Florida, anxious people
thronged supermarkets, ATM machines and Home Depots, frantically
buying preparedness and peace of mind: jugs of water, sheets of
plywood, bandoliers of batteries, cases of pet food, snowdrifts of
disposable diapers, sacks of charcoal and cans of Sterno, along
with enough candles to light the palaces of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going crazy here. We have no plywood. We have nothing,''
said Angela Souza, who works at The Home Depot in Jensen Beach.
``It looks like a traffic jam out in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, that store sold more than 2,600 pieces of
plywood. The store in Fort Pierce sold out of 2,700 pieces of
5/8-inch or 1/2-inch plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Generators in both stores sold out early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery store aisles were bustling with residents picking up
staples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have everything they need, but they come to stock
up on water, dry goods, batteries or candles,'' said Ann Seymour, a
bookkeeper at the Stuart Winn-Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wheelihan of Lantana bought 13 sheets of plywood for his
house and his parents' home in Lake Worth. He said he was
especially concerned about his parents' house because it has
jalousie windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Mom and Dad haven't boarded up their house in 40 years, but
I'm boarding it up now,'' Wheelihan said. ``It's worth a few
hundred dollars to save things they've been collecting for a
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Albertsons quickly sold out of bottled water.
Kyle Heine, the store's general merchandising manager, set up a
hurricane display featuring lamps, candles and batteries, although
those supplies weren't selling as well as the water, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is really concerned about (Floyd),'' Heine said.
``But I don't think all of the clientele here are sure that it's
coming our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another shopper spent the morning making trip after trip to The
Home Depot in Boynton Beach, each time filling the bed of his truck
until it sagged heavily in the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have time to talk,'' he said as he rushed to the
truck's door. ``I don't have time to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   At Palm Beach International Airport, authorities said no
extraordinary precautions were being taken Sunday. The threshold
for closing the airport comes when sustained winds reach 65 mph to
70 mph, said Jim Craft, airport operations supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   After Floyd, Gert.
</P>
<P>
   The storm system known as Gert became a tropical storm Sunday
and was expected to strengthen to a hurricane today, the National
Weather Service announced. Gert still lay 1,780 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles, but was moving west at a speed of 21 mph, with
maximum sustained winds of 65 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This motion is expected to continue on Monday,'' the weather
service bulletin said.

SPORTS COLUMN: GIANTS' OFFENSE IN SEARCH OF A STARTER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY, Fla. _ For much of July and August, Giants fans heard
coach Jim Fassel talk about the newfangled, high-powered, wide-open
offense he was ready to unleash in his third year on the job. This
Giants' offense would be versatile, volatile and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   During the preseason the Giants offered tantalizing morsels of
wide-open things to come, and fans, hungry for a change, bit. It
turns out that the newfangled Giants' offense everyone has been
talking about is its defense.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the Giants' offense and Tampa Bay's offense fought
a duel of ineptitude, the Giants' defense made it clear that until
further notice the team's foundation is what it has always been:
defense. The new offense mustered four first downs and 107 yards;
the defense accounted for 14 points and set up a field goal in the
Giants' 17-13 victory over the Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who earned a starting quarterback berth on the strength
of six strong games at the end of last season, had a lukewarm
season debut. Normally opening games are dismissed as, well,
opening games. But Graham's case is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants acquired Kerry Collins in the off season, the
assumption was that the starting job would be his by midseason.
Maybe sooner. Fassel steadfastly has insisted that Graham is the
starter, no strings attached. Well, maybe one or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people predicted Kent would not start the first game,
that I'd make a switch in the preseason,'' Fassel said. ``That's
not the case. All I've really done for Kent is give him the
opportunity. He's got to earn it. He knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent's been around me long enough to know that I don't have a
quick hook with a quarterback, but you've got to win. You've got to
play well. It's not a Supreme Court appointment. You've got to
function or you're going to be out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won Sunday, but not because of Graham. For three
quarters, the Giants' offense with Graham at the helm struggled to
find a rhythm. Completions were sporadic, few points were scored
and the running game was virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was 12 of 23 for 91 yards. The longest completion was for
12 yards. While the Giants' new wide-open offense sputtered and
jerked, the defense repeatedly saved the day. In the first quarter
Christian Peter rumbled 38 yards after recovering a fumble by the
quarterback. Andre Weathers' interception gave the Giants a 14-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said the Giants played the way they had to play to beat
Tampa Bay. Tampa Bay has one of the best defenses in the league,
and outside of bulldozing them, the only way to survive is to
nickel-and-dime them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good game of patience,'' Graham said. ``We played
smart; we didn't turn the ball over. We knew going in that it was
going to be tough to get it done. But a lot of teams that play the
Bucs get impatient and go deep and throw interceptions. We didn't
do that. We've go to do what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham describes himself as the guy who starts at the end of the
line and finally works his way to the front. His career has been a
struggle. This year the starting job is his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The best you can say for the Giants' offense is that Graham was
better than Trent Dilfer of Tampa Bay. This was not an encouraging
spectacle for Giants fans looking for the new infrastructure Fassel
promised: 27 yards rushing, 91 in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The day was saved for the Giants because Dilfer was horrible:
one of his fumbles was returned for a Giants touchdown; one of his
interceptions was returned for a touchdown; another interception
set up a Giants field goal. Eric Zeier finally, mercifully,
replaced Dilfer, and he threw an interception that gave the Giants
the game.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two seasons, the quarterback position has been
Fassel's Achilles' heel, which is problematic for a coach who got
the job on the strength of being a quarterback guru. Fassel was
hired to nurture two quarterbacks who are no longer around: Dave
Brown and Danny Kanell. Kanell replaced Brown, and Graham finally
replaced Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   If Fassell switches to Collins, Giants fans might legitimately
begin to wonder whether players are the problem or whether the
scheme is the problem. What is the scheme? The scheme is defense.
</P>
<P>
   The job is Graham's to lose. He loses bits of it with every
incomplete pass, every interception, every sack when he holds the
ball too long.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cushion, no margin of error. Kerry Collins is the
$16.9 million clock that is ticking.

 &HT;    Loss stops Maddux's streak at 8
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Braves got a double whammy on Sunday
afternooon as they bid good riddance to 3Com Park, losing Greg
Maddux's eight-game winning streak and falling 8-4 to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves lost four of six games here this season, the last one
before the Giants move to Pacific Bell Ballpark and finished 4-5
against the Giants overall this year, their first season series
loss to the Giants since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate this place,'' said Brian Jordan, who didn't get too
many arguments from his teammates. ``Playing here, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's first loss to the Giants since 1996 was decided when he
surrendered six consecutive singles in a four-run fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just started to get his change-up up,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``I don't know if it was the wind. He got it in the same spot
every pitch, right there belt high.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since his spring struggles had Maddux given up hits with
less of a fight. Barry Bonds started it with a rip to right center
and eighth hitter Doug Mirabelli finished it with a two-run single
up the middle for a 6-1 Giants lead.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones gunned down Bonds at second base with a great throw
from right center and that would be the only out the Braves would
see until pitcher Joe Nathan laid down a sacrifice six batters
later. Maddux got out of the inning only after Ramon Martinez, the
ninth batter in the inning, sent Jordan to the warning track in the
right field corner.
</P>
<P>
   The six runs were the most Maddux allowed since the Cardinals
scored eight on him May 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually when I leave (my change-up) up, I can feel it when I
throw it,'' said Maddux, now 18-7. ``It just wasn't sinking. I felt
like I was throwing it pretty good, but it just, I don't know. It
was more me than the conditions. I'll see if I can't fix it by the
next time out. I didn't really make pitches when I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, 19-11 against the Giants in his career but only 8-8 at
3Com Park, wasn't blaming the windy conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be 99 percent my fault and 1 percent I can blame on
the conditions,'' Maddux said. ``I should be able to make the
adjustment. It's not like it's the first time I've pitched here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tried to rally for him, scoring three runs in the
sixth inning on a two-run Bret Boone homer and Chipper Jones' 40th
home run of the season. But the offense went flat after that and
the bullpen made it worse by serving up home runs to Rich Aurilia
and Barry Bonds.

TIMORESE BISHOP IS CALLING FOR WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TIMOR-RDP, TIMOR-REFUGEES) 
(lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo of East Timor,
who fled his homeland last week after anti-independence forces
riddled his house with bullets and then burned it down, called on
Sunday for the creation of a war crimes tribunal to bring charges
of genocide against Indonesian military commanders and militia
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Belo, the Roman Catholic religious leader of most of the 800,000
people of East Timor and the co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace
Prize, also said in an interview that he feared that the
military-backed militias would begin a new wave of massacres unless
international peacekeepers are deployed to East Timor this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary to put peacekeepers there immediately _ within
24, 48 hours _ to defend the people and to protect the refugees who
are still in the forest,'' he said, speaking by phone from Lisbon,
Portugal, where he was invited by his religious order. ``It is
necessary to save the people of East Timor.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a scheduled audience with Pope John Paul II at the
pope's Italian summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, the bishop said
he had heard reports from East Timor that the death toll was now
measured in the thousands _ ``I was told more than 10,000'' _ and
that the killings continued Sunday in both East Timor and West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of East Timorese have fled or been forced to
go to the western half of the island, which is also a province of
Indonesia. ``The militias are still going around, and they are
killing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wanted to see the creation of a war crimes tribunal
for East Timor, like those created by the United Nations to deal
with human rights abuses in the Balkans and Rwanda, to prosecute
crimes against humanity carried out by Indonesian military
commanders and the militias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, some actions must be taken,'' he said. ``There must be an
international court to judge these actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Belo said he was convinced that Indonesian soldiers in civilian
clothes had tried to kill or harm him by firing into his home last
week, and that Indonesia's military commander, Gen. Wiranto, had
been directing the violence in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He planned this _ he blessed this,'' the bishop said. ``The
military, absolutely, they are responsible for the violence. I
think this is a kind of revenge for the military because they
failed to keep East Timor as a province. They saw that East Timor
was now free, and they wanted revenge.'' In a referendum last
month, East Timorese voted overwhelmingly for independence from
Indonesia, though the action still needs official ratification by
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now Timor is almost completely destroyed,'' the bishop
said, adding in reference to the capital, ``Dili is a ghost city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that four or five priests have already been killed,''
he said, adding that Roman Catholic priests and nuns were being
selected as targets because ``they have been the moral strength for
the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious differences are considered one element of the turmoil
in East Timor. Most East Timorese are Roman Catholics, while the
vast majority of Indonesians are Muslim; Indonesia is the world's
largest Muslim nation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Belo said of Wiranto, ``He's responsible, and he should be
dismissed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not harsh in his assessment, however, of President B.J.
Habibie, who appeared to have been muscled aside by the military
during the crisis in East Timor but who made the announcement
Sunday inviting the United Nations to send peacekeeping troops to
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the man who agreed to an international election to
decide independence for East Timor, so we hope that he will
continue as president,'' the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   Belo fled East Timor last Tuesday, traveling first by an
Australian military plane to the northern Australian city of
Darwin, and then on to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The day before leaving his homeland, the bishop was trapped in
his house in Dili as armed men began firing on the compound. ``When
they attacked my house, the bullets were flying over my head,'' he
said. ``I know that they were military.'' Asked how he could be so
sure they were soldiers, he replied: ``I saw them. I know they were
military.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was too early to establish a time line for East
Timorese independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force is needed ``to give tranquillity to the
population, and then little by little, our leaders can decide how
to bring East Timor to independence,'' he said. ``There should be a
period of transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is scheduled to spend several days in Italy and then
return to Portugal, the bishop said he was ready to return to East
Timor this week if the peacekeeping force is in place. ``Yes, if
the peacekeeping force is already there, I will go,'' he said.
``Today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Agassi grand in final
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andre Agassi affirmed his new No. 1 ranking Sunday
with a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 6-2 victory over the best of
Todd Martin in a 3-hour, 23-minute classic of a men's final at the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   It was Agassi's fifth major title, his second this year, and his
first at the U.S. Open since 1994, the year he finished his first
great comeback by winning as an unseeded player against Michael
Stich.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win two Slams, which is something nobody else did this
year, makes me feel like I've accomplished the most,'' said Agassi,
who overtook Pete Sampras at the top of the ATP Tour rankings
today.
</P>
<P>
   At 29, this Agassi may be older, but he's fitter and simply
better. Against one of the game's top service returners who was
playing the match of his life, Agassi didn't surrender a single
service break, holding all 25 times while saving eight break
points. Agassi was broken only six times in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the seventh seed, was in his first major final since
Sampras beat him at the 1994 Australian Open, and he played well
enough to have won his first.
</P>
<P>
   The opening set was decided essentially by a single point.
Leading the first game 30-love, Martin had the open court on a
short ball and drove a backhand into the corner, but Agassi guessed
right and intercepted it, guiding it into the open court for a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi then got the only break of the set with three sraight
backhand winners, one a return, another a passing shot.
</P>
<P>
   The second set went to a tiebreaker without a service break, and
Martin took control of it serving at 3-4. He hit consecutive
first-volley winners, one off each side, then got a mini-break on
Agassi with an inside-out forehand winner crosscourt. After Agassi
pulled to within 5-6 with a service winner, Martin won the set by
forcing a volley that Agassi couldn't handle from his backhand
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Martin won the third-set tiebreaker with ease. Agassi opened it
with a double-fault, and Martin got two other mini-breaks with
strong up-the-line returns that Agassi found difficult to match.
Martin was serving flawlessly as he knocked off two first volleys
for winners and had a service winner.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Agassi got the first service break since the
match's opening game when at deuce Martin double-faulted, then
floated a first volley long. Martin had led 40-15.
</P>
<P>
   Things began to unravel for Martin at 0-1 in the fifth as Agassi
hit a backhand return winner and Martin followed with a
double-fault and a long backhand for love-40. Agassi then ripped
Martin's wide first serve down the line for a backhand winner to
lead 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, sprinting to the chair during changeovers while the
fatigued Martin waddled back, then held at love, giving him nine
straight points won and a 3-0 lead. At that point, the match was
essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly couldn't call this disappointing; I lost to a
better player,'' Martin said. ``He beat me when I played a very
good match.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi is the first American to win the French and U.S. titles
in the same year since Tony Trabert in 1955. The only great
achievement he's never attained is the year-end No. 1 rankings, and
now he's leading coming down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest times of my life, and I'll never forget
New York right here,'' said Agassi.

 &HT;    Excerpts from U.S. Attorney's letter to Janet Reno
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Excerpts from a five-page letter that Bill
Johnston, the assistant U.S. attorney in Waco, sent to Attorney
General Janet Reno, expressing Johnston's suspicions that, even
now, some members of the Justice Department are not telling the
full truth about the Branch Davidian incident:
</P>
<P>
   As I have watched the responses made by the Department of
Justice to the recent Davidian evidence controversy, I have formed
the belief that facts may have been kept from you _ and quite
possibly are being kept from you even now, by components of the
Department. ...
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, an independent filmmaker from Colorado named Mike
McNulty began making requests to view the evidence. He contacted
the Public Affairs section of the Department of Justice and he
contacted me ... Bret Brandenburg and I ... both had some
reservations about dealing with Mike McNulty, in part because of
his first film, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement.'' I felt at the time
that the film was inaccurate, if not irresponsible. However, I
expressed to Mr. Brandenburg that to stonewall McNulty tended to
lend some credence to his already held belief that the government
had something to hide. Because much of the evidence which McNulty
sought to view had been in the public domain at trail, and because
McNulty was not a litigant, I believed that some reasonable but
limited access should be granted him.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his observation of the evidence, Mike McNulty began to
believe that the FBI had fired some sort of 40 millimeter
projectile which could have started the fire on April 19, 1993. He
had stated to me that in November of 1998, he wrote a letter to the
FBI alleging facts in connection with the 40 millimeter projecti--
es.
</P>
<P>
   On a Saturday morning in June of 1999, I received a telephone
call at my home from DOJ Torts Branch lawyer Marie Hagen. Ms. Hagen
was extremely upset with me. She demanded to know whether or not I
had allowed Mike McNulty to view the Davidian evidence ... I
responded ... that the permission to do so had come from the Chief
of Public Affairs and that I figured that he had checked with the
necessary folks before allowing me to coordinate with McNulty. She
ended the conversation unquenched in her anger. I think that I now
know why. ...
</P>
<P>
   In mid-June of this year, I received a letter from an attorney
for the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) ... The attorney
stated that the DPS desired to cease being custodians of the
Davidian evidence. ... Wisely, the chairman of the DPS Commission
asked the Rangers to take stock of the evidence before it was
released. ... After some initial work, certain ``40 millimeter
evidence'' became the focus of their inquiry. ... Pretty soon, a 40
millimeter shell casing marked ``M-118'' and a photograph of a grey
projectile with a red stripe became very significant. As soon as
their significance was even suspected, I notified my U.S. attorney,
in writing, of what was going on. Soon, it was determined that the
casing had been fired by the FBI on April 19, 1993 _ by their own
admission. The admission had been made to the Rangers in 1993 or
1994. The Rangers simply didn't understand the significance of the
casing at that time. The full significance was figured out by the
Rangers just in the past couple of weeks. The photo of the
projectile mentioned above shows what the Rangers now know is an
M-651 pyrotechnic tear gas round. ...
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a fax which originated with the Department of Justice
came to me. ... The first (page) was a copy of handwritten notes
which apparently had been written by paralegal who assisted in the
Davidian trial preparation. The notes were of an interview of an
FBI agent which was probably conducted in 1993. The notes reflect
that the agent said that he fired ferret rounds and a ``military
gas round.'' ... The third page of the fax was an FBI report of an
agent who had heard radio traffic about a military round being
fired. ...
</P>
<P>
   I mentioned above that I think that I understand why Marie Hagen
was so upset that I had worked with Mike McNulty in allowing him
access to Davidian evidence. I believe that the three pages faxed
to me last week hold the answer. At the top of the typewritten
document, someone has written, ``privileged.'' At the bottom, it
appears that someone wrote, ``DOJ witness do not discuss.'' It
appears that someone was making decisions about whether the
plaintiffs in the civil case, or others, should have access to
these documents. It is my own hypothesis that the Torts Branch has
had these documents for years and that they decided not to make
them available to the plaintiffs. The Torts Branch or some other
component also apparently decided not to let you know about these
documents. Certainly, as attention focused in the past year on the
fire issue, the full import of these documents must have been known
to whomever possessed them. ...

LIFE IS BUT A DREAMCAST, BUT IS THAT ALTOGETHR BEST?

   We've got it on good information that if Mike Shanahan allows
Brian Griese to play the whole game tonight against Miami, then
Denver will pull out a 29-24 victory with 42 seconds left _ only
because of a dropped pass in the end zone on the Dolphins' final
play.
</P>
<P>
   Our source: Sega Dreamcast's new ``NFL 2K'' ($49.95) video game,
which is about as close to reality as something like this can get.
</P>
<P>
   We appreciate the realism that video games have been able to
offer over the last several years. But Sega's amazing Dreamcast
system ($199) with 128 bit graphics _ twice as many as Nintendo 64,
for those who can do the math _ brings us to the not-so-virtual
line in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   When is it get TOO real?
</P>
<P>
   It might be too real when you let the computer take its
information, set up a ``Monday Night'' matchup between Denver and
Miami, and watch something that lacks only Al Michaels and Boomer
Esiason's comments between plays.
</P>
<P>
   It can be downright spooky. But in a pretty neat way, the game
lives up to its hype.
</P>
<P>
   Stacked up against the other current NFL video games _ Sony
PlayStation's ``NFL GameDay 2000'' and ``Madden NFL 2000'' and
Nintendo 64's ``NFL Quarterback Club 2000'' _ the Sega entry stands
far above. It not only mirrors each team's style of play and
play-calling tendencies, it has added features such as all 31 NFL
stadiums in accurate 3D models, college alumni teams, more
realistic audio, high-level-player detailing and a
performance-equalization option that allows mismatched teams to
have equal abilities that none of the others have. A 56k modem is
included to let game players hook into a PC and play others.
</P>
<P>
   One reason it looks so impressive is that runs at 60 frames a
second. A regular TV only runs at 30. It has 1,600 motion-captured
moves. Most others have about 400.
</P>
<P>
   About the only way this can be more realistic is if they'd add
the instant-replay system and allow the virtual coaches to contest
calls.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't go that far, for which we're thankful. &QL;

   &UR; By PAMELA MENDELS  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   GOSHEN, N.Y. -- While other teen-agers were enjoying the
dwindling vacation days of late summer, Mario Rangel was sitting in
front of a laptop computer, trying to memorize the capitals of
Europe for an on-line geography class.
</P>
<P>
   Mario's father is a migrant farm worker, one of many who travel
each year from southern Texas to Orange County, N.Y., areas rich in
black-dirt fields of onions, lettuce and other crops. For youths
like Mario and his siblings, the stay up north, about an hour and a
half from Manhattan, is an exciting time to renew summer
friendships cultivated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But the migrant life can take a heavy toll on their educations.
</P>
<P>
   Students like Mario almost inevitably lose time in the classroom
when they shuttle between states with different school calendars.
Those who leave Texas for New York in late May, for example, may
find it little use to sign up for the last few days or weeks of New
York's school year, especially since much of that time is given
over to test taking.
</P>
<P>
   And since curriculums and course schedules also vary widely
among states, migrant children who take classes out of state
frequently find themselves several steps behind their classmates
when they return home in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Mario, who dreams of becoming an electrical
engineer, is participating in a program that gives the teen-age
children of migrant farm workers laptop computers to use in taking
classes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get the class over with on line, I can do something
else in school instead of feeling like I have to catch up,'' said
Mario, who is studying world geography.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old project, known as Estrella (``star'' in
Spanish), is paid for with a $400,000 grant from the United States
Department of Education. It seeks to use technology to alleviate a
pressing problem among a group of high school students whose
dropout rate is about 50 percent: lack of continuity in schooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to get kids graduated,'' said Robert E. Lynch,
coordinator of the program in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said, the program seeks to give children
from poor homes a familiarity with computers that middle-class
children with personal computers in their bedrooms take for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 50 teen-agers from Texas who migrate to New York,
Illinois and Montana are taking part. They and their families are
given lessons in how to use the equipment before they leave Texas.
They also sign a contract pledging to devote at least seven hours a
week to their classes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teen-agers in Montana and Illinois, and a smaller
number in New York, work in the fields during the day and carve out
time at night to do their studies, usually in school buildings with
the phone lines necessary for computer modems.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, many of the students do their lessons
from their homes -- often crowded, ramshackle housing that the
program equips with telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, most of the 35 students who participated
in the program's first year completed the classes, which are
offered in subjects ranging from algebra to world history,
according to Brenda R. Pessin, who oversees Estrella as part of her
job as director of migrant education services for the nonprofit
Illinois Migrant Council.
</P>
<P>
   For three failing middle-school students, she added, taking and
passing the on-line course meant they could advance to the next
grade when they returned to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If Mario, 15, successfully completes the course and its
follow-up tests, he receives credit at his school in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The courses are offered through NovaNET, an on-line education
company that sells its services to school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Students are given bite-size chunks of lessons, sometimes
accompanied by video clips, charts and other multimedia graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons include drills, quizzes and instructional games. Mario's
geography course, for example, included a crossword puzzle about
rivers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Each unit of study generally ends in an on-line test that must
be passed before the student can go to the next unit.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella students decide what courses to take after consulting
with guidance counselors at their schools in Texas and, in some
cases, New York.
</P>
<P>
   While they are logged on, students are generally on their own --
there are usually no teachers to join them on line to answer
questions or discuss their work. But there is some oversight. From
her computer, Nancy Fernandez, a staff worker in a migrant
education outreach program for the mid-Hudson area, can determine
how much time students have devoted to their studies.
</P>
<P>
   She also meets in person with each student each week to chat,
discuss problems and act as a gentle prod if any of them begin to
slow down in their school work.
</P>
<P>
   Students can also turn to the project's Texas-based Web master,
who manages the project's technical aspects, for technical help.
</P>
<P>
   The service does not come cheaply. At close to $8,000 per
student, the program causes some educators to wonder whether the
money would not be better used to match students with
flesh-and-blood teachers. ``Maybe it's the best we can do, but I
think it's sad that we don't see the need for getting teachers more
closely involved with these kids,'' said Lowell W. Monke, an
assistant professor of education at Grinnell College and the
co-author of a book, to be published next year, that examines
classroom Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Sloan, a professor at Columbia University's Teachers
College, said the program risked being a Band-Aid for a serious
social ill. ``It promises to solve a problem without addressing the
real nature of the problem involved -- an exploitative labor
system,'' Professor Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Estrella's organizers respond that the program exists to give
the participants a means to escape migrant life. ``We are providing
the migrant youth with education and skills so they can make a
choice,'' Mr. Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also say it would not be possible to hire all the
specialty teachers needed for the many subject areas taught in high
school. And, they say, they try to build human contact into the
program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a ``cyber-mentor'' E-mail correspondence program
pairs the teen-agers with college students.
</P>
<P>
   To Gary Chapman, a social policy researcher at the University of
Texas who has criticized some computer-based education as little
more than technological glitz, Estrella makes sense. ``This is one
example where you get the thing that technology is good for --
shifting time and space -- where it might actually help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some students find that on-line instruction is not enough. Mr.
Lynch and Ms. Fernandez are considering finding a tutor to help one
Estrella student who did well with an on-line English course last
year but is struggling this summer with algebra.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mario, a lean, soft-spoken young man with a trace
of a mustache, says the project has its ups and downs. ``If you
don't understand something, you can't ask teacher,'' he noted. But
he added that he liked working at his own pace, adding, ``You can
concentrate more and take your time, as much as you need.''

HABIBIE BOWS, WILL ALLOW FOREIGN TROOPS IN EAST TIMOR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Declaring that ``too many people have lost
their lives,'' President B.J. Habibie ceded to mounting outside
pressure and threats of diplomatic sanctions Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, and
consented to the deployment of UN-sanctioned troops in the
violence-wracked territory of East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The international community welcomed the about-face, with
Australia volunteering to deploy forces within days and the United
States offering support troops. But Indonesian officials put
conditions on the deployment that could delay the arrival of a
force for weeks, and that could leave the door open for further
killings, destruction and a humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Monday morning in New Zealand, President
Clinton said, ``The most important thing is for President Habibie
to make good on this statement, get the details worked out and get
the force in in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Major General Sudrajat, an
Indonesian armed forces spokesman, said that Indonesia was ``not in
a rush'' to receive troops, and that it expected UN approval and
deployment to take at least two weeks. He underscored that Jakarta,
which faces nationalist sentiment against foreign troops, ``has the
prerogative to select which one will coordinate . . . and which
countries we would like to join a peacekeeping force.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in contrast, said Indonesia should have no say over the
composition of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps'' the Indonesian military ``should have some parallel
presence even, but they should not be able to say who is in or not
in the force and what the structure . . . will be, otherwise it
will raise all kinds of questions about whether there will be
integrity in the force and it will also delay the implementation,''
Clinton said in Auckland, where he is attending the annual
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit. The East Timor
crisis has dominated the agenda at APEC.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds, if not thousands, of East Timorese civilians,
including some nuns and priests, have been slaughtered by
pro-Indonesia forces in the week since the announcement of a
landslide vote for independence in the disputed territory.
Indonesia declared martial law in East Timor on Sept. 7, but the
soldiers who are supposed to enforce peace are accused of
participating in the rampages.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the White House cut off arms sales and military
aid, and over the weekend threatened economic and commercial
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In a live televised address Sunday night after a three-hour
Cabinet meeting, Habibie told his nation that outside forces were
needed because ``too many people have lost their lives . . . lost
their homes and security. We cannot wait any longer. We have to
stop the suffering and mourning immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the UN secretary general to inform him about our
readiness to accept international peacekeeping forces through the
UN from friendly nations to restore peace and security in East
Timor,'' Habibie said in the presidential palace, as his Cabinet
and generals stood by.
</P>
<P>
   Australia has offered to deploy 4,500 troops and lead forces
from ``willing nations'' until a UN force is ready to deploy this
year. Clinton said Australia would carry the ``lion's share'' of
the peacekeeping burden, while the United States would, with the
approval of Congress, provide logistical support such as transport,
communications and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   US troops are already involved in operations in Kosovo, Bosnia,
Haiti and the Sinai Desert.
</P>
<P>
   But Sudrajat said that it would be ``very difficult'' to accept
Australian forces, because of their ``political meddling. They
intervene in our policy too much. Asian forces might be more
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore and Cambodia have
offered to contribute to an international force, as have Britain,
Portugal and others.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, the one nation ready to lead a force, is just 400
miles south of East Timor and home to a significant East Timorese
exile community. Sudrajat said flag-burnings and protests at the
Indonesian Embassy and threats against Indonesian students in
Australia have tainted opinion against Sydney, and would make it
impossible to guarantee safety of Australians if militias in East
Timor ``get angry with them.''
</P>
<P>
   An American UN civilian police officer who was shot in East
Timor last week said he had been targeted because militias and
soldiers thought he was Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony on the
southeastern end of the Indonesian island chain, in 1975, sparking
a guerrilla war and military crackdown that claimed 200,000 lives
from fighting, starvation and disease by 1980. The international
community, ironically with the exception of Australia, has never
recognized Indonesian rule there.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Habibie offered the province independence if it
rejected a plan for autonomy under continued Indonesian rule.
Nearly 79 percent of voters opted for separation on Aug. 30,
provoking a savage campaign of revenge by pro-Indonesia militiamen
aided and armed by elements of the military.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, 50 UN ambassadors condemned Indonesia for allowing
the violence in East Timor and for refusing outside help.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie treaded a fine line Sunday night to ease pressure to
accept foreign troops and nationalist sentiment against them. The
Indonesian and English texts of his address were different, with
the Indonesian ``inviting international peacekeeping forces to
assist us in restoring order with the Indonesian military in a
cooperative manner.'' The English version expressed ``readiness to
accept international peacekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign troops have not been allowed into Indonesia since it won
independence from the Dutch over 50 years ago, and Habibie, who
hopes to be renamed president by his National Assembly this fall,
is aware that inviting outside forces will be unpopular at home.
</P>
<P>
   UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said he appreciated that
Habibie's announcement ``was a very difficult decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats in Jakarta called Habibie's announcement a slap in the
face for the Indonesian military, an admission that they were
unable to control rampaging civilian militias or their own rogue
forces who aided them.
</P>
<P>
   Sudrajat denied that it was ``an offense'' to the military,
insisting, ``We have carried out our duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we were unable to control the situation, but we
have to wait for the right time. If we wanted to stop it within two
days, we'd have to kill the people'' suspected of mob violence, he
said. ``We cannot just open machine guns against them. . . . These
people have become family.''
</P>
<P>
   After 24 years of arming and allying with pro-Indonesia civilian
militias against separatist guerrillas, troops in East Timor have
``to change our paradigm, and acknowledge'' the separatist
guerrillas ``who used to be our enemy as our friend. . . . It's
very difficult to keep neutral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said members of two batallions of East Timorese soldiers
aided friends in militias or guerrillas in the last week. He said
the approximately 900 East Timorese soldiers were transferred to
West Timor to ``keep them neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat in Jakarta said Sunday that he was ``fairly
skeptical'' of Habibie's offer. ``His announcement was clear this
would be in cooperation with the Indonesian armed forces, and not a
replacement for them. . . . They are going to want to save face and
not to take a back seat to forces coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-nation UN Security Council must approve any UN force, and
can do so only after a five-ambassador delegation that visited
Jakarta and Dili last week returns to New York. Indonesian Foreign
Minister Ali Alatas departs for New York Monday to negotiate the
details of a force.

   &UR; By BOB TEDESCHI &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   Life was much easier for E-commerce companies when their primary
focus was on acquiring customers. They could simply take the
company public, spend huge sums on advertising then wait for the
customers to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Things became messy when shoppers actually arrived. Suddenly,
E-commerce executives realized that managing online sales could be
as difficult as managing offline merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise returns, in particular, have been nettlesome for
Internet stores, especially those without previous experience in
catalog or traditional retailing. Analysts and executives say
E-commerce sites have not done enough to give customers the same
confidence in their return policies as offline merchants do and
have been slow to devise effective systems for refunds and
exchanges. In short, they say, if Internet retailers want to
attract more return customers, they are going to have to deal
better with returns by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling returns is a complicated process that can't be
standardized the same way as outbound shipments,'' said James
Vogtle, an E-commerce research director with Boston Consulting
Group. ``And it's a process that's not getting the attention it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For every $100 in goods an E-commerce company ships, $5 worth is
returned, according to a recent study by Boston Consulting in
conjunction with Shop.org, an Internet retailing trade group. That
5 percent rate compares favorably with that of direct marketing
companies, which have return rates of 5 percent to 7 percent, as
well as traditional retailers, whose returns total 6 percent of
sales, according to the National Retail Federation. But the
comparison is also somewhat misleading because a large percentage
of Internet commerce is made up of items like books and CDs, which
have low return rates.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is not the number of returns, but how those
returns are being handled. Analysts and executives say customers
are often subjected to poor customer service when trying to make
returns, resulting in delayed exchanges or mishandled refunds.
Because most sites require customers to pay for shipping items back
to the retailer, the process can be costly, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These problems are reflected in two surveys conducted among more
than 2,000 Internet users by Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm. In one survey in which Internet shoppers ranked
their top 12 sources of dissatisfaction with E-commerce sites the
fifth-greatest concern was returning merchandise. In the other
study, also conducted by Jupiter, 40 percent of those surveyed
indicated they would buy more on line if they could return items
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have retailers been frequently caught off guard by the
volume of orders received, but, says Ken Cassar, a Jupiter analyst,
E-commerce sites often cede control of fulfilling orders -- as well
as handling returns -- to outside companies. ``When things do go
wrong, a vast majority of the time it's because there's a gap in
the seams between various parties,'' Cassar said. ``The fewer times
the baton is passed, the greater the chances are for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly, an online
retailer of clothing and housewares, says the company sees a return
rate for clothing ``in the low 20 percent range'' -- nearly 10
points below the catalog rate for apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefly, which uses a third-party to handle orders and returns,
manages the return process in several steps. After a customer calls
and indicates a problem, the item is shipped back at the company's
expense, using a United Parcel Service packing slip included with
each item delivered. The item is inspected when it arrives, and the
customer's account is credited ``within a week of them sending
it,'' Morris said. The fulfillment center repackages and restocks
items that are in perfect condition; imperfect items are either
repaired or discarded.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that no orders are mishandled, Bluefly ``is all over
the fulfillment house,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We manage them really closely,'' he said, ``and treat them
like they're virtual employees.'' Of returns in general, he added,
``This is definitely the less-sexy side of the business, but it's
as important -- if not more important -- than any other aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Brooks, chief executive of Furniture.com, an
Internet-only retailer, said that because the cost of returned
furniture -- and dissatisfied customers -- was so high, the company
designed its Web site to insure that customers made the right
choice. ``The best way is to make the customer as educated as
possible about what they're getting,'' Brooks said, adding that
Furniture.com's return rate is materially lower than that of
catalog companies, though he would not disclose a specific rate.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture.com's Web site enables customers to view photos of an
item from a number of angles, use a room-design option to see how
it would fit with their current furniture and e-mail or speak to
design consultants and have fabric swatches sent to them free. Once
the furniture is shipped, customers can hold the furniture for a
week before returning it -- at no cost. The only catch: customers
get a store credit, not a cash reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing companies like Lands' End and Levi Strauss are also
improving their sites with modeling technology that allows
customers to indicate their physical dimensions and receive
guidance on what size to order.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to accepting returns, perhaps the best option
is one that remains unreachable for companies that operate only on
line -- namely, physical stores. The Gap and Federated's Macy's,
for instance, accept returns of merchandise at their stores even
when items are purchased on line -- a policy that is not shared by
many Internet retailers who have physical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Kapp, vice president for special markets and new media at
Estee Lauder, which includes the Clinique Web site, agreed there
was a benefit in allowing customers to return items to a physical
store. She said Estee Lauder customers could do so as long as the
department store in which the company's products were sold allowed
it.
</P>
<P>
   But that option has limits, Ms. Kapp said. ``What if you live 20
miles away, or you don't feel like going to the mall?'' she asked.
``Isn't that the reason why they got on line in the first place?''

   &UR; By BOB TEDESCHI &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)
</P>
<P>
   Life was much easier for E-commerce companies when their primary
focus was on acquiring customers. They could simply take the
company public, spend huge sums on advertising then wait for the
customers to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Things became messy when shoppers actually arrived. Suddenly,
E-commerce executives realized that managing online sales could be
as difficult as managing offline merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise returns, in particular, have been nettlesome for
Internet stores, especially those without previous experience in
catalog or traditional retailing. Analysts and executives say
E-commerce sites have not done enough to give customers the same
confidence in their return policies as offline merchants do and
have been slow to devise effective systems for refunds and
exchanges. In short, they say, if Internet retailers want to
attract more return customers, they are going to have to deal
better with returns by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling returns is a complicated process that can't be
standardized the same way as outbound shipments,'' said James
Vogtle, an E-commerce research director with Boston Consulting
Group. ``And it's a process that's not getting the attention it
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For every $100 in goods an E-commerce company ships, $5 worth is
returned, according to a recent study by Boston Consulting in
conjunction with Shop.org, an Internet retailing trade group. That
5 percent rate compares favorably with that of direct marketing
companies, which have return rates of 5 percent to 7 percent, as
well as traditional retailers, whose returns total 6 percent of
sales, according to the National Retail Federation. But the
comparison is also somewhat misleading because a large percentage
of Internet commerce is made up of items like books and CDs, which
have low return rates.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is not the number of returns, but how those
returns are being handled. Analysts and executives say customers
are often subjected to poor customer service when trying to make
returns, resulting in delayed exchanges or mishandled refunds.
Because most sites require customers to pay for shipping items back
to the retailer, the process can be costly, as well.
</P>
<P>
   These problems are reflected in two surveys conducted among more
than 2,000 Internet users by Jupiter Communications, an Internet
research firm. In one survey in which Internet shoppers ranked
their top 12 sources of dissatisfaction with E-commerce sites the
fifth-greatest concern was returning merchandise. In the other
study, also conducted by Jupiter, 40 percent of those surveyed
indicated they would buy more on line if they could return items
easily.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have retailers been frequently caught off guard by the
volume of orders received, but, says Ken Cassar, a Jupiter analyst,
E-commerce sites often cede control of fulfilling orders -- as well
as handling returns -- to outside companies. ``When things do go
wrong, a vast majority of the time it's because there's a gap in
the seams between various parties,'' Cassar said. ``The fewer times
the baton is passed, the greater the chances are for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly, an online

repaired or discarded.

 &HT;    Falcons left `warming up' while Vikings take win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Vikings won against the Falcons on Sunday because
they dominated the middle of the field, got three turnovers to
none, and the worst penalties of the game went against Atlanta at
terrible times.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings turned the tables and played Falcons-style football,
winning the time of possession battle by more than six minutes
against a team that last year led the league in that category.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first quarter, wide receiver Ronnie Harris
fumbled after a 20-yard gain early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Buchanan was penalized 52 yards for pass interference while
defending Randy Moss, and beaten a couple plays later on a hard
inside slant by Cris Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I battled (a sprained left) the knee,'' Buchanan said.
``Sometimes, that's the way the game goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Dwight fumbled the kickoff, hurling himself into a left
wedge after taking a kickoff four yards deep on the right side of
the end zone. Minnesota punter/kicker Mitch Berger recovered at the
Atlanta 21. Soon a Gary Anderson 36-yard field goal made it 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't make those kind of mistakes (last year),'' coach
Dan Reeves said. ``Those things are correctable, but we have to
keep working. (The mistakes) are the same things that we did in the
preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Morten Anderson missed a 35-yarder to start Minnesota's final
scoring drive, and a 24-yard pass interference penalty against
Atlanta strong safety Marty Carter helped too. Leroy Hoard's 1-yard
run with 1:48 left in the first half made it 17-0.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta raced downfield after that, and drew to within 17-7 on a
23-yard pass from Chandler to wide receiver Chris Calloway with 43
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway beat second-year Vikings cornerback Ramos McDonald with
an inside move on a post route.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, the Falcons didn't challenge McDonald much,
especially deep, even though Minnesota's safeties were guarding the
middle of the field more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had hoped to get Dwight in space, but he strained a
hamstring in pre-game warm-ups and barely played on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were re-routing us (bumping Falcon wide receivers),''
Reeves said. ``We always seemed to be going sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Falcons never got a running game going, rushing
for 81 yards on 23 carries (21 yards coming on Chandler scrambles).
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Bob Christian scored on a 1-yard dive over guard in the
fourth quarter, but Falcon running backs were stuffed up the middle
most of the day. Leading rusher Jamal Anderson had just 50 yards on
16 attempts, a 3.1-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings did it with multiple run-blitzes, and by often
playing outside linebackers a half-yard closer than usual to the
middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Minnesota challenged Atlanta to run wide.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons couldn't, and their game plan never caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get behind, you can't do certain things with your
running game,'' said right guard Gene Williams. ``We got going, but
it took us too long to get warmed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian's 1-yard run came with 13:18 left, but the Falcons had
a hard time getting the ball back, as the Vikings held the ball
33:14 to Atlanta's 26:46.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to believe the Vikings when they said they were
going to be more methodical offensively, but they were Sunday.
Quarterback Randall Cunningham didn't throw for big yardage (184
yards), but he completed 22-of-33 passes, and Minnesota converted
9-of-17 third downs into first downs.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves complained afterward about the lack of a pass rush.
Atlanta didn't sack Cunningham, even though Minnesota had horrible
problems in the preseason protecting the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons defensive tackle Shane Dronett said that the Vikings'
plan to have wide receivers, tight ends and running backs stay in
to block, sometimes coming in motion to do so, worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pulling a lot of people back inside,'' he said. ``A
lot of times, they were running one- and two-man routes. They've
got the people to play pitch-and-catch with that kind of routine.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's chance to tie with 3:38 was wide left, as Andersen
tried to compensate for his earlier hook by aiming outside. The
ball stayed outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I hit it pretty good,'' said Andersen, who made 23
of 28 field goals last year. ``I certainly don't know, from a
technical standpoint, what I did.

 &HT;    Chandler injured as Falcons' comeback falls short
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Spotted through binoculars, the sight of Dan Reeves on
Sunday evening might have been alarming. The Falcons coach had
every right to be steamed.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Morten Andersen's 39-yard field goal try sailing
wide left with 3:38 left in the game that triggered his barking, a
laundry list of foibles made Reeves a time bomb waiting to go off.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough that his team lost 17-14 to the Vikings while making
virtually all the mistakes it had avoided on the way to the Super
Bowl last season. Add the status of quarterback Chris Chandler,
whose right hamstring could keep him out of the next game, a Monday
night affair at Dallas, and it was the worst day at the office
since Nov. 9, 1997, when Tampa Bay prevailed 31-10 in the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts any time you lose, but particularly the way we
lost,'' said Reeves, after seeing the end of streaks of 11
regular-season victories and 11 in a row at home. ``I don't know
how bad Chris's hamstring is, but he couldn't have come back in if
we got the ball back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons did get the ball back after Andersen's miss, but
only for the final play. A 32-yard screen play from Tony Graziani
to Jamal Anderson left a sellout crowd of 69,555 groaning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Falcons led the NFL in turnover ratio. Sunday,
they had three fumbles and forced no Minnesota turnovers. Atlanta
helped the Vikings to at least 10 of their points after first-half
fumbles by Chandler and kick returner Tim Dwight left Minnesota 58
and 21 yards from the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties gave the Vikings 55 of the 58 yards on the first
score, including a questionable 52-yard interference call against
cornerback Ray Buchanan, who was defending Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they called me on that one,'' Buchanan
said. ``Here I am 5-10, and Moss is 6-10 (actually 6-4), and they
say they're not going to call that (incidental contact) this year,
and they call it on the poodle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings led 17-0 at the half. Atlanta tried to recover, but
unlike the 1998 NFC Championship Game, the Falcons' Andersen missed
after the Vikings' Gary Anderson left the door open with a late
miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never brought a cape,'' said Andersen, who also missed a
35-yarder in the first half. ``I'm not Superman.

IT'S AGASSI IN (WHAT ELSE?) A COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By   ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man has shed so many skins and cycled through so
many lifetimes he seems to have a feline gene lurking somewhere,
but for 29-year-old Andre Agassi, who won the U.S. Open the hard
way Sunday, with a foray into five-set territory, the ninth and
last tennis life is his best life. He guarantees it.
</P>
<P>
   Reincarnated again, this time with a body chiseled, whittled and
polished to resemble granite and a frill-free game plan that
resembles no one else's, the balding, bold Agassi captured his
second Grand Slam title of the year, and installed himself as the
No. 1 player in the world, with a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7), 6-3,
6-2 demolition of another 29-year-old American in the midst of a
career renaissance, seventh-seeded Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you ask for anything more than two Americans in the
finals of the U.S. Open?'' said Agassi, for whom this tournament
has always been his favorite Grand Slam event. ``Win or lose, it
was a privilege to be out here; this is the greatest time in my
life,'' said Agassi, who reached three consecutive Grand Slam
finals this year and made history at the French Open when he became
only the fifth player to collect all four Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's match, his ninth career Grand Slam final and his fourth
at the Open, which he won in 1994, featured few bells and whistles
from Agassi. The trick shots, the histrionics, the celebrity
entourage are gone with the frosted hair and acid-washed denim. The
attitude was businesslike. According to him, it had to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played so well I felt like I was hanging on by a thread for
most of the match; he gave me a lot to worry about,'' said Agassi,
who hung on and around so successfully that he never lost a service
game and committed just 23 unforced errors, 37 fewer than Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any five-setter I ever played where I didn't
lose my serve,'' Agassi said after checking the statistics and
confirming that he had fended off all eight break points held by
Martin, like Agassi considered one of the most dangerous return
artists in the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   Their 3-hour-23-minute friendly confrontation, the fifth
all-American final in Open history, began in the sun-dappled and
finally humidity-free Arthur Ashe Stadium beneath a humane blue sky
and concluded under the spotlights. A pair of Americans last
reached the final in 1996, when Pete Sampras thwarted Michael Chang
for the title.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as Agassi's semifinal victim, second-ranked Yevgeny
Kafelnikov remarked with equal parts respect and resignation, is
Agassi's year. ``Without a doubt, 1999, this year belongs to him,''
Kafelnikov said.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi had to earn it. Two years ago, overweight and
under-achieving, Agassi sent himself back to the minor leagues of
tennis, the challenger circuit, to school himself on how to win
again after his ranking nose-dived to 141st. Last year he
re-established his work ethic, but despite finishing the year
ranked sixth, his Grand Slam results were desultory.
</P>
<P>
   Correcting that was his goal for 1999, and he achieved it by
mounting a comeback from a two-sets-to-none deficit to capture his
crown at Roland Garros, pushing Pete Sampras to heroic heights in
their Wimbledon final, and achieving his ultimate goal, this title
and the top ranking that came with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open is what I want,'' he declared before taking his
9-5 record against Martin into the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Agassi pranced right out and snatched an instant service break
in the opening game, where a backhand return put Martin in trouble
at 30-40 and a crosscourt backhand pass eluded Martin completely.
Agassi then sneaked away from a 0-40 deficit in the fourth game,
and, apparently in control from the backcourt, claimed the set when
Martin elbowed a backhand return into the net. But Agassi's
momentum was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who wound up wearing a hospital gown as he received
intravenous treatment after his torturous fourth-round comeback
against Greg Rusedski but made a flawless transition back to tennis
whites for the next two rounds, was not about to let anything as
mundane as one lost set deter him.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two hours, and throughout two tiebreakers that
improved Martin's 1999 tiebreaker record to 25-13, Agassi could not
pry another service break away from Martin, who compensated for his
less-than-fleet lateral footwork by rushing the net and keeping the
points compact and vertical.
</P>
<P>
   In the second set's tiebreaker, Martin's first serve and
dagger-like volleys turned a 3-4 deficit to a 5-4 lead. He reached
set point with a crosscourt forehand bullet and converted his
second set point with a serve-and-volley charge that hurried Agassi
into a backhand error.
</P>
<P>
   Martin nearly skinned his nose on the net as he ducked to avoid
a decapitating overhead from Agassi to trail 0-15 in the eighth
game of the third set, then double-faulted to trail 0-30, but
Agassi again failed to use his momentum to do any lasting damage.
</P>
<P>
   They trundled into another tiebreaker, but this one was owned by
Martin from the start, where Agassi spouted a double fault, to the
finish, where Agassi, down 6-2 but seemingly indifferent to his
proximity to a two-sets-to-one deficit, swatted a careless backhand
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   And that was his wakeup call. In the fourth set, Agassi zeroed
in with his returns like a homing pigeon: he earned himself a set
point with a blistering forehand return that traced the sideline
like a guided missile, and he broke Martin for the set with a
net-clipping return that Martin blocked long.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi's eyes were saucer-sized by the fifth set, and that's how
he was seeing the tennis ball, too. Larger than life. This time
Agassi was a little stingier about keeping the momentum on his
side. He broke Martin, who had 23 aces but exited the match with a
leaden arm, at love for a 2-0 lead, and by the time Agassi had held
himself together for a 4-1 lead, he was high-stepping toward his
changeover chair like a Lippizaner. From there, it was academic:
the kinetics were all Agassi's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than a tad short,'' Martin said of his waning
efforts in the final set, where he crumbled in the face of
something he called Agassi's ``relentless pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't think of a better way to go out,'' Martin said,
``than to play a great match against a great champion.'' &QL;

 PAPERWORK FLIES OUT THE WINDOW AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GO ONLINE
 &HT;     By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco   Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Every October, some 75,000 San Francisco
business owners have to renew their city business licenses.
Traditionally, that has involved filling out a paper form and
mailing it off with a check.
</P>
<P>
   This year, if all goes well, they'll have the option of doing it
all over the Web _ including paying by credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot project, supervised by City Treasurer Susan Leal and
her staff, is an example of the latest e-trend: e-government. If it
lives up to its promise, it will eventually enable individual
citizens and businesses to deal with official forms, permits and
payments of all sorts _ from parking tickets to marriage licenses _
right from their computer screens, 24 hours a day and seven days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it won't necessarily eliminate red tape _ it'll just
convert it to digital form. But at least you won't have to wait in
line for your chance to wrestle with government bureaucracy, or
worry about mail getting delayed, lost or misfiled. And, on the
government side, doing business electronically should someday
generate substantial savings and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Computers in government, of course, are nothing new: City, state
and federal bureaucracies have been using them internally for
decades. And when the Web emerged in the mid '90s, San Francisco
and most other municipalities were quick to set up sites any surfer
could peruse.
</P>
<P>
   But those sites consisted, for the most part, of static
information: agendas, minutes, phone lists, regulations and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, e-government refers to interactive services _
mechanisms for citizens and companies not just to obtain
information, but also to transact business with public agencies.
It's the public-sector equivalent of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for San Francisco's pilot project aren't yet firm, in part
because the city and its partner in the program, consulting giant
KPMG, haven't yet signed a contract. It's possible, officials warn,
that there won't be time to implement their plan for online
business license renewals before the November 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But Leal's team has a smaller-scale fallback plan: If they can't
offer license renewals, they'll at least make it possible to order
and pay for copies of birth and death certificates on the Web this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   The next step would be to expand to online payment of water
bills and business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities and counties in the San Francisco Bay Area and
around California are also adding interactive services to their
sites:
</P>
<P>
   San Carlos already has an online ``Citizen Complaint Form,''
where residents can report potholes, burned-out lights, recurrent
traffic-law violations and anything else that's bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the city will add a page where contractors and
homeowners can file and pay for permits for simple construction
work, such as reroofing and water-heater installation. (Online
processing of permit filings complex enough to require blueprints
will come later.) And, by the end of the year, residents should be
able to sign up and pay online for Park and Recreation Department
courses and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale and Mountain View also plan to offer online filing and
payment for permits in October. Their joint effort, backed by
$100,000 in consulting services donated by Microsoft and partners,
is an offshoot of Smart Permit, a project of Joint Venture: Silicon
Valley, the South Bay public-private consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland plans to add software to its Web site that combines
police data with maps of the city, making it easier for citizens
groups as well as officials to track and analyze crime problems.
</P>
<P>
   The city is holding off on online permits for now, on the
grounds that its current file-by-fax system meets the need, but
like San Francisco, it's hoping to put its business-license renewal
forms on the Web later this year.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego County has allowed residents to pay property taxes
over the Web since March.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County Superior Court this summer began installing
ATM-inspired kiosks it calls ``Automated Court Clerks'' in malls
and public facilities. Residents can use the kiosks, which have
touch screens and receipt printers, to pay their parking tickets,
among other chores.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica, which has sponsored a free, text-only electronic
network since 1989, began offering city services such as
business-license renewal, recreation-program registration and
service-request forms on the network in the early '90s, even before
the Web arose, according to Jory Wolf, the city's manager of
information systems.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens now also have the option of carrying out these and
other transactions via the Web, and the city is in the process of
rolling out its own kiosk program.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its focus on high technology, California has no
monopoly _ and perhaps not even a lead _ in the e-government area.
</P>
<P>
   While California's Department of Motor Vehicles, for example,
has only recently begun to investigate ways the Web could keep
Californians out of its legendary lines, the equivalent agencies in
several other states already have made some services available in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has provided online (and phone-in) registration renewal
since 1997, through a program developed and run by IBM. Michigan
has a similar program, using software developed by SDR Technologies
of Westlake Village, Calif., a company that got its start
developing campaign-contribution reporting software for San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the widest range of online services, including payment
for dog licenses, excise taxes and parking tickets, is available in
Boston. That city also seems to have invested more than any other
municipality in laying a heavy-duty technical foundation for future
development of additional services: Its Web site,
www.cityofboston.com, runs on a Hitachi server powered by eight
Intel Xeon microprocessors _ the most powerful type of
PC-compatible computer in existence today.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians who don't have computers of their own will be able to
tap into services from kiosks, connected via high-speed digital
subscriber lines, that will be installed by year end, not only in
the downtown area, but also in residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who tied the knot in Las Vegas in such a rush they
forgot the paperwork, Clark County, Nev., recently began selling
copies of marriage licenses over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the e-government movement lags far behind the boom in
private e-commerce. ``The public sector in general tends to be
about 18 months behind private business in this kind of thing,''
said Payton Smith, an analyst at Federal Sources Inc., a market
research company in McLean, Va., that focuses on government
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's absolutely a trend all over the country toward
putting more services online,'' he added, ``and it's only going to
pick up speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there aren't obstacles. One is a matter of attitudes:
``Local governments are often a little conservative,'' said Terry
Bursztynsky, director of online services at the Association of Bay
Area Governments in Oakland. ``They have the citizenry looking over
their shoulders, and no one wants to be accused of wasting the
taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when public agencies decide to bring service to the Web,
they rarely operate at the fast pace known proverbially as
``Internet time.'' Joint Venture: Silicon Valley's Smart Permit
project was launched almost five years ago. And the pilot project
San Francisco expects to launch this fall is a successor to an
larger online initiative that was launched in 1997 but ``never
panned out,'' according to City Treasurer Leal.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, no doubt, is political and bureaucratic
infighting, but governments, especially at the local level, often
lack the financial and technical resources needed to build a
sophisticated e-commerce infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of EGOV13 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``These registration-and-payment applications may seem simple,
but they actually involve integrating a lot of different
components,'' said Brian Moura, assistant city manager of San
Carlos, Calif., and a longtime technology guru. ``It's been a lot
harder than we would have thought.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, though, almost everyone agrees that
e-government will be increasingly important in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be a little ahead of the curve right now,'' said Jay
Banfield, special assistant to Leal and point man for the city's
e-government initiative, ``but our constituents are demanding and
getting this kind of service from the private sector, and they're
going to expect it from us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, adding new government services should get cheaper and
easier over time. ``The hard part is now, when we have to create
the whole infrastructure,'' Banfield said. ``As we get that done,
we start to benefit from experience and economies of scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on his 20 years as Santa Monica's information-systems
manager, Wolf summed up his view of e-government: ``There's no
question, no opposition _ this is the future.''

THE ECONOMICS OF E-GOVERNMENT &HT;    By HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco   Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Over the long haul, doing business online should
produce significant savings for government.
</P>
<P>
   But the economics of e-government still can be complex. One big
issue is how to handle credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
   Just like merchants, governments have to pay for credit card
processing services. The fees vary _ they're negotiated between
city and bank _ but typically they're several percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   That might not sound like much, but it adds up to a big problem
for delicately balanced municipal budgets. And it's one that's
likely to grow as services involving larger payments move online
and more citizens and businesses take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with that problem, some government bodies add
``convenience fees'' for users paying fees online. But most
officials say they're reluctant to add such surcharges, for fear
that they'll deter usage of online services and breed resentment,
especially because the vast majority of private businesses absorb
credit card fees instead of passing them on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The volume of business on Arizona's online registration-renewal
site tripled ``overnight'' when the original $6.95 convenience fee
was eliminated last October, according to Jack Alderson of IBM's
government services group, which operates the program.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of EGOV13SI (50748 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Exactly how San Francisco will handle this problem remains to be
determined, said City Treasurer Susan Leal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, the savings generated by doing business
electronically should make it easy for governments to justify
absorbing credit card fees.
</P>
<P>
   But these savings typically don't show up at the outset. In the
early stages of an e-government initiative, development costs are
high, online transaction volume is relatively low and the staff
assigned to handling in-person or snail-mail transactions can't yet
be redeployed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the private sector, governments can't exactly turn to
angel investors or venture capitalists to help them get their
programs off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For many government entities, though, public-private
partnerships play a similar role. Microsoft and some of its
partners contributed $100,000 for a permit project in Mountain View
and Sunnyvale, Calif. IBM did all the development work for
Arizona's vehicle-registration program, and now operates it on its
own servers, in exchange for $1 per transaction and 2 percent of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Kimball, CEO of government-software developer SDR
Technologies, called such partnerships ``the only real solution''
for e-government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new model,'' he said, ``is that we develop the necessary
software, run it on our own servers and take care of all the
maintenance and upgrade hassles, all at no charge to the agency.
Our compensation is entirely transaction-based.'' The company now
runs the Federal Election Commission's campaign-finance reporting
site on that basis.
</P>
<P>
   The details of San Francisco's arrangement with consulting firm
KPMG, its partner in planning the city's upcoming e-government
pilot project, aren't yet available, but it's clear that the
company will play a central role.
</P>
<P>
   Some municipal officials, on the other hand, question such
arrangements. Frank Kliewer, manager of internetworking at
Oakland's Office of Information Technology, said ``I'd much rather
pay $12 an hour to interns from Laney College (in Oakland, Calif.)
to get what we need than create dependence on some outside
company.''

READERS STILL PREFER THE PRINTED WORD &HT;    By DAVID LAZARUS
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco   Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Remember all that talk about electronic media
making paper-based communications obsolete? Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   A report from the Boston Consulting Group predicts that paper
consumption will continue to rise worldwide and that the paper
industry will thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Web publishing will grow in prominence, and more and more
people will use e-mail. But many readers will remain reluctant to
give up their books, newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predictions about the electronic substitution of paper-based
media are often excessive,'' BCG Vice President Harri Andersson
said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that for all the practicality of electronic media,
``most paper applications provide portability and ease of use, as
well as a certain privacy of use.''
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, he tosses the notion of a paperless office in
the trash can and predicts that consumption of precut office paper
will double by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't to say that traditional media have it easy.
Newspapers in particular will have their work cut out for them as
online resources steal business, Andersson said.
</P>
<P>
   He forecasts that 15 percent of North America's 1997 newsprint
capacity will be superfluous within four years as electronic
newspapers, fax-on-demand services and online news organizations
score gains in the battle for readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The considerable information content of most newspapers,
combined with high fixed costs and the subsidizing of content by
advertising, makes them particularly vulnerable to electronic
substitution,'' Andersson said.
</P>
<P>
   His report lays much of the blame for this trend at the doorstep
of the newspapers themselves. About 200 million pages of the New
York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post now are
viewed online each month, it states.
</P>
<P>
   By 2003, the report estimates, approximately 15 percent of all
U.S. classified ads will be on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   So can trees breathe easier? Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in
Washington, D.C., observed in a recent study that paper is still
``the dominant and essential vehicle of modern communications.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal computers alone, the institute found, ``can account for
115 billion sheets of paper per year worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sweet music to Weyerhaeuser Co. in Tacoma, Wash., the
world's biggest lumber producer and manager of timberland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was widely reported that paper would go away and there'd be
a paperless society,'' said Frank Mendizabal, a company spokesman.
``That hasn't proved to be the case.''

COMMENTARY: UNDERGROUND DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Changes It's to Its in 7th graph) 
 (ms) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It could happen. I'm not saying it will happen. But
the stars are moving ever closer to a favorable alignment. A subway
line under Second Avenue in Manhattan _ a dream that has tantalized
commuters for most of this century _ is now approaching the realm
of the possible. Don't bet the mortgage just yet. The cynics and
the naysayers are still holding the high cards. But it could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are one of the unlucky thousands who ride to work
while being poked and jostled by the unruly elbows, backpacks and
umbrellas on the hopelessly and sometimes dangerously overcrowded
Lexington Avenue line, you know for sure that it should happen.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the city's subway system began 100 years ago.
William McKinley was president and Robert Van Wyck was mayor, the
first mayor of all five boroughs. The subways soon became
indispensable and shortly after World War I East Siders were being
told that a Second Avenue subway line was in their future.
</P>
<P>
   They had no idea how far in the future. For one reason or
another _ a Depression, a World War, a lack of vision, a fiscal
crisis _ the Second Avenue subway never happened. Highways and
bridges and tunnels and vast acres of parking lots materialized
during those decades. But no subway under Second Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The East Side of Manhattan was developed around the Second and
Third Avenue els,'' said Bob Yaro, executive director of the
Regional Plan Association, which is part of a coalition of civic
and business groups that is calling for work to actually get
started on creation of a Second Avenue line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the els came down, the East Side was zoned with the
understanding that there was going to be a Second Avenue subway
replacing those elevated lines. But it hasn't been built.
Consequently, the Lex is jammed well beyond its carrying capacity,
to the point where it just doesn't work. People can't get on and
off the trains. The platforms and stairs can't carry the numbers of
people that are there. It is literally approaching an unsafe
situation at the most crowded stations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s a full-scale Second Avenue line probably would
have cost a few hundred million dollars. Now it would cost several
billion. And yet, Yaro and many others are saying, ``I think its
time has come.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons to be at least somewhat optimistic. To
get the subway line built you have to have the support of top state
officials. It so happens that Gov. George Pataki very much wants to
build a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand
Central Terminal. That would keep thousands of suburban Long Island
commuters from having to travel to Penn Station on the West Side of
Manhattan and then doubling back to the East Side by subway to get
to work. (It would also add thousands of new passengers to the
daily crush of the Lexington Avenue line.)
</P>
<P>
   And it just happens that the speaker of the state Assembly,
Sheldon Silver, represents the Lower East Side, which is woefully
short of subway service and would benefit tremendously if the
Second Avenue subway were built.
</P>
<P>
   One has to keep in mind, of course, that for Silver's local
constituents to benefit, a full-length Second Avenue line would
have to be built, not the truncated 125th Street to 63rd Street
proposal being considered by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pataki, friend of the suburbanites, meet Mr. Silver, who
says he's a champion of the urbanites. Let's make a deal. If not
now, when? The number of New Yorkers using mass transit has soared
over the past couple of years. And these are the best of economic
times, with the federal, state and city governments all running
surpluses. All we need is a little vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running out of capacity to move people into the central
business district,'' said Gene Russianoff, the senior attorney with
the Straphangers Campaign, which is also part of the coalition
supporting a new subway line. ``If we want to have the jobs of a
growing economy we have to be able to get the people to them. And
we've maxed out. The Lex is at 140 percent of capacity during rush
hour. It's a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   There is wide support for the new subway line, ranging from the
Auto Club of New York to the New York City Partnership and the
Environmental Defense Fund. The stars are in alignment. All we need
is leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pataki? Mr. Silver?

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: OLD ROOTS FOR A NEW CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Russians are full of ancient admonitions about how to survive in
their proud and difficult country. One maxim that has served
entirely too well through many decades and many forms of government
suggests that ``if you are turned away at the front door, try
knocking at the back with a ruble.'' Unfortunately, such advice
still works as well today as it did over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Any Russian parent, for example, tries hard to keep a son out of
the army, where hazing, disease and ragged equipment add to the
normal hazards of war. In Moscow, which finds very few 18-year-olds
healthy enough to serve, the cost of an official exemption for
illness is $3,000 to $5,000, depending on the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   To get a new phone in Russia often requires a cash-laden
handshake. A bank loan, a government document, almost any
transaction demands a little something extra. A driver's license
costs a few hundred dollars on the street, although I know a
Russian woman who told her husband that even with his newly
purchased license, he could not drive a car until he actually
learned how.
</P>
<P>
   While the West focuses on the possibility of scandal at the
highest levels of the Russian government, most Russians would
acknowledge that any influence-buying in the Kremlin is simply a
more expensive version of their own everyday price of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, such lawlessness, on a petty or grander scale, is not
new to Russia. Corruption in the czarist days helped the communists
bring down the government over 80 years ago, and communist
corruption _ a state secret _ helped erode the Soviet Union from
within. Now, the important question is how today's corruption will
affect this latest Russian experiment with democracy and a form of
capitalism that still appears stuck in its robber-baron stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lawless state before, and it was a society completely
alienated from its government. What we have now is not very
different, except that nobody is afraid of the government anymore.
The government is weak now, and it is easier to steal from,''
explains Masha Lipman, one of Moscow's top political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   What is different, as Ms. Lipman quickly points out, is that she
can complain openly about any scandal brewing within the Kremlin
walls. Her colleagues at the news magazine Itogi can investigate
the president; they can reprint critical articles about corruption
from Western news organizations without fear of the secret police
or Siberia. This is new in Russia. This is better.
</P>
<P>
   What is also different since the Soviet Union expired eight
years ago is the elections. The Soviets held elaborately fake votes
_ with one candidate per government position. Now, a far messier
and more democratic system is being born, with elections looming
for the Duma in December and the president next year.
</P>
<P>
   This progress sometimes gets overlooked by the Western media,
ever ready with instant labels. Russia is a mafia paradise, they
conclude, a full-fledged bandit state, its opportunity for reform
and enlightenment lost forever under a sludge of bribery and
scandal. The television interviewer Charlie Rose suggested recently
that if Russia were a movie, it would be called ``Apocalypse
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Apocalypse Not,''' counters Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary
of state. Talbott, who spends a lot of his time trying to lift the
American political gloom about Russia, sees elections as the way
out of Russia's lawless state. If Russians do not respect the laws,
do not like the way their officials are conducting the nation's
business, they can change the officeholders. There is reason for
hope for a law-based society in Russia, he concludes, ``as long as
there are freely contested elections.'' This transformation, even
Talbott agrees, is going to take a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   It will also take a public will in Russia to push for such
changes in the political system. Reform is not something that
advisers from Harvard can magically create in Moscow, and the
Russians will have to figure out how to elect politicians who will
serve a larger public interest. Until then, Russian laws are as
weak as paper, and much of what Westerners label lawlessness,
Russians call survival.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ As Dr. Venton Bell, the principal of West
Charlotte High School, sat in the stands at the American Legion
Memorial Stadium here on Friday, most of his attention was focused
on whether his school's football team would beat the state
champions from Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   But Bell, 54, also had another matter on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, a federal judge had ordered the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system to end busing and stop
assigning students to schools based on race. The ruling said the
schools had eliminated ``all vestiges of past discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Charlotte became the birthplace of busing three decades
ago, West Charlotte High School has often been cited by the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district as a place where integration
was working. An all-black high school before busing began, it is
now about 75 percent black, said Bell, who graduated from West
Charlotte in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's court ruling brought up memories of the old
separate-but-unequal school system. Bell remembered when his school
made do with cast-off books and supplies from white schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``See those yellow and gold uniforms that our football players
and cheerleaders are wearing?'' he said, pointing to the brightly
clad students on the field. ``Those are our school colors today
because we used to have to take the hand-me-down old uniforms from
Harding, a white school, whose colors are yellow and gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte became the first city in the country to implement
school busing after Judge James McMillan of U.S. District Court
here ruled in 1969 that the Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools had been
intentionally operating a racially segregated system.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan ruled that busing students to schools outside their
neighborhoods was an appropriate method for achieving racial
balance. The Charlotte plan was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1971, clearing the way for school systems nationwide to implement
busing.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's ruling came in a lawsuit by white parents who claimed
Charlotte's educational policies discriminated against whites. In
his ruling, Judge Robert D. Potter of U.S. District Court here, who
had campaigned against busing as a private citizen in 1969, said
the schools had fulfilled their obligation under the original court
order.
</P>
<P>
   School officials had argued that they needed to use race in
school assignments for at least five more years because the system
had not done all it could to eliminate disparities between the
facilities at schools in black and white neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said the reactions he had seen to the ruling varied with
the generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't know what's the big deal,'' he said. ``The
people who are uptight about this are the parents. I'm sure some of
the kids were not aware what was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebony Davis, 16, was one of those who did not know why there had
been a swarm of television reporters at the school on Friday when
she got on her bus to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the first half of the football game, Ms. Davis
finally heard what all the commotion was about, and she was
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``How am I going to get to school?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Davis, who is black, and her friends, both black and
white, had heard that Charlotte was the first city in the United
States to implement school busing, they were unclear about the
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't busing started because some parents didn't have a way
to get their kids to school?'' Ms. Davis asked.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Richey, 52, a white investment banker, understood all too
well the implications of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling my daughter about the court decision,'' said
Richey, whose son and daughter attend West Charlotte High School.
``I told her that busing is going to be illegal next year. And her
reaction was, `OK, just so I don't have to leave West Charlotte.'
She loves it there.''
</P>
<P>
   Richey, a Charlotte native, was at the game to watch his son,
who is on the football team, and his daughter, who is a junior
varsity cheerleader. Until each child was in seventh grade, Richey
had sent them to a virtually all-white private school near their
suburban home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air tends to be rarefied at private schools,'' he said.
``I didn't want our kids to grow up thinking that everyone lives in
a world where their biggest decisions are whether to go to Bermuda
or Cancun for Easter break.''
</P>
<P>
   Richey said he and his family worried that doing away with
busing would deprive both blacks and whites of an important
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids have seen both sides,'' he said. ``How do you buy an
education like that?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Richey acknowledged that many white parents in
Charlotte were happy about the court ruling because they want to
keep their children in schools closer to home, and away from
inner-city children.
</P>
<P>
   And while many black parents worried that the ruling would
return Charlotte to a segregated school system, others had mixed
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Hinton, 36, a detention officer in the sheriff's
department, was at the football game with his son, a second-grader.
Busing began here when Hinton was a little older than his son is
now. He was bused to a previously all-white school at the time, and
recalled it as the first time he had been around white people.
</P>

   ``I did think it was a good thing back then,'' Hinton said. ``I
thought that predominantly white schools were better and were
getting better books. But now I really think that neighborhood
schools are best. I don't think busing works when you try to shove
integration down people's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game ended and West Charlotte won, Ebony Davis learned
that the busing ruling might mean that some of her white friends
would not return to West Charlotte next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is not really a factor for me,'' she said. ``I went to
the beach with a white friend for a week this summer. Having all
races there makes the school more diverse, and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell was mindful of the concerns voiced by opponents of the
ruling, but he said he was trying to remain hopeful about how
things would play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think busing at the time was a good thing, because there was
no other way to change things,'' he said. ``But the days of Jim
Crow and apartheid are gone. I don't think this judge's decision is
going to have a big effect _ as long as we have equal facilities at
all of our schools.''

EDITORIAL: CAMPAIGN REFORM'S MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 13:
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important election events of the current season
takes place this week, not in Iowa or New Hampshire or any other
primary state, but on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the House of Representatives votes on the
Shays-Meehan campaign finance reform bill to ban unregulated ``soft
money'' donations to political parties, regulate phony ``issue
ads'' on television and impose new fund-raising disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would curb abuses and practices at the heart of
the 1996 fund-raising scandals, appears likely to pass. But the
more votes it gets, the better the chances will be for Senate
approval of what would become the most sweeping electoral reforms
in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the political establishment have begun feeling the
pressure from voters and even donors. The Committee for Economic
Development is rounding up business leaders opposed to soft-money
donations. Gov. George W. Bush last week announced that his
campaign would list donors on its Web site, a positive step but
nothing like real reform.
</P>
<P>
   The bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays of Connecticut and
Martin Meehan of Massachusetts passed last year by a vote of 252 to
179, including 61 Republicans who broke with their party leadership
to back the bill. If supporters stand firm, the majority ought to
be just as big this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a repetition of their junkyard tactics of 1998, House
Speaker Dennis Hastert and Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, are
offering amendments and substitutes that would gut the bill's main
provisions or split the delicate coalition backing reform.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and Republicans may be tempted to waver.
Anti-abortion groups are pressuring their allies to support
amendments that would gut the legislation's regulation of
television campaign ads sponsored by independent groups.
Republicans and Democrats who favor campaign reform have urged
anti-abortion forces not to oppose the Shays-Meehan bill, but
without success. On Tuesday they need to vote for reform, in
defiance of the misguided wishes of people with whom they might
agree on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Another danger to reform comes in the form of ``poison pill''
amendments. One would throw out the whole bill if any one part of
it was declared unconstitutional. Others would increase ceilings on
donations to candidates, a premature step. Another would weaken the
ability of unions to raise money. If passed, it would drive
Democrats from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A poison pill administered by DeLay would deregulate campaign
activities as long as they were conducted on the Internet. Still
another measure would require that a candidate raise at least 50
percent of his contributions in his home state, a measure that if
passed would force blacks and other urban minorities to oppose the
underlying bill.
</P>
<P>
   The gravest danger to reform is posed by three seemingly
attractive ``substitute'' amendments pushed by Republicans that, if
passed, would supplant the Shays-Meehan bill altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The one sponsored by John Doolittle of California would repeal
all campaign limits and merely require disclosure, an obvious step
backward. Another pushed by Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas would allow
``soft money'' for state parties, a loophole that would simply
rechannel the flow of corrupt money. A third pushed by Bill Thomas
of California sounds harmless enough. It would strengthen filing
requirements and take other constructive steps. But because it is a
substitute, its passage would defeat Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   Without a campaign overhaul, the parties are sure to spend $500
million to $750 million in soft money this year, twice as much as
in the last presidential election. A ``yes'' vote on Shays-Meehan
can head off more corrupt fund raising and more scandals in the
coming election cycle. On Tuesday the House faces a test of its
members' sincerity and of whether it is listening to the public
instead of special-interest donors.

DEMANDING (undated) _ Ranks of `demanding' elders grows. One woman
called 911 and demanded that someone come make her coffee when her
family didn't show up fast enough. Others call their adult children
40 or 50 times a day, asking for everything from a back rub to help
changing a light bulb. In nursing homes, they hit the call button
every five minutes. Call them difficult, crotchety or just plain
cranky _ they are the highly vocal minority of elderly people
formally described as ``high maintenance.'' In the past, they rode
the porch rocker and yelled at passing kids, or tormented
long-suffering daughters-in-law in the privacy of the family home.
Today, social-service workers say, difficult older people are
growing in number, living longer and are increasingly separated
from their families. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A''

LIGHTRAIL (Phoenix) _ While backers ready more details for a
Phoenix-area light-rail train, other folks are leaning hard on the
brake, arguing for alternative forms of rapid transit. To them,
monorails, or Jetson-like travel pods suspEnded from a guide-rail,
or even buses that run on rubber tires but operate like a train,
are better than launching an electric train on a 17-mile track from
central Phoenix to downtown Mesa. To these dreamers, the rail plan
is nothing but an ``electric street car,'' a 19th-century rail
holdover, a rapid-transit plan that will not be rapid and won't
attract riders. But local city planners say they looked at
everything from monorails to subways and concluded that an electric
train, running at street level, is the best way to start building
rapid-transit in the Valley. They hope a train could be running by
2005. By MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A'' category.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE COMPLETE STORIES OF EVELYN WAUGH'' &QL; 
(Little, Brown, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``His style,'' said Edmund Wilson, ``has the desperate
jauntiness of an orchestra fiddling away for dear life on a sinking
ship.'' Evelyn Waugh was wicked and funny, and his fellow writers
were happy to apply the same tactics to him. Here are his works of
short fiction, 39 stories collected for the first time in hardcover
for American readers (the book was adapted from a scholarly edition
published last year in Great Britain). They include ``By Special
Request,'' in which Waugh suggests an alternative ending to his
novel, ``A Handful of Dust,'' and ``Charles Ryder's Schooldays,'' a
chapter in the life of the hero of ``Brideshead Revisited,''
published 16 years after Waugh's death. To coincide with this
volume, Back Bay Books has reissued ``Brideshead Revisited,''
``Decline and Fall,'' ``Vile Bodies,'' ``A Handful of Dust'' and
``Scoop'' in paperback. The books are like Waugh himself _
handsome, with viciously funny stories inside. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME'' &QL; 
By Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this is a LOT more about her, and it is dumbfoundingly
interesting. Houston does nothing, really, except talk about
herself in these essays, yet unlike her filmed recitations for
television's ``Sunday Morning,'' these monologues pull you in, and
before you know it, you've stayed for the duration. Maybe it's the
swagger in what she has to say, the stockpile of experience, the
competence at things that are foreign to many women, and many men,
for that matter. If you've read her short-story collections
(``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' ``Waltzing the Cat''), you know that
Houston is on intimate terms with adventure, with wilderness, with
danger, and with difficult men who thrive on all three. She has
been a hunting guide in the mountains of Alaska, and she has run so
many white-water rivers in so many countries that she can't
remember them all. She was addicted to risk for a long time, but
she's getting over it. She has a ranch now, and is learning to call
it her own. Finally, she has good friends and, it seems, a
boyfriend who goes against type. In one of these essays she takes
him winter camping and he admits that he has never slept on the
ground before. What's amazing is that she doesn't hold it against
him. Her essays are about mountains, rivers, horses, dogs, hunters
and _ we sure didn't see this one coming _ her lifelong obsession
with her weight. ``Even to this day,'' she writes, ``call me stupid
and I'll laugh in your face; call me a bad writer and I'll discuss
art with you all day long; but call me fat and you'll send me
sobbing to the bathroom, and I'll wear tent dresses for the next
six days.'' It might be the most ordinary thing we've ever heard
about Pam Houston. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``BEST SHOTS: THE GREATEST NFL PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE CENTURY'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
(DK, $30) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at Barry Sanders on Page 70,'' writes Joe Namath
in his foreword. ``Just look at his feet, his legs, his body
movement, his motion _ how his body weight is leaning so hard to
one side. Look at that right foot of his! And he's still going at
full speed, you know, he's not falling down. I mean, he's exploding
somewhere.'' It's true, you'll be impressed. Sanders, photographed
in 1995 by Allen Kee, is cutting so hard that his body is hanging
out over thin air and the twist of his pivot foot has distorted the
leather of his shoe _ AND HE'S NOT FALLING DOWN. Or look at Lynn
Swann on Page 84, making, in 1976, one of the most spectacular
catches in Super Bowl history. Or at Terry Glenn, turning to draw
in a Drew Bledsoe pass that has just emerged from a dense fog that
hides anything more than a few feet above the field. Or at
linebacker Chuck Bednarik celebrating over the prostrate form of
Frank Gifford, who looks like road kill in a helmet. There's lots
of drama here, but our favorite is a quiet photograph that puts the
others to shame. It shows, quite simply, Walter Payton running a
path created for him by his Chicago Bears teammates. It's an
understated moment that reveals football at its best _ the
precision teamwork, the finesse, the choreography of the game.
(That's the Giants' Mark Ingram on the book jacket, celebrating in
the end zone.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
``LISTEN TO THIS!'' &QL; 
By Alan Reder and John Baxter (Hyperion, $16.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reder and Baxter spent four years interviewing popular musicians
about their favorite artists and recordings. The result is this
volume, which offers educated and honest opinions (Dave Matthews
says he listens to Keith Jarrett's album, ``The Koln Concert,''
because ``it calms me down, like watching windshield wipers'')
about today's music from some of the people who know it best. The
Beatles are mentioned more than any other group or artist. Other
favorites include James Brown, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, Muddy
Waters, the Rolling Stones, John Coltrane, Otis Redding, Elvis
Presley, Charlie Parker, B.B. King, Howlin' Wolf, Jimi Hendrix,
Aretha Franklin, Miles Davis, Lightnin' Hopkins, Ray Charles and
Bob Dylan. But not all of the names are famous, so it's possible to
discover new territory for your own listening pleasure. The authors
note, for example, that Dave Matthews, Ani DiFranco and Victoria
Williams all list among their favorites ``an obscure but very
special album'' by Mary Margaret O'Hara called ``Miss America.''
The book includes a master list of artists, and its index will
inspire you, too. Among the musicians polled are Pat Metheny,
Waylon Jennings, Joan Armatrading, Vassar Clements, Michael Doucet,
Pete Seeger, Sonny Rollins, Willie Nelson, Branford Marsalis, Bobby
McFerrin, Herbie Hancock and Dr. John. &QL;

IN JEFFERSON CITY, THE PUSH TO OVERRIDE VETOES IS GAINING
MOMENTUM

   ... of a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But the section that led to the veto would allow a judge to
require defendants who are put on probation to pay a fee into a
county law-enforcement fund. The fund would be controlled by the
county sheriff, the presiding commissioner and one other elected
county official.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, Carnahan objected to the money being spent
outside the normal budget process. He complained that the bill set
no maximum fee and set no restrictions on how the money could be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   Those provisions, Carnahan wrote, create the impression that
defendants could buy probation by paying into the fund _ and that
poor defendants without the money to pay would be sent to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Caskey argued that the public is demanding that offenders bear a
greater portion of the cost of the criminal justice system. Such
funds have been used for years, he said, but judges had asked for
specific statutory authority for such fees.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers considered the potential for abuse and required the
funds to be phased out by 2002 unless reauthorized by the
legislature, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter urging an override, Caskey wrote that the bill ``is
tougher on crime while being smarter on costs associated with
wholesale incarceration for non-violent offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   Caskey last week predicted that he had the 23 votes necessary in
the Senate to override the governor's veto. He said he was
optimistic about gaining the required two-thirds support in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Steve Gaw, a Moberly Democrat, said the bill's
breadth was its chief asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several provisions were very popular in the House,'' Gaw said.
``The telemarketing-fraud section was important to the AARP.
Registration of sexual predators has wide appeal. And the
sentencing provisions helped with prison overcrowding. There is a
feeling among many members that a lot of the objections to this
bill were dealt with in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Don Lograsso of Blue Springs, however, said he
would support the veto. He called the bill ``a piece of junk'' that
would soften the penalties for some crimes. The most egregious
part, he said, was imposing fines as part of probation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are nothing but slush funds,'' Lograsso said. ``They've
had those in southeastern Missouri where they were using the money
for computers and office equipment, not law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President pro tem Ed Quick, a Liberty Democrat, said the
crime and abortion bills were the only issues he saw gaining much
support. Lawmakers, he said, had shown scant interest in
overturning vetoes of bills that would allow adults to ride
motorcycles without helmets or legalize arcade games that give out
prizes worth up to $250.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Walt Mueller of St. Louis County is drumming up
support to override the veto of a $100,000 pilot program to
subsidize the cost of traveling to visit prison inmates. Mueller
said the program would reduce recidivism by keeping inmates in
touch with their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan, however, called the spending a questionable use of
state funds and said the amount was inadequate to fund a statewide
project.
</P>
<P>
   Gaw said Mueller's effort did not seem to have gained widespread
support. But the bill had attracted an unusual following of House
members on the far right and far left.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Harry Wiggins of Kansas City said he might call
for veto overrides on two bills that would create, among several
specialty license plates, one for ``Respect Life.'' The bills also
would create a state Respect Life Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan vetoed both bills, saying the legislation violated the
state Constitution, which requires bills to pertain to only one
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of a license-plate bill to create a lobbying
organization is inappropriate,'' the governor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins said he planned to meet Tuesday with the House sponsor,
Democrat Patrick O'Connor of St. Louis County, to discuss whether
to mount an override bid. In this veto session, even motor vehicles
can't escape the abortion divide.

 KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _As the war of words over abortion escalates
heading into the Missouri General Assembly's annual veto session
this week, several lawmakers are quietly pushing to override vetoes
dealing with crime, prison inmates and even specialty license
plates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the efforts are considered longshots. But several
lawmakers said the momentum generated by the campaign to override
the abortion-bill veto has scratched the veneer of invincibility
around Gov. Mel Carnahan, who has never had a veto tossed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a fever,'' said Democratic Sen. Harold Caskey of
Butler. ``Once you get one override, you may get a steamroller
effect. It depends on the psychological mix at the time, whether
people are worked up and what the governor's reaction is.''
</P>
<P>
   The veto session, which begins Wednesday, will be convened to
consider only the nine measures Carnahan vetoed last legislative
session.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers recognize that overrides are almost unheard of in
Missouri. The legislature has overridden only two vetoes this
century and only six in state history. And with the exception of
1833, no Missouri legislature has ever rejected more than one veto
in a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, both chambers are controlled by a slim majority of
Democrats, who are loath to override a governor of their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sifford, Carnahan's chief of staff, said he was confident
that the legislature would back the governor on eight of the nine
bills he vetoed and on all of the individual items struck from
appropriations bills. The ninth bill, which would ban the late-term
procedure often referred to as ``partial birth'' abortion, is too
close to call, Sifford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've obviously got a full-court press on, but we have no feel
for which way it's going,'' he said. ``A lot of people are
undecided, but we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a veto session dominated by the emotionally charged
abortion debate, no issue can avoid being caught in the whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that appears to have the next-best chance of an
override is a crime bill that Caskey championed. Several lawmakers
said abortion opponents are trying to ease anxiety about overriding
the governor on the abortion bill by suggesting lawmakers split the
difference: Override on abortion and sustain on the crime bill.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he heard that argument in the Senate. But the
House, where he said he was doing most of his lobbying, was less
inclined to link the two measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``House sponsors of the crime bill have indicated to me that
they are not into vote-swapping on the abortion bill,'' Carnahan
said. ``The best lobbying against a bill is to talk about its
problems. That's what I'm doing, and people are listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Ronnie DePasco, a Kansas City Democrat,
said it would be nearly impossible to override two vetoes. But
lawmakers are in a feisty mood. If the override attempt on the
abortion bill fails, an override on the crime bill becomes more
likely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The crime measure, Senate Bill 335, is the combination of
several bills dealing with a wide range of criminal issues. The
bill originally was aimed at easing prison crowding by reducing
sentences for nonviolent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the legislative process, the bill had sections
that would regulate telephone marketing; let judges, police and
prosecutors carry concealed guns; require sexual predators to be
listed on the Internet; stop the sale of bootleg cigarettes; and
make it a crime to leave the scene of a shooting.

EARLY PRESIDENTIAL POLLS INDICATE DEMOCRATS FACE TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a 1995 White House reception, Ohio Democratic
Party Chairman David Leland guaranteed President Clinton that his
state's 21 electoral votes would be in his column again the
following year.
</P>
<P>
   This at a time when Ohio appeared to be soured on Clinton and up
for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were you sober at the time?'' Leland's friends joked later.
</P>
<P>
   But Leland was not just talking the party line. Clinton won
Ohio, as well as a host of other battleground states. All had been
in doubt for the Democrats as they headed into 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Now the political map looms just as large, as Ohio again
presents a challenge for the Democrats. The same holds for
Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois and Pennsylvania, to say
nothing of Iowa, Kentucky, Arkansas and Louisiana. These 10 swing
states could decide the 2000 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore ticket won them all in 1996 and 1992. But based
on current polling, they are all leaning toward Republican Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls also show that if the election were held today, the
Democratic presidential candidate _ whether Vice President Al Gore
or Bill Bradley _ could have trouble even in friendly territory
like California, New York and New Jersey, although Bradley, a
former senator from New Jersey, does well there. Without that trove
of electoral votes _ 102 in all _ a Democrat would be hard-pressed
to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   How seriously should these polls be taken?
</P>
<P>
   ``I use these early polls as a political weather vane to tell
you the shifting winds,'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican
pollster. ``It's kind of a reflection of the national mood.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barone, an author of /{The Almanac of American
Politics,/} divides the country into distinct political regions,
based on political trends: Democrats seem most solid in the
northeast corridor and the Pacific rim; Republicans hold sway in
much of the South, the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains and the
desert states.
</P>
<P>
   Carved up like that, the map shows the two parties close to
parity in electoral votes. If the 2000 election holds to form, each
party would draw about 200 electoral votes from their strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   With 270 electoral votes needed to win, victory lies in the
middle _ in chunks of the Rust Belt, the heartland and the South,
in possibly 10 states that control 136 votes.
</P>
<P>
   And despite polls that give Bush widespread support, Barone
said: ``The more fertile way to look at it is we've got a real even
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Newhouse put it: ``Everybody realizes that this election
is not going to be as one-sided as the polls are right now. Nobody
is taking these numbers with more than a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Anxious Democrats _ and there are many _ might also take comfort
in recalling that at this time four years ago, the political
geography appeared nearly as daunting. Then, as now, Republicans
had more states leaning their way as they handicapped their White
House chances.
</P>
<P>
   So what must Democrats do to replay history? And can they?
</P>
<P>
   Past is not necessarily prologue in presidential politics, but
history does provide cautionary guidance. ``The person who led at
this point in the race is usually the person who lost,'' said
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, who works for the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Early polls showed President Bush beating Clinton in the 1992
campaign, Michael Dukakis beating Bush in 1988, Walter Mondale
beating President Reagan in 1984 and President Carter beating
Reagan in 1980, Mellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are familiar with the roster of failed front-runners
and insist that they are not overconfident. But they also do not
believe that Democrats can count on a repeat of the big public mood
swing that occurred between 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, a Bush political adviser and former executive
director of the Christian Coalition, said Republicans allowed
themselves to be blamed for the two government shutdowns that
angered the public. The Republican nominee, former Sen. Bob Dole,
paid the price.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a similar budget blowup occurs this year, Reed said,
``it will be lot more difficult to tie Governor Bush to that. In
the voter's mind, there's not really a connection. He's not doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that shift in mood toward Clinton, bolstered by an
extensive advertising effort against Dole when he had little money
to respond, that boosted the Democratic ticket in the battleground
states in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That Gore, the current Democratic front-runner, is struggling _
even as the economy continues to soar and the president continues
to remain popular _ is a source of frustration to supporters. Early
polls show that Bush is even beating him in an unshakable
Democratic bastion such as Massachusetts, the only state George
McGovern carried in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, Gore's campaign press secretary, said that the poll
numbers were misleading and that his numbers would turn around as
the campaign progressed and voters understood better what he would
do as president.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, and even some worried Democrats, say the vice
president is a victim of ``Clinton fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy the way it is, this should be a walk for the
vice president,'' said Ron Kaufman, White House political director
in the 1992 campaign for President Bush, the governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman knows something about the vagaries of presidential
politics and public opinion, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 14 to 15 months away from the election,'' he said. ``We
don't even have nominees. My guess is, lots can happen. Being the
person who took President Bush from 91 points in the polls to 37
points in the polls, I can say that.''

DEAL WOULD GIVE OVERLAND PARK COMPANY FOOTHOLD IN GOVERNMENT
PURCHASING 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ The company that helped put the state of
Kansas on the Internet is planning to revolutionize the way
government agencies do their purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   National Information Consortium, with headquarters in Overland
Park, plans to purchase a Reston, Va., Internet software company
for about $30 million. The company, eFed, has developed a
purchasing system that claims to cut the administrative costs of
government purchasing by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement are expected to be announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   National Information Consortium has developed Web sites for nine
states, including Kansas. The company specializes in helping
government agencies develop Internet sites that allow businesses
and consumers to do business with the state online.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, for example, the company developed the Information
Network of Kansas, which allows businesses, professionals and
consumers to do everything from look up court records to purchase
hunting licenses online.
</P>
<P>
   NIC plans to use eFed to expand the services it offers
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, eFed works with purchasing agents in nine federal
agencies, and has been working to develop contracts with some state
agencies. The company, which is expected to have profits of $5
million in 1999, is growing at a rate of more than 100 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
   It currently costs taxpayers an average of more than $100 in
administrative costs alone each time a federal purchasing agent
places an order, according to eFed statistics. The company contends
it can reduce the time and cost by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a purchasing agent interested in buying 10 new
personal computers for an agency currently might page through a
catalog or surf the Web sites of three or four computer
manufacturers. The eFed software creates a catalog of more than 1
million products and updates the prices each time a buyer accesses
the software.
</P>
<P>
   It also allows the purchasing agent to buy online with a federal
purchase card, cutting several steps out of the process.
</P>
<P>
   Reston-based Electric Press, a privately held Internet
publishing company, currently owns eFed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of NIC and eFed declined to comment on the deal.
Sources close to the negotiations said the agreement calls for NIC
to pay Electric Press $15 million and 600,000 shares of the
Overland Park company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   NIC stock closed Friday at $24.12 a share, up $3.81 for the day.
That makes the deal worth about $29.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   NIC was formed about nine years ago and went public on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold 13 million shares at $12 a share, raising about
$156 million. The company stock since has doubled, and the
company's stock on Friday was valued at $1.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   NIC is expected to have revenues of about $53 million during the
current fiscal year.

 ClINTON FAULTS MALAYSIA ON REPORTER'S JAILING 
 (ms) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two days after a Canadian journalist began serving a six-week
sentence in Malaysia for slandering the country's court system,
President Clinton criticized the Malaysian government Monday
morning for jailing a reporter for the act of reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting a journalist in jail for doing his job undermines the
press freedoms that play such a critical role in building a
democratic society,'' the president said in a statement released in
New Zealand, where he is attending the Asian economic summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Murray Hiebert, the Malaysia bureau chief of The
Far Eastern Economic Review, began serving a six-week sentence on
Saturday, after a panel of judges rejected his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that press supporters say is a heavy blow to
Malaysia's shaky press freedom, the three-member appeals court
ruled that Hiebert had slandered the judiciary by writing an
article that discussed a lawsuit by the wife of an appeals court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Tofel, a spokesman for Dow Jones &AMP; Co., which owns the
magazine for which Hiebert works, said the company was disappointed
by the ruling. ``As Hiebert has maintained in court and throughout
this case, neither he nor The Far Eastern Economic Review had any
intention to attack either the courts of Malaysia or the litigants
in any particular case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hiebert's conviction in 1997, the Malaysian authorities
have held his passport. Hiebert, 50, said he had decided to
retrieve his passport by serving out his sentence, rather than
pursuing further appeals, because he was eager to join his family
in the United States and to visit his parents in Canada. His
lawyers, however, said they would continue to seek vindication for
him.
</P>
<P>
   The article in the case was published in January 1997 in The Far
Eastern Economic Review. It discussed the growing litigiousness
among Malaysians and, as an example, recounted a widely publicized
case in which the wife of an appeals court judge sued her son's
school, claiming it had unfairly dropped him from its debate team.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit raced through Malaysia's legal system in seven
months. In the article, Hiebert quoted lawyers who questioned
whether the plaintiff's relationship to a powerful judge helped
speed the process.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who presided at Hiebert's trial, Low Hop Bing, said at
the time that the conviction was meant to send a message to the
media that disrespect for the court system would not be tolerated.

BARNES &AMP; NOBLE TO PHASE OUT USE OF TIMES BOOK LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While online booksellers wage a fierce price war over New York
Times best sellers, Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. is preparing to phase out
its use of the newspaper's weekly list at its superstores.
</P>
<P>
   In place of the Times list of books, for which Barnes &AMP; Noble
typically offers discounts, the bookseller intends to offer
bargains based on the chain's own sales rankings. Executives at
Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' leading bookstore chain, said
they would begin shifting to the system in the coming weeks. They
said they were making the change because their own sales rankings
did not always match the Times best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   Barnesandnoble.com, the Web company that the chain spun off in a
public stock offering in May, plans for now to continuing offering
discounts based on the New York Times best-seller lists, the Web
company's spokesman, Gus Carlson, said. ``We're looking at what
they've done and we're looking at our own situation,'' Carlson
said. ``The best thing to say is that we're reviewing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May, top online booksellers _ including
Barnesandnoble.com, Borders.com _ which is part of Borders Group _
and Amazon.com _ have been engaged in a fierce competition to
attract customers through 50 percent discounts on books from the
Times best-seller lists.
</P>
<P>
   And Amazon.com, after a legal dispute with The Times, struck an
agreement with the newspaper that allowed the bookseller to
continue posting the lists online. The Times had demanded that
Amazon.com stop publishing the list on its site without a licensing
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Back on terra firma, though, Barnes &AMP; Noble has decided that it
does not need the list for its bricks-and-mortar superstores.
``Frequently there were titles that we went after _ for whatever
reason _ that were selling like crazy, but were not on the New York
Times best-seller lists,'' said Alan Kahn, chief operating officer
for Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that our list that we cut every weekend reflects
more accurately what goes on in our stores,'' Kahn said. ``Any
retailer wants to sell more of what they're selling.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Barnes &AMP; Noble's top competitors said that they would
continue to use the newspaper's lists as the basis for offering
discounts. Bill Curry, a spokesman for Amazon.com, said, ``We think
it's a valuable way for customers to know the savings on
best-selling books, because it's such a well-known list.''
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Barnes &AMP; Noble's use of a different list would
make it more difficult to compare prices against the promotions of
other competitors. But Barnes &AMP; Noble executives note that many of
the discounted books would probably appear on both lists. The chain
will offer 30 percent discounts on its best-selling hardcover
titles and 20 percent reductions off its trade paperbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Borders, the second-largest bookstore chain, said it planned for
now to continue using the New York Times lists, although one
executive indicated that his company was reviewing its options.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At The Times, Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the newspaper,
issued a brief statement about Barnes &AMP; Noble's action. The chain
``has made a commercial decision, which is what it is in business
to do,'' she said, adding that it is the newspaper's role to
``review books and also report the most comprehensive and impartial
sales data of all such lists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our list includes more than just one chain store,'' Ms.
Nielsen said. ``It includes several chain stores and independent
booksellers and thus is a broader audience.''

GROUPS SAY CRANBERRY GROWERS MISLEAD ON ACREAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Cranberry farmers have been quietly expanding
into more and more unregulated acreage, even as they have sought
federal approval to use sensitive wetlands, environmental groups
assert.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation came as one of the state's largest growers, A.R.
DeMarco Enterprises, was charged this month with illegally
expanding into 22 acres of regulated wetlands in Burlington County.
</P>
<P>
   That charge by the state Department of Environmental Protection
_ which could mean heavy fines for the owner, Garfield DeMarco, a
former Burlington County Republican leader _ cast further suspicion
on the industry in the eyes of some environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The $25-million-a-year cranberry industry has thrived for over
200 years in the state's pinelands on the fringes of natural
wetlands, where swampy conditions and a web of streams, dams and
ditches allow farmers to flood growing areas easily and cheaply
with the water that is essential to the crop.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New Jersey, the most urban and densely populated
state in the country, has become the third-largest cranberry
producer, behind Massachusetts and Wisconsin. And many people see
the farming of cranberries, as well as blueberries, both of which
depend on clean water, as compatible with, and indeed an aid to,
wetlands preservation.
</P>
<P>
   The growers say they need to expand into regulated wetlands to
remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But William Neil, director of conservation for the New Jersey
Audubon Society, asserts that cranberry growers have already been
working far more than the 3,500 acres that they have cited in their
expansion applications.
</P>
<P>
   He said that reports on pesticide use suggested that as much as
4,481 acres of cranberries were being grown in the state, and that
other statistics from the state Department of Agriculture put the
figure at put the figure at 3,900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lee, one of the state's 48 cranberry growers and a
spokesman for the group, denied any deception. He said that he and
other growers had always indicated that they were modestly
expanding into unregulated, upland areas and into blueberry bogs on
their land. Those expansions had added as much as 400 acres to the
state's cranberry inventory in recent years, he conceded, which
would put the total at about 3,900 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have done it on our farm to the maximum extent possible
without touching regulated wetlands,'' Lee said. ``This is true of
most of the other farmers. We are all tapped out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the growers, most of whom are part of the large Ocean
Spray cooperative, had not hidden expansions from the public, as
Neil asserted. He said they had always told regulators that they
were converting blueberry bogs to more lucrative cranberry
production wherever possible, and extending growing areas upland,
away from the wetlands, when it did not require extensive
redirection of water.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations by Neil came about three weeks after the state
and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency said that they were
close to approving conditions under which growers could expand into
300 acres of wetlands over the next five years without seeking
specific permission for each expansion as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The draft agreement on what is called the ``general permit''
could be approved later this month. But it is being opposed by the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as ``the most environmentally
damaging proposal'' considered by regulators over the last five
years. Echoing this sentiment, environmental groups like the
Audubon Society have asked federal environmental regulators to
reconsider their support.

EMOTIONAL DAY FOR CHIEFS COACH ENDS IN AGONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 JOE POSNANSKI  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Elvis Grbac threw, and the ball floated a long way
down the field, and no receiver was going to catch up, and Gunther
Cunningham's heart exploded. That's how it felt. His heart
exploded, and his mind trembled, and he felt as if he were sinking
into the ground. Thirty years, he had waited to be the head
football coach. Thirty long years.
</P>
<P>
   The ball floated away. The game floated away.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Chiefs were going to lose to the Chicago Bears,
20-17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You die,'' Cunningham says. ``You absolutely die. I don't
think anybody can understand it. You die. There's no feeling like
that in the world. There's no pain so great. You work your heart
out, and then you see that pass going too far, and you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham died so many times on Sunday during his first game as
head coach. He died two dozen deaths in the first half alone, when
Chicago unleashed its loony new offense, and the Chiefs defense ran
around bewildered, bumping into each other, leaving receivers
uncovered, letting runners slide by. The Bears scored on every
possession in the half, took a 20-3 lead, and Cunningham went into
the locker room feeling every emotion on earth except joy, feeling
every kind of inner pain a man can feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept well Saturday night,'' he said. ``You know why? I
believed. I knew this team was ready. Then, that first half, we
played defense like that. But in the second half, we shut them out.
We played the kind of defense we can play. And I said, `That's my
team.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the second half, Cunningham danced up and down the
sideline, he pumped his fist, he bounced around, everything
changed. The defense stiffened. Grbac connected on an 86-yard
touchdown pass to Derrick Alexander. Chicago fumbled the next
kickoff. Moments later, the ball slipped out of Bears quarterback
Shane Matthews' hand, and Donnie Edwards raced 79 yards for a
touchdown. Chicago was trying to give away the game. Cunningham was
flying. He wore the headphones. He dumped the headphones. He
slapped helmets. He screamed at an official. He grimaced. He kicked
at a loose ball. The Chiefs were going to come back and win the
game. He could feel it in his gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had any doubt in my mind,'' he said. When Pete
Stoyanovich missed a 38-yard field goal, Cunningham still believed.
When the Chiefs had a drive stall at the Chicago 41, he still
believed. When the Chiefs got the ball back and faced fourth-and-10
with less than three minutes remaining, Cunningham believed so
deeply that he decided to go for it, when the safer and more
dependable play would have been to punt and let the defense get the
ball back. Grbac threw long, Alexander went short, and that was
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went for it,'' Cunningham said. ``And I will go for it
again. And I will go for it again after that. That's me. That's my
team. We're swashbucklers. We're not falling back on our heels.
We're not playing it safe. I went for it because I believed, deep
down, we were going to make it. We should have made it. And I will
go for it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Chiefs got their last chance, 94 yards from the end
zone, two minutes and 10 seconds left, and a run went for short
yardage, one pass was incomplete, then another, and finally it was
fourth down, and Grbac threw the ball long, Alexander could not
catch up. The game was lost. Cameras closed in on Cunningham as
that last ball floated away. His face remained blank. His insides
simmered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so frustrating,'' he said. ``Our defense kept giving
our offense chances. We've got to make those plays. We've got to
find ways to make plays. It killed me to watch us in those last
minutes on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   He went into the locker room, spoke softly to his team about how
games and chances don't ever come back. He answered a few media
questions. His face was red; his eyes bloodshot. Then, Gunther
Cunningham went into the coach's room to regroup, to slow his
heartbeat a bit, to calm his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun,'' Chiefs president//general manager Carl Peterson told
him, ``it's just one game. There will be others.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said similar things. Cunningham nodded. He knew this
agony was part of the bargain, part of the lifelong dream to be a
head football coach in the National Football League. Didn't make it
sting any less, though. Cunningham showered and put on his tie and
jacket and stared at the wall for a while. He wandered into the
training room to talk to Grbac: ``I told him, `Elvis, you haven't
changed in my eyes. You're my guy. You're going to be a great
quarterback in this league. And don't you ever forget it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's going to take some hits back in Kansas City over
this loss,'' Cunningham said. ``I will too. We're adults. That's
the way it goes. We'll take our hits, you bet, but then we will
come back next week and play our hearts out. That's pro football.
That's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham began to wander to the bus. He knew what would happen
next. He knew the routine as if it was his vaudeville act. First,
he would ride the bus, then get on the plane, then get in the car,
and he would feel worse and worse as the night went along. He would
manage to fall asleep for an hour or two when suddenly he would
jolt awake, as if stabbed by a knife. And, with that, sleep would
be done, and he would spend the rest of the night working, think up
strategies, staring out the window, into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to coach more,'' he said. ``That's clear. I've been
spread so thin. But that's going to change. Nobody knows this team
better than I do. So, I will get in there and coach more for this
Denver game coming up. I will be everywhere next week. This team is
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost smiled then as he headed for the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' he said. ``I'm already excited about Denver.
I really am. I've just got to get all this darkness out of my
mind.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diana Gonzalez had not been to church in many years,
so she was somewhat skeptical when she heard that St. Cecilia's
Church in East Harlem was holding an ecumenical prayer service on a
seemingly secular subject: the fate of Vieques, P.R., a small
island that is home to a U.S. naval base, and that, for many Puerto
Ricans, has long symbolized their colonial status.
</P>

   ``I wasn't sure what to expect,'' she said. ``It is a political
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   What she got was a religious service deeply laced with politics,
not only from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is well known for
interweaving the religious and the secular, but from the archbishop
of San Juan, Roberto Gonzalez Nieves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it amazing,'' she said of the archbishop's use of
religious teachings not only to urge the removal of the naval base
but to defend clemency for 11 Puerto Rican nationalists just freed
from prison. ``I didn't know he could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   But do that he did, before a church packed with raucous
nationalists, who offered standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Vieques has smarted in the Puerto Rican
consciousness almost since the United States began using the island
for naval exercises during World War II. But it has threatened to
boil over since April, when one civilian was killed and four others
were injured during a practice bombing run. Since then the base has
been the site of almost continuous civil disobedience, although the
authorities made no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists say the military presence has harmed the
51-square-mile island's natural resources and its economy and
endangered its residents' health. The Navy says Vieques, a small
island seven miles off Puerto Rico, is the only place where it can
stage realistic battle scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's service, which also featured performances by the
popular Puerto Rican singer Danny Rivera and by Jackson's daughter
Sandita, was designed to show solidarity for the activists, and to
capitalize on the burst of Puerto Rican patriotism engendered by
the release of 11 members of the Puerto Rican nationalist group,
the Armed Forces for National Liberation, known as the FALN It was
also the birthday of Albizu Campos, a celebrated Puerto Rican
nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wasted no time in making his point: if the United States
fought for Kosovo's right to self-determination, if it believes in
East Timor's right to self-determination, why do the people of
Puerto Rico not deserve the same chance?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sin for one individual to own another _ it's called
slavery,'' he said to appreciative murmurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sin for one nation to own another _ it's called
colonialism,'' he continued, and brought down the house.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said that while he supported the Clinton
administration's offer of clemency, he had questions about the way
it was handled. The announcement of clemency, he said, came with no
advance word to the prisoners, their families, their lawyers, or
any of the people who had worked to win their release. And, he
said, it came on the day that he and the archbishop had scheduled a
visit to Vieques, and called it an ``attempt to divert attention''
from Vieques.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later, he said he believed that the lack of preparation for the
announcement caused the delay in the prisoners' decision to accept
the conditions imposed on their clemency, and he said that, in
turn, had caused Hillary Rodham Clinton's ``confusion'' on the
issue. Mrs. Clinton had said that the clemency offer should be
withdrawn because the prisoners had taken too long to renounce
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Mrs. Clinton would make a ``strong candidate'' for
Senate, but refrained from saying whether he would support her.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop, who was a priest at Holy Cross Church in the
Bronx in the 1970s and 1980s, called the military activities on
Vieques ``an offense against the principles for which the United
States wishes to stand.'' He quoted sections of the Roman Catholic
catechism to build a case that there is no defense _ including good
intentions _ for harming the innocent and that peace is impossible
without justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these reasons we appeal to principles that surpass all
social, political and economic factors,'' he said. He also earned a
wild ovation by striking an overtly nationalist tone, saying in
Spanish that all Puerto Ricans, whether in New York or on the
island, are ``a single family, a single nation.'' And he referred
to the FALN prisoners as political prisoners, and said mercy must
go alongside justice and peace.
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop also said that the people of New York had
suffered ``political manipulation'' in their quest for peace and
justice, an apparent reference to the issue of clemency surfacing
in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the archbishop said he was not advocating any
particular future for Puerto Rico, a self-governing
U.S.commonwealth that has considered both statehood and
independence. Rather, he said, he wanted whatever option the island
picked to ``foster the national identity of the Puerto Rican
people.''

MOSQUITO SPRAYERS BLITZ THROUGH NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By   JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The white pickup trucks outfitted with canisters and
spray hoses were gone as quickly as they arrived, leaving only a
foul odor and an ominous-looking white cloud of insecticide.
</P>
<P>
   The ground war against the outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a
mosquito-borne viral disease, was in full swing over the weekend,
backed up by aerial support from insecticide-spraying helicopters.
But it was a lightning blitz so fast that many residents barely
noticed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were coming,'' Crystal McKenny, 22, said at 2:50
a.m. Sunday, about 15 minutes after a convoy of trucks passed a
building where she was sitting on the steps with a friend in
northwest Harlem. ``I just forgot we were first. I was going to be
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m. Sunday, all of northern Manhattan had been treated
with malathion, the insecticide that city officials are using to
fight the mosquitoes that carry the virus, which so far has been
responsible for three deaths in the city.
</P>
<P>
   City workers have been spraying Staten Island, Central Park and
much of northern Manhattan. Midtown and lower Manhattan are
expected to be completed by Tuesday. The Mayor's Office of
Emergency Management is using 11 trucks, five helicopters and an
airplane in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Sunday the number of possible cases
of St. Louis encephalitis, an occasionally fatal disease that can
cause extreme swelling of the brain, was about 80. The number of
confirmed cases remained at nine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night and Sunday morning, as truck drivers sprayed
northern Manhattan and Brooklyn Heights, several new possible cases
were reported to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that test results returned by the Federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention had discounted 16 possible
cases, but that four cases needed more testing because the results
were inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   One of those four cases involved a 79-year-old woman from
Whitestone, Queens, who died in mid-August, before the outbreak had
become public, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly, small children and people with weakened immune
systems are particularly vulnerable to the disease, while most
healthy people recover on their own. The symptoms can range from a
slight headache or fever to a high fever and convulsions.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday evening, the convoys trolled back and forth on
crosstown streets, just north of Central Park and Morningside
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the smell quickly disappeared after the trucks
went by, and people were often able to return to the streets. The
stench, although powerful, was sometimes so short lived that some,
including a group of Columbia University students, did not even
realize that the spray truck had passed through their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Virginia Heath, 52, a mental health worker, and her
husband, Jose Nina, 46, a former outfielder for the Los Angeles
Dodgers were momentarily distracted from their view of the Hudson
River and the New Jersey skyline as one of the trucks roared by.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is how come they want to spray everywhere but
midtown on a Saturday night?'' Ms. Heath said as her husband held
his nose. ``It must be some chemical that is hazardous to your
health, that they don't want to give to rich folks.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials have said that the spraying of malathion
poses almost no risk to humans, although people with respiratory
problems like asthma could have an attack if exposed to the spray.

HUNDREDS GATHER AT CROSSES SYMBOLIZING VICTIMS OF COLUMBINE HIGH
SCHOOL MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Thirteen crosses on the crest of the hill
symbolized the innocent victims of last spring's Columbine High
School massacre and offered inspiration to hundreds who gathered in
a Johnson County field Sunday evening to affirm their faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   The original wooden crosses erected after the Littleton, Colo.,
shooting, which are now traveling the country, still bear messages
scrawled by loved ones and the tattered remains of ribbons and
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep, baby sleep,'' was written in black marker on several of
the crosses. ``We loved you, coach,'' was written on the one for
teacher William David Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   The poignancy of the sad reminders was eclipsed by a message of
hope brought by Darrell Scott, whose daughter Rachel was killed
April 20 outside the school and whose son Craig survived by playing
dead in the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I believed for a second that God was asleep on April 20 I
wouldn't be here,'' Darrell Scott told the crowd of several hundred
in lawn chairs and on blankets. ``I would be very, very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott read from his daughter's diaries to reveal how deeply she
believed that God had a mission for her in life and in death. In a
diary addressed to God, Rachel wrote, ``I want you to use me to
reach the unreached.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you something,'' her father added, ``her prayer
was answered.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel's televised funeral was viewed by millions and the
17-year-old's death has inspired countless people to turn their
lives around, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Her last diary, which was in her backpack the day she was shot
and which bears a bullet hole, contained a drawing Rachel made of a
pair of eyes crying tears over a rose that, her father said, is
growing out of a columbine plant.
</P>
<P>
   Scott spoke at an evening service on the grounds of the future
First Family Church at 143rd Street and Metcalf Avenue. A morning
service at the site was moved to Rockhurst High School because of
Sunday morning's rain.
</P>
<P>
   At the morning service, Craig Scott related his experience
during the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Local youths were selected to carry each of the crosses down the
hill and through the audience to the front of a portable stage
below. Scott spoke of each of the victims as the crosses were
brought down, noting the absence of crosses for the two killers,
who committed suicide after the shooting. Scott asked for prayers
for those boys' families.
</P>
<P>
   The crosses, built of unvarnished wood by carpenter Greg Zanis
of Aurora, Ill., have traveled to visit congregations across the
country. First Family pastor Jerry Johnston invited Scott to bring
the crosses here.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City woman who is in the process of becoming a member
of the First Family Church brought her dog with her to the outdoor
service. She stooped to read the messages on the crosses in the
setting sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of my faith is that God uses experiences like this,''
said the woman, who identified herself only as Aileen. ``Even
though it's really sad, it might bring a person closer to God. If
these families believe in God after something like this, that's
pretty powerful.''

 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what we know as the college football season begins to
find its legs.
</P>
<P>
   First, Florida State's Peter Warrick is a worthy front-runner
for the Heisman Trophy and Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton should vault
to second place after the two took turns trampling each other's end
zones late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Penn State's LaVar Arrington lost what little chance he
had for the award but probably insured that he would become the top
pick in the National Football League draft by playing well and
acting badly in a 20-17 victory over Pittsburgh. The linebacker
blocked the game-tying field-goal attempt, snatched an interception
and, most impressively, pounded and bullied a punter. A punter!
</P>
<P>
   Third, Wisconsin's Ron Dayne needs tougher opposition if he
wants to separate Warrick and Hamilton from the Heisman. And
finally, the sense of time of the Swiss might better serve Notre
Dame than the luck of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play one more second of that game,'' said
Coach Bobby Bowden after Florida State, top-ranked in the
Associated Press poll, outlasted Georgia Tech, 41-35, in
Tallahassee. ``I never thought I would see the day that an offense
would score that many points on us. I think Tech had a chance to
win up to the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Florida State's Travis Minor smothered an onside-kick
attempt with 1 minute 35 seconds left, Georgia Tech did have a
chance in a high-wire game that showed Warrick belonged alongside
Johnny Rodgers, Desmond Howard and Tim Brown _ the only true
receivers to win the Heisman.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable sequence, Florida State (2-0) and Georgia Tech
(1-1) rang up touchdowns on seven consecutive series, combining for
five of them in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick caught a 26-yard touchdown pass, lined up at quarterback
in the shotgun and ricocheted 17 yards for a touchdown run, and
finished with 167 yards on 8 catches.
</P>
<P>
   And the 5-foot-10-inch Hamilton, the South's version of Doug
Flutie, fired right back. He was 22 of 25 for 387 yards and 4
touchdowns. He ran for another score and completed his final 14
passes of the game, touchdown throws of 11 and 22 yards among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit, and they hit back,'' said Hamilton, who was knocked
out of the game the last two times the teams met. ``They made plays
and we made plays back. They just made more plays than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Penn State, which was ranked second going into
the weekend, was considered to be the big-play team of the new
season after crushing victories over Arizona and Akron. But the
Nittany Lions looked Victorian in surviving over the 34-point
underdog Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, a 6-foot-3-inch, 242-pound all-American, slapped
around Pitt's 6-0, 189-pound punter Greg DeBolt in the early going.
But he finished by getting a hand on a 52-yard field-goal attempt
by Nick Lotz with four seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the emotional Arrington blindsided DeBolt
after his punt and jumped on him as a penalty flag flew. He then
leaped to his feet, ignored the referee and shoved DeBolt again.
Another flag flew, and Arrington was penalized 30 yards for two
personal fouls.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst did not seem to bother the college game's arbiter
of taste and sportsmanship, Joe Paterno. He spoke calmly to
Arrington on the sideline and the linebacker remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to nitpick all of the time,'' Paterno said
afterward. ``He should have walked away, but it was a good lesson
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel sorry for the Badgers' Dayne. But don't feel sorry for that
dawdling bunch from South Bend, Ind. Dayne, the Wisconsin man
mountain, rolled for 158 yards in a 50-10 thrashing of Ball State.
He only played three quarters _ one more than he did the previous
week in Wisconsin's rout of Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne is not only in search of the Heisman, but also the career
rushing record set last year by Ricky Williams of Texas. With
Cincinnati next for the Badgers, both will be part-time pursuits.
He needs the Big Ten schedule to get there in a hurry before he
loses any more ground to Warrick and a Hamilton in the Heisman
race.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame again proved it cannot do anything in a hurry. For
the second week in a row, the Irish ran out of clock _ this time
after driving to Purdue's (2-0) 1-yard line in a 28-23 loss. The
Irish (1-2) had already turned the two-minute drill into
slow-motion chaos. It caught up to them when they called a timeout
with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Davie called two plays intended to move them three
feet for the score. Unfortunately, the first one allowed
quarterback Jarious Jackson to call an audible, if necessary, for
an option play. He had not.
</P>
<P>
   But fullback Joey Goodspeed thought he had. He relayed it to
tailback Tony Fisher. They went right. Jackson went left as
planned, but instead of finding Fisher ready for a handoff, he was
hit by linebacker Mike Rose. The play lost 9 yards. End of game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coaching staff, we had a couple of mistakes,'' said
Davie, who last week heard the gun sound as his team was trying to
win the game from Michigan's 12.
</P>
<P>
   The season is still young, but there are some truths on the
college landscape. Look for the Heisman Trophy winner to streak out
of the South. The Great Dayne will rumble toward them out of
Wisconsin when he gets a chance.

MIRER'S CHANCE TO REPLACE TESTAVERDE COMES TOO SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As Keyshawn Johnson stormed out of the
interview room _ unleashing all of the frustration from the injury
to Vinny Testaverde in the Jets' opening-day 30-28 loss Sunday to
the New England Patriots and the realization that maybe the Super
Bowl dreams were fading _ Rick Mirer was ushered in through a door
on the other side of the room, a disconcerting welcome to his first
postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Before Johnson left the room, he had described Testaverde as
irreplaceable. Mirer is left to prove him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty rough situation for everybody right now,'' Mirer
said as he walked through the corridors under Giants Stadium.
``They've had high expectations and Vinny was a big part of that. I
don't even know all these guys yet. I haven't done much here yet.
You have to earn all that stuff on the field on game day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Mirer, that chance came much sooner than he believed it
would when he was acquired in a trade with the Green Bay Packers on
Aug. 20, shortly after playing against the Jets in an exhibition
game. In his brief time with the team, he earned the backup
quarterback job behind Testaverde. Now, after less than a month
with the organization he finds himself saddled with the
responsibility of salvaging the team's title hopes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On this day, he did not even get his chance until the fourth
quarter as  &UR; c &LR; oach Bill Parcells placed him as the emergency
quarterback, presuming that Testaverde would be healthy and that
Tom Tupa, who serves as the punter as well as holder on kicks,
would never be called into action in his listing as the
second-string quarterback.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tupa entered the game when Testaverde went down with the
ruptured Achilles' tendon midway through the second period because
if Parcells had inserted Mirer before the fourth quarter, Tupa
would not have been allowed into the game even to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa responded with a 25-yard touchdown pass to Johnson on his
first play, the first pass he had attempted since Nov. 17, 1996, on
a fake punt while he was a member of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, a quarterback at Ohio State, had thrown his previous
touchdown pass in 1992, and his performance amazed even Patriots
quarterback Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is an amazing athlete,'' Bledsoe said. ``He had no
reps in the preseason. He has had very little work with the first
team. But he did get his dream shot this week because he got to be
me on the scout team.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, it would be Mirer under the microscope, and he
was only third best on his own team. Testaverde was 10 of 15 before
the injury and Tupa was 6 of 10 with two touchdowns, in addition to
punting and even running on a fake field goal, ending up just short
of a first down.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer was 4 of 11 for 28 yards with two interceptions, the most
costly one coming with only 3 minutes 30 seconds to play in the
game and the Jets trying to run down the clock while protecting a
28-27 lead. After a late read brought him to Johnson, his attempt
to force the ball in bounced off Johnson and into the hands of New
England linebacker Chris Slade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mirer, who was the second player selected in the National
Football League draft, behind Parcells' selection with New England
of Bledsoe, has worn his way through four teams now in seven years.
He did not play a down last season with Green Bay, but will now be
counted on because Parcells said that he would not reach out for a
veteran quarterback, instead going with Mirer, Tupa and Ray Lucas,
who was inactive Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For Mirer, inspiration for what can happen came from what
Testaverde achieved last season after enduring years of struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been done, so I've seen it happen and feel good about my
chances,'' Mirer said. ``I have a little less time than he did and
a little less time than I want. But it's possible and I feel good
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not always be pretty, but I'm going to try to get the
job done my way and execute his plays. We're going to need help
from other guys, but we have that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would happen this way,'' Mirer said. ``It
did and it's time to play and I've got to be ready to go. There's a
lot of work to be done and not a lot of time to do it. You hate to
see anybody get hurt, especially the guy that controls the offense.
It accelerates my learning process. Right now there's a lot of
things I'm going to have to get comfortable with real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirer should get the majority of practice snaps as the team
prepares for next week's meeting with Buffalo on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to be playing,'' Mirer said. ``Today I felt
like this morning waking up, it's a new season and I'm not playing,
but I'm one play away. Sure enough, that happens early. It's not
really the way you'd like to see it happen. It's a good opportunity
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to slow this team down because there are things I
need to get comfortable with to be successful. Hopefully, I can
pick up where Vinny left off and get this team where they deserve
to be.''

CELLEGY PINS ITS HOPES ON HEMORRHOID GEL &HT;    By TOM ABATE
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Mike Forrest of Cellegy Pharmaceuticals doesn't take it
personally when people steer clear of him at cocktail parties.
</P>
<P>
   His South San Francisco, Calif., firm is in the final stages of
testing the first new treatment for hemorrhoids and anal fissures
in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly the most popular topic of conversation,'' he
admits.
</P>
<P>
   But by Christmas, Forrest hopes to have analyzed the results of
Phase III clinical trials involving 300 patients, who are now using
an experimental gel to relax the swollen blood vessels and cramped
muscles that cause hemorrhoids and fissures.
</P>
<P>
   The gel's active ingredient is nitroglycerin, the same chemical
angina patients use to ease blood flow around the heart. New York
surgeon Steve Gorfine realized several years ago that nitroglycerin
could probably have the same calming effect on inflamed anal
tissue, and in 1997 he patented the idea of using nitro relaxants
for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Cellegy acquired these patent rights and quickly won Food and
Drug Administration approval to skip early-stage safety tests _
saving years of trials _ and jump right into Phase III studies of
whether the nitro gel works.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nitroglycerin has been used for so long in humans, the FDA was
convinced it was safe,'' Forrest says, explaining the expedited
trials.
</P>
<P>
   Cellegy hopes the trial data will prove its nitro cream a more
effective pain reliever than current prescription steroid drugs or
over-the-counter remedies, both of which have been around for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   If the Phase III data are positive, Cellegy will seek FDA
approval next year to sell a drug with a U.S. market potential in
excess of $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cellegy's shares have more than doubled since the spring, when
the company announced its Phase III trials. The stock closed
unchanged Friday (Sept. 11) at $8.13.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 30-person Cellegy recently completed Phase II safety
studies of a gel rub that would give aging men a testosterone
boost. (It's not what you think: Patients rub the gel into an arm
or thigh muscle.) ``In the U.S., 5 million men have clinically low
testosterone levels,'' Forrest says.
</P>
<P>
   The medical term for testosterone deficiency is hypogonadalism.
The condition generally occurs after age 40, causing mood swings,
loss of muscle mass, a decrease in libido and problems in
concentrating.
</P>
<P>
   Three forms of testosterone replacement therapy are on the
market, but Forrest says all have drawbacks. Oral tablets can cause
liver damage. Injections can safely deliver testosterone boosts,
but the effect wears off soon.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, the FDA approved testosterone skin
patches, which deliver steady doses of hormone. But Forrest says
the patches, which must be applied daily, cause skin irritation and
leave unsightly red blotches.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, thousands of American men shell out $1,000 a year for a
year's supply of testosterone skin patches. If his experimental gel
can deliver its hormonal kick without the skin irritation, Forrest
thinks Cellegy could have another Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Cellegy has only tested its gel on a handful of men.
The FDA will doubtless scrutinize whether the testosterone rub
outperforms the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   So touting this prospect is premature. Then again, if you were
Mike Forrest, which gel would you rather talk about at cocktail
parties?
</P>
<P>
   RUMOR DEPARTMENT: Over the past month, shares of Chiron Corp.
have soared on rumors that it might be acquired by Novartis, the
Swiss drug firm that already owns a 45 percent stake in Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors began shortly after Roche, another Swiss drug firm,
acquired Genentech Inc., then turned right around and spun off part
of Genentech in a hugely successful public offering. Roche had
owned two-thirds of Genentech before this maneuver, and market
speculation held that Novartis might do a similar dance with
Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company has commented on the rumors. Analysts who follow
Chiron have largely declined to speculate on possible merger talks.
And Novartis, which is traded on the Zurich exchange, isn't well
understood in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   But the market gossip provides a good excuse to learn about
Novartis, one of the world's top three drug vendors. With $22
billion in revenues, Novartis ranks 159 on Fortune magazine's
Global 500 list.
</P>
<P>
   Based down the street from Roche in the Swiss city of Basel,
Novartis has three main businesses. Prescription drugs is the
largest division, accounting for 55 percent of sales. Another 18
percent comes from consumer health products, which include such
popular items as Ex-Lax and Maalox, as well as Gerber baby food.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis derives the last 27 percent of its revenues from the
sale of pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified seeds and
agri-chemicals. European financial reports say Novartis' ag
business is in trouble, owing partly to weak crop prices, which
have crimped purchases of seeds and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over genetically modified foods has also bruised
its reputation. Novartis sells a strain of corn altered so that its
stalk contains an insecticide meant to kill corn pests.
</P>
<P>
   Poor performance in the agri-division, combined with lackluster
results in the pharmaceutical and consumer categories, has driven
Novartis shares down more than 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis has tried to reverse the slide by dedicating about a
third of its $7.8 billion cash reserve to a stock buyback program.
The company is also gearing up to launch several new prescription
drugs in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Euro-press has noted, but not dwelt, on the prospect that
Novartis might acquire Chiron now, rather than later, effectively
renegotiating a contract that currently prevents Novartis from
doing a buyout until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But the more active rumor on the other side of the Atlantic is
that Novartis might spin off its troubled agri-unit, tightening its
focus on prescription and OTC drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Novartis digests Chiron now, or deals with its
agri-problems first and its biotech opportunities later, the Swiss
drug giant is destined to play a determining role in Chiron's
future. Since Genentech is already majority-owned by Roche, this
means the San Francisco Bay Area's two leading biotech firms will
both one day take their lead from Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's an ill rumor that blows no good. Chiron shares
had been stalled in the low 20s for nigh on to three years, defying
CEO Sean Lance's efforts to excite investors. But now the hint that
Chiron may be in play has made its stock unstoppable in recent
weeks. Its shares gained 3 cents Friday (Sept. 11) to close at
$34.78.

   SOFTWARE MARKET REBOUNDS &HT;    By TOM STEIN
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Software stocks, which have taken a beating for
much of the year, are starting to bounce back, as investors
anticipate a rebound in sales once companies get over their Y2K
worries and start buying business software again.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of leading software companies such as PeopleSoft,
Oracle, Intuit, Siebel and SAP hit the skids this year as customers
put off buying commercial software and turned their attention
toward making sure their existing software was ready for the
potential Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   But now many companies think they have the Y2K problem under
control, and they are once again shopping for new software to
modernize their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an increasing awareness on the part of companies that
there will be life beyond Y2K and that they'd better be prepared
with new business information systems,'' said Jim Shepherd, an
analyst with AMR Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in leading business-software companies have risen 30 to
50 percent in the past month. The sector could get another boost
Tuesday (Sept. 14), when Oracle of Redwood City, Calif. announces
earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Chuck Phillips, a
analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he expects Oracle's
business software revenues to rise 17 percent from the year earlier
period. In recent quarters, sales growth has been mostly flat for
business-software companies. Oracle stock closed at $46.38 Friday
(Sept. 11), up 29 percent in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel Systems in San Mateo, Calif., is perhaps positioned the
best. The company sits smack in the middle of the red-hot market
for sales force automation software, which helps companies manage
their sales leads, call centers and marketing operations. Analysts
say customers get the most immediate return on investment from this
type of software.
</P>
<P>
   AMR Research predicts the market for sales software alone will
grow from about $2 billion last year to $11 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's stock closed at $75.78 Friday (Sept. 11) _ up 50
percent from $50.38 a month ago _ and is hovering just below its
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft and SAP _ which make software that help companies run
their finance, distribution, sales and manufacturing operations _
have also seen their stocks climb back from frightening lows
recently.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, PeopleSoft's stock has soared 37 percent. It
finished on Friday (Sept. 11) at $18.13, compared with $13.19 a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Pleasanton, Calif., company also seems to have settled many
of its management troubles. Investors, and customers, were scared
off after the company's founder and chief executive Dave Duffield
said this spring he would step back from day-to-day operations. At
the same time, many longtime executives departed the company. But
according to analysts, Wall Street now feels more comfortable with
PeopleSoft's new management team, lead by President Craig Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intuit, a Mountain View, Calif., maker of financial
software for consumers and small businesses, has seen a sharp rise
in its stock price. Intuit shares closed Friday (Sept. 11) at $103,
up 44 percent from $71.44 a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing some large deals coming back into the pipeline
for the business software vendors,'' said Bill Lanzon, an analyst
with Dain Rauscher Wessels. That's a vast improvement over a few
months ago, when the customer pipeline had all but dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Babcock, chief technology officer at Pacific Coast Feathers
in Seattle, is one SAP customer who is looking to buy more
applications in the New Year. Her company, which makes down pillows
and comforters, would like to buy an executive information system
that gives management immediate feedback on critical information
such as product sales by region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think companies are still focused on Y2K, but I think that
focus is starting to shift toward new technology projects.''
</P>
<P>
   While business-software stocks have rebounded nicely of late,
most are still below their 52-week highs. Analysts think it's
unlikely prices will recover fully this year. ``Companies like
PeopleSoft have come back lately, but they still have a long way to
go,'' said Shepherd of AMR Research.

   RENT OUT YOUR CHOICE OF SOFTWARE &HT;    By TOM STEIN
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Desktop software has always been a pain.
</P>
<P>
   For most consumers, loading new software on a personal computer
can be a frustrating, mind-bending experience. And the more
software you install on your PC, the more technical troubles you're
likely to have.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those infinite software upgrades to worry about,
not to mention all the uninstalling and reinstalling you have to do
when when you replace your old machine with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, these software issues are a real deterrent to PC
use,'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter, an industry
newsletter in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a better way. A few high-tech giants, as well
as a host of small startups, are playing with the idea of renting
software over the Internet. Instead of trudging off to a local
retailer and plunking down $40 or more for the latest software
title, consumers could simply log on to the Internet and access the
software package of their choice _ sometimes for free, sometimes
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: The software resides on a remote server in
cyberspace and is never loaded onto the individual's computer
desktop. Users would access the software on an as-needed basis and
pay either a per usage fee, a monthly subscription fee or,
sometimes, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Users also can pay to have their files stored remotely or can
transfer the files to their own computer hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, for instance, being able to rent, for a nominal charge,
a tax-preparation application. When you are finished, your tax
return is filed on your hard drive _ or possibly zapped directly to
the IRS _ while the application that created it disappears into the
cyber-clouds.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of renting software over the Internet is new to
the consumer market, it has already taken hold in the business
world. That's because corporations spent much of the past decade
trying to install complex software applications to run their
businesses. Some of these software projects took years to complete
and cost millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate the problem, some companies are now renting access
to financial, manufacturing and sales software over the Internet.
As a result, a winemaker, for instance, can focus on growing grapes
instead of worrying about installing and maintaining complicated
software applications.
</P>
<P>
   Companies as varied as Robert Mondavi Winery and Samsung
Semiconductor spent a total of $150 million on software rentals
last year. That figure is expected to grow to $2 billion by 2003,
according to International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors are eager to tap into this market. Oracle Corp., for
one, has set up a separate business unit, called Oracle Business
Online, dedicated to software rental. Other companies in the market
include Corio and USinterworking, which rent out software from the
likes of PeopleSoft and SAP.
</P>
<P>
   And while the action to date has been on the business software
side, some industry experts believe the real potential of the
rental market is on the consumer side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't want to fret with technology in the home,''
said Clare Gillan, an analyst with International Data Corp. ``I
think you will see some big vendors make a play (in the software
rental market) because that is a way to own the consumer and have
control of the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems lent huge credibility to the notion of software
rental late last month when it acquired a company called Star
Office and said it would begin offering word processing and
spreadsheet applications for free over the Internet. The service is
aimed at both consumers and businesses. By giving away the
software, Sun is hoping to increase sales of its computer servers,
which host the software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun also said it would unveil a new Web site later this year
called StarPortal, where consumers can access applications similar
to those in Microsoft Office, the leading ``business productivity''
package.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the threat from Sun, Microsoft said it's working
on its own Web-based office productivity services. At first, these
rental services will take shape around Microsoft's Windows 2000
software and will be targeted at small businesses, not consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe it's crucial that Microsoft quickly address
the consumer market. ``The big question is whether Microsoft is
willing to change its revenue model and accept a near-term loss,''
said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that there are 100 million Office customers, who each
pay about $400 for the software in retail outlets. ``If Microsoft
wants to hold on to its market share, it has to provide a
compelling solution in the software rental space that is priced
right.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sun will offer its software for free over the Web, it is
still unclear what consumers can expect to pay for Microsoft
applications under a rental model.
</P>
<P>
   It's also crucial to note that, for several reasons, consumer
software rental is not yet ready for prime time. The first problem
is slow and spotty Internet access. Critics argue that most people
just won't tolerate waiting minute after frustrating minute to
access, say, an Internet-based spreadsheet document to crunch
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rental concept to work, you have to give consumers
bulletproof applications,'' said Yogen Dalal, a partner at venture
capital firm Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, Calif. ``If I'm a college
student using a Web-based word-processing application to write my
term paper, I won't be happy if my Internet connection crashes and
I lose all my data.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dalal and others believe software rental is inevitable,
they say it won't be a reality for another three to five years. By
that time, it's expected that most people will have high-speed
access to the Internet and that network connections will be more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical issue is privacy. How secure will consumers
feel if their private word-processing or financial documents are
stored remotely on an Internet server?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the idea of my personal files sitting on someone
else's server,'' said Rebecca Susser, a 30-year-old San Francisco
resident who has given the issue some thought. ``Also, if I'm on
the road and can't log on to the Internet, does that mean I won't
be able to do my work?''
</P>
<P>
   But Susser sees plenty of upside as well. ``Overall, the whole
rental aspect is very appealing,'' she said. ``I like the fact that
my software will always be automatically updated and that there
would be a plethora of programs I could use.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she is interested in high-end design software but that
she wouldn't use it often enough to justify forking out hundreds of
dollars. ``It would be really cool if could pay (a small fee) for
the software only when I needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, millions of people are accessing software _ albeit
small-scale applications _ over the Internet. Online giants like
Yahoo, American Online and Microsoft, as well as fledging startups
like Visto, offer e-mail and calendaring programs over the Web that
are hugely popular with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers speculate that the next logical step would be
for these companies to increase the number of Internet-based
applications in their portfolios and start charging a subscription
fee. Just as cable television operators offer consumers the choice
of basic, premium and pay-per-view services, a similar model could
be applied to software rental.
</P>
<P>
   Two startups that are clearly forging ahead in this direction
are Desktop.com in San Francisco and Arepa.com in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop.com, which will formally launch its service on September
20, wants to become, quite literally, the desktop of the Internet.
Today, computer users go to a single, centralized spot to access
all their software _ namely the PC desktop. The concept behind
Desktop.com is to give users that same convenience on the Internet,
whether they are trying to access games, finance or personal
productivity software.
</P>
<P>
   The company is building its own Internet-based applications, but
is also encouraging third-party developers to create software for
its platform. Desktop.com chief executive Katie Burke said the
site, at first, will cater to niche applications targeted at a
focused market, such as software that will allow long-distance
runners to log the number of miles they cover each week. The
service will initially be free to users.
</P>
<P>
   Arepa.com, for its part, is targeting the nearly 2 million U.S.
households that already have high-speed, or broadband, access to
the Internet. Subscribers to the service, which is now being tested
in select locations across the country, get instant access to
popular software titles, including educational, gaming and personal
productivity applications.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still experimenting with pricing, but subscribers
can expect to pay a few dollars to rent a particular application
for a day or two, or they can access a unlimited number of software
titles in a particular category for about $10 a month.

BUCHANAN POISED FOR REFORM PARTY BID
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By CRAGG HINES &QL; 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pat Buchanan, whose aggressively conservative bids
for the Republican presidential nomination have weakened the
party's eventual standard-bearer in the last two national
campaigns, said Sunday he was almost prepared to seek the Reform
Party nomination _ an even more harrowing prospect for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door really is wide open,'' Buchanan said on NBC's Meet
the Press. ``We are very close to making that decision ... We are
taking a hard look at leaving the Republican nomination run and
running for the Reform Party nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment was the clearest indication yet by the conservative
commentator, who was an aide to Republican Presidents Nixon and
Reagan, that he is prepared to abandon his current lackluster GOP
presidential bid and seek the nomination of the party founded by
Dallas billionaire Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's time maybe to take a bye on the regionals and
go straight to the finals,'' Buchanan said of the prospect that he
could leave the Republican primary race and seek a place on the
November 2000 presidential ballot as the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan indicated he would make a decision by Oct. 15. The
Reform Party is expected to nominate a presidential candidate at a
convention next summer. But in some states, including Texas, where
the party does not have a guaranteed ballot position, individual
candidates face deadlines _ as well as costly petition drives _
before summer 2000 for getting on ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's latest Republican campaign has been faring poorly,
mired in single digits in national polls _ all of which are led by
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sort of made up my mind, that I cannot endorse the
Republican nominee as of now,'' Buchanan said, referring to Bush.
``I cannot make that commitment, because my party at the national
level has become a Xerox copy, basically, of the Democratic
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan criticized the party's support for several
international commercial pacts, including the North American Free
Trade Agreement, and U.S. intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo, which
have been supported by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning Sunday in Iowa, recalled that he had
encouraged Buchanan to stay in the Republican Party, but said:
``Some things in politics are beyond your control.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal worries of the Bush campaign has been that
the Reform Party would spring back to life enough to deny the
Republican nominee victory. That concern would be magnified were
Buchanan to be the Reform candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A mid-August national poll, by Schroth and Associates,
traditionally aligned with Democratic candidates, found the
following result in a three-way presidential contest: Bush 39
percent; Vice President Al Gore 35 percent; Buchanan, as the Reform
nominee, 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine, in its new edition, said a private poll conducted
by Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant, found Buchanan would win 6
percent of the vote in a three-way contest with Bush and Gore _
with two-thirds of the Buchanan vote coming from Bush supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only bad news'' for Republicans, George C. Edwards III,
director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said of Buchanan's prospective jump to the Reform
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible Reform nominees did not pose a similar threat to
Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a certain (GOP) constituency that will never
be satisfied with George Bush but would not necessarily be
attracted to (Minnesota Gov.) Jesse Ventura,'' the newest Reform
Party star.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who shares some of Buchanan's conservative economic
positions but not his hard-right social positions such as
opposition to abortion, has been cool to Buchanan as a prospective
Reform presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, in an interview last week in the Capitol Hill newspaper
The Hill, belittled the possibility that ``a retread from another
campaign or another party'' would pick up the Reform banner.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Verney of Dallas, chairman of the Reform Party and
political adviser to Perot, signaled a welcome to Buchanan. He also
said that Pat Choate, the Washington economist who was Perot's vice
presidential running mate in 1996, had been urging Buchanan to make
the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the idea that (Buchanan) has recognized that
the Republican presidential nomination contest is content-free,''
Verney said in a telephone interview. ``He has a lot of issues he
is passionate about that aren't going to get discussed in the
Republican primary process. Through the reform party he can give
the voters an opportunity to express their views and build a new
political party.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gargan, who represents the Ventura wing of the Reform Party
and will take over as party chairman in January, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe Perot's first presidential run, in 1992,
cost President Bush a second term. Exit polls indicated, however,
that Perot took evenly from both Bush and Democratic nominee Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan seemed unimpressed by the argument that as the Reform
candidate he could cost Bush the election and allow Democrat Gore
to be elected. Buchanan said he could win with a campaign in which
he espoused ``an American foreign policy that puts our own country
first a trade policy that puts our workers ahead of the global
economy ... an immigration policy that says we need a time out.''
On those issues, he contended, Bush and Gore have few differences.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan acknowledged the Reform Party did not share some of his
conservative social views, including his opposition to abortion,
but said: ``If I am going to run for the Reform Party nomination,
I'm not going to start trimming on my convictions. Clearly, on
life, there are many members of the Reform Party who disagree with
me. But I will tell them honestly, if I get into the race, I'm
pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said that the party has not taken positions, ``so they
are neither a qualifier or disqualifier.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney said Buchanan ``would be expected to endorse our party's
platform, which is about government reform and economic reform
issues. As he presents himself to (Reform Party) voters _ and I
certainly would expect him to remain passionate about his position
on abortion _ he will win or lose support based on his personal
position on social issues.''

<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ |It was an overwhelming football afternoon,
which ended with a.MDBR/[.MDNM/ very.MDBR/].MDNM/ blurry, yet
.MDBR/ecstatic[ .MDNM/estastic.MDBR/].MDNM/ bottom line for the
Cowboys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nearly four hours, this team opened the 1999
season by being good, bad, ugly, losers, determined, gallant, and
finally.MDBR/ .MDNM/....MDBR/ .MDNM/a deserving winner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey's postgame locker room speech to his club should
have been: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, forget everything we did out there today, but remember
it forever.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra would understand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys play like this every week, they won't win another
game. Either that, or they will go unbeaten for the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This 41-35 overtime classic against the Redskins rewrote some
history, erased some longstanding myths, and maybe, just maybe,
proved a point to Michael Irvin. And also proved another point
about Irvin, not to mention Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to me about everything today was watching us
.MDBR/be .MDNM/led by No. 8, No. 22 and No. 88,''.MDBR/[.MDNM/
said.MDBR/].MDNM/ Cowboys .MDBR/special teams[ .MDNM/specials'
team.MDBR/].MDNM/ coach Joe Avezzano.MDBR/ said.MDNM/. ``That kind
of took us back to our roots.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those, of course, are Super Bowl roots, which was another time
and another Cowboys' team, but.MDBR/ .MDNM/... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in the glory days, the knock on Aikman was two-fold.
Doesn't throw a good deep ball and doesn't bring back the Cowboys
from Sunday afternoon scoreboard holes. Yesterday, Troy knocked
down two myths for the price of one Redskins Stadium ticket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Down by 21 points to open the fourth quarter, Aikman whistled
three touchdown passes in a six-minute span, including overtime,
and for the final quarter and .MDBR/overtime[ .MDNM/OT.MDBR/].MDNM/
th.MDBR/r.MDNM/ew for 240 yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And about that longstanding deep ball pox on Troy's football
house.MDBR/ _ .MDNM/he air-mailed a perfect strike to an open
Rocket Ismail, who never broke stride in catching.MDBR/[.MDNM/ what
would be.MDBR/].MDNM/ a 76-yard overtime TD bomb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I rejoice in a great victory for this football team,'' said
Aikman, ``but definitely not in trying to prove my critics wrong
about comebacks or deep balls or anything else. I am far past that
point in my career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides, those who have mistakenly believed that over the
years won't change their minds just because of today. For me, it's
only about trying to win football games.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which sound.MDBR/e.MDNM/d lik.MDBR/e.MDNM/ a postgame echo from
the other members of the Cowboys' Hall of Fame trifecta, meaning
Emmitt and yes, also Irvin, despite some earlier grumbling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a play-action fake to Emmitt on third-and-two in overtime
that baffled the Washington.MDBR/ .MDNM/defen.MDBR/s.MDNM/e. The
entire secondary took a run-stopping step forward. By then, Ismail
was blowing by them and Aikman was setting up at his .MDBR/own[
.MDNM/won.MDBR/].MDNM/ 20.MDBR/-.MDNM/yard line for the long
heave. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt getting the call seemed a natural on this critical
third-and-two from.MDBR/ .MDNM/the 2.MDBR/4.MDNM/. He already had
109 yards rushing. But Gailey fooled everyone with a
go-for-the-jugular bomb. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I expected that play to be called at that point would
be lying,'' Aikman said. ``I thought we'd do what we do best.MDBR/
_ .MDNM/pound 'em .MDBR/\R.MDNM/with Emmitt.MDBR/\S.MDNM/. But when
the play came in, I'm thinking what a great call. I really thought
it'd work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is now praising Chan. But if it doesn't work, I
don't think you'd exactly be calling him creative,'' added Aikman,
laughing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On that point of Gailey's creativity, even many of his own
players were privately barking as the Cowboys fell behind by three
touchdowns in an awful third quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The offense was stagnant, leaving Dave Campo's defense
overexposed, and a blowout Washington .MDBR/victory[
.MDNM/win.MDBR/].MDNM/ was brewing. Gailey's play calling appeared
to stray from basic bread-and-butter. Not enough running from
Emmitt, and Irvin was sitting out an entire series once, plus
various plays here and there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you'd call it mad..MDBR/ .MDNM/...MDBR/.
.MDNM/O.MDBR/K.MDNM/, you can call it mad,'' said Irvin, smiling.
``It's hard, difficult, different, not to be in there all the time.
But did it work today? Yes.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   .MDBR/Said Aikman: .MDNM/``Michael wasn't pleased, and in the
third quarter I also felt we were getting away from the run, which
didn't make the offensive line happy at all.MDBR/.[ .MDNM/,'' said
Aikman. ``.MDBR/] .MDNM/But then it started to all come together.
We got back to the run, and got Michael going.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gailey matter-of-factly explained, ``I'm going to be mixing it
up in every game, and if it appears we stray from the run at times,
hopefully it will set up the run for later. Which it did
t.MDBR/o.MDNM/day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``With Michael, I personally heard no complaints, but I'd like
to think by resting him, it led to his great finish. When he made
the two late TD catches .MDBR/\R.MDNM/in the fourth
quarter.MDBR/\S.MDNM/, he sure looked fresh to me.'' Touche. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By doubling his TD catches from last season, Irvin
immediate.MDBR/l.MDNM/y left behind that stigma of faded
superstar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange kind of victory, yet over the long afternoon,
some questions were answered and stigmas were crushed on several
fronts. ``Plus, winning sure beats the alternative,'' Aikman said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just ask any of the Redskins. &QL;

   TIMOR-REFUGEES (Kupang, Indonesia) _ As the refugees huddle in
makeshift camps here, militia men roam the grounds menacingly. They
harass aid workers and journalists who try to visit the camps. And
they search for refugees who they believe voted for independence
for East Timor in the recent referendum. The situation in Kupang,
the capital of West Timor, is not as desperate as in East Timor,
where anti-independence gangs have killed thousands and destroyed
the capital, Dili. But the fear here is pervasive and paralyzing.
In visits to two large refugee camps on Sunday, it appeared that
the army and police are unwilling or unable to control the gangs,
which effectively run the camps. By Mark Landler.

METS CRUSH DODGERS, 10-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If only the Three Stooges had an opportunity to
work with this material.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing aside the refined pitching and clutch hitting that had
defined the first three games of this series, the New York Mets
defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10-3, in a game that started out
like normal baseball with two good pitchers and devolved into a
parade of such ridiculous plays that a laugh track should have been
playing on the loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   If this was no thing of beauty, then the results nonetheless
looked pretty good for the Mets. They are just two games behind the
Atlanta Braves in the National League East Division while remaining
two and a half games ahead of the Cincinnati Reds in the wild-card
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets led, 5-3, after the sixth inning and broke open the
game when the Dodgers' meltdown began. With the Dodgers' Eric
Gagne, who was making his second major league start, gone, reliever
Mike Judd was in to contribute to the comic chain of events. He
started by walking Roger Cedeno and Edgardo Alfonzo. John Olerud
singled to left, advancing the runners. But Cedeno ran past third,
and, a third of the way down the basepath to home, he turned to go
back. But Alfonzo was halfway to third himself.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, running like a kid who knew he was going to get yelled
at when he got home but figured he should go anyway, headed back to
third, catcher Paul LoDuca in pursuit. Cedeno and Alfonzo arrived
at third almost simultaneously, staring at each other briefly.
Alfonzo broke back for second, leaving the base for Cedeno and
taunting LoDuca to follow him. LoDuca did, and Alfonzo was tagged
out. But Cedeno remained safe on third.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza then hit a shot past third base that scored Cedeno
and Olerud. Judd walked Robin Ventura, and Shawon Dunston singled
in Piazza. Then the Dodgers put in reliever Robinson Checo. His
start fit in perfectly with this blooper reel: his first pitch was
sailed to the backstop and scored Ventura. The score was 9-3 and
mercifully, the inning ended that way.
</P>
<P>
   This series has largely hinged on pitching matchups, with subtle
swings and tiny mistakes determining the outcomes of the first
three games.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's game, the Mets had a clear advantage. They
were starting Kenny Rogers, who had gone 4-0 since joining the Mets
in late July. The Mets had won all but one of his eight starts, and
Rogers was coming off a four-hit shutout of the Giants. The
Dodgers, on the other hand, had Gagne _ who was named the Texas
League pitcher of the year for the Dodgers' Class AA team in San
Antonio, and he got in trouble immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who was batting leadoff because Rickey Henderson had the
night off, hit a ground-rule double that bounced over the
center-field fence. Edgardo Alfonzo was up next. Since he went 6
for 6 with three home runs against Houston on Aug. 30, Alfonzo has
been in a slump, going 6 for 37. But on Sunday night, Alfonzo timed
his swing perfectly and blasted a home run to left field to give
the Mets an early 2-0 lead. That gave Alfonzo 100 runs batted in,
the first time three Mets _ Piazza and Ventura are the others _
have driven in at least 100 runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers began well, retiring the side in the first and second
innings. But he had tweaked his left hamstring while running
Saturday, and he appeared to tire in the third. Facing the bottom
of the Dodgers' order, he walked Adrian Beltre to open the inning.
LoDuca, batting eighth, hit a roller to Ventura, whose throw to
first bounced in the dirt and rolled toward the camera pit to the
right of the dugout. Beltre went to third and LoDuca to second on
Ventura's error, the first he has committed since July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne grounded out to short, scoring Beltre, and LoDuca scored
on Eric Young's flare to left center. The Dodgers went ahead by 3-2
in the fifth when Gagne singled to right and scored on a double by
Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, though, Gagne was facing the heart of the Mets'
order for the third time. He retired Alfonzo and Olerud but walked
Piazza and yielded a single to Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Dunston, in the lineup because Darryl Hamilton bruised his knee
while hitting the wall as he made a catch on Saturday night, laced
a 1-2 pitch for a double that was barely fair down the third-base
line. It rolled into the corner as left fielder Gary Sheffield went
after it. Piazza scored easily, and the third-base coach Cookie
Rojas waved the slow-running Ventura home, too.
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca squatted and braced for impact. If he made the tag, the
inning would be over with the score tied. But Ventura ran to
LoDuca's right, practically lifting LoDuca's shoulder with his body
as he tumbled around him. LoDuca lost his grip on the ball, and
Ventura completed his roll with the aplomp of Olga Korbut, reaching
out to tag home. The Mets led, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers was the beneficiary. Despite allowing 10 hits, three
walks and three runs in seven innings, he earned the victory.

A STRANGE DAY, BUT IT'S A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ It was an overwhelming football afternoon, which
ended with a blurry, yet ecstatic bottom line for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of nearly four hours, this team opened the 1999
season by being good, bad, ugly, losers, determined, gallant, and
finally ... a deserving winner.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey's postgame locker room speech to his club should
have been:
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys, forget everything we did out there today, but remember
it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra would understand.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys play like this every week, they won't win another
game. Either that, or they will go unbeaten for the season.
</P>
<P>
   This 41-35 overtime classic against the Redskins rewrote some
history, erased some longstanding myths, and maybe, just maybe,
proved a point to Michael Irvin. And also proved another point
about Irvin, not to mention Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to me about everything today was watching us be
led by No. 8, No. 22 and No. 88,'' Cowboys special teams coach Joe
Avezzano said. ``That kind of took us back to our roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Those, of course, are Super Bowl roots, which was another time
and another Cowboys' team, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Even in the glory days, the knock on Aikman was two-fold.
Doesn't throw a good deep ball and doesn't bring back the Cowboys
from Sunday afternoon scoreboard holes. Yesterday, Troy knocked
down two myths for the price of one Redskins Stadium ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 21 points to open the fourth quarter, Aikman whistled
three touchdown passes in a six-minute span, including overtime,
and for the final quarter and overtime threw for 240 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And about that longstanding deep ball pox on Troy's football
house _ he air-mailed a perfect strike to an open Rocket Ismail,
who never broke stride in catching a 76-yard overtime TD bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rejoice in a great victory for this football team,'' said
Aikman, ``but definitely not in trying to prove my critics wrong
about comebacks or deep balls or anything else. I am far past that
point in my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides, those who have mistakenly believed that over the
years won't change their minds just because of today. For me, it's
only about trying to win football games.''
</P>
<P>
   Which sounded like a postgame echo from the other members of the
Cowboys' Hall of Fame trifecta, meaning Emmitt and yes, also Irvin,
despite some earlier grumbling.
</P>
<P>
   It was a play-action fake to Emmitt on third-and-two in overtime
that baffled the Washington defense. The entire secondary took a
run-stopping step forward. By then, Ismail was blowing by them and
Aikman was setting up at his own 20-yard line for the long heave.
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt getting the call seemed a natural on this critical
third-and-two from the 24. He already had 109 yards rushing. But
Gailey fooled everyone with a go-for-the-jugular bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I expected that play to be called at that point would
be lying,'' Aikman said. ``I thought we'd do what we do best _
pound 'em \Rwith Emmitt\S. But when the play came in, I'm thinking
what a great call. I really thought it'd work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is now praising Chan. But if it doesn't work, I
don't think you'd exactly be calling him creative,'' added Aikman,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   On that point of Gailey's creativity, even many of his own
players were privately barking as the Cowboys fell behind by three
touchdowns in an awful third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The offense was stagnant, leaving Dave Campo's defense
overexposed, and a blowout Washington victory was brewing. Gailey's
play calling appeared to stray from basic bread-and-butter. Not
enough running from Emmitt, and Irvin was sitting out an entire
series once, plus various plays here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you'd call it mad. ... OK, you can call it
mad,'' said Irvin, smiling. ``It's hard, difficult, different, not
to be in there all the time. But did it work today? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Aikman: ``Michael wasn't pleased, and in the third quarter
I also felt we were getting away from the run, which didn't make
the offensive line happy at all. But then it started to all come
together. We got back to the run, and got Michael going.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey matter-of-factly explained, ``I'm going to be mixing it
up in every game, and if it appears we stray from the run at times,
hopefully it will set up the run for later. Which it did today.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Michael, I personally heard no complaints, but I'd like
to think by resting him, it led to his great finish. When he made
the two late TD catches \Rin the fourth quarter\S, he sure looked
fresh to me.'' Touche.
</P>
<P>
   By doubling his TD catches from last season, Irvin immediately
left behind that stigma of faded superstar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange kind of victory, yet over the long afternoon,
some questions were answered and stigmas were crushed on several
fronts. ``Plus, winning sure beats the alternative,'' Aikman said.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask any of the Redskins. \Ntagtop:Randy Galloway's ``Sports
at Six'' can be heard weeknights, 6-8 p.m., on WBAP NewsTalk 820.

CANSECO SOUNDING UPBEAT ABOUT FUTURE WITH RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ He was gone in a blink, like a lightning bolt in
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail's business was done. His presence duly
noted. His impact upon the day's events stunningly established.
</P>
<P>
   And his locker was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Rocket Ismail doesn't do interviews. When asked, he more or less
politely declines. He doesn't offer an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   And thus, by the time that most of the assembled media had
reached the giddy locker room Sunday after the Dallas Cowboys'
41-35 overtime victory, Ismail was long gone, safely harbored on
the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure. Millions of words are written about the Cowboys in
any given NFL season. Scan the radio dial, troll the cable TV
channels, and there's a Cowboy being quoted every hour.
</P>
<P>
   But win a desperate season opener, memorably coming from 21
points behind in the fourth quarter, and the Cowboys receiver who
scored the electric, deciding touchdown doesn't utter a peep?
</P>
<P>
   This just in _ ``Rocket wins the first, then takes the fifth.''
Silent film at 11.
</P>
<P>
   In so many ways, this was Troy Aikman's day. A day when Aikman,
after it was all tallied and done, could stifle the critics and
debunk the myths. And it was also Emmitt Smith's day, and Michael
Irvin's.
</P>
<P>
   And let me suggest that it was a poignant day for owner Jerry
Jones and his head coach. It was Jones, after all, who passed over
higher-profile names to hire the unassuming Chan Gailey. And it was
Gailey whose offense ran aground late in his first season and had
begun to inspire doubts.
</P>
<P>
   A loss to the Washington Redskins, which seemed profoundly
possible as Sunday's fourth quarter began, would have incited the
wolves _ count me in, I'll admit _ who thought Gailey hadn't proven
anything, except that he wasn't Barry Switzer.
</P>
<P>
   But how things can turn. In the first quarter, a play-action
fake to Smith had frozen the Washington defense, and Aikman had
lofted a rainbow to Ismail at the Redskins' 10-yard line. A
would-be 54-yard touchdown pass slipped right through Rocket's
fickle arms.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third period, Gailey's alleged signature
offense had dug the Cowboys a 35-14 hole. Ismail, the team's most
prominent free-agent signing, had ``stretched'' the Washington
defense for only 21 not-so-elastic yards.
</P>
<P>
   As the Redskins' Larry Centers said, ``We had them down. We
should have gone into a feeding frenzy and really finished them
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Gailey put it later, the Cowboys fell back on their
``character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when it looked like we were getting pushed
around the field,'' the coach said. ``And that's what wins games
like this _ character.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-llll, to be accurate, the Redskins helped. They twice lost
fumbles inside the Cowboys' 10-yard line. They shied away from a
game-turning onside kick. They leaped offside three times on the
visitors' tying touchdown drive. And with the game theirs for the
final taking, in the waning three seconds of regulation time, the
Redskins botched a field-goal snap.
</P>
<P>
   Character? It was more a case of the Redskins acting out a death
wish.
</P>
<P>
   But it took something on the Cowboys' part to answer the
opportunity. Something they didn't often have last season.
</P>
<P>
   Something like the lightning-quick Ismail. And a fit and
confident Emmitt Smith. And Irvin, again playing with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin paid homage to Ismail's presence, noting, ``Having a guy
with that kind of speed, you can't help but respect it. Today I saw
some one-on-one coverage. And that's a blessing from God.''
</P>
<P>
   In the game's final 19 minutes, Ismail caught five passes for
128 yards. Irvin, with elbow room, caught three for 62 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Gailey offense burst to life. Suddenly, Owner
Jones looked like a genius again, for hiring Gailey, and signing
Ismail, and re-signing center Mark Stepnoski, and not giving up on
Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, even for inviting his royal good-luck charm, Prince
Bandar of Saudi Arabia, to rejoin him in the visiting owner's box,
as the Cowboys knocked off Washington for the fourth consecutive
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were trailing there, Prince Bandar leaned in my ear
and told me that General Patton said he always wanted to lead
desperate men into battle,'' Jones related.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the Super Bowl wins, I think this was the most
exciting thing I've ever been a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet from Owner Jones sat Ismail's silent, empty locker. A
Cowboy who doesn't bask in the spotlight? Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   It was like old times for the new Cowboys. It was like the old
script, rewritten with a new twist.
</P>
<P>
   It could mean everything. It could mean nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Don't know yet. But if you're going somewhere, I'd say hitching
a Rocket is a good start. nn

ROCKET LAUNCH IN OVERTIME CAPS WILD COWBOYS COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Ray Buck 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ The Cowboys' 41-35 overtime victory against
Washington in the season opener yesterday at Redskins Stadium
wasn't artistic, but then sweating rarely is.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, their missed tackles, dropped passes and
penalty-ridden drives all were forgotten on one spectacular 76-yard
pass play from Troy Aikman to newcomer Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail,
who was playing in his first game that counted in a Dallas uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in a Redskins uniform has touched Ismail yet.
</P>
<P>
   With that one immaculate reception, as uncluttered a picture of
a game-ending pass play as you will ever see, a crowd of 79,237 sat
in stunned silence. It was the largest crowd in Maryland sports
event, excluding the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ismail gathered in the ball at the Washington 40 and
made his courtesy dash to the end zone, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
looked like a man who had chased down a speeding bus.
</P>
<P>
   On the other sideline, Redskins coach Norv Turner looked like a
man who had just been run over by the same bus.
</P>
<P>
   The local media already is on job-security watch, wondering how
new Redskins owner Daniel Snyder will react to Turner's letting his
team blow a 35-14 fourth-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, who extended their NFL-best opening-day record
to 30-9-1, this Rocket-fueled comeback tied the club record for the
biggest comeback in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an awfully big show of character by our football
team,'' Gailey said. ``Our execution at times wasn't good on both
sides of the ball, and at times it looked like we were getting
pushed around on the field ... but our character never faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what wins ... character. And I think we can build on
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman called it ``the wildest football game that I've ever been
part of.''
</P>
<P>
   It indeed was a wild ride with plenty of warts. It also was a
victory that allows the Cowboys to begin a season beset by injuries
and a suspension totally committed to Gailey's philosophy of
getting everybody involved.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey's idea is to have a different star every game. He rests
his front-liners. He rotates in and out his reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's game-stopper came on the 12th play of overtime ...
after Richie Cunningham's extra-point kick caromed off the left
upright and forced overtime with 1 minute, 46 seconds in regulation
... after Washington won the toss and had the ball first in
overtime ... after the Cowboys started from their own 5-yard line
in overtime ... before Daryl Johnston fell on an Emmitt Smith
fumble on the first offensive play to keep the dream alive.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of sweating before this one was over.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ismail dropped that same pass on the same pass play
earlier in the game. But this game was less about pretty and more
about pride and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys jumped out in front, 14-3, one play into the second
quarter as Aikman, with the first five-touchdown game of his
11-year NFL career, hooked up with tight end David LaFleur for
touchdown passes of 15 and 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas went into mistake mode in the middle quarters, compiling
more penalties than big plays, and tumbled behind 35-14 as
Washington quarterback Brad Johnson, under little pass-rush
pressure, picked apart the Cowboys' secondary. Receivers Michael
Westbrook and Albert Connell finished with 159 and 137 yards,
respectively, on a combined nine receptions and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' comeback began with Smith's scoring on a 1-yard
pitch to the left, Toss 39 Bob, in which Smith followed Johnston's
lead block just like the old days. It was Dallas' first points
since the first play of the second quarter, and it came with 10:43
left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a lot of the new stuff,'' Johnston said, ``but
maybe old style. That's the mentality we've had here in the past:
Don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey ordered up an onside kick, and rookie Dat Nguyen
recovered for the Cowboys. When that didn't lead to any points,
Johnston admitted, ``We had to bring ourselves up again.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Cowboys' defense forced the Redskins to run three
plays and punt, Aikman went to his longtime favorite target,
Michael Irvin, for a 37-yard touchdown pass that Irvin caught in
spite of pass interference. Barely two minutes later, Irvin caught
a 12-yard touchdown pass that Aikman simply drilled into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, Irvin had doubled his touchdown total from last
season, and the Cowboys were headed for overtime and a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the way we did, I think is going to help us,'' Irvin
said. ``We have some guys who haven't been to war with us, and we
haven't been to war with them ... a game like this, you start
trusting one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismail caught a team-high eight passes for 149 yards; Irvin,
five passes for 122 yards, and went much of the middle two quarters
without even being in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different approach for me,'' Irvin explained. ``But
I've said before, I'll try anything as long as it works. And that
means winning.''
</P>
<P>
   First game into a new season, it definitely worked.

AGASSI'S COMEBACK TRAIL ENDS IN TRIUMPH AT U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ Andre Agassi's journey to the
mountaintop is complete.
</P>
<P>
   His long, arduous trip from the depths of the tennis world, from
the lows of triple-figure rankings and the ignominy of having to
play challenger events, ended Sunday with both feet firmly planted
at the peak.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi defeated Todd Martin, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-7 (2-7), 6-3,
6-3, to win the U.S. Open men's singles championship, solidifying
his grasp on the No. 1 ranking by winning his second Grand Slam
title of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accomplish two Slams, which is something no one else did
this year, makes me feel I'm the best,'' Agassi said. ``This is
what you play for. I'm appreciating this time of my life. It feels
good to accomplish it, definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Agassi was ranked No. 141 and his immense talent
appeared squandered
</P>
<P>
   That's when Agassi rededicated himself, and began the journey
that ended Sunday in Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a choice if I was really going to play the game
or quit,'' Agassi said. ``If I was going to play, I had a lot of
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The final leg up the mountain was unexpectedly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was the second seed. Martin was seeded seventh. Agassi
was the heavy favorite. Martin was the foil.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, though, pushed Agassi to excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Todd deserved to be in the finals,'' Agassi said. ``The way he
played it was disappointing that someone had to lose. He played so
well. I felt like I was hanging on by a thread most of the match.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi won the first set by the smallest of margins. He broke
Martin in the second game, then battled back from a 0-40 deficit
the next time he served.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't do anything with Martin's serve the next two sets,
though. Martin mixed it up, serving hard shots down the middle and
changeups wide. He followed his first serve to the net and knocked
off volleys. He was solid on his groundstrokes.
</P>
<P>
   Martin couldn't break Agassi either, and the second and third
sets went into tiebreakers. Martin won both, not because of Agassi
mistakes _ he had only 23 unforced errors _ but because he played
great tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The underdog had the lead and the crowd roared, sensing an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had a chance to win,'' Martin said. ``I knew I needed
to keep playing well on my serve and better on his serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi realized he was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very worried,'' Agassi said. ``He gave me a lot to worry
about. Not only was he serving great but he was volleying
magnificently, and holding his own from the baseline. My goal in
the fourth was to take care of my serve and hang in there until
something good happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi took care of his serve. He wasn't broken all match,
fighting off all eight break points against him.
</P>
<P>
   The good thing happened in the third game of the fourth set,
when Agassi broke when Martin pushed a volley long.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set wasn't close.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who played an exhausting, five-set match against Greg
Rusedski in the fourth round, began to wear down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem was I lost my legs a little bit,'' Martin
said. ``When that happened, the serve is what goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi broke Martin for a 2-0 lead in the fifth set, and held
for 3-0. To emphasize that he was the fresher player, he sprinted
to his chair on the changeover, while Martin slowly walked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like he dropped off a hair, and I was able to
maintain,'' Agassi said. ``It seemed more physical than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi sprinted to the chair again two games later, when he had
a 4-1 lead. Martin faced the same deficit in the fifth set against
Rusedski, and came back. It wasn't in him Sunday, though.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi held, then broke Martin again to win the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He beat me when I played a very good match,'' Martin said. ``I
feel very good about being at the 1999 Open. I would have loved to
have been the champion, but playing the seven matches I did I feel
very good about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as good as the man who sits atop the tennis world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you ever make up for missed opportunities,''
he said. ``The best you can do is not live in regret. What I missed
out on earlier in my career I'll never get back, but it's nice to
get another opportunity at it. Who knows if I could have
accomplished more. But there's still time.'' nn

SERENA STEALS SHOW AT AMERICA'S SLAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. _ They call the U.S. Open ``America's
Slam.'' Not this year. This tournament was ``Serena's Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away from Broadway, Serena Williams was the star of
this production. The 17-year-old won the women's singles Saturday
and co-starred with 18-year-old sister Venus on Sunday to win the
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking maybe next year I should try to enter the men's
event and see if I can at least win a round,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was only kidding. Then again, she could probably do it.
</P>
<P>
   There were some great moments in this year's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi was a compelling story. He capped a return from
career oblivion by clinching the No. 1 ranking with a victory
against Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the semifinals. Then, Sunday, he came
from behind to beat Todd Martin in five tough sets and win his
second Grand Slam singles title of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long road for me and one that I'm proud of,''
Agassi said. ``It means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the gentleman tennis player, played the tournament of
his life. He survived a tough first-round match against unheralded
Stephane Huet in the first round and came from two sets down to
beat Greg Rusedski in the third round. He played much better than
expected Sunday, turning what was supposed to be a rout into a
nail-biter by pushing Agassi to five sets.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov created a buzz when he predicted only three men, he,
Agassi and Richard Krajicek, could win the Open. Krajicek served a
record 49 aces against Kafelnikov, and still lost.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, one-time troubled teen Jennifer Capriati
made it to the fourth round before losing to Monica Seles. In her
subsequent postmatch news conference, she read a prepared statement
that she would field no more questions about her past, then left in
tears when the subject wouldn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   There were great shots, including Cedric Pioline's running
passing shot that prompted Gustavo Kuerten to congratulate him in
the middle of a game, and the stabbed one-handed backhand that
Hingis somehow got into the court against Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament also raised a couple of key questions.
</P>
<P>
   Can Pete Sampras, who was favored to win and break the tie he
holds with Roy Emerson for most Grand Slam titles but missed the
event because of a back injury, return to challenge Agassi for
tennis supremacy?
</P>
<P>
   Can Seles get in shape and challenge the current crop of
teen-agers?
</P>
<P>
   It was a tournament that lost some luster when Sampras couldn't
play and defending champion Patrick Rafter withdrew in the first
round because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was a tournament that overcame that with equal parts
great tennis and great drama.
</P>
<P>
   And squarely on center stage was Serena Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams family commanded the spotlight from Day One, when
papa Richard predicted an all-daughter final.
</P>
<P>
   Few believed him. Venus was in the same bracket as Hingis, the
top-ranked woman who was on top of her game. Serena, the seventh
seed, was in the same bracket as No. 2 seed and defending champion
Lindsay Davenport and the fourth-seeded Seles.
</P>
<P>
   If either sister made it to the final, it was supposed to be
Venus. Serena, in her second full year on tour, had never made it
past the quarterfinals of a major. Venus had experienced big-time,
big-match pressure and seemed ready to win her first Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Serena, though, upstaged her sister. She beat Seles in the
quarterfinals and Davenport in the semis. In the final she met
Hingis, who had shattered Richard Williams' dreams with a victory
over Venus in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   Serena destroyed Hingis in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   In taking the spotlight, the sisters energized women's tennis.
Attendance at the National Tennis Center hit record highs. TV
ratings were up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be part of what's happening,'' Venus said.
``Right now, this is what's happening. People are running to be
part of it. Honestly. If you saw something good, wouldn't you want
to be part of it? I would.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters figure to be a part of it for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Open provided a glimpse of the future of tennis, and
it is beaded and brash.
</P>
<P>
   The future of tennis is two teen-agers from Compton, Calif., who
move better than anyone in the women's game, hit the ball harder
than anyone in the women's game, serve faster than anyone in the
women's game and, with the possible exception of Hingis, are more
confident than anyone else in the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   The future belongs to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the present, this year's U.S. Open, was Serena's slam. nn

WIN CAN'T KEEP VIKINGS FROM GRUMBLING
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As the high-fives and chest thumping filled the
visitors locker room here Sunday, Minnesota Vikings offensive
coordinator Ray Sherman sounded like a man whose team had lost by
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He snapped at a reporter, he refused to answer questions, and he
was defensive when he did answer.
</P>
<P>
   In a rematch of the 1998 NFC Championship Game, the Vikings
might have won a measure of revenge with a 17-14 victory against
the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   But their offense Sunday looked nothing like the juggernaut that
scored a league-record 556 points last season. And so Sherman was
left to defend a unit that scored its fewest points since a 14-13
loss to Detroit on Dec. 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won the game, didn't we?,'' he barked in the direction of
ESPN reporter Andrea Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman has a point. Problem is, points are suddenly becoming
hard to come by for Sherman-coached offenses. Sherman was the
Vikings' quarterbacks coach in that loss to the Lions nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Sherman replaced Chan Gailey as the offensive
coordinator in Pittsburgh. But the Steelers, who went to the AFC
Championship Game in 1997, didn't even make the playoffs in 1998.
Sherman, whose offense once bored Kordell Stewart to tears, was
fired.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green rehired Sherman as an offensive
assistant after the 1998 season, and then promoted Sherman to
offensive coordinator when Chip Myers died of a heart attack Feb.
23.
</P>
<P>
   In Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Randall Cunningham, and Robert
Smith, Sherman inherited a Mercedes, equipped with all the bells
and whistles. Yet, there must be sugar in the gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   In four preseason games, the Vikings' first-team offense scored
27 points. Sunday, the passing game looked unimaginative, with
Cunningham either throwing it deep or dumping it short. (Mostly, he
dumped it short, averaging a measly 5.6 yards per attempt). Moss
didn't have a reception longer than nine yards. Smith, the featured
running back, was held to 2.9 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a very aggressive game plan,'' Cunningham said. ``They
just did some things that made us not look aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The elements _ and a Falcons defense ranked No. 8 last season _
combined to hold the Vikings to less than 300 yards of total
offense. Minnesota failed to score in three of the four quarters.
Two of their scoring drives came with help from the referee; Moss
drew pass interference calls on both of the Vikings' touchdown
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Yo Ray, could Sherman Hemsley have done a better job?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk about the comparisons to last year and
what we did today,'' Sherman said. ``We scored 27 points (in the
NFC Championship Game) and we lost, didn't we? Our job was to find
a way to win the game. The Falcons get paid to play too. The point
structure didn't matter. We won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No, surprise, the Vikings' defense won the game. Forced to play
with four new starters because of free agency, the Vikings' defense
bore down on the ``Dirty Birds,'' limiting running back Jamal
Anderson to 50 yards on 16 carries, and sacking quarterback Chris
Chandler twice, knocking him out of the game with a hamstring
injury with 3:58 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deserved a lot of criticism for the way we played last
year,'' cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock said. ``We had a lot of marquee
players who didn't step up and do the job. We lost a couple of guys
in free agency, but the core is still here. And that core of guys
got the job done today.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that Ray Sherman, somewhere, is breathing a sigh of
relief, and muttering to himself, ``didn't we win the game?''
</P>
<P>

STEELERS CRUSH BROWNS, 43-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ In the parking lot outside Cleveland Browns Stadium
there were grown men wearing dog bones on their heads, and they
weren't ashamed. That of course means all is right again in the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments in sports that can warm even the hardest
hearts. Football returning to Cleveland is one of those times.
Nothing could dampen the excitement. Not the at-times obnoxious way
every local car dealer, grocery store and bank tried to jump on the
bandwagon. Not the dark clouds and the loud claps of thunder that
threatened rain.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Pittsburgh Steelers could ruin this night. It would
have added to the storybook feel if the Browns had won, but that
was asking for a little too much. Thus Pittsburgh won, 43-0, in
what was largely an unremarkable game.
</P>
<P>
   The game may have been a dud, but the significance of it was
not. In 1995, the owner Art Modell moved his team from Cleveland to
Baltimore. It took almost five years, but the Browns, one of
professional football's most storied franchises, is playing again.
The city of Cleveland could not have been more ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uniqueness of this situation, the game had almost
a Super Bowl feel to it, and the 73,138 fans stayed glued to their
seats, cheering the Browns well into the fourth quarter. They did
so despite the lopsided nature of the contest in which the Browns
gained 1 yard in the third quarter. And they stayed when the rookie
quarterback Tim Couch, the No. 1 pick in the draft, entered the
contest with 10 minutes 47 seconds remaining and threw an
interception on his first pass as a professional.
</P>
<P>
   All week the city of Cleveland had treated the return of the
Browns like it was a spiritual event. When Browns linebacker Chris
Spielman retired it did not matter that he had spent most of his
career with the Detroit Lions _ or that he had never played a down
in the regular season in a Cleveland uniform _ local stations
interrupted their afternoon programming to cover his retirement
news conference live.
</P>
<P>
   Signs welcoming back the team adorned the city on Sunday,
especially downtown. Fans flooded the stadium, inside and out,
wearing orange dresses or orange T-shirts or orange pants. Dog
masks sold for $14 a shot. People chewed on dog bones _ some fake,
some real. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue made an appearance at the
game, expressing how great a day this is for the league.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dawg Pound was back.
</P>
<P>
   A small corner of the $283 million stadium was designated for
the people wearing the dog masks. Almost every television camera
and microphone within a 50-mile radius paid a visit to the pound,
which was as big an attraction as the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium, the night, was one big celebration, and when the
Browns came running onto the field, they seemed to sense that this
evening was indeed special. Some went to the stands and high-fived
fans wearing orange wigs, and this was before the game even began.
</P>
<P>
   Once it started, Browns fans did see some early treats. On the
Steelers' opening offensive possession it was clear that the new
offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride has put his stamp on the team.
Pittsburgh twice went to five wide receiver sets and picked apart
Cleveland's defense, spicing the razzle-dazzle with the occasional
Jerome Bettis bulldozer-like run or option by quarterback Kordell
Stewart. But on fourth down and one inch at the Cleveland 22-yard
line Stewart's sneak up the middle was stopped by the Cleveland
defenders. That got the fans to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   But, in terms of on-field highlights for the Browns, that was
about it. The team's return to the city is one of the best football
stories this season, maybe this decade, yet it did not take long
for reality to set in. Cleveland is an expansion team and, unlike
expansion cousins Carolina and Jacksonville, there will likely be
no Cinderella playoff run. The Browns have little talent and it did
not take long for the Steelers to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's next two drives ended in scores. The first was
after Browns quarterback Ty Detmer threw an interception that
Pittsburgh converted into a five-play, 39-yard drive that
culminated in a Stewart 1-yard touchdown run. The Steelers followed
that with a 19-yard field goal for a 10-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with about five minutes remaining in the first half,
Stewart connected with running back Richard Huntley after he beat
defensive back Marlon Forbes on a 5-yard crossing pattern. Just
before the half the Steelers added a 28-yard field goal to give
Pittsburgh a 20-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   What had been a raucous beginning dimmed to a quiet simmer. Of
course the fans, an ocean of orange in the stands, did not leave.
They did not boo. There was a sort of unspoken understanding. This
was one of those times when a city was just happy to see its team
play, even if it did not play that well. &QL;

FINAL SCORE CONSOLES COWBOYS DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. _ Cornerback Kevin Mathis and the Dallas Cowboys
defense survived two onslaughts at Redskins Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The first one came on the field during the Cowboys' improbable
41-35 overtime victory against the Washington Redskins _ a victory
even though Dallas allowed 504 yards of total offense, including
369 yards passing.
</P>
<P>
   The second one came in the postgame locker room, as members of
the defense were unable to enjoy the miraculous 21-point comeback
victory because of repeated questions about their shoddy
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, largely responsible for Redskins receiver Michael
Westbrook's video-game-like output of five catches for 159 yards
and one touchdown, accepted responsibility for his play. But he
refused to be denied the pleasure of celebrating the season-opening
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in my play,'' Mathis said. ``I got a lot of
things to work. But I'm going to stay focused to get better next
week. But we play as a team. We came a way with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat lost in rumble, however, was that part of the reason
the Cowboys came away with a victory was because Mathis and the
defense played better in the fourth quarter and overtime, when they
held the Redskins scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear what the Redskins' offense did in the first three
quarters of the game. Quarterback Brad Johnson targeted Mathis and
nickel cornerback Charlie Williams, who started in place of injured
cornerback Deion Sanders (toe).
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas A&AMP;M receiver Albert Connell benefited along with
Westbrook, catching four balls for 137 yards, including a 50-yard
touchdown reception on which he seemingly ripped the ball out of
the hands of Williams before racing to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys expected the Redskins to take advantage of their
injury-depleted secondary _ which also played without veteran
cornerback Kevin Smith (back injury). But what they didn't expect,
said defensive-line coach Jim Bates, was for Redskins running back
Stephen Davis to conjure up memories of former Washington legend
John Riggins. Davis plowed for 109 yards on 24 carries, mostly
through the middle of the Cowboys' Leon Lett-less defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really did a good job of game-planning us,'' Bates said.
``We wouldn't have thought they could run like that. They ran well
and gashed us several times.''
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened during the Cowboys' own offensive
onslaught in the fourth quarter. The defense joined in the fun with
a few plays themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the whole defense to together at the beginning of the
fourth quarter and told them to keep their heads in it,'' Bates
said. ``We told them we are going to get it together. The offense
scored and changed the momentum, and the defense followed
through.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 35-14 lead into the fourth quarter, the Redskins
came up empty on five consecutive possessions, including four
punts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' game-winning drive was set up by a sack by
defensive end Greg Ellis, his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense didn't play well by no stretch of the
imagination,'' Ellis said. ``And we won't be happy when we see the
film. But you've got to keep in mind we did win.''
</P>
<P>
   IRVIN FUMES THEN SHINES Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin's
back-into-the-limelight day of 122 yards and two touchdowns began
with him catching passes of 34 and 26 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He followed the second catch with a gyrating dance that riled
the packed house of Redskins fans.
</P>
<P>
   There is some question, however, as to who Irvin was aiming his
``I'm still a bad man'' taunts at, considering that the Cowboys
tried to trade him during the off-season and then administered a
game plan to cut back on his time.
</P>
<P>
   The television shots of a seething Irvin sitting on the sideline
during a third-quarter offensive possession when the Cowboys were
down 28-14 were quite telling.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who sat for a total of 18 plays in the game, accepted
being on the bench in the first and second quarter. But down 28-14
in the third quarter and watching your offense go three-and-out
without you was another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say I was mad,'' Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   He was back in the game in the fourth quarter, and it seemed
like old times. Irvin keyed the Cowboys' comeback with a 37-yard
touchdown catch and 12-yarder on his patented slant route to tie
the game. The two scores doubled his touchdown output for all of
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the two touchdowns) was great,'' Irvin said. ``I didn't
want to go through the spell of one touchdown catch and then it was
here we go again.''
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to duplicate last season is at the root of the
Cowboys' decision to rest Irvin, 31, during games. Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey said the mission is to keep his star receiver fresh
late in the season, but he wondered out loud if the plan was the
reason for Irvin's fourth-quarter outburst Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An elated Irvin wasn't in a disagreeing mood after the game,
saying ``it worked (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll accept anything as long as we win,'' Irvin said. ``But
it's not going to be easy for me. I'm used to playing all the time.
This was different.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM The Redskins were not the only ones
confused by Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's play calling Sunday, as
several Cowboys questioned why he abandoned the running game during
the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins never did get a handle on running back Emmitt
Smith, who rushed 23 times for 109 yards, including six carries in
the first quarter to power two touchdown drives (the second
touchdown came on the first play of the second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Smith carried the ball just seven times in the middle two
quarters when the Cowboys' offense registered zero points.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gailey's bent to mix it up paid off in the end when
the Cowboys game-winning touchdown pass came against a defense
expecting a run.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Michael Myers entered the season as the
favorite to replace suspended defensive tackle Leon Lett in the
lineup. But a poor preseason cost him a starting job. Now he is at
the bottom of the depth chart at defensive tackle, as he was made
inactive for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Questions that tackle Flozell Adams, who is deaf in one ear,
committed a couple of motion penalties because of his hearing were
quickly shot down by Gailey. He said the Cowboys were going on a
silent count when Adams got the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ROCKET GO DEEP If it was the playground, the Cowboys'
game-winning play would simply be called Rocket Go Deep. That's
certainly how it looked.
</P>
<P>
   But things weren't that simple. It couldn't have been, or the
Redskins would have least put somebody in the same zip code of
receiver Raghib Ismail on his catch of Cowboys quarterback Troy
Aikman's 76-yard overtime pass.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Redskins lose the battle with Ismail's speed,
but they were done in by the formation, the play call and the play
fake.
</P>
<P>
   What's ironic is that the Cowboys ran the same play earlier in
the game, but a wide-open Ismail dropped the ball. Yet, they didn't
know what hit them when the Cowboys lined up in the same formation
in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a third-and-two at their own 24-yard line, Chan Gailey
took receiver Michael Irvin out of the game and sent in an extra
tight end. The Redskins looked at the Cowboys' lineup and saw two
tight ends, fullback Daryl Johnston and tailback Emmitt Smith and
thought run.
</P>
<P>
   That belief was buoyed by the fact that Gailey had opted for
running plays on a number of third-and-shorts throughout the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   So when Aikman faked a handoff to Smith, both Redskins safeties
took a couple of steps forward. Then it was too late to catch
Ismail, who sold the play by pretending to block before darting
straight down the middle of the field. Aikman lofted a perfect pass
that Ismail caught in full stride.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dogpile in the end zone, that was straight off the
playground.
</P>
<P>
   GAME BALLS The rule of sports is that the hero is the person who
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Raghib Ismail's career-best performance _ eight catches
for 149 yards and one touchdown _ certainly qualifies.
</P>
<P>
   Other game-ball superlatives:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith rushed 24 times for 109 yards, topping
the 100-yard barrier for the 50th time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Michael Irvin's 122-yard effort put him over the
100-yard mark for the 47th time.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman's career-high five touchdown passes tied
the team record shared by Eddie LeBaron, Don Meredith, Craig Morton
and Danny White.
UP NEXT
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will be hard-pressed to top Sunday's season-opening
victory for sheer excitement. However, Game 2, set for next Monday
against the defending NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the home
opener, could feature a nice caveat _ the return of injured
cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a stretch to think that Sanders might time his
return from toe surgery to coincide with a Prime Time affair
against his old team on ``Monday Night Football''.
</P>
<P>
   It could also feature a dance-off between Sanders and his
to-legit-to-quit two-step and Falcons dirty-bird dancing running
back Jamal Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the game is concerned, the Cowboys must be better
against the run than they were Sunday, or Anderson will win by
default.

M'S CAN'T BUY A BREAK IN 4-1 LOSS TO ORIOLES

   BALTIMORE _ Ken Griffey Jr. came in from center field.
Infielders Alex Rodriguez and David Bell came out. And the pop fly
by Eugene Kingsale, who was leading off the fifth inning for the
Baltimore Orioles, landed in the center of a Mariner triangle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in no-man's land,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly where the Mariners find themselves this morning
after three games of a maddening four-game series at Oriole Park at
Camden Yards. That little single Sunday touched off a rally that
B.J. Surhoff capped with a two-out, three-run home run, the crucial
blow in a 4-1 Mariners loss.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsale was erased on a fielder's choice, and the next batter
flied out. But after Mike Bordick singled, Surhoff drove a high
fastball from John Halama (11-7) over the wall in right-center
field for his 27th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 2-0 (in the count), and he's feeling comfortable,''
said Halama, who lasted into the eighth inning. ``I needed to throw
a strike. He's going to be aggressive, and he just beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true, but the Mariners have had One of Those Series _ the
kind where the other side turns the freak double play, gets the
back-to-back infield hits and watches troublesome home runs hook
foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole series they've hit balls we've had to dive to knock
down,'' pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``Everything's been in
the hole, and each and every time we give them an extra out, we end
up paying the price. It's just been one of those series where
everything they're hitting gets under a glove or just over the
infield, and everything we're hitting goes right at them. Sometimes
it works that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the sun shines on one team while blinding the other _
literally.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsale's pop, innocent as it looked, was trouble from the
start. Bell saw it all the way, and thought he could have tried to
catch it. But Rodriguez, who was a good 15 feet away from the ball
when it landed, called for Griffey to catch it. Bell thought
Griffey was camped under it _ when Griffey, in fact, was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I flipped my glasses down and had to hope for it to come out
of the sun,'' Griffey said. ``I heard Alex call, `You, you, you!'
and I thought, `I guess he can't see it.' It's just one of those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many. Brian Hunter led off the game with a single
off the leg of Orioles starter Scott Erickson. Bell followed with a
pop-up that Erickson caught with a sprawling dive. Hunter was at
second by then, and was easily doubled up at first.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's 18th home run put the Mariners ahead 1-0 in the fourth,
but Erickson (13-11) was nearly flawless after that.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hooked a would-be homer a few feet wide of the
right-field foul pole leading off the ninth, then was retired when
shortstop Bordick lunged for a looping liner, catching it on the
second base side of the bag.
</P>
<P>
   That was how it went for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   An inning earlier, Baltimore had gotten its final run on a pair
of infield hits. With one out and Bordick on second, Halama gave
way to Todd Williams. The side-arming right-hander broke Albert
Belle's bat on a ball up the middle, and Rodriguez gloved it, spun
and threw _ just late.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Jeff Conine, hit a grounder that was deflected
by diving third baseman Russ Davis down the line. Davis bare-handed
the ball and threw to first, late again, and Bordick scored to give
the Orioles a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Bad breaks? Probably, but Bell wasn't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little break here or there might affect the outcome of the
game, but I will admit that we control most of what happens,'' Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last three games, we haven't gotten it done. I don't feel
we've been playing bad, we just haven't done quite what it takes to
win games.''
