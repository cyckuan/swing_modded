<HEADLINE> After-Hours Stock Quotes Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock  
Exchange have postponed for a second time plans to extend the 
operation of their stock quote tickers to accommodate after-hours 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The tickers provide the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq on Friday set a new target date of Oct. 25, subject to  
approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A NYSE 
spokesman said the exchange hasn't set a date and is awaiting SEC 
approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two markets initially planned to extend their ticker hours  
on Oct. 4. The date was then pushed back to this coming Monday 
before the new postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage industry had requested the latest delay, asking  
for more time to update its trading systems to process after-hours 
trades, Nasdaq said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postponement will provide them an opportunity to make  
adjustments to their systems or modify their processes,'' said 
Nasdaq's chief operating officer, J. Patrick Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time, and the NYSE until 6:35 p.m. Both systems currently stop 
distributing quotes at 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the NYSE agreed to extend its 
ticker hours following a request from the Chicago Stock Exchange, 
which trades NYSE listed stocks for regional customers and has 
applied to the SEC to keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> Union Tries To Help Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Government crackdowns on immigration and the  
changing face of America's workforce have prompted the AFL-CIO to 
renew efforts to reach out to immigrant workers, union officials 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is planning four public forums, in Atlanta, Chicago,  
Los Angeles and New York, to hear from immigrant workers about 
working conditions and efforts to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants have long been exploited on the job but rarely speak  
out for fear of being fired or deported, said Clayola Brown, vice 
president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many horror stories out there. We truly don't  
know the depth because there is so much fear,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union figures, one in 10 U.S. workers was born  
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Daisy Cabrera, 26, who has worked as a janitor for union and  
non-union companies, said her non-union employer did not provide 
overtime or health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed the job. If I protested, I'd get fired,'' she said.  
``With the union, we have control of our work load. When we were 
not unionized, they dumped work on us and we were expected to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials said the effort to reach immigrants comes as  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service is cracking down on 
undocumented workers in labor-intensive industries, such as 
meatpacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Operation Vanguard, the INS has subpoenaed employee  
records at several Midwest plants to verify workers' immigration 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	While the method has prompted questions about invasion of  
privacy and concerns about labor shortages, the INS says it is less 
disruptive than workplace raids.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Attack Bush's Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Conservative candidates vying for the  
Republican presidential nomination criticized front-runner George 
W. Bush on Saturday for ``beating up on the conservatives'' and 
distancing himself from core GOP values. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern with Mr. Bush is what he's saying out there on the  
campaign trail,'' Pat Buchanan told about 1,000 people at the 
National Federation of Republican Assemblies convention. ``He's 
been beating up on the conservatives. He's been pandering to the 
media by beating up on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and fellow conservatives Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and  
Alan Keyes preached tax reform, anti-abortion policy and family 
values to members of the public and 320 convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	A non-binding straw poll was won by Forbes, who received 380 of  
829 votes, or 45.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely delighted,'' Forbes said. ``I think it shows  
conservatives are rallying to my candidacy. This is going to become 
a race similar to 1980, where the conservatives fought the 
outsiders. The outsiders won in '80, and we're going do it again 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan came in second with 172 votes, or 20.8 percent,  
followed by Keyes with 149 votes and Bauer with 86 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA, founded in 1996, is a grass-roots conservative  
organization that bills itself as ``the Republican wing of the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the event, each candidate mentioned the Texas governor  
directly, criticizing Bush's stance on big government and his 
reluctance to require that all judge appointees oppose abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who skipped the convention along with GOP hopefuls John  
McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Orrin Hatch, received 35 votes. McCain 
and Dole received three each, and Hatch none. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said earlier in the week that Republicans were too often  
pessimistic and confused limited government with ``a disdain for 
government itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This governor in Texas is the pessimist in the race. He is  
running as a Bush Republican and I will proudly run as a Reagan 
Republican,'' Bauer said to a chorus of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer called Bush's comments ``a surrender'' to expansive  
government and a departure from conservative values. 
</P>
<P>
	``That obviously hit nerves with the Republican Party. Those are  
two issues that Republicans care a great deal about,'' he said. 
``If the governor keeps making speeches like that it's going to 
guarantee that we're going to have an open race that's going to go 
all the way to the convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spent Saturday in Springfield, Mo., at a fund-raiser and  
cookout for Republican Rep. Roy Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Forbes, Bauer and Sen. Hatch traveled to Des  
Moines, Iowa, to stress their anti-abortion credentials before a 
gathering of the Iowa Right to Life convention. 
</P>
<P>
	All told the audience of about 250 that they would never abandon  
social issues such as abortion and euthanasia, and Forbes and Bauer 
said they would appoint only judges opposed to abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took a  
measured swipe at Bush's father, former President Bush, for his 
judicial appointments. ``To be honest with you, the most liberal 
pro-abortion judge on the Supreme Court was appointed by our last 
Republican president,'' he said in a reference to Justice David 
Souter. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kansas City convention, demands for comprehensive tax  
reform and anti-abortion Supreme Court justices drew wild cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, while pushing his proposed 17 percent flat tax, called  
for elimination of all individual taxes such as estate taxes, or as 
he put it, ``taxation without respiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes equated the tax reform movement to fighting slavery, and  
called for the abolition of the personal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people go out and work for the money, the people ought to  
be the ones in control of the management of that money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan both entered and left the stage to a chanting chorus of  
``stay, Pat, stay.'' Earlier this week, Buchanan said he was 
``leaning toward'' leaving the Republican Party to seek the Reform 
Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made no mention of the Reform Party during his  
20-minute speech. He canceled a news conference scheduled by the 
NFRA. His political director, Tim Haley, said Buchanan had been ill 
and had never promised to meet with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA delegates from 33 states will vote Sunday afternoon on  
one candidate the organization can back for the Republican 
presidential nomination. All candidates are on the ballot, and the 
group's bylaws require a two-thirds majority to earn NFRA backing.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 1, Wizards 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Defender Ezra Hendrickson's goal led Los  
Angeles to a 1-0 victory over the Kansas City Wizards, as the 
Galaxy clinched first place in Major League Soccer's Western 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrickson scored in the 25th minute after getting a pass from  
Ron Myers, who was on the right flank and dribbled around three 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hendrickson slammed his shot by goalkeeper Tony Meola from 10  
yards out, sending the ball just under the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City (8-24) dominated the second half, when it took 11 of  
its 16 shots. Preki, Alexi Lalas and Chris Henderson had the best 
chances to score for the Wizards, but Kevin Hartman got his 11th 
shutout of the season for Los Angeles (20-12). 
</P>
<P>
	After the game Lalas, one of the best-known stars in American  
soccer, announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have decided to leave the game and I am looking forward to  
starting a new chapter in my life off the field,'' said the 
29-year-old Lalas, who had four goals and an assist this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked,'' said Meola, traded with Lalas to Kansas City  
by the Metro Stars in January. ``His timing wasn't the greatest. He 
is a big loss to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles coach Sigi Schmid said Lalas ``has always set his  
own standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something said about a person when they know exactly  
what they want and they do it. When someone knows it's time, they 
know.''

<HEADLINE> No. 1 FSU 31, No. 19 Miami 21 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Football Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick wasn't around, so Chris  
Weinke simply went to the next best option, and wide receiver Ron 
Dugans came through to bail out No. 1 Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugans turned a short pass into a 54-yard gain to set up Travis  
Minor's fourth-quarter 2-yard touchdown run that lifted the 
Seminoles to a 31-21 victory over No. 19 Miami on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, the Heisman Trophy favorite serving an indefinite  
suspension after his arrest on a grand theft charge of underpaying 
for designer clothes at a department store, watched his team 
struggle for three quarters before winning its 27th straight at 
Doak Campbell Stadium and 44th without a loss. Both streaks are the 
longest among major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugans wasn't the only receiver who came to Weinke's rescue. In  
completing 23-of-34 for 332 yards, Weinke had first-half TD passes 
of 48 yards to seldom-used Germaine Stringer and 18 yards to tight 
end Ryan Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0) has now beaten Miami (2-3) four years in a  
row, but this one was the toughest yet, especially without Warrick, 
who averages 154 all-purpose yards per game. Dressed in baggy blue 
jeans and a red golf shirt, Warrick paced the sideline cheering on 
his team and hoping his legal problems are cleared up next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly was sensational, hitting 27-of-41  
passes for 370 yards and three touchdowns, including two to Santana 
Moss, one an 80-yarder that tied the score 14-14 after one quarter. 
Moss finished with nine catches for 180 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Seminoles ahead 24-21 on Sebastian Janikowski's 38-yard  
field goal midway through the third quarter, Weinke led the 
Seminoles on a game-clinching 97-yard drive. After Dugans' 54-yard 
gain to the Miami 30, FSU moved down to the 13, when Miami's 
Leonard Myers was called for pass interference in the end zone 
against Dugans. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, from the Miami 3, Minor powered into the end  
zone and Florida State kept its national title hopes alive as 
80,976 fans broke into the Seminole War Chant. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor had 25 carries for 146 yards, with Dugans finishing with  
five catches for 80 yards and Stringer had three catches for 80 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Warrick, the first half was filled with big plays --  
by both teams. Fittingly, it was 21-21 after 30 minutes, with the 
Hurricanes keeping the pressure on a shaky Florida State secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles opened a 7-0 lead on their second possession when  
Stringer, one of two replacements for Warrick, caught his 48-yard 
TD pass just 3:47 into the game. He beat Myers on a post pattern, 
caught the ball in stride at the 13 and scored untouched. When he 
returned to the bench, he was greeted by a towel-waving Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, the last team to beat Florida State at Doak Campbell (in  
1991), wasted little time in pulling even. 
</P>
<P>
	King threw an 8-yard scoring pass to Reggie Wayne 3:08 later,  
the football sailing over the head of cornerback Mario Edwards in 
the left corner of the end zone and into the Hurricane receiver's 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles moved ahead 14-7, on Jeff Chaney's 3-yard TD run,  
and the Hurricanes responded on Kelly's 80-yard TD pass to Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles lost a scoring chance late in the first quarter  
when Dan Kendra fumbled at the Miami 10 and the Hurricanes Al 
Blades recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami took a 21-14 lead after an 89-yard march, with Kelly  
hitting Moss on a 6-yard TD, with Edwards again the beaten defender 
in the end zone. This time it was the Seminoles turn to even the 
score, with Weinke finding Sprauge behind Miami's linebackers on 
the 18-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before kickoff, both teams had to be restrained from  
going at each other at midfield. One of the Miami players shouted 
something to a Florida State player, and both teams gathered near 
midfield, each forming a huge circle. All the players began jumping 
up and down in unison, jawing at each other, before coaches came 
over and broke things up.

<HEADLINE> Accidents Hits Heart of Japan Nukes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Fumiko Kawasaki was just finishing lunch  
when firemen rushed into her farm supplies store and told her to 
evacuate. They didn't say why, and she didn't want to ask. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew something was up because police were already sealing  
off the area,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the nuclear fuel processing plant across the street, workers  
had ignored safety procedures -- possibly with the tacit approval of 
cost-conscious supervisors -- and mixed up a batch of uranium so 
volatile it sent a potent burst of radiation into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	By nightfall, the mix went critical, simmering into a  
self-sustaining nuclear reaction. Three plant employees were 
hospitalized with potentially fatal doses of radiation. Hundreds of 
thousands of people holed up indoors awaiting word that it was safe 
to venture outside again. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Japan's most serious nuclear accident, probably rating a  
five on the scale used by the International Atomic Energy 
Commission -- equal to the Three Mile Island accident of 1979. 
Chernobyl was a seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have grown up with nuclear power,'' Kawasaki said as she  
sipped coffee made with bottled water -- officials told her not to 
use the well just yet. ``But this accident made us realize how 
little we really know about what is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of her neighbors was less sanguine.  
</P>
<P>
	``We are deeply involved in the nuclear industry here,'' said  
Hiroko Gocho, a pharmacist who was working about a half mile from 
the processing plant when the radiation leaked. ``We trusted them, 
and they betrayed our trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	To even the most casual visitor, it's clear Tokaimura is a  
poster town for Japan's nuclear power program. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's first commercial nuclear reactor, Tokai, was  
completed here in 1966. That reactor was decommissioned last year 
because it was deemed too costly to operate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokai II reactor has been in operation since 1978. Both  
reactors are only about a 15-minute drive from the center of town, 
and a dozen other related facilities for processing, handling or 
studying nuclear materials line the coast to the east and the 
town's western outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside town hall a two-story-tall sign declares: ``We oppose  
nuclear weapons; We promote the peaceful use of nuclear power.'' 
The two main roads running through the center of town are Nuclear 
Research Street and Nuclear Power Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Few townspeople openly oppose nuclear power.  
</P>
<P>
	About a third of the work force is employed by the nuclear  
industry, and all benefit from the huge share of tax money the 
plants contribute to the town's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	And officials always stressed their concern for safety. In case  
of emergency, special intercoms are installed in 10,000 homes in 
the area and public address systems sit atop utility poles in 66 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
	But even when the warnings were broadcast two hours after the  
radiation leak Sept. 30, few thought the trouble could be coming 
from the uranium processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We assumed it was across town at a reactor,'' Gocho said. ``We  
had no idea they were doing something so dangerous at the plant. It 
looks more like just a little workshop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A short walk from town hall, the processing plant is surrounded  
by a low fence and trees, and ringed by small farms and mom-and-pop 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
	On the outside, little has changed since the accident, although  
police officers now stand around its perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, however, the dangers remain.  
</P>
<P>
	JCO, the private company that operates the plant, says it is  
cautiously allowing workers back into the area of the complex where 
the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you can walk around inside the plant in most places,''  
said spokesman Akira Iwata. ``But we are still considering what to 
do with that section. You can't go in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JCO, in fact, has no idea what will be done with the  
nondescript, concrete building where the leak occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't make any decision on our own,'' Iwata said. ``We are  
consulting with the Science and Technology Agency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say much of the cleanup problem stems from the fact  
that as a processing plant -- as opposed to a nuclear reactor -- the 
facility was not designed to handle a nuclear chain reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	And, company officials admit, it never would have happened had  
even a modicum of safety procedures been observed. 
</P>
<P>
	JCO officials say the accident happened something like this:  
</P>
<P>
	To speed up their work, workers used a stainless steel bucket to  
mix a uranium compound with nitric acid, bypassing a system of 
mechanized tanks. JCO admits that was not unusual. But this time, 
the workers used 6.5 times more uranium than the safe limit, and 
were mixing uranium of an unusually high grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The first bursts of radiation were detected outside the plant at  
about 10:35 a.m., and a few hours later the uranium mix went 
critical. The chain reaction continued for more than 17 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents got their first warning about two hours after the  
initial burst. That night, everyone within 6 miles of the plant was 
advised to stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts now say that after the initial leak, radiation levels in  
the area probably returned to normal quickly. Unlike at Chernobyl, 
there was no explosion and no radioactive material escaped the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the ramifications spread.  
</P>
<P>
	Police are investigating whether the negligence was part of a  
systematic and illegal attempt by JCO management to cut costs. The 
government is preparing to revoke its operating license, and set 
new standards for the six other processing facilities still in 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Further delays are likely, experts say, despite the government's  
vow to push ahead with plans to build more reactors to produce 
electricity. Already, officials say the Fugen reactor west of Tokyo 
may be shut down because without the Tokaimura facility there is no 
place to store its spent fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	And though Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi visited the site  
personally to demonstrate the danger was gone, prices for area farm 
produce have plummeted. Thousands of worried residents are still 
seeking blood tests and medical checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody wants to live here anymore,'' said Miwa Sukegawa, a  
housewife and mother of two small children. ``It's just so 
frightening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Yutaka Yoshii watches his steps as he walks around dozens of  
radiation detectors spread out on the floor outside the makeshift 
emergency center where officials are trying to figure out what to 
do about the processing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	The command center is set up at Atom World, a small theme park  
on the edge of the grounds of the Tokai II nuclear reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhibitions aimed at children boast of the wonders of nuclear  
power. There is a reactor turbine next to a fountain outside, and 
an Atomic Theater where groups can watch promos for the nuclear 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are no visitors now, only harried experts and nuclear  
power industry employees talking on cell phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, this would be full of people,'' said Yoshii, who is  
assistant general manager of the Tokaimura offices of Japan Atomic 
Power Co. ``But we had to close it to set up the center.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like other industry officials, Yoshii is cautious about  
condemning how the processing plant was run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to really know the facts before we make judgments,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he acknowledged it will probably color the way the  
Japanese look at nuclear power for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a terrible shame,'' he said. ``Japan needs nuclear  
power. But we must never forget the need for safety, and trust.''

<HEADLINE> Jerry West Says Shaq Wil Win MVP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Jerry West has made a bold  
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaquille O'Neal will be the MVP this season,'' said West, the  
executive vice president of the Los Angeles Lakers. ``There has 
been tremendous enthusiasm on his part and he is the happiest I 
have seen him since he has been in Los Angeles. He believes in what 
(coach Phil Jackson) is trying to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West made his comments Saturday while speaking to the media for  
the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-1 center wasn't worried about personal accolades, but  
rather the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter (what West said),'' said O'Neal. ``How does  
that work anyway? (The media) votes me in, right? Most of you don't 
like me anyway. It's all about the jewelry, I just want a 
championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson saw the prediction as a confidence booster for O'Neal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a nice sentiment,'' said Jackson. ``He should be among  
the top five vote-getters in the MVP, he has the ability to do 
that. He has to stay healthy though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West is not only impressed with O'Neal, but also the enthusiasm  
that the whole squad has shown for Jackson's ``triangle'' offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have been impressed with the tremendous concentration that  
our players are showing out there and also the fact that they have 
worked so hard considering how strenuous the camp has been,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Rice, a free agent at the end of the season, was also on  
the mind of West, who considers Rice to be in the best shape of his 
career. Rice has tendinitis in his left knee, which has sidelined 
him for one practice and part of the team's scrimmage Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Glen is going to have a great year, not a good year,'' said  
West. ``Physically, with the exception of his tendinitis, he looks 
great. He is going to have lots of opportunities to score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson held his first intersquad scrimmage Friday night,  
bringing in officials to put a gauge on where his team stands at 
this point. His first team was comprised of O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, 
Derek Fisher, Rice and A.C. Green. Rick Fox filled in for Rice 
later in the scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first team had a lot of fun. Some of the other guys  
struggled. I was real impressed we got through five games. It let 
the horse out of the barn, it was fun for them,'' Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson also was impressed with this rookie squad, which  
includes No. 1 draft pick Devean George and free agent Gerald 
Jordan, who outplayed the Lakers' second team of veterans.

<HEADLINE> NetAid Concerts Fight World Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Annie Lennox and The Eurythmics kicked off the  
first of three fund-raising concerts held Saturday in London, 
Geneva and New Jersey that were broadcast live on the Internet to 
increase awareness about world poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Collectively, you are so powerful and strong you can do these  
things,'' Lennox told the crowd of 60,000 at London's Wembley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	NetAid organizers had predicted 1 billion Internet hits on their  
Web site, the largest audience ever for a live music event. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewel, Sheryl Crow, Sting and Puff Daddy were scheduled to  
perform Saturday evening at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	For the average computer user, the quality of the London concert  
footage was akin to watching a shaky, slow-motion security camera. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Welsh band Catatonia had taken to the stage Saturday  
evening in London, an estimated 125,000 Internet users had tried to 
log onto the NetAid Web site, which was designed to be viewed with 
a top-speed modem that most home computers do not have. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheer volume of Internet users also slowed the system,  
making pictures grainy and slowing transmission time, said Thomas 
Ritstetter, spokesman for KPMG Consulting, which set up the Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps it may be a little ambitious to use Internet  
technology at this point,'' said Ritstetter. ``But the incentive of 
using the Internet is to get people to make a live donation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three overlapping concerts were organized by the U.N.  
Development Program and California-based Internet development 
company Cisco Systems Inc. Their goal was to have people watch the 
concert on-line, then donate money via the Internet to victims of 
poverty in Kosovo and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site was designed to handle 1,000 financial transactions  
per second, but how much money was actually being donated was 
unclear Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking before the concert in Geneva, Mark Malloch Brown, head  
of the U.N. Development Program, said the initiative should be seen 
as just the start of a ``permanent coalition to fight poverty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge us not by the revenue we generate, but by the number of  
(Internet) hits we get,'' Malloch Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	The total cost of the operation -- stadium rental and  
organizational costs -- was between $4 million and $5 million, he 
said. The performers and Web site developers contributed their 
services for free. 
</P>
<P>
	The musicians performing in London made sure the concert goers  
got the message that the night was dedicated to fighting poverty. 
As pop groups and British television stars took the stage, they 
pleaded with the audience to help the impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please listen to this song. This one is called 'Brother Can  
You Spare a Dime,''' singer George Michael told a screaming crowd. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Ads Brace for Forbes Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Bracing for a rival's onslaught, George  
W. Bush's political team has produced and tested a huge package of 
potential campaign advertisements -- including several designed to 
look like attack ads he could face. 
</P>
<P>
	In focus groups conducted by the Bush team, the simulated  
attacks from wealthy publisher Steve Forbes did not hurt the Texas 
governor's standing when coupled with a Bush ad responding to the 
criticism, said knowledgeable officials close to the Bush campaign. 
The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, outlined the 
extraordinary efforts to prepare the GOP front-runner for a 
multimillion dollar ad blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	It is rare but not unprecedented for a campaign to prepare  
attack ads against its own candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's effort underscores his team's concerns that Forbes could  
dip into his personal fortune to shave Bush's lead in polls. It 
also reflects the benefits of deep pockets: Only Bush, who has 
shattered fund-raising records, and Forbes have the financial 
resources to mount such a comprehensive ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forbes and Bush campaign are warily watching each other's ad  
strategies. They are preparing for a joint television blitz, 
expected to begin in the next three to six weeks, that will likely 
shape the debate and affect the entire eight-candidate GOP field. 
Forbes ran negative ads in 1996 against eventual nominee Bob Dole, 
who later said the attacks softened him up for the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported last week that Bush planned to  
spend up to $20 million in the early stages of the 2000 primary 
season on ads that reflect positively on Bush's record and 
political philosophy. Forbes is expected to spend at least as much 
on a mix of ads that will include spots showing a ``sharp 
contrast'' between him and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The positive Bush ads were shown in battleground states to small  
groups of Republican voters who then were questioned for their 
reaction. Mixed in with the Bush spots were positive ads already 
aired by Forbes and another rival, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The package also included several attack ads, made to look like  
they were produced by the Forbes campaign, and at least one ad in 
which Bush responds to negative attacks. The faux Forbes ads 
attacked Bush on a number of issues, including taxes, education and 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the mock negative ads included McCain, a signal that  
Bush believes the senator will keep his promise to run a positive 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Shown together, the package gave Bush's team insight into how  
average Americans respond to a mock ad campaign. In most cases, the 
last ads shown to focus groups were the ads attacking Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus groups were encouraging, said Bush officials who  
shared the results -- including specific figures -- on condition that 
the details not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, the attacks chipped into Bush's favorability  
rating, but he recovered all his lost support after voters saw the 
response ad. In New Hampshire, his ratings dipped again after the 
attack but rose slightly higher than the initial results once 
voters saw the response ad. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa voters actually gave Bush a better approval rating after  
the attack ads, and the figure rose higher after the response spot. 
Bush's team believes Iowans harbor hard feelings over Forbes' 1996 
ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' campaign officials doubt the credibility of results  
provided by the Bush team, and said the governor's effort proves 
that Forbes is a force to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that they're focus grouping Forbes ads indicates that  
we are clearly on their minds,'' campaign manager Bill Dal Col 
said. ``In light of his recent and sudden moves to the left, it is 
very enlightening that they would be doing these ads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes hopes to emerge as the conservative alternative to Bush,  
who is reaching out to moderates while trying to appease the right 
wing of his party.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Judges Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton today challenged the Senate to  
act on his nominations of Hispanics to federal judgeships, and said 
partisanship is hindering the progress of minorities in the 
judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud that we have succeeded in appointing more Hispanics  
to the federal bench than any administration in history,'' Clinton 
told the Hispanic Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said too many Hispanic nominees are languishing in the  
Senate, waiting for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply dissatisfied with the Senate's partisan handling  
of some of my minority nominees,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated some of the strong language he used earlier in the  
week to denounce the Republican-led Senate for rejecting the 
nomination of Ronnie White, a black judge who had earlier won GOP 
endorsements. The nomination went down on a straight party line 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a disgrace,'' Clinton said bitterly.  
</P>
<P>
	The speech was Clinton's last on a three-day trip that began  
with addresses to labor and gay groups in New York on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	During stops in Canada on Friday, Clinton drew a firm line  
against any U.S. support for an independent Quebec, and said ethnic 
and tribal groups the world over must resist the impulse to declare 
themselves sovereign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must think of how we will live after the shooting stops,  
after the smoke clears,'' Clinton said during a conference in 
Quebec on federalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his one-day Canadian visit to fine-tune friendly  
relations with the United States' northern neighbor. He and Prime 
Minister Jean Chretien reached an agreement on exchanging defense 
technology, and talked a bit about trade, nuclear proliferation and 
peacekeeping in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	He did not make direct comparisons to Quebec, a French-speaking  
province of 7 million that is frustrated with the Canadian federal 
system and has held two independence referendums. In 1995, it came 
close to voting to split from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Clinton cited East Timor as an example, saying that  
region now faces tremendous difficulties because it broke away from 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does that mean they were wrong? No. Under the circumstances  
they faced, they probably made the only decision they could have,'' 
Clinton said. ``But wouldn't it have been better if they could have 
found their religious, their cultural, their ethnic and their 
economic footing in genuine self-government in the framework of a 
larger entity, which would also have supported them economically?'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the federalism conference, Clinton spent about 15 minutes  
with Quebec's separatist premier, Lucien Bouchard. A senior 
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said 
Clinton and Bouchard had ``a friendly, informal chat'' in which 
Bouchard said how much he enjoyed Clinton's speech; the subject of 
sovereignty in Quebec never came up, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the president helped dedicate a new U.S. Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Bening: I'd Support Beatty's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Annette Bening can sound quite politic when it  
comes to the possible presidential future for her husband, Warren 
Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would support fully whatever Warren chooses to do. That's  
all I will say at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if he does choose to run, the 41-year-old actress who stars  
in the hit film ``American Beauty'' knows it will have an effect on 
the couple's three children -- Kathlyn, 7, Ben, 5, and Isabel, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just beginning to dawn on Kathlyn that there's something  
different about us from other moms and dads,'' she says in the 
latest US magazine. ``I am very conscious about it -- protective, 
extremely vigilant. I'm doing everything I can to help them, but 
it's also important to say to them, `This is how it is, your bag, 
what you get to deal with. Everybody has something. This is yours 
and it's big.'''

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Get Revenge on Wright </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Once an October star, Jaret Wright is now a  
falling one. 
</P>
<P>
	Taunted by the Fenway Park crowd from the moment he walked in  
from Cleveland's bullpen, Wright's miserable 1999 just got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, called upon to relieve after starter Dave Burba's  
forearm tightened in the fourth inning, took the loss Saturday as 
the Boston Red Sox extended the AL playoffs to a fourth game with a 
9-3 win over the Indians in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	With ``Jar-et, Jar-et'' ringing in his ears, Wright, who two  
years ago was a postseason hero as a fresh-faced rookie for the 
Indians, pitched two-plus innings that were as shaky as his 
previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed five runs, four hits, one walk, one hit batter and  
one game-tying homer. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it bluntly,'' Wright said, ``I didn't get it done. It  
was my shot to do something good, and it didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright had been expected to start Game 4, but Indians manager  
Mike Hargrove said before the game he would use Wright in long 
relief if necessary in Game 3 and bring back Game 1 winner Bartolo 
Colon on three days' rest Sunday if Cleveland lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright helped make it a reality.  
</P>
<P>
	He was told before the game to be ready in case Burba's forearm  
tightened -- a condition Burba has had for a few weeks but the 
Indians kept secret. Wright said he felt fine before coming in, but 
looked like he was overthrowing from his first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 21-year-old rookie in '97, Wright went 3-0 in the  
postseason, twice beating the New York Yankees in the division 
series. He won Game 4 of the World Series against Florida, and 
became the second youngest pitcher to start a deciding game and the 
seventh rookie to start a Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year he went 0-2 in the playoffs, losing to Boston in  
the opener and getting pounded by the Yankees in the ALCS. 
</P>
<P>
	He went 8-10 during a regular season that included two stints on  
the disabled list this season, and a well-publicized trip to AL 
president Gene Budig's office to discuss his reputation for 
throwing at batters' heads. 
</P>
<P>
	In an April game against Boston, Wright hit Darren Lewis -- who  
he drilled in the playoffs last year -- to set off a bench-clearing 
brawl and escalate tensions between teams with a history of bad 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had been waiting for a chance to get even, and they  
did. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said he wasn't bothered by the deafening chants as the  
crowd did a little headhunting of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard it and what-not,'' Wright said. ``But it doesn't  
affect your pitching. It's the stuff I've dealt with before. But 
it's just getting it done out there. Just hitting your spots and 
getting it done. There's no way the crowd should affect you. So 
that weight's on my shoulders, not anything the crowd did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Troy O'Leary, the first batter to face Wright, hit a shot  
through the mound that clipped the pitcher on the left leg. Wright 
then gave up a single to Lou Merloni and a double to Jason Varitek 
that tied it at 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis then gained revenge on Wright, slapping an RBI single to  
right and pumping his fist as he rounded first base. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after the Indians tied it in the sixth, Wright gave up a  
leadoff homer to John Valentin. He retired the next three in order, 
but set the stage for Boston's six-run seventh by walking Merloni 
to open the inning and hitting Varitek. 
</P>
<P>
	After being pulled from the game, Wright was given a standing  
ovation from the crowd as he walked somberly to the dugout. And 
when the Red Sox blew it open, all Wright could do was hang his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were ready today,'' Wright said. ``It didn't work out.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Parents Expand Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for the parents of a student killed at  
Columbine High School said Saturday he plans to expand the family's 
wrongful death lawsuit to include at least one gun manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger of Michigan said that Florida-based Navegar and  
a subsidiary, Intratec, which made the TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol 
used during the April 20 attack, likely would be named as 
defendants within two weeks. He said the companies' marketing 
practices were designed to make the weapon attractive to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt it could be used by legitimate hunters for legitimate  
purposes,'' Fieger said. ``It's marketed as being made of an alloy 
that doesn't carry fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger represents Michael and Vonda Shoels, whose son Isaiah was  
among 12 students killed by teen-age gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris in their attack on the school. Harris and Klebold also 
killed one teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels family spokesman Sam Riddle said Friday that Fieger and  
Colorado co-counsel Jack Beam were heartened by a California 
appeals court decision last week that reinstated a lawsuit against 
Navegar and Intratec. 
</P>
<P>
	That suit involves the TEC-DC9 a gunman used to kill eight  
people and wound six in a San Francisco office building in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shoelses in May sued the parents of Klebold and Harris,  
saying they should have known their sons were amassing a cache of 
guns and bombs to use in the attack. The lawsuit seeks $250 million 
in damages.

<HEADLINE> Tough Going for Mattel's Barad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- For nearly two years Mattel Inc. chief  
Jill E. Barad dazzled Wall Street with a flashy style and marketing 
savvy that helped turn the toymaker into a worldwide powerhouse 
with brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	To many, she seemed the perfect leader for the world's largest  
toy company. Her enthusiasm and energy appeared boundless. Clad in 
smart, designer clothes, she promoted Mattel with gusto, sometimes 
even dancing to the music that blared out in meetings where new 
toys were unveiled to industry analysts and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression of her is that she is the consummate product  
person, that she loves the product,'' toy consultant Chris Byrne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors haven't shared that enthusiasm during the past  
year. For the second time in 10 months, Wall Street has been 
shocked by surprise announcements that Mattel can't live up to 
revenue estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The news earlier this week pushed the company's stock to its  
lowest point since 1993, with shares trading Friday at $11.81 1/4, 
down 50 cents. It's off nearly 75 percent from a 10-year high of 
$46.75 reached last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest miscalculation -- which has already generated two  
class-action suits by investors -- has left some analysts wondering 
if Barad is up to the job of turning Mattel around, or if she will 
even be given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is faced with a tough situation. Do they make a  
management change or shuffle before their most important season of 
the year?'' said Eric Gustafson, a senior portfolio manager at 
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure on Barad intensified this week after Mattel revealed  
that The Learning Company, a software maker acquired by Mattel in 
May for $3.8 billion, will lose up to $100 million in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The board appears to be willing to give Barad time. Barad met  
with directors on Wednesday in New York, telling members she had 
been advised of The Learning Company's troubles late last week and 
was trying to learn the cause of the problem, according to a source 
familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mattel spokesman declined to comment Friday, except to say  
Barad continued to have the full support of Mattel's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barad, 48, took the helm of Mattel in January 1997, capping a  
16-year climb that began in the company's novelty toy unit. Under 
her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million 
product line into one of the world's most recognized brands with 
$1.9 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And she seems to recognize the changing desires of kids today,  
who are more interested in high-tech toys by the age of 6 rather 
than playing with dolls and board games. Mattel's has stepped up 
its software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to 
capture shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mattel's chairman and chief executive, Barad underwent a  
transformation of sorts. The one-time actress and beauty consultant 
-- one of only three women currently running a Fortune 500 company -- 
became a role model for millions of working women trying to break 
into the ranks of corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's romance with Barad and Mattel turned rocky last  
December after Mattel announced a $500 million shortfall for 1998 -- 
a disclosure came only weeks after a series of meetings in which 
Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its revenue 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel made a mistake when it based its original projections on  
the number of orders the company received in previous years, 
analysts said. Mattel ignored an announcement by Toys R Us, a key 
customer, that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, 
and the prospect that other retailers would do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong with The Learning Company is less clear. The two  
problems are similar, though, in that Mattel appears to have been 
oblivious to the problem until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to believe everything, it would appear they were  
totally out of the loop on what was going on with this latest 
acquisition,'' said Margaret Whitfield, an analyst at Tucker 
Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel is blaming the shortfall on a variety of problems,  
including the loss of a key distribution deal, an unexpectedly high 
return of unsold product from retailers and the write-off of bad 
debts. The explanation is disturbing to analysts because it 
suggests that The Learning Company was depending on a one-time cash 
payment from the distribution deal to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger question is why Mattel was in the dark. Officials at  
the software maker, like those heading other Mattel product lines,

	Some of the problems with The Learning Company were pointed out  
in a July report on Mattel issued by the Center for Financial 
Research and Analysis. Analyst Sirine Hafez reported The Learning 
Company's sales in the first half of 1999 fell well below 1998 
levels. There was also a big jump in accounts receivables, or money 
owed the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good acquisition. That's where the problem lies,''  
said Jim Silver, editor of The Toy Book, an industry publication. 
``The rest of Mattel is fine. (The Learning Company) is one big 
problem, though.''

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Presidential Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So the debate debate begins, with Gov. George  
W. Bush shunning Republican campaign confrontations until next year 
while Vice President Al Gore seeks a series every other week 
against Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats Gore and Bradley are to meet in Hanover, N.H., on Oct.  
27, answering audience questions in a televised joint forum, not 
quite debating but close. Five Republican candidates will share the 
same stage the following night, without Bush, who leads the field 
and is following the front-runner's script on debating his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate challenges are standard for candidates who are trying to  
catch up and want to confront the leader on an equal footing. Gore 
adapted the strategy to his circumstances -- he still leads Bradley 
by most measures, but the former New Jersey senator is catching up 
in polls and lately in fund raising and campaign cash on hand. That 
led the vice president to overhaul his campaign, and to seek 
debates -- live on the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he'd already agreed to joint appearances, beginning  
with the New Hampshire forum, and beyond that, will stick to his 
own campaign plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have debates every two weeks,'' Gore said, each on  
a different issue. He's mentioned as topics health care, education, 
the environment, national defense, crime control -- ``and the list 
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that timetable, the campaign for the Democratic nomination  
would become one of debates and not much else. There's no lure for 
Bradley in that; he's doing well the standard way. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was not, and while he now speaks of debates as a way to  
elevate the campaign and enrich democracy, he hadn't mentioned 
debating Bradley until just recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican debate argument is along more standard lines.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush has declined the Oct. 28 forum in New Hampshire; he said  
that ``while the debate may be important,'' it conflicts with a 
ceremony honoring his wife at Southern Methodist University. He 
wasn't going to the debate anyhow. His campaign has ruled out 
debates for 1999, saying he will wait until 2000, when people are 
paying attention to the presidential race. Bush has accepted an 
invitation to debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 15, and another 
in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush, it's time to debate,'' said rival Steve  
Forbes, repeating the challenge he has been issuing ever since the 
Texas governor began his active campaign. Forbes wants a series of 
five debates including Bush, which he won't get. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, at least five Republican candidates campaigning to  
catch the front-runner will appear without him at the forum at 
Dartmouth College. That's not to say they won't be talking about 
him. When Ronald Reagan skipped a Republican debate in Iowa in 
1980, the GOP field didn't spare the leader who wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan said debating would have been divisive, but after he lost  
in Iowa, he intensified his campaign, confronted his rivals in New 
Hampshire debates, and won. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate forums are fixtures now in the primary campaign  
states, usually with a big cast of contestants, some competitive 
for the nomination, some not, but in for the show. 
</P>
<P>
	They usually do more to cement impressions than to turn the  
course of a campaign. But there have been memorable moments, as 
when Reagan outmaneuvered the elder George Bush before they even 
began a 1980 debate, by arguing that four uninvited Republicans 
should be included, too. That cast Reagan as the unifier, although 
his side had arranged a two-man debate with Bush, who had upset him 
in Iowa. When the moderator tried to silence Reagan by ordering his 
microphone turned off, Reagan grabbed it and kept talking, saying 
he'd paid for it. Bush was left sputtering. The two finally 
debated, but by then, Reagan had won the engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, later vice president and president, describes it as the  
low point of his 1980 campaign. ``I will be the first to admit that 
I looked like a fool, rigidly playing by the rules,'' he writes in 
his new book, ``All the Best, George Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As vice president, Bush reluctantly joined the candidate forum  
circuit early, beginning in the fall of 1987. He was the 
front-runner, and so the target of five rival candidates, defending 
the Reagan administration against what he called carping by 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loyalty is a strength, not a character flaw,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's a line that may echo as Gore tries to debate his way to  
the Democratic nomination. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Park Dropped As NFL Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Days after Los Angeles lost to Houston  
in an effort to win an NFL expansion team, one of the principal 
California bidders abandoned Hollywood Park as a new stadium site. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz said he still wants to bring the  
NFL back to Southern California, but he chose Friday not to 
exercise the option on nearly 100 acres of land at the Inglewood 
racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just decided it was not economically prudent to exercise  
the option without having the franchise,'' Ovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had until Friday to exercise the option he and partner Ron  
Burkle picked up when Los Angeles billionaire oilman Marvin Davis 
allowed it to lapse. Davis dropped out of bidding a week after 
entering negotiations on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning the property to Hollywood Park is not a signal Ovitz  
plans to abandon his quest to return the NFL to Los Angeles, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gone this far. We're not going to stop now,'' he said.  
``We're not backing out of it at all. We just don't want to own the 
real estate in the hopes of somebody moving here. It's not a good 
use of my money or Ron Burkle's, that's all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood Park officials have said they planned to sell the site  
to a non-sports developer if it was not purchased for use as a 
stadium site. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL officials urged Ovitz to purchase the $55 million property  
in his bid to lure an existing team to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams in Phoenix, New Orleans, Buffalo and Minnesota have been  
identified among those that might be interested in moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Davis, who took the Raiders out of the Los Angeles Coliseum  
and back to Oakland after the 1994 season, also has indicated he 
might like to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's expansion franchise bid was $1 billion -- $150 million  
higher than offers by either the Los Angeles Coliseum group or the 
one headed by Ovitz at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer, the richest ever for a franchise, came from Houston  
businessman Bob McNair and includes the $700 million franchise 
price and a $310 million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston will begin play in 2002 in the American Football  
Conference, where the Oilers played before moving to Tennessee 
after the 1996 season.

<HEADLINE> Families Join Reno on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The families of hate-crime victims Matthew  
Shepard and James Byrd Jr. appeared with Attorney General Janet 
Reno on Saturday night as part of a campaign to persuade Congress 
to include attacks on gays and lesbians among federal hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, was killed a  
year ago in what prosecutors said was an anti-gay attack. Byrd, a 
black man, was killed in June 1998 when three white supremacists 
dragged him behind their pickup truck near Jasper, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights advocates say the Byrd family's presence was key to  
building support for the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has been 
passed by the Senate and must still be considered by the House. 
Among other measures, which Reno endorsed, the bill would add 
``sexual orientation'' to the description of peoples protected by 
federal hate crimes acts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rallying dinner, Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the  
Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, praised the 
Byrd family for lending their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Byrd family had the choice to stand with the gay and  
lesbian community... they made a moral decision'' to do so, Birch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, described how one year ago he  
walked into a hospital and saw the motionless body of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did believe gay people experienced equal treatment before,''  
Shepard said. ``I have never been so wrong in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore Asks for Labor Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tipper Gore made an impassioned plea Saturday  
for organized labor to ``stand with Al,'' as backroom wrangling 
continued over an early AFL-CIO endorsement of her husband's 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please stand with Al and fight for the change that will give  
our children and our grandchildren the America equal to our best 
possibilities and the highest ideals in each of our hearts,'' the 
vice president's wife asked several thousand workers rallying in 
advance of the AFL-CIO convention that opens here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO president John Sweeney told affiliated union presidents  
privately Friday that his priority at the convention is to give 
Gore the federation's early endorsement, several labor officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An endorsement now would give Gore thousands of grass-roots  
mobilizers to help beat back the increasingly strong challenge by 
former Sen. Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald McEntee, chairman of the labor federation's political  
committee and chief advocate of an early Gore endorsement, said 
Saturday he is confident he has the votes to prevail even though 
some union presidents would rather not rush ahead before their 
members have had a chance to study the candidates' records. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the time, this is the place,'' McEntee said in an  
interview. With all the high-profile speculation about the strength 
of Gore's campaign, he said he did not want this week's convention 
to leave the vice president empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are high because there's been sort of a big  
spotlight on this,'' McEntee said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the floor of the Los Angeles Convention Center, green-shirted  
members of McEntee's American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees hoisted a dozen or so ``Gore 2000'' campaign 
posters as Mrs. Gore addressed Saturday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	Her voice rose as she ran through her husband's record and  
repeated nearly a dozen times the beseeching refrain, ``stand with 
Al.'' Her husband's support for unionized workers goes back for 
decades, to the time he was a congressman from Tennessee, she said. 
``Al's support for labor unions is based on principle, not 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California Gov. Gray Davis weighed in with an offbeat appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would not be standing here if you had not taken a chance on  
me -- this boring, dull fellow dismissed as roadkill and yesterday's 
news,'' Davis said, adding a plea, too, for California Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, who is up for re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to take that same attitude ... and, please, endorse  
Dianne Feinstein and Al Gore at some point during your 
deliberations,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse Jackson, whose endorsement the vice president also covets  
but has not yet secured, rallied workers with the sing-song cry, 
``Bush to the bushes,'' aimed at the Republicans' front-runner, 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, has spent months lobbying union officials to hold off  
and give him a chance to make his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scenes, presidents of some of the AFL-CIO's biggest  
affiliated unions met twice Friday -- first, to hear from Sweeney 
that he wants ``very much'' to see the AFL-CIO endorse Gore before 
the biennial convention ends Wednesday, said union officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In a second, smaller meeting, McEntee and other union presidents  
pushing hardest for an early nod to Gore -- including the American 
Federation of Teachers, the Firefighters and the Communications 
Workers -- assessed their potential vote count and who still needs 
persuasion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney planned to meet separately with some wavering union  
boards on Sunday to press the case for Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho and campaign manager Donna  
Brazile were headed to Los Angeles for last-minute lobbying, and 
the vice president set aside time to address the convention 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 16 Die As Bus Overturns in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A bus carrying members of a singles club  
overturned on a slippery northern Israel road Saturday and plunged 
into a deep ravine, killing 16 people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six people were injured, 10 of them seriously, in what  
police called Israel's deadliest road accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was taking 56 members of a singles club from central  
Israel on an outing when the first heavy rain in months began 
falling, leaving the road slick. The bus was traveling between the 
towns of Tiberias and Nazareth when the driver lost control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour guide Zvika Mena told Israel TV that he was talking to the  
group when the bus veered off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly the bus began to zig-zag,'' Mena said. ``I shouted to  
everybody to hold firm. There were loud shouts and panic. I was 
thrown out of the front window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The red-and-white bus plunged at least 60 feet into the ravine  
and overturned, landing on its roof. Several bodies were pinned 
under the vehicle and some surviving passengers were trapped in 
their seats. Belongings were strewn across the rocky slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by heavy rain, rescue workers used metal cutters to  
free trapped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was traveling just below the 50 mph speed limit, but  
that was too fast considering the road conditions, traffic police 
chief Yaakov Ganot said. Survivors said they had asked the driver 
several times to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old driver had worked for the bus company for six  
months and had been given several traffic tickets for minor 
offenses, Israel TV reported.

<HEADLINE> Test Lets Companies Inspect Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government meat inspector's job has not  
changed for generations. All day long, inspectors sit in one place 
along a production line, poking each chicken or hog or cow carcass 
passing by as they look for defects, stray feathers or hair, and 
telltale signs of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department thinks that is a waste of time so it  
is testing a new system in which plant employees do most of the 
hands-on examination -- mostly looking for bruises and the like that 
have nothing to do with human health, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to free government inspectors so they can focus on  
potential hazards to human health such as salmonella and fecal 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with two-way radios, department employees can start  
moving along the lines to ensure the machinery is working properly 
and can conduct more extensive sampling of the meat. Some 
inspectors also can check meat in warehouses and other distribution 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental system started Oct. 4 at a poultry plant in  
Alabama. Additional poultry and pork plants will be added in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly need to do something more effective, and the new  
system holds out some opportunity for that,'' said Carol Tucker 
Foreman, coordinator of the Safe Food Coalition, a consumer group. 
She oversaw the department's inspection program during the Carter 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no downside. The public continues to have inspectors  
in the plant at all times, doing more to protect health than they 
were before the pilot project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department inspectors are not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Government Employees, which  
represents 7,000 inspectors, has sued the Agriculture Department, 
contending the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907 requires that 
the agency physically examine every meat and poultry carcass after 
it is slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and other critics of the program say the department  
essentially is allowing companies to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reducing public health standards and safeguards does not  
qualify as food safety reform,'' said Tom Devine, legal director of 
the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblowers group. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge refused last month to stop the pilot project,  
agreeing with the department that the law did not require 
inspectors to handle every carcass so long as they kept an eye on 
the meat. The union is appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is part of a prevention-oriented initiative by the  
Clinton administration that is putting more responsibility on 
processors to reduce food-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are required to identify key points in the  
manufacturing and packing processes where food can be contaminated, 
and then adopt new procedures and get new equipment to prevent 
potential contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 76 million people are sickened and 5,000 die each  
year from food poisoning. That includes 1.4 million cases and 600 
deaths from salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty chicken, turkey and pork plants have agreed to be part of  
the program. An independent lab will test the meat before the new 
program is started and after it has been running for a while to 
determine whether contamination levels have been reduced. So far, 
no beefpackers have volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
	The program can increase plants' expenses, but that is the cost  
of guaranteeing food safety, said Philip Clemens, president of 
Hatfield Quality Meats Inc., a Pennsylvania pork processor that 
volunteered for the program. ``Consumers both expect it and demand 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project started off without a hitch at the Gold Kist Inc.  
poultry plant in Guntersville, Ala., said John Huie, the 
Agriculture Department's inspector-in-charge at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's allowed us to focus more on food safety and public health  
issues in the plant,'' said Huie, a veterinarian 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, one of the most modern of 10 that Gold Kist operates,  
used to depend on the inspectors to find cosmetic defects, such as 
bile stains, or signs of poultry diseases that were of no danger to 
humans, he said. Now plant workers are doing that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no incentive (for the company) to remove some of  
these quality defects. They would send every carcass and let us 
make a decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has cut its staff at the plant from 18 to 12. The  
six inspectors were moved to other plants in the area where the 
department had vacancies.

<HEADLINE> Protest Turns Into Barbecue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *SANDRA CHEREB   	
</P>
<P>
	JARBIDGE, Nev. (AP) -- About 100 people turned out in this tiny  
northeastern Nevada town to protest a dispute with the U.S. Forest 
Service over a remote mountain road and its impact on an endangered 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
	The gathering Saturday was peaceful as people hiked the closed  
road under clear blue skies. The group had planned a work detail to 
take back the road, but backed off after a federal judge issued a 
temporary restraining order prohibiting the work. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the demonstrators had a barbecue.  
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1,000 protesters were expected before the U.S.  
District Judge David Hagen's order late Thursday. Some had already 
gathered with shovels and picks to reconstruct the 1.5-mile South 
Canyon Road along the Jarbidge River just south of the Idaho state 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Elko County and the federal government have been at odds over  
the road's ownership and fate since a 1995 flood washed it out. The 
road leads to the Jarbidge Wilderness Area. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service decided not to rebuild it after the flood  
because eroding soil could foul the river and threaten the bull 
trout, now protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But a group of residents, led by state Assemblyman John  
Carpenter and O.Q. ``Chris'' Johnson, chairman of the Elko County 
Republican Central Committee, want the road re-opened. They claim 
the road, which leads to a campground, has belonged to Elko County 
for more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagen scheduled an Oct. 22 hearing on the federal government's  
request for a preliminary injunction. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Computers Track Gov't Money at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Department officials say they've  
moved to correct security problems and other weaknesses that 
congressional auditors found in computer systems handling the 
government's financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billions of dollars of payments and collections are at  
significant risk of loss or fraud, vast amounts of sensitive data 
are at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical 
computer-based operations are vulnerable to serious disruptions,'' 
the General Accounting Office said in a report this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an annual review, the GAO examined operations at the  
seven main data processing centers of Treasury's Financial 
Management Service from August 1998 to February 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	FMS spokeswoman Connie Craig said the agency has made  
significant improvements to its computer systems since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that we're in much better shape than is reflected in  
the report,'' Craig said Friday. ``It isn't reflecting current 
reality. We have taken a lot of steps to correct the weaknesses 
identified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FMS acts as the government's accountant, disburser and  
collections agency, working with the Federal Reserve and about 
11,000 financial institutions to carry out these duties. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, it oversaw $1.6 trillion in payments and $1.7 trillion  
in collections, including Social Security and veterans checks, 
income taxes and refunds, federal employees' salaries, customs 
duties and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also keeps the balance sheets used by Congress and  
the executive branch to make decisions about the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Among weaknesses the auditors found at some or all of the FMS'  
main data centers: 
</P>
<P>
	--Inadequate security to control physical entry to the premises  
of data centers and the computer equipment and tape libraries they 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lax control over user IDs and passwords that allow access to  
sensitive computer records. 
</P>
<P>
	--Outdated or inaccurate data.  
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said 14 of 20 major problems identified in the previous  
year's audit had been corrected, and that the FMS was working on 
other improvements. However, it said auditors had identified new 
problems.

<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley  
called for stronger commercial and economic ties between American 
and Jordanian businesses at the start of his Middle East tour on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	During his two-day visit to Jordan, Daley was expected to  
discuss with his Jordanian counterpart Mohammed Asfour various ways 
of encouraging trade and investment between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come to Jordan and the Middle East to build on a  
valuable partnership between our public and private sectors that 
can contribute to -- and indeed accelerate -- economic growth, 
economic expansion and job creation,'' Daley said in a statement on 
arriving in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley also was to inaugurate a permanent U.S. Department of  
Commerce office in Amman to introduce visiting members of trade 
missions to key Jordanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
	A delegation of business executives was accompanying Daley to  
push their expertise in hopes of landing contracts in the region, 
Daley said before leaving the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	King Abdullah II, who was in Washington, met with Daley and the

<HEADLINE> Yankees 3, Rangers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Of all the rebounds in Darryl  
Strawberry's career, this one tops the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry hit a three-run homer in the first inning and Roger  
Clemens made it stand up Saturday night, sending the New York 
Yankees into the AL championship series with a 3-0 victory over the 
Texas Rangers that capped a first-round sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Strawberry announced he had colon cancer the day  
before New York played in Texas. The Yankees finished a first-round 
sweep the next day and dedicated the victory to their ailing 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he came to The Ballpark unsure he'd even be in the  
lineup. He rewarded manager Joe Torre's faith and his teammates' 
patience with his comeback, which almost was derailed by an April 
arrest in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have considered how far I've come, even with the mistake I  
made down in Tampa. It's a big opportunity for me,'' Strawberry 
said. ``These guys are great, they're my teammates, I love them 
all. They stand by me and I'm glad we have a chance to play in the 
next round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York will start the ALCS at home Wednesday night against the  
winner of the Cleveland-Boston series. The Indians, whom the 
Yankees beat in six games last year on their way to the World 
Series title, lead the Red Sox 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, their 10th straight postseason win put them a  
step closer to their 25th Series championship and their third in 
four years. They also kept headed toward a Subway Series as the New 
York Mets advanced to the NLCS earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clemens, his seven shutout innings of three-hit ball were  
certainly enough to placate Yankees fans who had been waiting, ever 
since he was acquired this spring from Toronto, for him to show the 
form that won five Cy Youngs. He earned his second postseason win 
in 10 starts, his other victory coming in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight, he kept his emotions intact, which I thought was the  
key for him because his stuff was terrific,'' Torre said. ``Roger 
Clemens was Roger Clemens. He was the pitcher we traded for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Clemens: ``I was pretty good tonight. I just tried to get  
it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Rangers, this was another disappointing end as they lost  
their ninth straight playoff game -- all to the Yankees. This marked 
the second straight year hard-hitting Texas scored a total of one 
run in an opening-round sweep by New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my eyes, I don't see this as a step backwards,'' Texas  
manager Johnny Oates said. ``We still want to be world champions. 
I'm confident it'll happen soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This game was as good as over with two outs in top of the first  
when Strawberry went with a low and away breaking ball from Esteban 
Loaiza and sent it 415 feet into the left-center field stands for a 
3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sensed we were very quiet, very tense at the beginning of  
the game,'' Torre said. ``Darryl's homer sure woke us up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the white towels waved by the 50,269 fans at The  
Ballpark to fire up the Rangers could've been a sign of surrender 
considering how bad their team was hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 5.83 runs per game in the regular season, the  
Rangers did nothing in this series, batting only .152 as a team. 
They hit .141 last year and overall have scored just two runs in 
their last 60 playoff innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were supposed to be different this time after the best  
season in team history. Instead, this game was the Rangers' worst 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a few months to analyze what happened in this playoff  
and see how we can score at will pretty much in the season and then 
in three games not even smell home plate,'' Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were held to five hits by Clemens, Jeff Nelson and Mariano  
Rivera and got only two runners past first base. Rivera pitched two 
innings for his second save of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was locked in long before the game as he wowed  
teammates in batting practice by consistently reaching far-away 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, his incredible revival shouldn't be surprising. For  
all Strawberry has been through, the one consistent thing has been 
his sweet swing. It's the reason baseball keeps giving him second 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mid-1980s prodigy who came through was Clemens, who is  
seeking his his first World Series title to go with his individual 
pitching awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket wasn't dominating, but he didn't have to be. He  
struck out two and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest inning was the first, and not because of the  
Rangers. What Clemens really was battling was eight days of rest 
and the emotions of his first playoff start in four years, plus the 
fact it was coming before dozens of friends and family in his home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clemens handled it like a big-game pitcher is supposed to:  
He struck out leadoff hitter Mark McLemore looking on four pitches 
and needed just three more to retire the side. 
</P>
<P>
	His only jam was in the fourth when a two-out walk to Todd Zeile  
put runners on first and second. But Lee Stevens grounded out to 
first on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaiza, making his playoff debut, allowed only two runners to  
reach second after Strawberry's homer, both with two outs. In seven 
innings, he allowed five hits, three runs and a walk while striking 
out four. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Rangers were 0-for-13 with runners in scoring position  
in the series. ... Unable to get hits off Clemens, Tom Goodwin and 
Juan Gonzalez hit balls that hit him. Both turned into outs at 
first. ... Torre wouldn't say whether David Cone, who would've 
started Game 4, would be his Game 1 starter in the ALCS. ... Former 
Dallas Cowboys star Roger Staubach took his ceremonial first pitch 
so seriously that he warmed up and took a glove to the mound. Sure 
enough, the toss had some zing to it. ... With losses by the 
Rangers and Houston Astros, there's no chance for a Texas vs. New 
York finals in baseball as there was in the NHL, NBA and WNBA this 
season. Teams from the Lone Star State won the other three. ... The 
Yankees won 12 straight postseason games -- all in the World Series 
-- from 1927-32. ... Texas was shut out seven times in the regular 
season, and twice by the Yankees in the playoffs. ... Yankees right 
fielder Paul O'Neill did not play because of a bruised side. He 
should be OK for the ALCS.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: US Needs Nuke Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A ban on testing of nuclear weapons is more  
important now than when President Eisenhower proposed it more than 
40 years ago, President Clinton said Saturday. He again urged the 
Senate to delay a treaty vote that means certain defeat for his 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said  
Tuesday's expected vote will go forward unless Clinton withdraws 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty from consideration and promises 
not to submit it again. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty would impose a blanket international ban on all  
nuclear test explosions. The United States already is refraining 
from testing. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sent the signed treaty to the Republican-led Senate two  
years ago, but conservatives had refused to hold debate on it 
before now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, only a week has been alloted to consider it,'' Clinton  
said in his weekly radio address, delivered in Chicago where 
Clinton traveled for a separate address to Hispanic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is especially disturbing since the issue has been  
politicized ... a week is not enough time for an issue of this 
profound importance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some congressional conservatives argue the United States should  
not give up its right to conduct nuclear tests. But Clinton and 
Democratic leaders say that substantive issue has taken a back seat 
to Republican zeal to score a partisan point. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki, said: ``The  
White House has made a miscalculation to push for this treaty and 
this vote at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the treaty, also signed by 153 other countries, is  
America's best chance at nuclear security for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year, the threat grows that nuclear weapons will  
spread,'' Clinton said. ``In the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and 
Asia, to areas where American troops are deployed,'' he said, ``to 
regions with intense rivalries, to rogue leaders and perhaps even 
to terrorists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rejecting the pact would prevent the United States from taking  
the lead in halting the global spread of nuclear weapons, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stakes are high.''  
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, the president acknowledged he lacks the votes in  
the Senate to ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives have not backed off since their sudden move to  
schedule a vote for Tuesday. The Senate opened debate on the treaty 
on Friday, and Democrats have virtually no hope of rallying the 67 
votes needed to ratify it.

<HEADLINE> Tests Shed Light on Cystic Fibrosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Tests in mice suggest a reversible fatty-acid  
imbalance may be the source of chronic lung inflamation, excess 
mucus and other symptoms of cystic fibrosis, researchers said 
Saturday at the 13th annual North American Cystic Fibrosis 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic disease, which affects 30,000 American children and  
young adults, attacks patients' lungs with a thick mucus and most 
die from lung damage or infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers -- Dr. Juan Alvarez and Dr. Steven Freedman of  
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston -- worked with mice 
genetically altered to mimic cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	They found the altered mice had abnormally high levels of one  
fatty acid -- arachidonic acid, or AA -- and abnormally low levels of 
another -- docosahexaeonic acid, or DHA. The imbalance was limited 
to the organs most affected by cystic fibrosis, including the 
lungs, pancreas and intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	When the altered mice were fed large doses of DHA for one week,  
the researchers reported, not only was that imbalance corrected -- 
the signs of cystic fibrosis also were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary tests suggest the imbalance involving the two fatty  
acids also exists in people with the disease, Alvarez and Freedman 
said. They are studying the relationship in cystic fibrosis 
patients under a research agreement with Genzyme General of 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although a number of steps remain before the benefit of DHA to  
patients is known, this exciting research presents an entirely new 
strategy to correct and possibly even prevent some of the ravages 
of this disease,'' said Robert J. Beall, president and chief 
executive officer of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	DHA is available as a nutritional supplement in health food  
stores, but the researchers and foundation officials warned 
patients against experimenting at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials are expected to begin next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've made some tantalizing observations in an animal  
model,'' said Dr. Peter Durie, director of cystic fibrosis research 
at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, where the CF gene was 
discovered 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal hereditary disease  
among Caucasians in the United States. The median life expectancy 
is 32 years. Treatments to fight lung infections and improve 
nutrition have improved care dramatically, but they treat only 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	One cystic fibrosis patient was optimistic about the research.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very promising,'' said Suzanne Pattee, an  
attorney at the Washington, D.C.-based CF Foundation. As for her 
illness, she said, ``Obviously I'm more fortunate than many -- I'm 
in my mid-30s.''

<HEADLINE>  Boxers Dismiss Gender Critics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Margaret McGregor and Loi Chow are prepared to  
make history in the boxing ring. 
</P>
<P>
	But they hugged like old friends at Friday's weigh-in. After all  
the controversy over what is believed to be the first professional 
bout between the sexes, both fighters say they're ready to prove 
the critics wrong -- in the ring tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll let the action do the talking,'' Chow said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love to box,'' McGregor said. ``I need to get in the ring.''  
</P>
<P>
	McGregor, a landscaper from Bremerton, Wash., and Chow, a jockey  
from Vancouver, British Columbia, will both earn $1,500 win or lose 
-- although some say more than money is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Chow, who weighed in at 128 pounds in jeans, sneakers and a  
T-shirt, admitted Friday he feels caught in a ``lose-lose'' 
situation in the lightweight bout: If he wins, he's a brute who 
beat up a woman; if he loses, he's a wimp who got beat by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he has never hit a woman before, but that won't hold him  
back. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is not a woman the moment she steps in the ring with me,''  
said Chow, 33. ``She's an opponent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chow is 0-2 as a professional boxer and hasn't fought in more  
than three years. But the 5-foot-2 man said he feels he has ``a 
slight edge'' over McGregor, who's won three pro matches against 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	Chow stepped in to box McGregor after the fighter he was  
training, Hector Morales, pulled out of the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Chow said, ``Regrets -- I have none.''  
</P>
<P>
	McGregor said critics of the fight ``should open their minds a  
little more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor, who's 5-foot-4 and weighed in at 129 pounds in a  
sports bra and paisley shorts, praised Chow as ``a gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe it's a good match,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Like Chow, McGregor has been overwhelmed by the media attention.  
Co-promoter Jim Rupp said he has heard from news organizations in a 
dozen countries wishing to cover the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a small-town girl, I like to box,'' McGregor, 36,  
told reporters. ``You all got pretty excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with male and female boxing organizations have decried  
the bout, calling it a sideshow that sets back the sport. In an age 
when women athletes are gaining stardom in such sports as 
basketball and soccer, many people think male-female boxing crosses 
a line that shouldn't be crossed. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor doesn't see it that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this boosts boxing for everyone,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both fighters planned on sleeping a lot before their four-round  
bout, scheduled to be the last of the night even though it's the 
undercard to a fight between lightweights Martin O'Malley and Tito 
Tovar. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as boxing goes, Rupp said, the O'Malley fight will be the  
one to watch. But he understands the spotlight on McGregor and 
Chow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's only one first,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell To Meet With Knicks Execs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell will meet Sunday with  
Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy and general manager Scott Layden to 
explain his absence from training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks held their final practice Saturday and flew back to  
suburban New York, where Sprewell was staying at a hotel after 
reportedly driving cross-country from Oakland, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Layden spoke Friday and Saturday with Sprewell's agent, Robert  
Gist, but refused to divulge details of the call. Layden said he 
did not speak directly with Sprewell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some sense of what happened, but I still think it's  
important that Jeff and I sit down with Latrell and see what he has 
to say,'' Layden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said the team was leaving Charleston a little bumped  
and bruised, and he gave the players a day off Sunday. The Knicks 
will practice Monday morning before holding a public scrimmage in 
the afternoon at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Their first exhibition game is Tuesday night, but first the team  
needs to address the Sprewell situation. He was expected to arrive 
in camp by Wednesday, but failed to show up and did not telephone 
the team to explain himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know really what's happened,'' Van Gundy said. ``After  
we speak tomorrow, everybody will have a better understanding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting to hear what he has to say. I'm waiting for my  
opportunity to say to him what I want to say,'' the coach said.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pitcher Reveals Heart Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Chicago Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood has a dime-sized  
hole in his heart, a condition that probably will not affect his 
baseball career, the Chicago Tribune reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old Wood, the 1998 NL rookie of the year, missed the  
entire season after blowing out his right elbow in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, however, Wood learned he had a condition called  
atrial septal defect, which can cause a gradual weakening of the 
heart and cut life expectancy to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right before spring training I got a viral infection and my  
system got really worn down,'' Wood told the Tribune. ``I woke up 
one morning at 5 in the morning and I was really sick. I'd been 
sick the last couple of nights, not able to keep anything down. I 
was worn down, so I ended up going to the hospital.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a hospital in Mesa, Wood said, ``they couldn't keep my blood  
pressure up, so they did some tests on my heart and found a little 
hole . . . and it was leaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors discovered the hole in the wall separating the two upper  
chambers. Doctors often recommend that the hole be closed at some 
point -- Wood's doctors told him his would have to be fixed by the 
time he was 30 or 40. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood chose not to have surgery right away.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most (people with ASD) survive,'' Dr. Keith Horvath, assistant  
professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Northwestern University 
Medical School, told the Tribune.

	``From a surgical point of view, it's a very low-risk thing to  
fix. Most of the time if people have one, they become symptomatic 
by the time they're in their 30s, or a lot of times at 2 or 3,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardiologists call ASD a ``silent killer'' because it affects a  
person over a long period. But they said there is no danger of Wood 
collapsing on the mound while pitching, even if the hole goes 
unfixed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a Hank Gathers or Reggie Lewis (situation),''  
Horvath said, mentioning two star athletes who died unexpectedly of 
heart ailments at young ages. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who tied a major league record with 20 strikeouts in a  
game in 1998 while going 13-6, later learned that his mother, 
43-year-old Terry, also had ASD. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he will have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the  
heart) done every year. Horvath said Wood probably can wait to have 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to balance the risk and the benefit,'' he said. ``How  
long is his career going to be? Can he wait a few years? Sure, 
probably. But at some point, what can happen is that the blood ends 
up going in the wrong direction, and it leads to congestion in the 
lungs. You develop high blood pressure in the lungs. The problem is 
we can't treat that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood intends to return to the Cubs next season.  
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's motivated me the most are the people who've  
said I'm not going to come back,'' he said. ``I've had a lot of 
support from fans and other players when I've gone on the road, a 
lot of concern. Guys who have never met me before (are) coming up 
to me and asking me how I'm doing, wishing me well and for a quick 
and healthy recovery. That's very uplifting, and the fan support 
has been tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's going to drive me the most is all the people who are  
saying I'm not going to be the same, I'm not going to come back,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 9, Indians 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In a series full of surprises, now this: The  
Boston Red Sox will play again. 
</P>
<P>
	They won Saturday for only the second time in 20 playoff games.  
They did it without an injured Nomar Garciaparra and with more bad 
news on Pedro Martinez's sprained back muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	They hit like Cleveland, baseball's highest scoring team since  
1950, scoring six runs in the seventh inning to beat the Indians 
9-3 in Game 3 and avoid a first-round sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	And those late runs were produced by two players who have  
struggled at the plate -- John Valentin with a tiebreaking, two-run 
double, and Brian Daubach with a three-run homer. Garciaparra's 
replacement, Lou Merloni, who singled in the final run. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the biggest surprise as the Red Sox cut the Indians'  
lead to 2-1 in the best-of-5 division series was the strong 
performance from Ramon Martinez, Pedro's older brother, who pitched 
his first major league game in nearly 15 months on Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	And they did it against a team that was thinking sweep after its  
11-1 domination of Boston in Game 2 at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Red Sox will play another game in Fenway Park on Sunday  
with the odds still stacked against them. Bartolo Colon, dominant 
in Cleveland's 3-2 Game 1 victory, faces Kent Mercker, who was 2-0 
in just five starts after being acquired from St. Louis on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox ended their postseason futility streak at home,  
winning for the first time in eight games since a victory in Game 5 
of the 1986 World Series. Their 1-18 stretch began in the next game 
when Bill Buckner's infamous error gave New York a comeback win two 
days before the Mets won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	That's something Boston hasn't done since 1918, Cleveland since  
1948 when it beat another Boston team, the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox chances got a boost from the hitting problems of  
four Indians. Kenny Lofton, Manny Ramirez, Dave Justice and Sandy 
Alomar were a combined 0-for-35 in the series until Lofton singled 
in the seventh off winning pitcher Derek Lowe and came around to 
score the run that tied it at 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Burba had allowed one hit before leaving after four innings  
with tightness under his right forearm and a 1-0 lead. Jaret 
Wright, the losing pitcher, replaced him and the game began 
slipping away as he allowed two runs in the fifth and Valentin's 
go-ahead homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed the first two runners in the seventh to reach base --  
walking Merloni and hitting Jason Varitek. Ricardo Rincon then came 
in to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Lewis' sacrifice bunt attempt turned into a forceout when  
Travis Fryman threw out Merloni at third. Trot Nixon then struck 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jose Offerman walked, loading the bases. Then Valentin,  
0-for-10 before his homer and whose throwing error allowed the 
tying run to score in the seventh, doubled. 
</P>
<P>
	Daubach, who tailed off sharply late in the season, then hit a  
three-run homer. The onslaught continued against Sean DePaula, who 
gave up a walk to Mike Stanley, a single to Troy O'Leary and an RBI 
single to Merloni. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest offensive show of the series by the Red Sox,  
who totaled three runs and 11 hits in the first two games. And they 
did it without Garciaparra, who hit .357. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the game with a bruised right wrist suffered two weeks  
earlier when he was hit by a pitch by Baltimore's Al Reyes. 
Garciaparra played the first two games, going 2-for-6 with a homer 
and a double. 
</P>
<P>
	But he sat out Friday's team workout then decided he couldn't  
play after taking some swings in the batting cage before Saturday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez's health check didn't go much better. Martinez  
had left the opener with a sprained muscle under his right shoulder 
blade after four innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He threw for the first time since then before Saturday's game  
but the exercise lasted about one minute when he felt discomfort. 
He planned to try again Sunday with hopes of starting in a possible 
fifth game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez, who underwent rotator cuff surgery on his right  
shoulder on June 30, 1998, was 2-1 this season, finishing with two 
strong starts against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he allowed two runs on five hits and three walks  
while striking out six in 5 2-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave up the tying run in the sixth when Roberto Alomar  
doubled, took third on Ramirez's groundout to first and scored on 
Harold Baines' grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was replaced by Lowe, Martinez tipped his cap as the  
crowd gave him a standing ovation. His brother was the first to 
shake his hand in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland took a 1-0 lead on Justice's sacrifice fly in the  
fourth. But Wright gave up a run-scoring single to Darren Lewis and 
a sacrifice fly in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright was available because Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove  
decided he would start Bartolo Colon in a fourth game, if one was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wright, 1-5 with a 5.97 ERA in the second half of the  
season, had trouble Saturday even when he got outs. 
</P>
<P>
	The first batter, O'Leary, hit a hard shot off Wright's shin  
that Fryman fielded, then threw the ball to first for the out. 
</P>
<P>
	But a single by Merloni and a double by Varitek put runners at  
second and third. That set up another confrontation between Wright 
and Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright hit Lewis in the helmet in last year's first game of the  
division series, then hit him with a curveball April 23 that 
prompted the usually mild-mannered Lewis to charge the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	With fans derisively chanting, ``Ja-ret, Ja-ret,'' Lewis singled  
in Merloni. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Burba retired the first nine batters until Offerman started 
the fourth with a single. ... Boston had 11 hits after totaling 
that many in the first two games.

<HEADLINE> Nike Discloses Factory Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Pressured by university protests of  
sweatshop conditions, Nike has made public all the overseas and 
domestic factories that make T-shirts, hats and sweatshirts 
licensed by five major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids really moved the process along,'' said Joel Seguine,  
spokesman for the University of Michigan, one of the five 
universities that add their logos to clothing with the Nike swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
	The list applies to clothing sold in student stores or as  
general merchandise, not to equipment for athletic teams, which is 
under separate license. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaverton-based Nike disclosed the factory sites Thursday on its  
Web site, www.nikebiz.com, listing addresses where clothing is made 
for Michigan, Arizona, Duke, Georgetown and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site listed 41 factories in 11 countries, including  
China, Bangladesh, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen factories were in the United States, mostly in  
the South. ``I'm sure that was a surprise to most people,'' said 
Vada Manager, Nike's director of manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing was welcomed by officials at all the schools.  
Several noted that Nike had made the disclosure well in advance of 
a March deadline the universities had set. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike Chairman Phil Knight offered to disclose the factory sites  
last March if the colleges required disclosure from all licensed 
manufacturers, which the schools have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists fighting sweatshop labor practices were quick to  
praise Nike, saying it would put pressure on other major athletic 
apparel and equipment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's smart of them and I hope other companies will follow  
them,'' said Dan Hennefeld, a spokesman for United Students Against 
Sweatshops, a student coalition that has pushed for labor reform.

<HEADLINE> Romanians Lead Gymnastics Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Andreea Raducan floated and Maria Olaru  
flew, overshadowing star teammate Simona Amanar as defending 
champion Romania took the lead today in women's team qualifying at 
the World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians have lost 1997 triple gold medalist Gina Gogean to  
retirement, but Raducan stepped in serenely, scoring 9.812 on the 
balance beam and 9.800 in the floor exercises, where she sometimes 
seemed to barely touch the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaru's best was a 9.787 on the floor, but her consistency put  
her into the individual lead with 38.792 to 38.755 for Raducan and 
38.467 for Amanar, the 1997 all-around silver medalist, who scored 
9.812 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Next best of the individuals was Czech gymnast Jana Komrskova  
with 38.137. The top 36 women advance to the competition for the 
all-around gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1997 bronze medalist China and a strong U.S. team yet to  
compete on Sunday, Romania led with 154.394 points to 153.576 for 
the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, the 1997 runner-up, was a close second thanks to a saucy  
performance by defending individual champion Svetlana Khorkina, who 
sometimes appeared to be using conjuring tricks to flip from place 
to place. 
</P>
<P>
	She gained the day's best score, 9.837, on the uneven bars.  
</P>
<P>
	Third was Ukraine with 151.970, followed by Australia with  
150.688. Spain had 150.407, France 149.451, Italy 148.545, Britain 
146.982, Japan 145.740 and the Netherlands 144.402. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong Chinese and American teams will compete Sunday.

<HEADLINE> NetAid Concerts Aim To Help Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations is hoping to tap into a new  
generation of philanthropists and bring attention to world poverty 
on Saturday with overlapping rock concerts in three cities -- all 
broadcast live on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One billion hits are expected on the U.N. Development Program's  
Web site, where Internet surfers can log on and rock on with, among 
others, David Bowie and the Eurythmics in London, Bryan Ferry in 
Geneva, and Bono, Sting and Puff Daddy at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Local television and radio stations also will carry the concerts  
live. 
</P>
<P>
	Official development aid has dwindled in recent years, and the  
U.N. agency is hoping to convince a new generation to open their 
minds and wallets to alleviate world poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it won't let governments off the hook,'' spokesman Mark  
Malloch Brown said Friday in London. ``I think this will build 
pressure on them when they see this message going out to a wider 
group of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers will be asked to donate money by entering their credit  
card information on the Web site or pledging a future donation. 
</P>
<P>
	With a click of a mouse, money can be directed to one of five  
designated areas: ending hunger, helping refugees, saving the 
environment, securing human rights or relieving debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of dollars have poured into the site, the  
United Nations said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in the history of mankind, we have the  
capacity to tackle poverty,'' said U.N. spokesman Jean Fabre, 
speaking to reporters in Geneva. ``NetAid is mobilizing artists and 
the Internet so that people have the possibility to be informed and 
also to be linked up together.''

<HEADLINE> Lee To Meet JonBenet Prosecutors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- A top forensic scientist came to Boulder  
on Saturday to meet with prosecutors as the JonBenet Ramsey grand 
jury prepared to meet at least once more before announcing a 
decision on its investigation of the girl's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Lee, a veteran of the O.J. Simpson trial and earlier  
consultations on the JonBenet case, was to meet with Boulder County 
District Attorney Alex Hunter, said Hunter's spokeswoman, Suzanne 
Laurion. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was to take place out of the grand jury's presence.  
Hunter did not disclose what evidence would be reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Hunter hinted that an announcement might be imminent  
in the nearly 3-year-old case, telling reporters to stay in contact 
with his office during the weekend. Later, however, Laurion said 
there would be no public statements on the case during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurion announced that the grand jury will meet again Tuesday.  
The panel has an Oct. 20 deadline to issue indictments, issue a 
report or disband without taking action. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet was found strangled, bound and beaten in her home on  
Dec. 26, 1996, about seven hours after her mother, Patsy Ramsey, 
called 911 to report the girl was missing. She told police she had 
found a 2 1/2-page note demanding $118,000 for JonBenet's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parents have been considered suspects, and both have said  
they are innocent.

<HEADLINE> France, Italy, Germany Make Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	World Cup champion France, Germany and Italy qualified for the  
European 2000 soccer championships Saturday, while England stayed 
in contention by squeezing into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also gaining automatic spots in next year's tournament were  
Yugoslavia, Romania and Portugal. Playoff berths were secured by 
Denmark, Ukraine, Turkey and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the day, the possibility existed that four of  
Europe's biggest soccer powers would fail to qualify for the 
16-team tournament in which the Netherlands and Belgium are 
co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	But France managed to win Group 4 by beating Iceland 3-2 and  
benefiting from a goalkeeping blunder that allowed Ukraine to gain 
a 1-1 tie with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	With two minutes left in regulation, Russian goalkeeper  
Alexander Filimonov mishandled a simple cross and fell backward. 
The ball slipped from his hands into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a personal catastrophe for me,'' Russian coach Oleg  
Romantsev said. ``We deserved a victory. A player of the quality 
like Filimonov's shouldn't miss such kicks and I will think twice 
before calling him to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy labored to a 0-0 tie against Belarus in Minsk, but the  
result was enough to clinch Group 1. Denmark, which had already 
completed its qualifying campaign, finished one point behind Italy 
in second place and will go into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, the defending European champion, finished atop Group 3  
by playing to a 0-0 tie with Turkey in Munich. Turkey settled for a 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a battle between bitter Balkan rivals, Yugoslavia tied  
Croatia 2-2 in Zagreb to win Group 8. Ireland threw away a chance 
to win the group by giving up a 90th-minute goal in Macedonia and 
will go to the playoffs instead. Croatia, third-place finisher at 
the 1998 World Cup, finished third in the group and was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania won Group 7 by beating Liechenstein 3-0, while Portugal  
downed Hungary 3-0 to claim an automatic qualifying spot as the 
best runner-up. The Portuguese finished with 23 points, three 
points ahead of the next best runner-up, Ukraine with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic, which had already won Group 9, finished with  
a 10-0 record by beating the Faeroe Islands 2-0 in Prague. The 
Czechs, runners-up at the 1996 championships, are the first team 
European team ever to win all their qualifying games. 
</P>
<P>
	England got a reprieve when Sweden beat Poland 2-0 in Stockholm.  
The result ensured that England finished second in Group 5 and 
clinched a berth in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden already had qualified as a group winner and had nothing  
to play for Saturday. England needed a victory by Sweden, while 
Poland needed only a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory left Sweden with 22 points. England and Poland both  
finished with 13 points, but England made the playoffs because of 
better head-to-head results. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, Spain and the Czech Republic had qualified as group  
winners. Belgium and the Netherlands qualified automatically as 
co-hosts. Scotland and Slovenia had clinched playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth and final playoff spot will be filled by Israel or  
Cyprus, both in contention for the runner-up spot in Group 6. That 
will be determined Sunday when Israel plays at Spain and Cyprus at 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the playoffs is Wednesday in Aachen, Germany. The  
first-leg games are Nov. 13-14 and the second leg Nov. 17. The four 
winners advance to the championships.

                           *John McLendon    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND HEIGHTS, Ohio (AP) -- Basketball Hall of Famer John  
McLendon, the last surviving student of Dr. James Naismith, the 
sport's creator, died Friday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	McLendon played at the University of Kansas in the early 1930s  
under Naismith. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, blacks were barred from the university pool even  
though swimming was a graduation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I jumped in and they drained the pool,'' McLendon recalled  
several years ago. ``Dr. Naismith wasn't about to have any of that 
so he sent over three of the biggest men on the basketball team to 
sit by the pool every time I swam. The administration wasn't happy, 
but there were no problems after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLendon went on to a 25-year coaching career and was inducted  
into the Hall of Fame in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first college coach to win three consecutive national  
titles, with Tennessee State of the NAIA from 1957 to 1959. The 
following season, he became the first black professional coach with 
the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League.

 *John C. Phillips    	
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- John C. Phillips, a retired Texas appeals  
court judge, died Saturday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, elected to the state Third Court of Appeals in 1963,  
was elected chief justice four years later and served in that 
capacity until his retirement in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	He served during World War II as an FBI special intelligence  
service agent in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips served as a Supreme Court briefing clerk, Texas  
Railroad Commission hearings examiner and assistant attorney 
general.

</P>
<P>
	ORONO, Minn. (AP) -- John Skoglund, the former Minnesota Vikings  
chairman, died Friday of lung cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Skoglund was chairman of the Vikings' board until the team was  
sold last year. His father, insurance mogul H.P. Skoglund, was one 
of the original owners of the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman, John Skoglund stayed out of the limelight. He said  
earlier this year that the satisfaction of owning part of the 
Vikings was enough for him. 

</P>
<P>
 *Jeremy Streck    	
</P>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former University of Kentucky football  
player Jeremy Streck, a starting senior guard last season, died 
Saturday of injuries suffered after being hit by a car. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Streck had been in critical condition since he was struck on  
Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the accident, police charged a man with driving  
under the influence. There was no word on whether additional 
charges would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 313-pound lineman from Cincinnati, Streck started 18  
games and played in 32 during his career at Kentucky. He started 
all 12 games last season at left guard as the Wildcats went 7-5, 
making their first appearance in a New Year's Day bowl game since 
1952.

	BEIJING (AP) -- China still hopes to put an astronaut in space,  
perhaps before the end of the year, Beijing's official newspapers 
reported Saturday, citing a senior executive in a government-run 
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang Liheng, deputy general manager of the China Aerospace  
Industrial Company, said plans for a launch of the manned 
spacecraft have been fixed for the century's end or early next 
century, the Beijing Daily and Beijing Evening News reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Wang provided no other details, as is usual in the vague  
official pronouncements on China's secretive space program. But the 
newspapers noted that extensive training has been given to a group 
of people who ``will become China's first generation of real 
astronauts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the program proves successful, China will become only the  
third country after the United States and the then-Soviet Union to 
achieve manned space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	China, an overwhelmingly rural country where farmers on average  
make $260 a year, sees its space program as a symbol of national 
strength. Many floats in the Oct. 1 National Day parade that marked 
50 years of communist rule carried models of rockets, including a 
Chinese version of the U.S. space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese aerospace officials announced earlier this year that  
they hoped to launch the manned spacecraft around the anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Western experts who track the Chinese space program believe that  
China has a new rocket to carry a reusable manned craft into orbit, 
but no shuttle-type vehicle. In the experts' opinion, China will 
have to conduct one, if not two, unmanned test launches of the 
craft before sending it up with astronauts inside. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the experts say, there have been no signs that a test  
has been conducted.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Slogan Has Family Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is taking pains in  
politics to be his own man, but a new biography says the Republican 
presidential candidate is using a slogan that was applied to his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservative'' was used by Ron Kaufman, an aide  
to the senior Bush when he was running for president in the 
mid-1980s, in a Christian magazine article designed to make 
religious conservatives comfortable with the candidate, the 
biography says. 
</P>
<P>
	``First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty,'' was  
released Sunday. The book, the first in a new series of competing 
biographies coming out on the GOP front-runner, was written by Bill 
Minutaglio, a Dallas Morning News reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The evenhanded book leaves unsettled two questions from the  
governor's past. It avoids any ``dollops of drug tales'' -- the 
long-standing, still-unsubstantiated speculation about whether the 
younger Bush ever used illegal drugs; and it offers no proof his 
family pulled strings to keep him out of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	``First Son'' details Bush's time living in Washington when he  
served as ``loyalty monitor'' in his father's presidential 
campaign. He was also the family's liaison with ascendant leaders 
of the religious right, who worried the vice president was not 
nearly as in tune with their issues as President Reagan was. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1986, the month the younger Bush suddenly stopped his  
years of hard drinking, the evangelical magazine Christian Herald 
published a cover story written by a Bush campaign aide in which 
Kaufman, head of the vice president's political action committee, 
said the candidate was best described as a ``compassionate 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The phrase gained limited currency in the 1988 campaign. It was  
used to describe both the vice president and a rival for the GOP 
nomination that year, Bob Dole. Indeed, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch 
of Utah, now running against the younger Bush, called himself a 
compassionate conservative way back in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the slogan is at the core of the governor's campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	The book says that once the vice president won the election, his  
son helped hand out political favors. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Minutaglio writes, the younger Bush suggested a  
wealthy Texas publisher, Roger Horchow, be appointed chairman of 
the National Endowment for the Arts because he had given money to 
the Bush campaign. But when aides discovered the publisher had also 
contributed to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, he scratched 
his name from the list.

<HEADLINE> No. 6 Tenn. 37, No. 10 Georgia 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tee Martin ran for three touchdowns and  
threw for another Saturday to lead No. 6 Tennessee to a 37-20 
victory over No. 10 Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers (4-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) also got a  
100-yard kickoff return from Leonard Scott to became the first team 
ever to beat Georgia (4-1, 2-1) in nine straight meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols' victory also forged a three-way tie at the top of the  
SEC Eastern Division among Tennessee, Georgia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving with an injured right (throwing) wrist in the  
fourth quarter, Martin led the Vols to 458 total yards. He 
completed 21 of 35 passes for 283 yards, with a touchdown and two 
interceptions. The extent of Martin's injury was not immediately 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	Cedrick Wilson led the Tennessee receivers with eight catches  
for 107 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs had been averaging 191 yards a game on the ground  
this year, but Tennessee held them to 54 yards on 30 carries. 
Jasper Sanks, who had gone over 100 yards three straight games, had 
37 yards on eight carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Quincy Carter completed 20 of 34 passes for 228 yards and two  
touchdowns despite heavy pressure most of the night. Terrence 
Edwards had five catches for 98 yards and a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee took control with a 21-point second quarter for a 28-7  
lead at the break, then added the only points of the third quarter 
on a safety when Georgia punter Wynn Kopp fell on a high center 
snap at his own goal line to make it 30-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia made it interesting for a time early in the fourth  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter led the 'Dogs on a 71-yard drive to score on his 4-yard  
pass to Jevaris Johnson with 14:16 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tennessee's next series, Jamie Henderson intercepted a Martin  
pass and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown to narrow the Vols' 
lead to 30-20 with 12 1/2 minutes still to play. 
</P>
<P>
	But Scott took the ensuing kickoff 100 yards to extend the  
margin back to 37-20, much to the relief of most of the crowd of 
107,247 who endured a steady, light rain the entire game. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was still erratic throwing the ball early, as he has been  
since injuring his throwing shoulder against Florida, but several 
times bailed the Vols out of trouble with timely scrambles. 
</P>
<P>
	His three scoring runs all came in the first half and covered 3,  
6 and 1 yard. He also scrambled for 22 yards on a third-and-15, and 
20 yards to the Georgia 9 to set up a 10-yard touchdown pass to 
Jamal Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's third TD run came with 24 seconds left in the half to  
cap an 82-yard drive in 10 plays to beat the clock and give the 
Volunteers a 28-7 lead at the break. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee scored with its opening drive, going 63 yards in nine  
plays. The biggest was a 34-yard completion to Eric Parker. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia drove 90 yards in 12 plays to tie it 7-7 late in the  
first quarter. Carter converted two long third downs. The touchdown 
came on a 27-yard pass from Carter to Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee went 82 yards with the ensuing possession to score on  
the screen pass to Lewis for a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After Georgia went three-and-out, the Vols drove 65 yards in  
seven plays to go ahead 21-7. Martin scored on a 6-yard sweep 
around right end. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive to beat the halftime clock was salvaged early on.  
Cedrick Wilson recovered his own fumble when two Georgia players 
had a good shot at it on the second play at the Tennessee 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin completed passes of 16 yards to Eric Parker, 19 to Lewis,  
17 to David Martin and 9 to Parker to march the Vols to the Georgia 
13 with the clock winding down and Tennessee out of timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis got 11 yards on first down, then took it to the 1 on the  
next play. Martin sneaked in with 24 seconds left in the half.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Says IRA Must Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Protestant politician  
central to the success or failure of Northern Ireland's peace 
accord told his divided supporters Saturday they must try to work 
with their enemies in the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. 
</P>
<P>
	But David Trimble's central demand -- that the Irish Republican  
Army disarm before a new Protestant-Catholic government can be 
formed -- remained unchanged. Disagreement on that point has been 
the major stumbling block in the stalled Northern Ireland peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing members of his Ulster Unionists party, Trimble  
castigated hard-line Protestant critics -- including several within 
the conference room -- who want him to abandon crucial talks this 
month with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. He called those who oppose 
the 1998 Good Friday peace accord ``crude opportunists'' and ``a 
carping handful,'' and he appealed for them to stop criticizing his 
leadership in public. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be no progress unless the Ulster Unionists forge  
agreements with Catholic nationalists -- and that includes Sinn 
Fein, which controls a 17 percent share of the vote in the 
British-ruled province, Trimble said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem we face now is inescapable while Sinn Fein  
maintains substantial electoral support,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trimble emphasized he would not give in on his demand for a  
firm IRA commitment to disarm before he agrees to govern Northern 
Ireland in coalition with four parties, including Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
	With so many Ulster Unionists convinced that the IRA will never  
disarm, Saturday's annual party conference was considered an 
essential hurdle for Trimble to clear before any further 
compromises on his part. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble's speech received a minute's standing ovation.  
Afterwards, his negotiating policy of ``no guns, no government'' 
was endorsed unanimously by the approximately 300 activists 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed coalition government is the core of the peace  
accord. But it has yet to materialize -- in large part because of 
the disagreement over the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord anticipated that the IRA would gradually disarm in  
cooperation with international arms inspectors. But the outlawed 
IRA has rejected that goal. The Ulster Unionists insist Sinn Fein's 
eligibility to hold office is tied to IRA intentions, while Sinn 
Fein insists it is not. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein negotiator Gerry Kelly said Trimble is placing  
``irresponsible and unachievable preconditions'' on Sinn Fein's 
participation in the coalition. He accused Trimble of defending the 
coalition verbally but subverting it with his demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who directed the negotiations  
that produced the Good Friday deal, will resume efforts in Belfast 
on Monday to find a compromise between the two sides. Last week, he 
suggested neither side had budged and his diplomacy could fail.

<HEADLINE> Iverson Says He Wants NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The news could have turned into another ugly  
controversy for Allen Iverson's impressive collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Not even five minutes after sitting down with reporters to talk  
about the season, Philadelphia 76ers coach Larry Brown slipped an 
interesting tidbit into the conversation: Iverson, his star player 
and occasional adversary, was going to have to change positions 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson won his first scoring title last season after Brown  
moved him to shooting guard. Now, the coach wants him to move back 
to point guard for about 18 minutes a game so promising second-year 
player Larry Hughes can have more playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a time when Iverson would have instantly rebelled,  
railed against the establishment, wondered aloud why everyone was 
out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't the same Iverson.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can play any position on the floor, unless you try to have  
me guard somebody like Shaq or post him up,'' Iverson said, 
laughing. ``I'll do anything to help this team win, I don't care 
what it is. I'll do anything it takes to get a championship. I 
think coach Brown knows what it takes to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These are revealing words from a player who cursed Brown during  
a game last season after a long spell on the bench. As he prepares 
for his fourth year in the NBA -- his first coming off a winning 
season -- Iverson is saying all the right things. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took winning for people to just open their eyes and listen  
to me,'' said Iverson, preparing for a season of heightened 
expectations after leading the Sixers to the playoffs for the first 
time since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's always been unfair the way people treated me when  
I first came in the league, because of my past,'' Iverson said. ``I 
always had some baggage anyway. People were always taking shots at 
me from the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 24-year-old Iverson finally proved to his critics last year  
that he can be the leader on a winning team. The Sixers were 28-22 
in the lockout-shortened season, upset Orlando in the first round 
of the playoffs and were swept by Indiana in the Eastern Conference 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson became the first scoring champion of the post-Michael  
Jordan era and was named to the all-NBA first team. Hounded by 
losing, missed practices and trouble with the law in his first two 
seasons, Iverson made it through the year with only one minor 
squabble with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always told him, these awards will come if you play on a  
winning team,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson's relationship with his old-school coach has evolved  
from what seemed like an impossible mismatch into one of respect, 
even admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	After moving Iverson to shooting guard to take advantage of his  
scoring ability, Brown is adding a new twist this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to allow us to put Larry Hughes on the court, and I  
think it's going to be a challenge,'' Brown said. ``He's going to 
have to play point guard 16-18 minutes a game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After having so many differences with Brown over playing time  
and playing style, Iverson suddenly sounds like a Brown clone. 
</P>
<P>
	``My main goal is just to play better defensively,'' Iverson  
said. ``I want to hopefully lead the league in steals. I want to 
get my assists up more than I did last year, and my rebounding, but 
most importantly my field goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want my coach to say, `He's gotten better at every aspect of  
his game.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	As an assistant to Rudy Tomjanovich on the U.S. Olympic team,  
Brown said he will offer his endorsement of Iverson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on what he did last year, I think he deserves being  
considered,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Brown's history of moving around, he admits he can see the  
day when Iverson is playing for someone else. Already in charge of 
the Sixers' basketball operations, Brown says, ``I wouldn't mind 
watching somebody else coach someday if we felt we built it the 
right way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who played for Dean Smith and worked as his assistant at  
North Carolina, said there is still one job he'd have a hard time 
turning down. 
</P>
<P>
	``If coach Smith called me up and said, `Larry, I'd like you to  
coach the University of North Carolina,' that would be a tough call 
for me,' '' Brown said. ``But I would love to finish my career here 
if that's possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Sixers met with the media last week before heading to  
training camp in Chapel Hill, N.C., Iverson seemed relieved to talk 
mostly about basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	He clowned around for the cameras and posed for shots while  
holding a Mr. Potato Head doll. It was part of a TV commercial for 
Disney On Ice, a rare endorsement opportunity. Iverson is scheduled 
to meet with Sixers officials soon to discuss plans to get him the 
marketing exposure he's lacked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same progress he's showed on the court, he's showed off  
the court the last three years,'' said Dave Coskey, the Sixers' 
vice president for public relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson spent four months in jail during high school on charges  
he was involved in a brawl, but the conviction was later 
overturned. He said many people in that situation ``never bounce 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With me, I took advantage of my second chance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	His goals have changed, his worries faded perhaps just enough so  
he can see the future more clearly. And he sees jewelry in the 
future; the kind NBA players like to put on their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm thinking `championship,''' he said.

<HEADLINE> Other Martinez Looks To Save Boston  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- He's not Pedro, but he's the best Martinez  
available. It was up to Ramon to help keep the Boston Red Sox's 
season from ending today. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pedro was 23-4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts, big  
brother Ramon made just four appearances after missing nearly 15 
months following shoulder surgery. And he's the healthiest Martinez 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can pitch,'' Ramon said Friday. ``I'm very confident that I  
can pitch anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro left the opener after four innings with a strained muscle  
in his back and a 2-0 lead Wednesday night. The Cleveland Indians 
came back to win 3-2. The following day, Cleveland won 11-1 to move 
within one win of sweeping the best-of-5 AL division series. 
</P>
<P>
	That win could come today and it was up to Martinez (2-1) to  
keep the Indians from starting quickly in Game 3, while Dave Burba 
(15-9) pitched for Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I caught him (Ramon Martinez) against Cleveland and he threw  
pretty well,'' Boston catcher Jason Varitek said. ``You're talking 
about an extremely intelligent man with an extremely intelligent 
baseball sense. I'm excited to have him on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Martinez underwent shoulder surgery on June 30, 1998, then  
spent most of this season working his way back, Burba entered the 
playoffs as Cleveland's most productive starter the last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I start thinking, `Well, this is a big game. I have  
to do this. I have to do that,' then I start doing things Dave 
Burba is not capable of doing,'' Burba said. ``So I'm going to 
approach it like it's any other start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boston's best hitter, AL batting champion Nomar Garciaparra, was  
expected to play after sitting out his team's light workout Friday. 
He rested a bruised right wrist suffered when he was hit by a pitch 
Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro was baseball's best pitcher during the season, and Ramon  
said his younger brother might be able to pitch in a fifth game in 
Cleveland on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Ramon must help the Red Sox get that far against only the  
seventh team in baseball history to score more than 1,000 runs in a 
season. Then, Boston must win again on Sunday when Kent Mercker is 
scheduled to pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ramon Martinez is capable of pitching a great game,''  
Cleveland's Roberto Alomar said. ``He has Pedro by his side who can 
give him some great advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How about: win or else.  
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Sox don't, they will have extended one of baseball's  
longest stretches of postseason futility. They will be 1-19 since 
that infamous night in 1986 when a baseball rolled between Bill 
Buckner's legs and New York evened the World Series at 3-3. Two 
nights later, the Mets were world champions, a status the Red Sox 
last enjoyed in 1918. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Red Sox aren't looking at the past, not even as recently  
as last Wednesday when they were stunned by the loss of Pedro 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were ... kind of shocked a little that he had to come out  
in the fourth inning,'' Ramon said. ``We don't have to think about 
it (Saturday). Play another game and give our best shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing another game seemed so far away for Ramon when he  
underwent surgery while with the Los Angeles Dodgers last summer. 
Suddenly, the career of one of the NL's best pitchers was in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a free agent and signed with his brother's team last  
March 11. After 10 rehabilitation starts, he pitched against Kansas 
City on Sept. 2, allowing four runs in three innings and taking the 
loss. Twelve days later, he was better, allowing three runs in 4 
2-3 innings against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the wins in his last two starts, both against Baltimore,  
giving up one run and six hits in 13 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see him getting better and better and better every  
start,'' Boston pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``You can see him 
starting to blossom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While it's improbable the Red Sox can come back to win three  
straight games and take the series, the Indians did win three 
straight last year after losing the opener to Pedro Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to get anything less than the best that the Red  
Sox have to give us,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said. ``That 
doesn't leave little warm and fuzzies in your stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll feel a lot better if the Indians can continue hitting like  
they did in Game 2 when they led 11-1 after four innings as Jim 
Thome hit a grand slam and Harold Baines had a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez made two postseason starts with the Dodgers, going 0-1  
with a 5.84 ERA. But in the regular season he's 125-78 with a 3.43 
ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Burba replaced ejected starter Dwight Gooden in the second  
inning of the second game last year against Boston. Burba allowed 
three runs in 5 1-3 innings and got the win in a 9-5 victory. ... 
The Red Sox have just 11 hits in two games. ... Boston is 16-7 
against Cleveland over the last two regular seasons but 1-5 in the 
playoffs. ... The Red Sox got a much needed day off for their 
bullpen. All seven relievers pitched in the first two games. ... 
Indians slugger Manny Ramirez, 0-for-7 with four strikeouts, dyed 
his hair orange. Hargrove said, rolling his eyes, ``I told him I 
thought his haircut was nice.''

<HEADLINE> Franco Helps Mets Advance to NLCS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It took John Franco 16 seasons to make the  
playoffs. He's not yet ready to look ahead to a possible Subway 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Franco pitched a perfect 10th inning to win the deciding game of  
the New York Mets' first-round victory over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Saturday and immediately turned his attention to 
the NL championship series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to think about Atlanta,'' Franco said after Todd  
Pratt's homer gave the Mets a 4-3, 10-inning win and a 3-1 series 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are enjoying right now what happened about 20 minutes ago.  
All that other stuff, if it happens, it will be great,'' said 
Franco, who shielded his son from a champagne celebration in the 
locker room. ``Right now we have to worry about playing the Braves 
in a couple of days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franco, who went from closer to set-up man after an injury to  
his middle finger in July, came into a 3-3 game in the 10th inning 
after warming up three times earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	He fell behind the first two hitters 2-0, but struck out former  
teammate Kelly Stinnett and got Lenny Harris, another ex-Met, on a 
grounder. Franco then retired Tony Womack on a grounder to third to 
end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping I didn't run out of gas and leave it in the  
bullpen,'' he said. ``Once you get called into the game, your 
adrenaline starts going. The main thing is to give my guys a chance 
to field the ball and that's what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt's homer gave Franco his first win, after 10 straight  
losses, since Sept. 13, 1997. Franco shot out of the dugout and was 
jumping up and down at home plate as Pratt rounded the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	He high-fived manager Bobby Valentine and embraced his teammates  
during a wild celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes good things happen to those who wait,'' said Franco,  
who is second on the career list with 416 saves. ``Hopefully some 
more good things will happen down the road.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That road starts Tuesday night in Atlanta. The Mets will have  
their hands full with a Braves team that beat them nine out of 12 
games, including five of six the final two weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had their way with us this year, that's for sure,''  
Franco said. ``The three games we played down in Atlanta were three 
tough games and the three we played here were tough. If this is any 
indication of what is going to happen, it is going to be a hell of 
a series.''

<HEADLINE>  Astros Look Forward to New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Forget about any sentimentality from the Houston  
Astros about playing for the last time at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the greatest pleasures I have from all of this series  
is the fact that we've played our final game in the Astrodome,'' 
manager Larry Dierker said Saturday after Atlanta beat Houston 7-5 
to win their NL playoff matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe new Enron Field with its inviting grass playing surface  
will be more hospitable to the Astros. Houston never got past the 
first round of the playoffs in 35 years at the Dome, and its chance 
this year was ended in four games by the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the days go by, there is a lot of frustration where we've  
been the last three years,'' Dierker said. ``We are really looking 
forward to being at Enron Field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros packed up for the move to their $250 million  
retractable roof stadium without remorse. A crowd of 48,553, about 
6,000 short of capacity, watched the wrapup at the ballpark called 
the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Astrodome surface has never been a friend to the players'  
knees, backs and joints,'' third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``Also, 
the ball doesn't have the lift and carry that it does outdoors. I'm 
looking forward to the grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros have won the NL Central three straight years, but  
have only two playoff victories to show for it. Atlanta swept them 
3-0 in 1997 and last year they ran into Kevin Brown and the San 
Diego Padres and were beaten 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we need to move to the new stadium to do better in the  
playoffs,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``I know everybody is 
excited about the new stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 7-0 on Saturday, the Astros rallied and cut  
the Braves lead to 7-5, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Possibly, physically it will be a lot better,'' second baseman  
Craig Biggio said. ``We won't get beat up by the turf so much. It 
should be exciting for the fans and we might have a little better 
karma there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros were twice six outs from reaching the World Series in  
the 1980 NLCS against Philadelphia. They failed to hold a 2-0 lead 
in Game 4 and lost 5-3 in 10 innings and in Game 5 they couldn't 
hold a 5-2 lead and the Phillies advanced to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the Astros lost a marathon 16-inning game to the New  
York Mets in Game 6 with the Mets winning 7-6 and denying the 
Astros once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had much luck here,'' Biggio said. ``But it hasn't  
been just our team. The teams in 1980 and 1986 also couldn't do 
much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Astrodome's spacious outfield gave the stadium a  
reputation as a great place for pitchers, Shane Reynolds sees it 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Astrodome is not that much of a pitcher's park any more  
since they moved the fences in and put those flowers up,'' Reynolds 
said. ``I think the new stadium will be a good experience for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker anticipates adjusting his roster to fit the new stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what effect the new stadium will have. It's  
going to be some growing pains, for sure. I figure we'll be halfway 
through the season getting used to it. I think every team has to 
consider its own stadium because we play half their games there,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hampton, Houston's 22-game winner, hopes the Astros get a  
boost from a change in ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into a new stadium is always exciting,'' Hampton said.  
``Hopefully, we'll be a team that can start off having a World 
Series there in the new stadium. I certainly don't think it's going 
to hurt being there.''

<HEADLINE> Silver Season Wins Again at Calder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Silver Season, who won the $200,000 Carry Stakes at  
Calder Race Course last July, had another big payday at the same 
track Saturday with a come-from-behind victory in the $300,000 
Smile Sprint Handicap for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	Rallying from next-to-last, Silver Season got through on the  
inside to win by 1 3/4 lengths over Son of a Pistol. Favored My Jeff's 
Mombo was third in a field of seven that went six furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Season, ridden by Eibar Coa, was timed in 1:10 and paid  
$7.20, $3.80 and $2.40. Son of a Pistol paid $3.80 and $2.60, while 
My Jeff's Mombo paid $2.40 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Coa kept Silver Season on the rail down the backstretch as High  
Security set the pace. My Jeff's Mombo moved into second going to 
the far turn and Son of a Pistol was third. Silver Season was 
sixth, but in good position, four lengths off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The field bunched on the stretch turn. Silver Season came off  
the rail just long enough to drive between High Security and My 
Jeff's Mombo. He got the lead approaching the eighth pole and 
maintained a safe margin to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Son of a Pistol closed well for second, 1 1/2 lengths over a  
faltering My Jeff's Mombo. The favorite barely lasted for third, a 
nose in front of Thrillin Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Season is the Kentucky-bred son of Silver Ghost owned by  
Buckram Oak Farm. He has won four of 14 starts and $387,469. After 
winning the Carry Stakes, he finished third in the Grade III 
Amsterdam at Saratoga and was soundly beaten in the Grade I King's 
Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
	Coa has ridden Silver Season in all four of his victories this  
year, but in only one of his seven losses as a 3-year-old, a 
third-place finish in the Grade II Riva Ridge at Belmont in June.

<HEADLINE> No. 23 Texas 38, Oklahoma 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Call this one a major comeback for Texas and a  
huge letdown for Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	Major Applewhite passed for three touchdowns and Hodges Mitchell  
rushed for 204 yards and a TD as the 23rd-ranked Longhorns rallied 
from a 17-point, first-quarter deficit to beat Oklahoma 38-28 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest come-from-behind victory for Texas (5-2, 2-1  
Big 12) since a similar rally to beat Texas A&AMP;M 21-17 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really came through today,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown.  
``There's a defining point in every season and this can be it for 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After turning the ball over six times in a 35-17 loss to Kansas  
State a week earlier, Applewhite stood in against a tough Oklahoma 
pass rush to complete 22 of 47 passes for 328 yards without an 
interception and no fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really physical. This one really meant a lot to me,''  
Applewhite said. 
</P>
<P>
	His third touchdown pass, an 18-yarder to Ryan Nunez, capped a  
99-yard fourth-quarter drive for the final touchdown with 8:16 left 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
	That score killed any momentum Oklahoma (3-2, 1-1) had gained  
after Sooners kicker Tim Duncan scored a touchdown on a fake field 
goal that pulled the Sooners within 31-28. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell started the Texas drive with a 35-yard run on first  
down that got the Longhorns off their goal line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hodges gave us an excellent spark today,'' Brown said. ``That  
was a huge drive and it really put the game away for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second time in as many weeks the Sooners let an  
opponent rally to win. Oklahoma led Notre Dame 30-14 in the second 
half last week before the Irish rallied to win 34-30. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be fine,'' said Sooners first-year coach Bob Stoops.  
``We don't hang our heads. We've just got to get better. We've got 
to be able to win these games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners, who opened the season with three victories, were  
frustrated after their second straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've worked too hard during the summer and this season to  
lose games like we did the past two weeks,'' said offensive lineman 
Jay Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The battle of the Big 12's best passing teams looked early on  
like an Oklahoma rout. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Heupel threw for 181 yards and two touchdowns in the first  
quarter for the Sooners. Oklahoma used multiple receiver sets -- 
including one that used six wideouts and just four down linemen -- 
to keep Texas' defense on its heels. 
</P>
<P>
	Heupel hit Antwone Savage with a 44-yard touchdown on the second  
play of the game and the Sooners led 17-0 after Duncan's 43-yard 
field goal and a 30-yard touchdown catch by Jarrail Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas closed the deficit behind three Kris Stockton field goals  
of 46, 41 and 37 yards before Applewhite hit Nunez with an 11-yard 
touchdown with 49 seconds left in the first half. Applewhite hit 
Nunez again for the 2-point conversion to complete the rally and 
tie it at 17-17. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas went ahead in the third quarter on Mitchell's 21-yard TD  
run and led 31-20 after Kwame Cavil took a flanker screen 48 yards 
up the middle for another score. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sooners closed within a field goal on Duncan's 4-yard  
touchdown catch from holder Patrick Fletcher on the fake field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma drove 80 yards on 10 plays for the touchdown, getting  
three first downs on defensive penalties against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving up big yardage in the first quarter, the Texas  
defense tightened up and allowed just 157 yards the rest of the 
game. Heupel finished 31-of-48 passing for 311 yards and three 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longhorns held Oklahoma to just 15 yards rushing on 18  
carries and started blitzing Heupel to pressure him. 
</P>
<P>
	Heupel killed the Sooners' last drive at the Texas 15 when an  
errant throw was picked off by a diving Ahmad Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we started out,'' Heupel said.''I thought it was going  
to be a really great day.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Sorry for Theft Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Suspended Florida State star receiver  
Peter Warrick apologized Saturday ``for making a poor decision and 
a bad judgment'' that resulted in his arrest for grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with ABC before the top-ranked Seminoles played  
No. 19 Miami, Warrick, dressed in baggy blue jeans and a red golf 
shirt, said he hopes to return to the team but is taking things 
``one step at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to my family, friends, team, coaches and  
most of all my fans,'' said Warrick, who watched the game on the 
sidelines with his teammates. ``I'm just trying to learn from my 
mistakes and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, considered one of the top contenders for the Heisman  
Trophy, teammate Laveranues Coles, 21, and 19-year-old Dillard's 
department store clerk Rachel Myrtil were charged with grand theft 
Thursday. The clerk was accused of selling the two players $412.38 
worth of clothing for only $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who had begun the season on probation for earlier  
violations of team rules, was kicked off the team and Warrick was 
suspended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, who was on the sideline with his teammates during the  
game, also spoke to them in the locker room before they took the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them to keep their heads up,'' Warrick said. ``Don't  
put all the focus on me, put all of it on the game. It's not about 
the Peter Warrick show -- it's a team thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick hopes he'll be reinstated to the team once his legal  
case is handled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to come back,'' he said. ``It's real tough for me  
to sit out to watch this game. I'm just trying to overcome 
obstacles - the further I get in life, the harder it's going to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick is set for a first court appearance Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, John Kenny, said neither he nor his client would  
be there because he has filed a written notice of appearance. 
Normally, it then would be at least six weeks before a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, Peter cannot afford to take too long,'' Kenny  
said. ``He has more interest in saying, `Let's get it done.'''

<HEADLINE> Russian Air Force Shells Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- The Russian air force attacked  
suspected rebel bases and training centers in Chechnya, and seven 
Russian soldiers were killed in ground clashes, news reports said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian artillery shelled targets in Chechnya as federal troops  
continued to fortify their positions in the northern third of the 
breakaway republic, the Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Russian soldiers were killed and 37 were wounded in the  
latest fighting to establish a security zone in Chechnya, a Defense 
Ministry spokesman said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry's press service said 50 Islamic militants were  
killed in the clashes, which wiped out a rebel base near the 
village of Naurskaya, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian outpost on the border between Chechnya and Dagestan  
came under automatic weapons fire during the night from separatist 
bases inside Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. There 
were no reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian ground forces invaded Chechnya two weeks ago. They want  
to establish a security zone there to prevent Muslim separatists 
from attacking neighboring regions in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had accused Russia on Friday of violating the  
Conventional Forces in Europe agreement, which limits the number of 
tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft and other non-nuclear arms in 
Europe and sets specific ceilings for particular regions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said today that Russia  
had notified the West about its military deployment in the Caucasus 
region and that a temporary buildup was within the treaty's 
framework. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of a temporary deployment of forces is  
provided for,'' Ivanov said. ``Here we are not committing any 
violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says Moscow cannot claim its deployment is temporary,  
since it has long violated higher weapon ceilings for southern 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Militants twice invaded Dagestan this summer, and are blamed by  
Moscow for a series of September apartment explosions in Russia 
that killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, refugees continued to flood from Chechnya into  
neighboring Ingushetia. About 142,000 people have fled the region 
so far, Interfax reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingush President Ruslan Aushev told Interfax that food, tents  
and other vital supplies to take care of the refugees were in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is a humanitarian catastrophe for us,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Advances in World Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- The United States needed Vanessa Atler's  
final 9.762 in floor exercises Sunday to advance to the medal round 
of the World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreea Raducan and Maria Olaru had led defending champion  
Romania to the best qualifying score Saturday, which held up while 
the final nine of the 40 women's teams competed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, entirely new since the 1996 Olympic team won the  
gold medal, was in danger of finishing just out of the top six -- 
missing a spot in the medal round -- before Atler came through with 
her best score of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States safely made the top 12 that qualify for next  
year's Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania topped qualifying with 154.394 points, Russia had  
153.576 and Ukraine 151.970. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing Sunday, 1997 bronze medalist China moved into fourth  
place with 151.720 and the Americans scored 151.001. Australia also 
made the final round with 150.688. 
</P>
<P>
	Rounding out the Olympic qualifiers, Spain had 150.407, France  
149.451, Italy 148.545, Canada 148.533, Britain 146.982 and Belarus 
145.856. Japan just missed qualifying with 145.740. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-year-old Raducan scored 9.812 on the balance beam and  
9.800 in the floor exercises. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaru's best score was a 9.787 on the floor, but her consistency  
put her into the individual lead with 38.792 to 38.755 for Raducan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, the defending individual champion,  
stood third in the competition for 36 places in the individual 
all-around medal round with 38.699. She had the best individual 
mark of 9.837, on the uneven bars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans ran into problems on the uneven bars, but this  
time Atler came through with a clean program after falls from the 
bars cost her national championships this year and last. She scored 
9.475. 
</P>
<P>
	American champion Kristen Maloney fell the wrong way out of a  
handstand and scored just 8.975. Elise Ray added vital points with 
a 9.600. 
</P>
<P>
	But Maloney and Atler both scored 9.612 on the balance beam, and  
Maloney had 9.750 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler stood seventh among individuals with 38.367.  
</P>
<P>
	Men's qualifying was to start later Sunday. China, seeking its  
fourth consecutive world title, was to compete Sunday night, with 
Russia and the United States scheduled Monday.

<HEADLINE> Officer Convicted in Jail Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GALVESTON, Texas (AP) -- A former jailer was convicted Saturday  
on a misdemeanor count of violating a Missouri inmate's rights by 
kicking him after he had complied with orders to lie down during a 
videotaped 1996 jail shakedown. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the jury found Wilton David Wallace and another  
officer, Robert Percival, innocent on felony counts that would have 
meant up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace faces probation or up to a year in jail on the lesser  
count, which did not allege bodily injury. Percival was acquitted 
on both counts and left the courtroom crying. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury said it was unable to reach a verdict on a canine  
officer, David Cisneros, whose dog bit the prisoner, convicted 
murderer Toby Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they are uncertain whether they'll try Cisneros  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Lt. Lester Arnold, who used a stun gun on the inmates at  
the Brazoria County Jail, pleaded guilty to this reduced charge 
last week to avoid trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was tried before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the second civil rights violation for Wallace, who served  
five months in federal prison for a 1983 offense against a 
prisoner. His attorney said he will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	After seeing the video, ostensibly made for training purposes,  
the state of Missouri canceled its private jail contract and moved 
its prisoners out of the state. The tape showed prisoners being 
electrically jolted and kicked.

<HEADLINE> Japan Seeks Different Energy Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HACHIJO ISLAND, Japan (AP) -- Cows doze underneath a row of shiny  
white windmills. Tucked away in a nearby jungle, flowers grow in 
greenhouses heated by a volcano's geothermal energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The look of Japan's energy future?  
</P>
<P>
	Hardly, experts say. Although there are a few pockets of  
experimental projects, like this remote island southeast of Tokyo, 
nuclear energy will likely remain a major part of any solution to 
resource-poor Japan's power problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nuclear power accounts for roughly 35 percent of Japan's energy.  
That is behind France, which has about a 78 percent reliance on 
nuclear power, but well ahead of the United States' 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next 10 years, Japan's government plans to boost the  
nuclear share to more than 40 percent by bringing new reactors 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	To further reduce dependence on imported oil, Japan also has  
been developing reactors fueled by plutonium, a highly radioactive 
element that can be used to make nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	For those hoping to find ways to pull Japan away from its  
decades-old commitment to nuclear energy, Hachijo Island is 
something of a cause celebre. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials initiated an ``Eco Island'' program here several years  
ago, hoping to turn the island's incessant winds and twin volcanoes 
into natural generators of clean, safe energy. 
</P>
<P>
	But even on an island with only 9,000 residents, that aim is  
proving a difficult task, officials say. And as a model for the 
rest of Japan, this island's message is bleak. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our geothermal plant can supply the needs for about  
30 percent of the island at night, when use is at its lowest,'' 
said Ryo Kikuchi, a planner at the island's town hall. ``I doubt if 
we will ever really increase that share very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Power companies say the reason is cost.  
</P>
<P>
	Generating electricity from wind, for example, costs from two to  
three times as much as producing it with nuclear reactors, the 
Agency of Natural Resources and Energy says. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of nuclear power say safety, not cost, should be the  
primary issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to make a political decision to convert from nuclear  
to natural energy,'' said Sanae Shida of Greenpeace Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	There is relatively little pressure on the government to make  
such a decision, however. Japan has never had a very powerful 
environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The share of energy generated by alternative sources is  
virtually zero,'' said Yoshimi Hitosugi of Tokyo Electric Co.

<HEADLINE> FSU's Warrick Sorry for Theft Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Suspended Florida State star receiver  
Peter Warrick apologized Saturday ``for making a poor decision and 
a bad judgment'' that resulted in his arrest for grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with ABC before the top-ranked Seminoles played  
No. 19 Miami, Warrick, dressed in baggy blue jeans and a red golf 
shirt, said he hopes to return to the team but is taking things 
``one step at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to apologize to my family, friends, team, coaches and  
most of all my fans,'' said Warrick, who watched the game on the 
sidelines with his teammates. ``I'm just trying to learn from my 
mistakes and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, considered one of the top contenders for the Heisman  
Trophy, teammate Laveranues Coles, 21, and 19-year-old Dillard's 
department store clerk Rachel Myrtil were charged with grand theft 
Thursday. The clerk was accused of selling the two players $412.38 
worth of clothing for only $21.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who had begun the season on probation for earlier  
violations of team rules, was kicked off the team and Warrick was 
suspended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, who was on the sideline with his teammates during the  
game, also spoke to them in the locker room before they took the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them to keep their heads up,'' Warrick said. ``Don't  
put all the focus on me, put all of it on the game. It's not about 
the Peter Warrick show -- it's a team thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick hopes he'll be reinstated to the team once his legal  
case is handled. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to come back,'' he said. ``It's real tough for me  
to sit out to watch this game. I'm just trying to overcome 
obstacles - the further I get in life, the harder it's going to 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick is set for a first court appearance Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	His attorney, John Kenny, said neither he nor his client would  
be there because he has filed a written notice of appearance. 
Normally, it then would be at least six weeks before a trial date. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, Peter cannot afford to take too long,'' Kenny  
said. ``He has more interest in saying, `Let's get it done.'''

<HEADLINE> Revolution 2, United 1, SO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ted Chronopoulos' goal snapped a 2-2 tie in  
the shootout and gave the New England Revolution a 2-1 victory over 
D.C. United in the regular-season finale for both teams Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the victory, New England (12-20) missed the playoffs. In  
addition to a victory over United, the Revolution needed Miami to 
lose to Colorado on Saturday, but the Fusion won 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, United (23-9) opens the MLS Eastern Conference  
semifinals next Saturday in a best-of-3 series against Miami, which 
squeaked into a playoff spot, finishing in fourth place. United 
beat Miami 3-1 in each of their three matches this season. 
</P>
<P>
	After Chronopoulos scored in the sixth round of the shootout,  
United's Geoff Aunger missed, ending the game. Johnny Torres and 
Mike Burns also scored for New England, while United's Marco 
Etchevarry and Jeff Agoos converted. 
</P>
<P>
	United will be seeking its third MLS championship, having won  
the title in the league's inaugural 1996 season and again in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	It took only until the second minute for United to lead.  
Etcheverry's corner kick curved a few feet in front of the goal and 
off the leg of Chronopoulos for an own goal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Revolution tied the game in the 50th minute when Leonel  
Alvarez passed to John Harkes at the right of the penalty box. 
Harkes made a perfect centering pass to Joe-Max Moore, who blasted 
a shot into the net from about 19 yards out. It was Moore's 15th 
goal this season.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Stock Quotes Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock  
Exchange have postponed for a second time plans to extend the 
operation of their stock quote tickers to accommodate after-hours 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The tickers provide the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq on Friday set a new target date of Oct. 25, subject to  
approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A NYSE 
spokesman said the exchange hasn't set a date and is awaiting SEC 
approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two markets initially planned to extend their ticker hours  
on Oct. 4. The date was then pushed back to this coming Monday 
before the new postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage industry had requested the latest delay, asking  
for more time to update its trading systems to process after-hours 
trades, Nasdaq said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postponement will provide them an opportunity to make  
adjustments to their systems or modify their processes,'' said 
Nasdaq's chief operating officer, J. Patrick Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time, and the NYSE until 6:35 p.m. Both systems currently stop 
distributing quotes at 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the NYSE agreed to extend its 
ticker hours following a request from the Chicago Stock Exchange, 
which trades NYSE listed stocks for regional customers and has 
applied to the SEC to keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> India Aviation Finishes Y2K Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's civil aviation industry has  
upgraded its equipment and trained pilots and engineers to make 
sure computers don't go haywire on New Year's Day, an official said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are Y2K compliant. We have taken all precautions. We're not  
taking chances on anything,'' said P.V. Jayakrishnan, the top 
bureaucrat at the Civil Aviation Ministry, which controls all 
aviation activity in India. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,200 aircraft operate in Indian airspace every day, half  
of them landing or taking off from its airports, with a total of 
70,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K fears stem from computers that use only two digits to  
represent the year, meaning they could read 2000 as 1900 and 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, the government ordered its civilian and  
military airports to implement the changes required under 
international air safety rules, Jayakrishnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the changes, the economics of international air travel  
can go awry if India is not Y2K compliant, especially since India 
is strategically located for civil aviation purposes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said all the systems have been tested and found  
satisfactory in tests conducted both by Indian and foreign 
agencies.

<HEADLINE> No. 14 Miss. State 18, Auburn 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- While the rest of the league grabs all the  
attention, Mississippi State just keeps winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 14th-ranked Bulldogs jump-started their offense with two  
late touchdowns in an 18-16 win over Auburn, moving Mississippi 
State (6-0, 3-0 SEC) to 6-0 for the first time in 55 years. Auburn 
(3-3, 1-3) has now lost three straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few teams in the country have the opportunity to go  
6-0,'' Bulldogs coach Jackie Sherrill said. ``I think when it comes 
down to it, you have to put yourself in a position to do that, and 
we did today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Bulldogs represented the West in last year's SEC  
title game, few expected them to repeat. Arkansas and Alabama were 
picked to fight it out for the right to play either Florida or 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	That left Mississippi State alone to quietly go about its  
business. It has, using the second-best defense in the country to 
win its first five games. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Bulldogs get little respect. Even from Auburn coach  
Tommy Tuberville, who said earlier this week that Mississippi State 
hadn't played its best competition yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people said we were 6-0 because we haven't played  
anybody, even coach Tuberville said this game was the start of our 
season,'' Sherrill said. ``He was right. But we've played somebody 
now, so I guess our season started today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took almost four full quarters for Mississippi State to get  
it going, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Matt Wyatt threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Matt Butler with  
19 seconds to play to complete the comeback win. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyatt, a senior who has started 15 games in his career, came  
into the game at the start of the second half when Wayne Madkin 
couldn't return because of a torn tendon in his index finger. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs trailed Auburn 10-0 at that point and Wyatt could  
do nothing to generate any offense. He was intercepted on his first 
series, which led to a field goal by Damon Duval that made it 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was frustrating at first because we couldn't get any first  
downs,'' said Wyatt. ``Everyone said to keep our heads up and play 
hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two teams then went back and forth, exchanging punt for punt  
in the defensive struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	After Duval's third field goal of the day, a 46-yarder that put  
the Tigers up 16-0 with 8:15 to play in the third, Wyatt finally 
got Mississippi State moving. 
</P>
<P>
	He led the Bulldogs on an eight play, 47-yard drive that got  
them on the board with Scott Westerfield's 33-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn then tried to eat up the clock by running the ball, to no  
avail. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers, who have the worst running game in the SEC, were  
held to just 39 yards rushing on 42 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	With Auburn unable to move the ball at all -- it had just nine  
first downs and 164 yards total offense -- it was only a matter of 
time before Mississippi State would get something going. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyatt did it with a late scoring drive, hooking up with C.J.  
Sirmones with a 16-yard touchdown pass that cut the score to 16-10 
with 2:28 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulldogs then kicked off, Auburn couldn't get a first down  
and was forced to punt from deep in its own territory. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers first took a delay of game penalty with 50 seconds to  
play, then Duval ran out of the end zone for a safety that made it 
16-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had made a decision earlier that we weren't going to kick  
or punt,'' Tuberville said. ``We are not going to second-guess 
ourselves now. I wouldn't change anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pig Prather returned Duval's ensuing kickoff 41 yards, and Wyatt  
needed only four plays to do the rest. He threw his 11-yard TD pass 
to Butler with 19 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Auburn got the ball back, but quarterback Jeff Klein was  
intercepted by Fred Smoot to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids played their hearts out and had this game won until  
the last second,'' said Tuberville. ``We have to play the hand we 
are dealt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wyatt finished 17-of-29 for 209 yards, two touchdowns and an  
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Mississippi State finished with 362 yards of total offense, most  
of it gained on its final two possessions. The Bulldogs had just 42 
yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the players and the coaches that sometimes you're just  
going to win games like this,'' Sherrill said. ``I'm glad we did, 
and thankful this one is over.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Transportation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $50 billion  
transportation bill into law Saturday, a wide-ranging measure 
funding transit and infrastructure projects, Amtrak and the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, includes $26.7  
billion for highways, a 10 percent increase from last year, and 
$5.8 billion for mass transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these funding levels will allow us to make the  
substantial improvements in infrastructure and mass transit that 
are necessary,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provides $571 million for Amtrak, including funds for a  
five-year plan to get the national passenger railroad operating 
self-sufficiently and eliminate the need for year-to-year 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	It contains all the money Clinton requested for Coast Guard  
operating expenses, $2.8 billion, including search and rescue 
operations and increased spending for law enforcement and drug 
interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	And it extends for one year a restraint on the government's use  
of new automobile fuel efficiency standards.

<HEADLINE> Pratt Steps Up Big for Mets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The names are now linked in baseball history:  
Bill Mazeroski, Chris Chambliss, Joe Carter ... and Todd Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
	They, and they alone, are the only men who know what it's like  
to end a postseason series with a home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was only divisional playoffs,'' Pratt said Saturday after  
his 10th-inning homer off Matt Mantei gave the New York Mets a 4-3 
win over Arizona and a 3-1 victory in their first-round series. ``I 
think if it would have been a World Series or an NLCS, it might 
have been something more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, he was out of baseball, released, a thing of  
the past, and not a noted one, at that. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt, now 32, was cut loose by Seattle in March 1996 and went  
to work at Bucky Dent's baseball school in Florida -- working at 
Domino's pizza to earn money on the side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hated baseball at that point because I was too good a player  
and was just getting a bad rap,'' he said. ``Maybe they just didn't 
think I was good enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a spare part on these Mets, around to catch pitchers on  
the side and give Mike Piazza a rest now and then. He got only 140 
at-bats -- and that was the highest total of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	But now the Diamondbacks know about the Domino effect.  
</P>
<P>
	``Piazza doesn't play and who hits the homer? It's like a  
script,'' Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said. ``That's 
baseball in all its glory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Todd Hundley had reconstructive elbow surgery in September  
1997, Pratt thought he'd get a chance to win the starting job the 
following spring, while Hundley recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	But he played badly in Florida and the Mets sent him to the  
minors at the start of the season. He wound up having three stints 
with New York, going up and down like an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was a very testing year for me,'' Pratt said.  
``Every time I got sent down last year I didn't deserve it. I mean, 
everybody makes a big deal out of Mike Piazza here, which is 
correct. But I am the Mike Piazza in Triple-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt hit .356 at Triple-A Norfolk with seven homers and 30 RBIs  
in 118 at-bats, but just .275 in 69 at-bats with the Mets. This 
year, he hit .293 with three homers and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he's been part of seven major league organizations and  
has played for 14 different pro teams. He was on Philadelphia's 
postseason roster in 1993, but did not play in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a career .300 hitter in Triple-A. Everybody knew I  
didn't belong there,'' Pratt said. ``They kept on bringing catcher 
after catcher in here, and they kept getting sent out because I was 
the player -- and today was the exclamation point on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first time he was sent down last year, he almost quit again,  
but the Mets' Triple-A manager talked him out of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was considering not showing up to the Norfolk squad,'' Pratt  
said. ``If it wasn't for Rick Dempsey at that point coming to my 
hotel room three days later, I probably would have never showed 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was brought up May 5, wound up on the DL, then was sent back  
to Norfolk on July 31, even though he was hitting .313 (15-for-48). 
</P>
<P>
	``They said it was a numbers game,'' he recalled Saturday. ``At  
that point was the first time I cried after being talked to by a 
manager. At that point, I stayed here three days once again 
contemplating asking for my release and saying, `Forget it, there 
has to be another team that wants me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Butch Huskey got hurt and Pratt was brought back up.  
</P>
<P>
	``All I know is he put forth the effort, kept himself ready,''  
Dent, now a coach with the Texas Rangers, said Saturday. ``That's a 
plus for him. He didn't give up, didn't quit and now look -- he 
found himself in a playoff situation and hit a home run. That's 
great, man. It just shows that you can never give up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the glow of Saturday's win, the Mets were thankful for that.  
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God for Todd Pratt and the job he did today,'' Mets  
general manager Steve Phillips said. ``I think the best thing about 
Todd is mentally he stays in the game, even when he's not 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt did his best to try to deflect attention. But when you're  
a home-run hero in New York, that's impossible. Just ask Dent, 
still remembered for his three-run drive over The Green Monster 
that propelled the Yankees over Boston in the 1978 AL East 
tiebreaker game. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what he does, Pratt has Saturday and the souvenir in  
hand -- the ball he hit to straightaway center, the one over Steve 
Finley's glove, the homer that put the Mets in the NL championship 
series for the first time in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe in his mind, he doesn't think'' so, John Franco said,  
``but I think there are 24 or 25 guys in that locker room that 
think he is a hero today.''

<HEADLINE> NetAid Concerts Aim To Help Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The United Nations is hoping to tap into a new  
generation of philanthropists and bring attention to world poverty 
on Saturday with overlapping rock concerts in three cities -- all 
broadcast live on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	One billion hits are expected on the U.N. Development Program's  
Web site, where Internet surfers can log on and rock on with, among 
others, David Bowie and the Eurythmics in London, Bryan Ferry in 
Geneva, and Bono, Sting and Puff Daddy at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Local television and radio stations also will carry the concerts  
live. 
</P>
<P>
	Official development aid has dwindled in recent years, and the  
U.N. agency is hoping to convince a new generation to open their 
minds and wallets to alleviate world poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it won't let governments off the hook,'' spokesman Mark  
Malloch Brown said Friday in London. ``I think this will build 
pressure on them when they see this message going out to a wider 
group of people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers will be asked to donate money by entering their credit  
card information on the Web site or pledging a future donation. 
</P>
<P>
	With a click of a mouse, money can be directed to one of five  
designated areas: ending hunger, helping refugees, saving the 
environment, securing human rights or relieving debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of dollars have poured into the site, the  
United Nations said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in the history of mankind, we have the  
capacity to tackle poverty,'' said U.N. spokesman Jean Fabre, 
speaking to reporters in Geneva. ``NetAid is mobilizing artists and 
the Internet so that people have the possibility to be informed and 
also to be linked up together.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Nudges Europe Into Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- The artisans at Messulam SpA use skills  
honed by ancient Etruscans to hammer silver plate into gleaming 
bowls and samovars. 
</P>
<P>
	To help sell the tableware, the family-owned firm relies on a  
more recent innovation: direct marketing via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	By coupling a new technology with 2,500 years of craftsmanship,  
managing director Roberto Beretta hopes Milan-based Messulam can 
offset Italy's rigid labor laws, which are among the company's 
toughest constraints. 
</P>
<P>
	When the loss of a major supplier last year compelled him to lay  
off a dozen workers, it took Beretta six months and the arbitration 
of a judge to do what an American boss could have achieved in 
minutes. There was no alternative. ``Otherwise, we would have had 
to shut down,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies across Europe have struggled against similar obstacles  
in the 1990s. Inflexible rules about the hiring and firing of 
workers, politicians reluctant to let foreigners compete with 
state-owned companies, high interest rates that choked off consumer 
demand -- all have sapped the region of its economic potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's uneven, tepid growth contrasts sharply with the vigor  
of the U.S. economy during the same period. Americans have enjoyed 
prosperity for more than eight years, the longest peacetime 
expansion in their history, while Europe and much of the 
industrialized world have had to make do with crumbs. 
</P>
<P>
	In Italy, economic output during the 24 months ending in March  
increased by a quarterly average of just 0.4 percent, the most 
anemic growth rate in Western Europe. Some of Italy's neighbors 
fared little better. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany languished due to the high costs of unification and a  
global downturn in demand for its exports. France is saddled with a 
stubbornly high unemployment rate of 11.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, at last, the flames of a broad recovery are starting to  
flicker. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's sort of a stereotype of a sclerotic Europe that is not  
borne out by the facts,'' says Bill Callaghan, chief economist for 
the Trades Union Congress, Britain's largest labor group. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recent positive signs:  
</P>
<P>
	--France's gross domestic product increased by a healthy 0.6  
percent during the year's second quarter. The finance ministry has 
predicted the economy will grow by as much as 2.5 percent this year 
and 3 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	--In Germany, which makes more than 25 percent of Europe's  
manufactured goods, orders jumped by 1.3 percent from June to July, 
three times more than most analysts had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	--A galloping demand for houses has pushed British property  
prices skyward, and the Bank of England raised a key lending rate 
in September for fear that the economy might overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ireland, long a laggard, now boasts Europe's fastest-growing  
economy, and Irish emigres are coming home to join the boom in 
construction and services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the fundamentals are pretty favorable for Europe,''  
says Paul Mortimer-Lee, a London-based economist with the French 
bank Paribas. ``I think we're going to see quite a bit stronger 
growth in 2000 than we have seen this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turnaround extends also to industrialized countries outside  
Europe. Japan's economy finally started to grow again this year 
after shrinking for 15 consecutive months. South Korea, Thailand 
and other formerly high-flying tigers of Asia are clawing their way 
back from financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Although growth rates vary widely within Europe, the overall  
improvement in the region has coincided with the introduction in 
January of a single regional currency, the euro, and its subsequent 
slide to near-parity with the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro is still primarily a bookkeeping entry for businesses  
and governments in the 11 countries of ``Euroland.'' Euro coins and 
notes won't enter circulation until Jan. 1, 2002. But the 
currency's low value relative to the dollar has given a competitive 
edge to products already priced in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weakness of the euro since the start of the year is one of  
the reasons the European economy is now picking up, because that 
has given a boost to export orders,'' says Jose Luis Alzola, an 
economist at the London office of Salomon Smith Barney Citibank. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Central Bank, headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany,  
is doing its part by charging commercial banks a low 2.5 percent 
for short-term loans. Cheaper loans usually mean increased 
investment and consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy needs a lot more of both. Under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty  
that set financial rules for joining the euro, Italy had to slash 
government spending more than most countries in order to qualify 
for the new currency. Recession soon set in. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Salvatore Ferragamo store on Milan's chic shopping  
street, Via Monte Napoleone, sales of shoes and handbags have been 
flat for the past three years. ``Before, the price wasn't 
important, but now people care how they spend,'' store manager 
Marina Brasca says. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, European consumers eager for better prices and wider  
selections have created an opening for aggressive U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is among the growing number of American  
businesses investing in Europe. Wal-Mart alarmed supermarkets in 
Britain, where the country's biggest supermarkets are under 
investigation for possible price-fixing, when it bought the grocery 
chain Asda Group PLC in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Other U.S. firms hope to profit from a wave of mergers and  
acquisitions sweeping the region. This consolidation trend is one 
aspect of the economic restructuring now underway in Europe, 
several years after a similar upheaval in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Europe's largest cities and high-tech centers have generally  
profited from these changes, which have favored services at the 
expense of heavy manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	But the region's industrial core is going the way of Pittsburgh  
and Detroit. Economic growth has declined sharply in manufacturing 
centers such as Germany's Ruhr River valley, parts of southern 
Belgium, and large sections of northern Spain, France and England. 
</P>
<P>
	One result is a chronically high jobless rate. Unemployment in  
Euroland stands at 10.2 percent, compared with 4.2 percent in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists and business executives blame Europe's labor  
laws, saying they have impeded growth by restraining businesses 
from quickly adjusting their workforce in response to market 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	At InnoConcepts N.V. near Rotterdam, which helps inventors turn  
ideas into marketable products, general manager Oscar Middendorp 
makes the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Holland,'' he says, ``we are more cautious before hiring  
someone -- in terms of references, questions we ask, qualifications 
-- because we know it will cost us a certain amount of time if we 
decide we do need to fire them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden cut its unemployment rate to 6.8 percent in July from 8.5  
percent a year ago, while clocking some of the fastest growth in 
Europe. Even so, Lena Munther has little to show for the four years 
she and a friend have run an organic cafe and food store in 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hardly have any financial leeway at all. We clear just  
enough to pay our bills,'' Munther says. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in Europe, external forces have contributed to much of  
the torpor. Major exporters like Germany and Italy suffered from 
the global financial crisis that erupted in East Asia in July 1997. 
The crisis read to Russia and Latin America, depressing orders for 
German and Italian exports and causing both economies to shrink in 
early 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts suggest that Europe has inflicted much of its own  
economic pain. 
</P>
<P>
	When German unification brought a torrent of investment into  
former East Germany, the German government hiked interest rates to 
keep down inflation. Germany's neighbors raised their rates to keep 
their currencies stable against the soaring mark. They avoided 
inflation, but only at the cost of stifling demand and growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, by contrast, has followed a more expansionist  
monetary policy in the 1990s. U.S. companies also are blessed with 
an enormous domestic market and a pool of workers who think little 
of uprooting themselves to seek jobs in far-flung corners of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Euroland, you don't have anything like the internal  
migration that you have in the United States, and there are much 
more serious barriers of language and culture,'' says William 
Kennedy, an economic historian at the London School of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
	These barriers, while largely psychological, belie the notion of  
the unified and efficient market symbolized by the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the biggest hurdles within Europe are nationalistic  
policies discouraging cross-border competition. 
</P>
<P>
	When Telecom Italia sought to dodge a hostile takeover bid by  
Italian competitor Olivetti this summer, it tried to forge a 
friendly merger with Germany's telecommunications powerhouse, 
Deutsche Telekom. The Italian government, however, made no secret 
of its opposition to the transalpine combination. The effort 
collapsed, and Olivetti prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic nationalism also has deep roots in France. Banque  
Nationale de Paris, the country's largest bank, launched a hostile 
takeover bid in March for French rivals Societe Generale and 
Paribas. But BNP ended up with only Paribas, a blow for senior 
French politicians who had hoped for the creation of a Gallic 
megabank that would fend off foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there will be opportunities for us in France,  
due to the resistance of the French government and French 
companies,'' says Roberto Fanori, a spokesman for Snamprogetti, the 
Milan-based engineering arm of Italy's ENI energy group. 
</P>
<P>
	State ownership of leading firms also has hindered growth in  
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the British government sold off large stakes in the  
steel, car and aerospace industries, many governments in 
continental Europe have been slower to privatize their holdings. 
Most of the region's former state-run monopolies are only now 
starting to face up to competitive realities. 
</P>
<P>
	ENEL, the state-controlled Italian electric utility, lost its  
37-year monopoly on power sales under a law passed in February. It 
plans to issue its first shares to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	As a preparatory step, ENEL has trimmed its payroll from 107,000  
workers to 80,000, through retirements and attrition. Yet the 
shrinkage did no harm to service, says economist Carlo Scarpa of 
the Milan-based Mattei Foundation, a research center funded by the 
ENI group. 
</P>
<P>
	As it learns to trust market forces, the Italian government is  
shedding an economic role that dates back a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, there was a lot of state intervention but no  
vision,'' Scarpa says. ``No one was willing to say, 'OK, we accept 
greater unemployment today if it means greater growth tomorrow.'''

<HEADLINE> Klan's 'Free' Speech Costs Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- When the Ku Klux Klan came to Defiance,  
the city prepared for an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 police officers from several departments near the  
small northwest Ohio city came to keep the peace between at least 
300 protesters and 41 Klansmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong rally March 20 by the American Knights of the Ku  
Klux Klan was uneventful, but peace came at a cost of $17,500 in 
overtime and other expenses, such as fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Defiance, a city of 16,000, is not alone in spending lots of  
money to ensure that a relatively small number of Klansmen can 
safely hold a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly two dozen Klan rallies so far this year, the bill  
for taxpayers has reached about $800,000. In 1994, the state 
received reports of 32 events involving the Klan and four involving 
other white supremacist groups. There have been at least 20 Klan 
events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Almay, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal  
Identification and Investigation, said rallies died down after 1994 
because a pivotal Klan organizer went to prison for beating an 
ex-girlfriend. The resurgence this year, he said, is partly due to 
James Roesch, an outspoken 18-year-old who calls himself Imperial 
Wizard of the American Knights of the White Kamellia. 
</P>
<P>
	Roesch said Klansmen don't ask for police protection, and  
anti-Klan protesters are the ones trying to provoke fights and 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we ask is to give our speeches,'' said Roesch, who lives  
in Rushylvania. ``There's many ways a city could save money. The 
way they spend money is ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even if protesters stayed away, officials say, they would  
have to prepare for confrontations anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have adequate protection, things get out of hand  
and you catch a lot of criticism for that. If you're adequately 
prepared, you catch a lot of criticism from people who say it's 
overkill,'' said Defiance County Sheriff Dave Westrick. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of refinement, the state now provides an ``off the  
shelf'' plan to communities for dealing with rallies. The plan 
includes advice on crowd control, security and how best to separate 
protesters, Klansmen and the media, said Ted Almay, superintendent 
of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the state is also promising to help cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Betty Montgomery said her office, for the first  
time, will make free metal detectors and fences available for use 
during rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her office spent $8,000 on two walk-through detectors, six  
handheld detectors and several miles of chain-link fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Almay said the goal is to ``ease the burden of the small towns.  
A city like Columbus, we'll help with intelligence and we'll help 
that day get things together, but when you go to Urbana or places 
like that, this is devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest cost to date has been in Cleveland, which said its  
Aug. 21 rally cost more than $537,000, mainly in overtime for 
police officers, street and water department employees, and other 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a May 1 rally by the American Knights of the Ku  
Klux Klan in Zanesville -- population 28,000 -- cost the city $7,500 
and the Muskingum County Sheriff's Department an additional 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unfortunate waste of taxpayers' money to have to do  
that, but in order to keep the city safe and officers safe, it's 
something you have to do,'' said Zanesville Police Chief Diane 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,  
Ala., said the number of Klansmen who show up rarely matters since 
they are always going to draw large protest crowds, whether or not 
communities ask people to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to recover the cost of rallies from the Klan itself  
have met with limited success. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1992, in a case involving a white supremacist group in  
Forsyth County, Ga., the Supreme Court said communities that impose 
permit fees for parades and rallies can't charge more for 
controversial groups just because they might need more police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 1996 Klan rally in Ann Arbor, Mich., the city billed  
both the Klan and an anti-Klan organization $72,000 for the cost of 
security. The city never started collection action but hasn't ruled 
out the possibility, city attorney Abigail Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery said there are real legal problems ``in terms of  
billing a particular group which is exercising its First Amendment 
rights, and selecting out one group because we don't like it and 
saying, 'We'll protect you, but we're going to charge you,' but 
other groups we don't charge.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Wanted To Reward Waco Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI supervisors sought to reward agents  
running its deadly 1993 Waco siege, proposing medals and 
``substantial cash incentive awards'' for members of the bureau's 
elite Hostage Rescue Team, newly released internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are silent on the outcome of the request to reward  
agents who fired tear gas into the Branch Davidians' home, manned 
sniper positions and drove tanks; and an FBI spokesman said Friday 
he was unaware whether awards were granted. 
</P>
<P>
	But former FBI deputy assistant director Danny Coulson, the  
founding commander of the HRT and one of the top officials 
overseeing the Waco operation, said neither medals nor bonuses were 
handed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't approved and they received nothing,'' Coulson said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI documents were recently turned over to investigators  
probing the bureau's conduct during the 51-day Waco standoff. They 
show that an extensive effort was made to honor the agents' ``brave 
and selfless actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One 13-page memo recommended the entire Hostage Rescue Team for  
the FBI Shield of Bravery, with individual commendations for agents 
who left their tank during the siege's fiery end to save a Davidian 
woman caught in the burning building. 
</P>
<P>
	Another memo proposed financial rewards for the HRT agents to  
recognize ``their exceptional and exemplary individual efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Coulson: ``We tend to want to demonize every FBI agent who  
was there ... (but) the American public needs to remember that 
agents did risk their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's conduct at Waco has come under renewed scrutiny  
from Congress and a special counsel appointed by Attorney General 
Janet Reno in recent weeks with the FBI's belated admission that 
its agents fired potentially incendiary tear-gas canisters in the 
hours before flames consumed the Davidians' retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died April 19,  
1993 in the final hours of the FBI siege. 
</P>
<P>
	The thousands of pages of internal documents already turned over  
to investigators offer the most detailed glimpse yet of the FBI's 
inner workings at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are a mix of the serious and the mundane, covering  
the FBI's evolving final-day tactical plan and daily intelligence 
reports to a local hotel's invitation to federal agents for a free 
Easter Sunday brunch. 
</P>
<P>
	The records outline the evolution of the FBI's rules of  
engagement for the final assault, dictating under what conditions 
agents could use deadly force. Several proposals were drafted, 
three of which would have permitted agents to use deadly force 
against unarmed Branch Davidians if they approached ``friendly'' 
positions and failed to respond to agents' commands. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has long denied that its agents fired any shots during  
the siege, and bureau officials stressed Friday that the final 
rules of engagement did not permit deadly force against unarmed 
Davidians. The bureau's long-standing policy, which permits agents 
to use deadly force in self-defense or defense of another, applied 
on April 19, said FBI spokesman Tron Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not be unusual, during the deliberation process, to  
consider various options,'' Brekke said of the earlier drafts. 
On-scene commanders had been worried by reports that Davidians 
might come out with explosives strapped to their bodies, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the documents:  
</P>
<P>
	--On seven occasions, agents threw flash-bang devices at  
Davidians who were outdoors to force them back inside the building. 
Koresh lieutenant Steve Schneider was ``absolutely distraught over 
being flash-banged,'' one FBI negotiator wrote April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI tallied the number of phone conversations negotiators  
had with each Davidian, the average length of each call and total 
time spent on the phone. The most prolific talker was Schneider, 
who had 459 conversations with FBI agents lasting nearly 96 hours. 
Second was Koresh, with 117 conversations spanning nearly 61 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI considered, at least briefly, abandoning the site.  
Under the ``retrogress from Waco'' plan, the proposed manpower 
requirements to provide cover as the forces retreated included four 
helicopters, four fixed-wing aircraft and 106 SWAT agents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Westinghouse Corp. offered, at no cost, the use of an aircraft  
and crew with ``state-of-the-art'' radar and infrared technology 
that not even the military possessed, one handwritten note stated. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI kept tabs on ``right-wing'' sympathizers who flocked to  
Waco during the siege and monitored Internet traffic.

<HEADLINE>  Greenwood Lake Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Greenwood Lake likes to do it his way -- and that  
way is unnerving for a trainer and owner. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was the winning way Saturday as the colt came from way  
out of it to win the 1 1-16-mile Champagne for 2-year-olds at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he takes himself back, but that's the way he  
likes to run,'' trainer Nick Zito said after his second straight 
victory in the Champagne. He won with The Groom Is Red last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just know he's not going to make it; he's too far back,''  
co-owner Joseph Cornacchia said of Greenwood Lake, who was last in 
the seven-horse field for the first three-quarters of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jean-Luc Samyn, Greenwood Lake was 9 lengths behind  
with a little more than a quarter-mile remaining, but he was 2 1/2 
lengths ahead at the wire after charging past Chief Seattle with 
about 30 yards remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In the race following the Champagne, Val's Prince took the lead  
just inside the eighth pole and won the 1 1/2-mile Turf Classic by a 
length over Dream Well for his second straight victory in a Grade I 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greenwood Lake raced into the 2-year-old championship  
picture, favored More Than Ready finished a dismal fifth for his 
second straight loss after five straight victories that had made 
him the division leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwood Lake, winning for the second time in four starts,  
carried home scale weight of 122 pounds in 1:43 3-5 and paid 
$15.60, $5.10 and $3.20. He earned $240,000 from a $400,000 purse 
for owners Cornacchia, Dolores Conway and Fred Dematteis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Seattle paid $3.90 and $3, and High Yield returned $2.60  
for show. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince, who won the Man o'War in his previous start,  
marked himself as the serious contender for the $2 million 
Breeders' Cup Turf on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. Yagli, the 8-5 
favorite, was trapped on the hedge in the stretch and wasn't a 
factor in his second straight defeat after having won three 
straight stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince, a 7-year-old gelding owned by Weiner Martin,  
carried home 126 in 2:28 3-5 and earned $360,000 from a purse of 
$600,000. He paid $8.10, $3.80 and $3. He is trained by James Bond, 
trainer of Behrens, the favorite for the $1 million Jockey Club 
Gold Cup Sunday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Val's Prince was the best turf horse in the  
country, Bond said, ``He sure looks that way to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France-based Dream Well, making his U.S. debut, returned $4.10  
and $3.60 after finishing neck in front of Fahris in the 
seven-horse field. Fahris paid $5.80.

<HEADLINE> Tough Going for Mattel's Barad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- For nearly two years Mattel Inc. chief  
Jill E. Barad dazzled Wall Street with a flashy style and marketing 
savvy that helped turn the toymaker into a worldwide powerhouse 
with brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	To many, she seemed the perfect leader for the world's largest  
toy company. Her enthusiasm and energy appeared boundless. Clad in 
smart, designer clothes, she promoted Mattel with gusto, sometimes 
even dancing to the music that blared out in meetings where new 
toys were unveiled to industry analysts and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression of her is that she is the consummate product  
person, that she loves the product,'' toy consultant Chris Byrne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors haven't shared that enthusiasm during the past  
year. For the second time in 10 months, Wall Street has been 
shocked by surprise announcements that Mattel can't live up to 
revenue estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The news earlier this week pushed the company's stock to its  
lowest point since 1993, with shares trading Friday at $11.81 1/4, 
down 50 cents. It's off nearly 75 percent from a 10-year high of 
$46.75 reached last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest miscalculation -- which has already generated two  
class-action suits by investors -- has left some analysts wondering 
if Barad is up to the job of turning Mattel around, or if she will 
even be given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is faced with a tough situation. Do they make a  
management change or shuffle before their most important season of 
the year?'' said Eric Gustafson, a senior portfolio manager at 
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure on Barad intensified this week after Mattel revealed  
that The Learning Company, a software maker acquired by Mattel in 
May for $3.8 billion, will lose up to $100 million in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The board appears to be willing to give Barad time. Barad met  
with directors on Wednesday in New York, telling members she had 
been advised of The Learning Company's troubles late last week and 
was trying to learn the cause of the problem, according to a source 
familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mattel spokesman declined to comment Friday, except to say  
Barad continued to have the full support of Mattel's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barad, 48, took the helm of Mattel in January 1997, capping a  
16-year climb that began in the company's novelty toy unit. Under 
her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million 
product line into one of the world's most recognized brands with 
$1.9 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And she seems to recognize the changing desires of kids today,  
who are more interested in high-tech toys by the age of 6 rather 
than playing with dolls and board games. Mattel's has stepped up 
its software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to 
capture shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mattel's chairman and chief executive, Barad underwent a  
transformation of sorts. The one-time actress and beauty consultant 
-- one of only three women currently running a Fortune 500 company -- 
became a role model for millions of working women trying to break 
into the ranks of corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's romance with Barad and Mattel turned rocky last  
December after Mattel announced a $500 million shortfall for 1998 -- 
a disclosure came only weeks after a series of meetings in which 
Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its revenue 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel made a mistake when it based its original projections on  
the number of orders the company received in previous years, 
analysts said. Mattel ignored an announcement by Toys R Us, a key 
customer, that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, 
and the prospect that other retailers would do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong with The Learning Company is less clear. The two  
problems are similar, though, in that Mattel appears to have been 
oblivious to the problem until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to believe everything, it would appear they were  
totally out of the loop on what was going on with this latest 
acquisition,'' said Margaret Whitfield, an analyst at Tucker 
Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel is blaming the shortfall on a variety of problems,  
including the loss of a key distribution deal, an unexpectedly high 
return of unsold product from retailers and the write-off of bad 
debts. The explanation is disturbing to analysts because it 
suggests that The Learning Company was depending on a one-time cash 
payment from the distribution deal to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger question is why Mattel was in the dark. Officials at  
the software maker, like those heading other Mattel product lines, 
report directly to Barad. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the problems with The Learning Company were pointed out  
in a July report on Mattel issued by the Center for Financial 
Research and Analysis. Analyst Sirine Hafez reported The Learning 
Company's sales in the first half of 1999 fell well below 1998 
levels. There was also a big jump in accounts receivables, or money 
owed the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good acquisition. That's where the problem lies,''  
said Jim Silver, editor of The Toy Book, an industry publication. 
``The rest of Mattel is fine. (The Learning Company) is one big 
problem, though.''

<HEADLINE> Piazza To Miss Saturday's Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All-Star catcher Mike Piazza was out of the New  
York Mets' lineup for a second straight day with an injured left 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who missed Game 3 of the New York Mets series against  
the Arizona Diamondbacks, was possibly available for pinch-hitting 
duties today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a little better,'' manager Bobby Valentine said before  
the game. ``He might be able to pinch-hit if all the treatment 
kicks in. It is still swollen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was icing his thumb before the game. He initially injured  
it Sept. 17 when he was hit by a foul ball against Philadelphia and 
re-aggravated it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays of the thumb were negative but Piazza had a bad reaction  
to a cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pratt, who went 1-for-3 with two walks in Game 3, started  
once again in Piazza's place.

<HEADLINE> 16 Die As Bus Overturns in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- A bus carrying members of a singles club  
overturned on a slippery northern Israel road Saturday and plunged 
into a deep ravine, killing 16 people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-six people were injured, 10 of them seriously, in what  
police called Israel's deadliest road accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was taking 56 members of a singles club from central  
Israel on an outing when the first heavy rain in months began 
falling, leaving the road slick. The bus was traveling between the 
towns of Tiberias and Nazareth when the driver lost control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour guide Zvika Mena told Israel TV that he was talking to the  
group when the bus veered off the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly the bus began to zig-zag,'' Mena said. ``I shouted to  
everybody to hold firm. There were loud shouts and panic. I was 
thrown out of the front window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The red-and-white bus plunged at least 60 feet into the ravine  
and overturned, landing on its roof. Several bodies were pinned 
under the vehicle and some surviving passengers were trapped in 
their seats. Belongings were strewn across the rocky slope. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampered by heavy rain, rescue workers used metal cutters to  
free trapped passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bus was traveling just below the 50 mph speed limit, but  
that was too fast considering the road conditions, traffic police 
chief Yaakov Ganot said. Survivors said they had asked the driver 
several times to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old driver had worked for the bus company for six  
months and had been given several traffic tickets for minor 
offenses, Israel TV reported.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Meeting on Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The numbers are clear -- if not a bit astounding.  
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics now make up about 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
half of them younger than age 20. That means that by 2050, one of 
every four Americans will be of Hispanic descent, according to U.S. 
Census estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	With such figures in mind, Hispanic leaders are eager to groom  
young talent to add political clout to their numbers. Some of the 
most prominent leaders are meeting here this weekend, at the U.S. 
Hispanic Leadership Conference, to find it. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 8,000 people -- most of them between the ages of 18  
and 34 -- have signed up for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to high school students Friday, former Housing  
Secretary Henry Cisneros said that because the Hispanic population 
is expected to grow so much in their lifetimes, a great deal of 
responsibility is on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want us to be a poor, hostile, angry, uneducated  
population in America. ... You can be the ones to break the 
pattern,'' he said. ``Can you do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the students broke into uproarious applause.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros is now head of Univision, a major Spanish-language  
television network. He was one of many Hispanic leaders who 
encouraged conference attendees to go to college, register to vote 
and organize politically -- all goals backed up at the conference by 
workshops and a college and job fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep people accountable,'' said Cisneros. ``We  
also, from time to time, have to defend ourselves when people come 
after us just because we are Latino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Cisneros, officials attending the conference  
included everyone from Aida Alvarez, head of the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, to Raymond Anrecio, a manager at General 
Motors' Public Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being here, I feel everyone is a role model. All of them give  
me good goals,'' said Davina Gonzalez, an 18-year-old high school 
senior from Santa Ana, Calif., one of many to swarm Cisneros to get 
photos or autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez -- who wants to be a child psychologist and made her  
first plane trip to take part in the conference -- said being chosen 
to participate was inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me very proud. It makes me feel like I will be able  
to be happy -- to live in a nice house with a yard, to have a family 
and to be able to buy them things they need,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Board Votes Against Creationism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Teachers in New Mexico no longer have to  
teach creationism along with the theory of evolution in their 
classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 14-1 vote Friday, the board decided against requiring  
instruction on creationism or other alternative theories about how 
life forms came to be. 
</P>
<P>
	``The action we took clarifies, so there is no equivocation,  
that the leading theory of how the Earth was created has to do with 
evolution,'' board president Flora Sanchez said. ``Other ideas may 
be part of classroom discussion and inquiry, but (the state) does 
not require their teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Creationism is the belief that people and the Earth were formed  
by a divine being. The theory of evolution, among other things, 
holds that man is the descendant of apes and other species. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the vote, the state education standards included  
language that spoke of several theories of evolution and required 
teachers to ``present the evidence for and against'' evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in the issue was rekindled this summer when the Kansas  
Board of Education passed new standards playing down the scientific 
importance of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	And earlier this month, the Kentucky Education Department  
deleted the word ``evolution'' from its standards, replacing it 
with less divisive ``change over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Sanchez acknowledged before the vote that ``there is a  
contingent of the public that doesn't like what we're doing. Most 
of that centers on the idea that this has something to do with 
religion. This does not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the proposal had argued that evolution is a theory  
that shouldn't be taught as scientific fact. 
</P>
<P>
	Board members and science teachers have agreed the change  
wouldn't drastically alter what was being taught in New Mexico 
classrooms. But many teachers have said they welcome the clearer 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's a whole army out there trying to put  
creationism into schools,'' said Bruce Miller, a science teacher at 
La Cueva High School in Albuquerque. But with these changes, ``we 
might not have to fight that battle again.''

<HEADLINE> European stocks close mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed mixed Friday, with oil  
stocks slipping the most as prices fell and telecommunications 
shares rising on talk of consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco fell 18.5 pence to close at 540 pence, and Shell lost  
15.5 pence to end at 441 pence. The drop was prompted by increased 
OPEC output and a rise in U.S. crude oil inventories pushing down 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Vodafone AirTouch, meanwhile, was one of the best performing  
shares in Europe, helped by news that it has boosted its 
shareholdings in several Japanese mobile telephone companies. The 
stock rose 10 pence, or 3.4 percent, to close at 303.25 pence. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom's bid for Sprint earlier in the week has increased  
speculation that more deals are to come, prompting gains in the 
European telecoms sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 614 European companies rose 0.80  
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 312.37. The worst performing 
index was energy, with a drop of 2.4 percent, followed by 
chemicals, which lost 1.0 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 310 companies in  
countries that joined the single currency, closed down 0.56 points 
at 327.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 0.92 of a point to  
3884.32, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed up 18.18 points at 
3757.11. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, London's FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares  
closed with a loss of 1.0 point to 6199.4. The Paris CAC-40 index 
fell 0.4 percent to 4,721.93, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index lost 0.5 
of a point to 5,419.26, Amsterdam's AEX index fell 0.2 percent to 
554.84 and Milan's MIBtel index fell 0.4 percent to 33,903.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gov. Touts GOP on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While Democrats at all levels fight to  
preserve a failing education system, Republican governors are 
taking bold steps to demand better results from students and 
teachers, Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci, in the weekly GOP radio address, credited his fellow  
governors for bucking the status quo and using high-stakes tests to 
hold students and schools accountable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accountability is meaningless without the means to hold  
schools, students and teachers to high standards and high 
expectations,'' Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, Cellucci said, new report cards will grade  
each school on how their students perform on statewide tests. Tough 
new standards programs are being carried out by Govs. Jim Gilmore 
of Virginia and Jeb Bush of Florida, he said. Other Republican 
governors are improving the nation's classrooms with charter 
schools and other forms of school choice, Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, he said, Gov. George W. Bush is ending social  
promotion and increasing test scores. Cellucci also praised Bush, 
the leading GOP presidential candidate, for his recent proposal to 
streamline federal programs and give states greater flexibility in 
using them to help their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a list of Republican governors and lawmakers who have  
used the weekly radio address this year to tout the party's 
education policy, Cellucci made reference to GOP recommendations to 
loosen regulations in the nation's major education law, set for 
renewal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must continue to promote the kind of change that is  
happening at the grassroots level by giving states the freedom to 
set standards,'' he said. ``Regrettably Democrats at the national 
and state level, such as Vice President Al Gore, are fighting to 
preserve the status quo and protect an education system that is 
failing our kids.''

<HEADLINE> Garciaparra Out of Game 3 Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- He's been named rookie of the year, won a batting  
title and started an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	And Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra says that what he did  
Saturday was his toughest task of all. 
</P>
<P>
	While his Boston teammates were beating the Cleveland Indians  
9-3 to avoid a sweep in the best-of-5 series, Garciaparra had to 
watch from the dugout because of his bruised right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be out there. I did everything I could do to be  
out there,'' the All-Star shortstop and AL batting champion said. 
``I'll be leaving here hoping I can be ready to play (Sunday).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lou Merloni replaced Garciaparra at shortstop and batted sixth,  
going 2-for-3. But he also made a throwing error on a potential 
double play that would have kept Roberto Alomar from scoring to 
make it 2-2 in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the victory assured Boston of at least one more game.  
Garciaparra said he would test his wrist again before Sunday's Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know if he's healthy, he's going,'' Merloni said. ``This is  
what the guy plays for. I know it was killing him not to be in this 
ballgame, the competitor he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garciaparra, who led the league with a .357 average, bruised his  
right wrist on Sept. 25 when Baltimore's Al Reyes hit him with a 
pitch. It didn't hurt him in the playoff opener, won by Cleveland 
3-2, when he went 2-for-3 with a homer and double and scored both 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But in an 11-1 loss in Game 2 on Thursday, Garciaparra was  
0-for-3 with a strikeout and two groundouts. 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling didn't go down on Friday, when Garciaparra skipped  
an off-day workout. And when he tried to take some swings before 
Game 3, he couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out in the tunnel (batting cage) and came back with a  
`No,''' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Red Sox force a fifth game, the condition of pitcher  
Pedro Martinez would also become an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL Cy Young Award favorite left his Game 1 start after four  
innings with a strained back muscle. He threw for about one minute 
in the outfield prior Saturday's game before trainer Rich Zawacki 
cut him off. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still experiencing discomfort,'' team doctor Arthur  
Pappas said. ``We'll attempt light throwing again tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> Union Tries To Help Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Government crackdowns on immigration and the  
changing face of America's workforce have prompted the AFL-CIO to 
renew efforts to reach out to immigrant workers, union officials 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The union is planning four public forums, in Atlanta, Chicago,  
Los Angeles and New York, to hear from immigrant workers about 
working conditions and efforts to unionize. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigrants have long been exploited on the job but rarely speak  
out for fear of being fired or deported, said Clayola Brown, vice 
president of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile 
Employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many horror stories out there. We truly don't  
know the depth because there is so much fear,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to union figures, one in 10 U.S. workers was born  
outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Daisy Cabrera, 26, who has worked as a janitor for union and  
non-union companies, said her non-union employer did not provide 
overtime or health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I needed the job. If I protested, I'd get fired,'' she said.  
``With the union, we have control of our work load. When we were 
not unionized, they dumped work on us and we were expected to do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AFL-CIO officials said the effort to reach immigrants comes as  
the Immigration and Naturalization Service is cracking down on 
undocumented workers in labor-intensive industries, such as 
meatpacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Operation Vanguard, the INS has subpoenaed employee  
records at several Midwest plants to verify workers' immigration 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	While the method has prompted questions about invasion of  
privacy and concerns about labor shortages, the INS says it is less 
disruptive than workplace raids.

<HEADLINE> Tests Shed Light on Cystic Fibrosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Tests in mice suggest a reversible fatty-acid  
imbalance may be the source of chronic lung inflamation, excess 
mucus and other symptoms of cystic fibrosis, researchers said 
Saturday at the 13th annual North American Cystic Fibrosis 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The genetic disease, which affects 30,000 American children and  
young adults, attacks patients' lungs with a thick mucus and most 
die from lung damage or infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers -- Dr. Juan Alvarez and Dr. Steven Freedman of  
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston -- worked with mice 
genetically altered to mimic cystic fibrosis. 
</P>
<P>
	They found the altered mice had abnormally high levels of one  
fatty acid -- arachidonic acid, or AA -- and abnormally low levels of 
another -- docosahexaeonic acid, or DHA. The imbalance was limited 
to the organs most affected by cystic fibrosis, including the 
lungs, pancreas and intestines. 
</P>
<P>
	When the altered mice were fed large doses of DHA for one week,  
the researchers reported, not only was that imbalance corrected -- 
the signs of cystic fibrosis also were reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary tests suggest the imbalance involving the two fatty  
acids also exists in people with the disease, Alvarez and Freedman 
said. They are studying the relationship in cystic fibrosis 
patients under a research agreement with Genzyme General of 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although a number of steps remain before the benefit of DHA to  
patients is known, this exciting research presents an entirely new 
strategy to correct and possibly even prevent some of the ravages 
of this disease,'' said Robert J. Beall, president and chief 
executive officer of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	DHA is available as a nutritional supplement in health food  
stores, but the researchers and foundation officials warned 
patients against experimenting at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials are expected to begin next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``They've made some tantalizing observations in an animal  
model,'' said Dr. Peter Durie, director of cystic fibrosis research 
at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, where the CF gene was 
discovered 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal hereditary disease  
among Caucasians in the United States. The median life expectancy 
is 32 years. Treatments to fight lung infections and improve 
nutrition have improved care dramatically, but they treat only 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	One cystic fibrosis patient was optimistic about the research.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very promising,'' said Suzanne Pattee, an  
attorney at the Washington, D.C.-based CF Foundation. As for her 
illness, she said, ``Obviously I'm more fortunate than many -- I'm 
in my mid-30s.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Compromise on Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year marked by brinkmanship over tax  
cuts and the budget surplus, congressional Republicans are trying 
to avoid a new confrontation with the White House on a must-pass 
bill renewing expiring tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	At a closed-door meeting last week, Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott said a 10-year, $75 billion proposal from the chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee, Republican William Roth of Delaware, was 
too costly to pass, according to a participant's notes of the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., urged a more modest alternative that would renew  
the tax breaks for another two years, long enough to get past the 
2000 election. If a Republican wins the White House, Lott's 
reasoning went, Congress would have a fresh opportunity to pass 
much broader tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Lott said his message to the Finance Committee was to  
come up with a noncontroversial ``clean'' bill. ``It's got to be as 
low as possible in terms of cost,'' he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	This move toward moderation on the tax ``extenders'' bill stands  
in stark contrast to the GOP's position earlier this year on the 
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. Republicans defied President 
Clinton's veto threat on that bill and then touted it as 
confirmation of the vast philosophical gulf between the GOP and 
Democrats on tax cuts vs. higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Disagreement remains over whether to use any of the projected  
budget surplus on this smaller tax bill -- most of which was part of 
the bigger tax cut -- or find revenue offsets to pay for it. The 
difference in this debate is that both sides stand to lose 
politically if the bill fails. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel an urgency to pass the extenders,'' said Senate  
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost every year, Congress must decide whether to renew -- or  
extend -- a batch of business tax breaks. Foremost among them is a 
credit for research and development popular with the high-tech 
industry and manufacturers; the credit expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Some lawmakers and lobbyists say this exercise is set up  
deliberately by Congress so there is a must-pass tax bill every 
year, ensuring a vehicle that can carry other pet items. But Rep. 
Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means 
Committee, said a periodic review of such credits is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ought to be able to reassess the program and see how it's  
working,'' said Archer, R-Texas, who included a five-year extension 
of the research credit in his version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Not passing an extenders bill this year runs the risk of  
alienating the high-tech business sector being courted so actively 
by Democrats and Republicans. There also are important 
constituencies for expiring credits for businesses that hire former 
welfare recipients and people who traditionally have difficulty 
holding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even worse, an estimated 1 million average taxpayers unwittingly  
could fall subject to the intricate alternative minimum tax because 
they claim personal credits such as the $500 per-child credit or 
education credits. The AMT was created to prevent the wealthy from 
escaping income taxes through legal means, but with inflation it is 
gradually creeping up on middle-class taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is now coming up and rear-ending people,'' said Rep. Nancy  
Johnson, R-Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless those personal credits are excluded from AMT, taxpayers  
working on their returns in early 2000 -- right during primary 
election season -- could be in for a costly surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe this Congress will fail to extend these  
expiring provisions,'' Archer said. ``There are too many important 
things in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite bipartisan sentiment to fix the AMT problem and extend  
the business credits, how the measure is paid for stands in the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Democrats repeatedly have opposed any tax relief  
that spends projected budget surpluses unless steps are taken 
toward the long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare, 
including a new prescription drug benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should do something,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of  
New York, top Democrat on the Finance Committee. ``What we do must 
be paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are suggesting a number of revenue offsets for a  
two-year extenders bill, including a proposal to close a number of 
corporate tax shelters and a reinstatement of a Superfund 
environmental cleanup tax. But Democrats also are hinting that some 
surplus money could be available for extenders in future years 
under certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no opposition, no difficulty with the concept of using  
non-Social Security revenues in the future so long as we recognize 
there's a very narrow amount of money,'' Daschle said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Lott spokesman John Czwartacki said  
Republicans are examining ways to pay for the extenders without 
spending surplus dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a sense that we would like an offset,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Roth and Moynihan have been discussing a compromise measure that  
could come before the Finance Committee as early as Wednesday. 
Pending before the House, meanwhile, is a five-year, $23.3 billion 
version that extends the research credit for five years and makes 
permanent the AMT fix mostly with projected surplus money.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Gov. Touts GOP on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican governors are bucking the status  
quo and using high-stakes tests to demand better results from 
students and teachers, Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Accountability is meaningless without the means to hold  
schools, students and teachers to high standards and high 
expectations,'' Cellucci said in the GOP's weekly radio address. 
``Republicans governors are holding the line on standards and we're 
using high-stakes tests to hold students and schools accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Massachusetts, Cellucci said, new report cards will grade  
each school on how their students perform on statewide tests. And 
tough new standards programs are being carried out by Virginia Gov. 
Jim Gilmore and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, he said. Other Republican 
governors are improving the nation's classrooms with charter 
schools and other forms of school choice, Cellucci said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, he added, Gov. George W. Bush is ending social  
promotion and increasing test scores. Cellucci also praised Bush, 
the leading GOP presidential candidate, for his recent proposal to 
streamline federal programs and give states greater flexibility in 
using them to help their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining a list of Republican governors and lawmakers who have  
used the weekly radio address this year to tout the party's 
education policy, Cellucci made reference to GOP calls to loosen 
regulations in the nation's major education law, set for renewal 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must continue to promote the kind of change that is  
happening at the grass-roots level by giving states the freedom to 
set standards,'' he said. ``Regrettably Democrats at the national 
and state level, such as Vice President Al Gore, are fighting to 
preserve the status quo and protect an education system that is 
failing our kids.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Lose Wrestling Matches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Americans Cary Kolat and Joe Williams lost  
their matches Saturday, failing to win medals in the World 
Freestyle Wrestling Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Uzbekistan's Ramil Islamov beat Kolat 5-0 at the 138 3/4-pound  
class. Kolat was upset 2-1 by 1995 World Champion Elbrus Tedeev of 
Ukraine earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is disappointing is that what happened to Cary,'' said  
Rich Bender, event director of the U.S. team. ``Cary Kolat was a 
favorite to win the gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bender said Kolat, Madison, Wis., injured his shoulder on the  
first day of the games on Thursday, which affected his performance. 
Kolat was a 1997 World silver medalist and 1998 World bronze 
medalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, the U.S. team lost another bronze medal chance  
when Williams, of Iowa City, Iowa, was beaten by Turkey's Adem 
Bereket 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was competing at an international event for the first  
time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	By clinching the fourth spots, Kolat and Williams qualified the  
United States to compete in their weight classes at the 2000 
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if the United States would improve on its 1998  
third place finish at the end of the championships on Sunday, when 
a total of 64 Olympic berths will be determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Americans still remain in the competition. Eric Guerrero,  
the No. 2 wrestler in the U.S. at 127 3/4 pounds, Lincoln McIlravy at 
152 pounds, Les Gutches at 187 pounds and Stephen Neal at 286 
pounds will all compete in the quarterfinals and semifinals on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tedeev won the gold medal by upsetting Korea's Kim Woo-Young  
4-0. In Williams' weight class, the winner was Russia's Adam 
Saitiev, who defeated Germany's Leipold Alexander, 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Quaker Oats To Pay 3.2M Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Quaker Oats Co. has agreed to pay $3.2 million to  
settle age discrimination claims filed on behalf of sales staffers 
who lost their jobs in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed the  
claims after finding ``reasonable cause'' to believe the 
Chicago-based company violated the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement was announced Friday. In it, the company admitted  
no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Quaker Oats firmly believes it did not discriminate against  
older employees during its 1994 sales force restructuring,'' said 
Robert S. Morrison, the company's chairman, president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Three hundred jobs were cut during the restructuring.  
</P>
<P>
	Several private lawsuits have been filed by people who lost jobs  
in 1994, Morrison said. But he said there has been no court ruling 
that the company discriminated against older employees.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Poised To Sweep Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Even before the championship banner was  
hoisted at Yankee Stadium on opening day, a shadow fell across a 
team that had enjoyed a season like no other in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	With the club in spring training, updates on pitchers and  
catchers gave way to grim medical reports. In quick succession, the 
Yankees learned that one of the greatest of them all, Joe DiMaggio, 
had died. And just two days later, their manager, Joe Torre, was 
diagnosed with prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	This came with the Yankees still dealing with Darryl  
Strawberry's colon cancer and legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody feels like we're snakebit,'' World Series MVP Scott  
Brosius said. ``After all, it's kind of hard to feel sorry for 
yourself when you finish with the best record in the league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brosius had a burden of his own this year. The third baseman's  
father, Maury Brosius, died of colon cancer at 55 on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days earlier, the Yankees lost another one of their Hall  
of Famers, Catfish Hunter, who died of Lou Gehrig's disease. They 
had seen him in spring training withering away and, after his 
death, wore black armbands to honor him -- those armbands were right 
below the No. 5 on the left uniform sleeves, remembering DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't expect bad things to happen, but we're not surprised  
anymore when they do,'' first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``It's 
almost like we're numb to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, the Yankees kept winning. They didn't exactly  
reprise last year's record 125-win season, but won the AL East. 
</P>
<P>
	New York was on the brink of making it back to the league  
championship series, taking a 2-0 lead into Game 3 of the best-of-5 
first-round matchup against the Rangers at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when everything seemed to be falling into place for the  
Yankees, a bump came along. They got a scare in Game 2 against 
Texas when bench coach Don Zimmer, who served as interim manager 
for 36 games while Torre recovered from surgery this spring, was 
hit in the head by a foul ball of Chuck Knoblauch's bat. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, Zimmer avoided any serious injury and returned  
to the bench, but shortstop Derek Jeter said it was just another 
chance for the Yankees to prove they could keep their focus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, you're going to think about things like that,''  
Jeter said. ``But one thing we're good at is blocking it out and 
playing through tough times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre said the first month of the  
season could have been the key to the Yankees' whole season, 
because playing without Torre prepared them for the adversity that 
they would face later. Stottlemyre also said that the way the team 
responded to the distractions makes this year's success ``even more 
satisfying than what we did last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of things to deal with and battle past, but  
we've rebounded pretty well,'' Stottlemyre said. ``I think that 
starts with Joe, because he was still leading us while he was 
absent through Zimmer. To survive that was crucial to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Yankees believe that the lessons learned during their  
difficult season can pay dividends in the postseason. After all, 
explained pitcher David Cone, a team with a history of playing amid 
distractions is less likely to fold under the pressure of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it works to our advantage,'' Cone said. ``Everything  
we've been through makes us a better team, and we're a close-knit 
group that's been through a lot together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And even without a record-setting win total or a smooth ride to  
the pennant, these Yankees are primed to win a second straight 
World Series title, and their record 25th overall.

	``If we end up at our ultimate goal, it will be every bit as  
sweet as it was last year,'' Brosius said. ``Actually, it will 
maybe be even sweeter because we had to dig down so deep.''

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Nebraska 42, Iowa St. 14 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Eric Crouch threw for two touchdowns and  
ran for another as No. 4 Nebraska routed Iowa State 49-14 Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Correll Buckhalter and Dan Alexander each topped 100 yards  
rushing and Derrahn Diedrick ran for 99 for the Cornhuskers (6-0, 
3-0 Big 12), who haven't lost to Iowa State in Lincoln since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska gained 524 yards against a defense that had been  
allowing only 215 per game and held the Cyclones (3-2, 0-2), who 
were leading the nation in rushing with 328 yards per game, to 185. 
The Huskers shut down Iowa State tailback Darren Davis, the 
nation's leading rusher, until the fourth quarter, when he was able 
to get free long after Nebraska coach Frank Solich had pulled his 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who was averaging 176.8 yards, finished with 107 on 22  
carries and scored two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter. 
Davis had just 40 yards on 15 carries heading into the final 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cyclones, who have been outscored 199-42 in their last three  
visits to Lincoln, were penalized 12 times for 99 yards, including 
one for roughing the punter that kept a Nebraska scoring drive 
alive. They also had two punts blocked, fumbled twice and threw one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch, who left midway through the third quarter, was 5-for-10  
passing for 85 yards, with touchdown throws of 47 yards to Matt 
Davison and 24 yards to Bobby Newcombe. He also ran for 58 yards on 
10 carries, including a 20-yard dash early in the third quarter 
that put Nebraska up 42-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander finished with 135 yards on 10 carries, the first time  
he broke 100 yards in a game this season. Buckhalter, who topped 
100 against Missouri two weeks ago, carried 14 times for 127. 
Buckhalter's 7-yard touchdown run gave the Huskers a 28-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska defensive back Joe Walker, who missed the first few  
games while recovering from knee surgery, forced two fumbles that 
resulted in Cornhusker touchdowns. Walker sacked Sage Rosenfels 
from the blind side early in the first quarter and recovered the 
fumble, setting up the Huskers' 62-yard drive that ended on 
Alexander's 7-yard run to give Nebraska a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the fourth quarter, Walker sacked Derrick Walker and  
reserve end Demoine Adams scooped up the ball and returned it 37 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska cornerback Ralph Brown scored on a blocked punt he  
recovered in the end zone, putting Nebraska up 14-0 with 5:44 left 
in the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Upsets Michigan 34-31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Michigan State's record-shattering  
duo of Bill Burke and Plaxico Burress was just too much for 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke passed for a school-record 400 yards and two touchdowns,  
and Burress caught 10 passes for a school-record 255 yards and a 
score as the No. 11 Spartans held off the third-ranked Wolverines 
34-31 Saturday in a showdown of Big Ten unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
	The win left Michigan State, which began the season unranked,  
6-0 overall and 3-0 in the conference. The Wolverines, hoping for a 
second national title in three years, slipped to 5-1, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke completed 21 of 36 passes and became the first player to  
pass for 400 yards for Michigan State, breaking the mark of 369 by 
Ed Smith against Indiana in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Burress broke the school mark of 252 receiving yards by Andre  
Rison in the 1989 Gator Bowl against Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the heroics of Burke and Burress, however, the game  
might have hinged on the decision of Michigan coach Lloyd Carr to 
start the second half with sophomore quarterback Drew Henson 
instead of senior Tom Brady. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson, who completed 6-of-12 for 111 yards, got the Wolverines  
their first touchdown on an 81-yard pass to Marcus Knight in the 
second quarter. But he was never able to move the offense in the 
third quarter and Brady -- playing the fourth quarter -- brought the 
Wolverines back from a 27-10 deficit by directing three scoring 
drives in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, who also played the first quarter, completed 30-of-41 for  
285 yards, including two TD tosses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans had dominated both sides of the ball until Brady  
got things untracked in the final quarter. Michigan State rolled up 
490 yards to 402 for Michigan. The Wolverines got 208 of those 
yards in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, behind the passing of Burke and big-play  
receptions by Burress, dominated the first two quarters, yet led 
just 13-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman T.J. Duckett scored on a 1-yard run and Paul Edinger  
kicked field goals of 39 and 43 yards in the first half for the 
Spartans. The Wolverines for their 10 points on a school-record 
56-yard field goal by Hayden Epstein and Henson's bomb to Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State kept the pressure on in the second half. Edinger  
missed a 44-yard attempt on the Spartans first possession, but with 
Burke and Burress hooking up for 17 yards, Michigan State drove 
49-yards in seven plays for a touchdown and a 20-10 lead on a 
19-yard TD toss from Burke to Gari Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Henson -- under a tremendous rush -- was picked off  
by Aric Morris who returned it 17 yards to the Michigan 18. Three 
plays later, Burke found Burress wide open in the end zone for a 
15-yard touchdown and a 27-10 lead with 3:02 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady replaced Henson on Michigan's next possession.  
</P>
<P>
	On his first drive, Brady completed 6-of-9 for 64 yards in an  
80-yard drive that ended in a 2-yard touchdown run by Anthony 
Thomas, closing the gap to 27-17 with 14:23 left in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't slow down Burke or the Spartans, however. Burke hit  
passes of 21 and 35 yards as Michigan State went 76 yards in six 
plays on its next possession, taking a 34-17 lead on a 14-yard 
scoring run by Dawan Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, doing his best to bring the Wolverines back, completed  
8-of-8 for 75 yards on Michigan's next possession, hitting David 
Terrell with a 19-yard TD toss to make it 34-24 with 8:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, hitting 9-of-11 for 86 yards, took the Wolverines 96  
yards on their next possession, hooking up with Aaron Shea for an 
8-yard touchdown, closing the gap to three points with 2:47 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	But, again, it was Burress coming up big the the Spartans.  
</P>
<P>
	Burress covered Michigan's onside kickoff attempt, giving the  
Spartans the ball at the Michigan 44 with 2:44 left. Then, with the 
Spartans trying to run out the clock, Burress made a 15-yard 
sideline catch on a third-and-9 situation, allowing them to keep 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the 12th time Michigan and Michigan State met when  
both were ranked by The Associated Press. Michigan had won the last 
five, but the Spartans now lead the series 6-5-1 in those 12 games 
</P>
<P>
	The higher ranked team has won nine of the 12 games, going  
9-2-1. The only other upset came in 1950 when Michigan State won 
14-7 in the first game of the season.

<HEADLINE> German Slave Labor Offer Said Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- A spokesman for German industry said Saturday he  
is confident negotiators will agree on compensation for Nazi-era 
slave laborers, even though representatives of survivors have 
criticized a German offer of $3.3 billion as too low. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Wolfgang Gibowski urged attorneys and survivor groups  
to accept the proposal, saying German companies are not prepared to 
pay more. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our best and final offer,'' he said in a telephone  
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan proposed Thursday by German negotiators in  
Washington, industry would finance two-thirds and the government 
one-third of a fund for former slave laborers and other ``forgotten 
victims'' who have received little or no restitution for Nazi 
evils. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Friday defended the German offer  
as ``worthy.'' The offer was spurred by U.S. class-action lawsuits 
against German companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The next round of negotiations is scheduled for Nov. 16-17 in  
Bonn, Germany. Gibowski did not rule out a collapse of the talks, 
but he said he was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect the attorneys and survivor groups to be ready to work  
on a solution of the problem and to talk about the money that's on 
the table,'' Gibowski told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	If no overall settlement can be found, individual companies  
could set up their own funds to compensate slave laborers who 
worked for them during World War II, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass-circulation Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted Gibowski  
as saying it was ``not fair'' that German companies ``are being 
insulted'' by critics of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jewish leader said he also expects a settlement.  
</P>
<P>
	Israel Singer, general secretary of the World Jewish Congress,  
said on German radio late Friday that he has ``great trust'' German 
negotiators will find a solution. It was unclear whether he found 
the German offer acceptable.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Presidential Debates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- So the debate debate begins, with Gov. George  
W. Bush shunning Republican campaign confrontations until next year 
while Vice President Al Gore seeks a series every other week 
against Bill Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats Gore and Bradley are to meet in Hanover, N.H., on Oct.  
27, answering audience questions in a televised joint forum, not 
quite debating but close. Five Republican candidates will share the 
same stage the following night, without Bush, who leads the field 
and is following the front-runner's script on debating his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate challenges are standard for candidates who are trying to  
catch up and want to confront the leader on an equal footing. Gore 
adapted the strategy to his circumstances -- he still leads Bradley 
by most measures, but the former New Jersey senator is catching up 
in polls and lately in fund raising and campaign cash on hand. That 
led the vice president to overhaul his campaign, and to seek 
debates -- live on the Internet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he'd already agreed to joint appearances, beginning  
with the New Hampshire forum, and beyond that, will stick to his 
own campaign plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have debates every two weeks,'' Gore said, each on  
a different issue. He's mentioned as topics health care, education, 
the environment, national defense, crime control -- ``and the list 
goes on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On that timetable, the campaign for the Democratic nomination  
would become one of debates and not much else. There's no lure for 
Bradley in that; he's doing well the standard way. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was not, and while he now speaks of debates as a way to  
elevate the campaign and enrich democracy, he hadn't mentioned 
debating Bradley until just recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican debate argument is along more standard lines.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush has declined the Oct. 28 forum in New Hampshire; he said  
that ``while the debate may be important,'' it conflicts with a 
ceremony honoring his wife at Southern Methodist University. He 
wasn't going to the debate anyhow. His campaign has ruled out 
debates for 1999, saying he will wait until 2000, when people are 
paying attention to the presidential race. Bush has accepted an 
invitation to debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 15, and another 
in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``George W. Bush, it's time to debate,'' said rival Steve  
Forbes, repeating the challenge he has been issuing ever since the 
Texas governor began his active campaign. Forbes wants a series of 
five debates including Bush, which he won't get. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, at least five Republican candidates campaigning to  
catch the front-runner will appear without him at the forum at 
Dartmouth College. That's not to say they won't be talking about 
him. When Ronald Reagan skipped a Republican debate in Iowa in 
1980, the GOP field didn't spare the leader who wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan said debating would have been divisive, but after he lost  
in Iowa, he intensified his campaign, confronted his rivals in New 
Hampshire debates, and won. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate forums are fixtures now in the primary campaign  
states, usually with a big cast of contestants, some competitive 
for the nomination, some not, but in for the show. 
</P>
<P>
	They usually do more to cement impressions than to turn the  
course of a campaign. But there have been memorable moments, as 
when Reagan outmaneuvered the elder George Bush before they even 
began a 1980 debate, by arguing that four uninvited Republicans 
should be included, too. That cast Reagan as the unifier, although 
his side had arranged a two-man debate with Bush, who had upset him 
in Iowa. When the moderator tried to silence Reagan by ordering his 
microphone turned off, Reagan grabbed it and kept talking, saying 
he'd paid for it. Bush was left sputtering. The two finally 
debated, but by then, Reagan had won the engagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, later vice president and president, describes it as the  
low point of his 1980 campaign. ``I will be the first to admit that 
I looked like a fool, rigidly playing by the rules,'' he writes in 
his new book, ``All the Best, George Bush.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As vice president, Bush reluctantly joined the candidate forum  
circuit early, beginning in the fall of 1987. He was the 
front-runner, and so the target of five rival candidates, defending 
the Reagan administration against what he called carping by 
outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Loyalty is a strength, not a character flaw,'' Bush said.  
</P>
<P>
	That's a line that may echo as Gore tries to debate his way to  
the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Elvis Objects Auctioned in Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- It was one for the money, two for the show --  
and $8,000 for a sixth-grade report card. 
</P>
<P>
	Elvis Presley fans armed with cash paid big bucks at a three-day  
auction featuring memorabilia from the King of Rock 'n' Roll. 
</P>
<P>
	The report card -- with D's in math and geography and A's in  
music -- was the first of 2,000 items culled from the Graceland 
collection to be put on the block during the three-day auction, 
which began Friday at the MGM Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole spectacle attracted the usual constellation of Elvis  
impersonators and rabid fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just trying to get anything,'' said Dorothy Antonelli, a  
50-year-old school bus monitor from Providence, R.I. ``This is far 
beyond anything I imagined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The items included Elvis' draft card, which went for $22,500,  
the tax forms of his parents, and the sequined jumpsuits from the 
latter part of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the pieces were record, movie and performance  
contracts, including the publishing contract for ``Heartbreak 
Hotel'' and letters from Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and 
President Kennedy. But there were also several of Presley's 
vehicles, including a vintage yellow Cadillac and a 1956 Lincoln 
Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	The items were selected to weed out the collection at Graceland,  
with money raised from the auction going to build houses for 
homeless families in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could come to a few million dollars or more,'' said Arlan  
Ettinger, owner of Guernsey's, the Manhattan auction house staging 
the sale. ``I wish I knew. But the interest has been phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the early bidding was any indication, the several hundred  
people who filled about two-thirds of the seats were more 
interested in items signed or owned by Presley. 
</P>
<P>
	A bidder paid $1,900 for a receipt signed by Elvis in 1955 for a  
Motorola television. The bill was $292.32, with monthly 
installments of $12.18. 
</P>
<P>
	But the King's first RCA contract, which got him a $5,000 bonus  
and a penny and a half for each record sold, was a disappointment. 
It was expected to bring up to $150,000, but fetched only $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Dolinsky, a shoe designer from Morristown, N.J., attended  
the auction appropriately attired in black shirt -- open to navel -- 
and freighted with chains and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not dressed like him,'' Dolinsky said. ``This is just the  
way I dress every day.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Cut Investigated Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Defensive end Chris Mims, who is being  
investigated by police for assault and robbery, was cut by the San 
Diego Chargers Saturday to make room on the 53-man roster for 
Fakhir Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, a rookie cornerback from Grambling, was signed from the  
practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims did not make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game,  
spokesman Bill Johnston said Saturday. However, coach Mike Riley 
indicated he'd like to re-sign Mims once the cornerbacks get 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting cornerbacks Terrance Shaw (ankle) and Charles Dimry  
(knee) will miss Sunday's game at Detroit because of injuries. 
Darryll Lewis and Jimmy Spencer will start in their places. 
</P>
<P>
	Mims is being investigated for striking a man with his belt and  
stealing his four tacos after a verbal confrontation at a fast-food 
restaurant early the morning of Sept. 27, some 10 hours after the 
Chargers lost their home opener to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are expected to decide this week whether to submit the  
case to the city attorney's office for prosecution of misdemeanor 
chargers.

<HEADLINE> Brinkley Inspired by Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Model Christie Brinkley says her own breast  
cancer scare inspired the introduction she wrote to a new 
children's book about families facing breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both my mom and myself had scares, and thank goodness, neither  
of us had cancer. But those two incidents gave me just a little 
teeny glimpse of what it's like to have the fear and the rush of 
emotions,'' Ms. Brinkley told The Associated Press this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The book addresses those fears -- particularly the children's  
fears -- and explains breast cancer through cute illustrations and 
in words children can understand, Ms. Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids Talk'' is a free book from the Susan G. Komen Foundation  
designed for children 10 and under. It was written by Laura

<HEADLINE> UAW, Ford Talk Deadline Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto  
Workers remained at the negotiating table today, trying to hammer 
out a contract for some 100,000 workers, despite a strike deadline 
that came and went. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at Ford plants in St. Louis, Claycomo, Mo., Flat Rock,  
Mich., and St. Paul, Minn., marked the deadline's passing at 
midnight Friday by walking off their jobs. But the UAW said it did 
not authorize the work stoppage, and has not set a new deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants make some of Ford's most profitable vehicles,  
including the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle. Ford spokesman 
Jim Vella said it was unclear why the workers walked out or how 
many were affected. He did say Ford expected the workers to return 
this morning. The St. Louis and St. Paul plants were open today, 
and workers at both plants returned to work. Ford had no other 
reports of disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Vella added: ``There's not a strike.''  
</P>
<P>
	Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 in St. Louis, said the  
walkout was temporary and designed to be ``kind of like a wake-up 
call'' to Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told union members in a taped  
message earlier this week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about 
accepting contracts agreed to by General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	During negotiations in 1993 and 1996, the UAW found Ford's  
proposal best and settled with it first, setting the pattern for 
the other two companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to work and maybe before the company can  
really make a big mistake, they'll understand that they're not 
first this time, but third,'' Yokich said. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW and Ford have enjoyed good relations for about 20 years,  
avoiding strikes like the one in Flint last year that shut down 
much of General Motors' production. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford made $6.6 billion in 1998 thanks partly to bulked-up  
production at the company's truck and sport utility vehicle plants. 
The average worker's profit sharing payment was $6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year, UAW officials have said they were opposed to  
Ford's plans to spin off or sell its parts unit, which employs 
23,500 UAW workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders have said a spinoff of Visteon Automotive Systems  
could cut pay and jobs, even close plants to compete against other 
parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-year contracts negotiated with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
GM's former parts operations included promises from the companies 
that they would not spin off, sell or close any division or factory 
-- a clause that could be causing problems for Ford.

<P>
	The contracts also included 3 percent raises each year, a $1,350  
signing bonus and improved pensions.

<P>
	The UAW also negotiated some terms with GM and Delphi Automotive

GM pension.

contract by next week.

<HEADLINE> Ford, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor  
Co. reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new contract, hours 
after a handful of workers walked off the job when a strike 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement announcing the deal contained no details, and  
officials declined to provide any, pending ratification meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the agreement followed the pattern set by the UAW in deals 
with General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year 
agreements with raises of 3 percent each year and a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unknown how the contract dealt with Visteon Automotive  
Systems, the parts division of Ford that the company is expected to 
either spin-off or sell. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials have said they were opposed to the company's plans  
for Visteon, which employs 23,500 UAW workers. Officials were 
concerned a separate Visteon could cut pay and jobs and even close 
plants to compete against other parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike deadline of midnight Friday was a first in U.S. auto  
industry negotiations this year and a sign of strain in what had 
been billed as a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the union said it did not authorize any work stoppages  
and workers at only a handful of plants walked off their jobs when 
the deadline passed. Plants scheduled to operate on Saturday were 
back in business by the day shift. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary walkout was designed to be ``kind of like a  
wake-up call'' to Ford, said Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkouts came at Ford plants in St. Louis; Claycomo, Mo.;  
Flat Rock, Mich.; and St. Paul, Minn. There was no word on how many 
workers were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had made $6.6 billion in 1998, thanks to a lack of work  
stoppages and bulked-up production at truck and sport utility 
vehicle plants. The average worker's profit sharing payment was 
$6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up  
agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Labor Day parade in Detroit, UAW workers carried signs  
depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' -- an orange monster 
busting out of the Ford logo. 
</P>
<P>
	And UAW President Stephen P.Yokich told union members in a taped  
message earlier in the week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' about 
accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiated some terms with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
Delphi Automotive Systems that experts say could have applied to 
Ford and Visteon. The contracts included promises from the 
companies that they would not spin off, sell or close any division 
or factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also  
allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 
with a GM pension. Other terms include a $1,350 signing bonus, 
improved pensions and better cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on their  
new contract by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976; it  
was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations. A local 
union in Atlanta struck Ford in 1986. The UAW has not held a 
national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, 
including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut 
down most of the company's North American production.

<HEADLINE> Bening: I'd Support Beatty's Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Annette Bening can sound quite politic when it  
comes to the possible presidential future for her husband, Warren 
Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would support fully whatever Warren chooses to do. That's  
all I will say at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if he does choose to run, the 41-year-old actress who stars  
in the hit film ``American Beauty'' knows it will have an effect on 
the couple's three children -- Kathlyn, 7, Ben, 5, and Isabel, 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just beginning to dawn on Kathlyn that there's something  
different about us from other moms and dads,'' she says in the 
latest US magazine. ``I am very conscious about it -- protective, 
extremely vigilant. I'm doing everything I can to help them, but 
it's also important to say to them, `This is how it is, your bag, 
what you get to deal with. Everybody has something. This is yours 
and it's big.'''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Parents Expand Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for the parents of a student killed at  
Columbine High School said Saturday he plans to expand the family's 
wrongful death lawsuit to include at least one gun manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger of Michigan said that Florida-based Navegar and  
a subsidiary, Intratec, which made the TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol 
used during the April 20 attack, likely would be named as 
defendants within two weeks. He said the companies' marketing 
practices were designed to make the weapon attractive to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt it could be used by legitimate hunters for legitimate  
purposes,'' Fieger said. ``It's marketed as being made of an alloy 
that doesn't carry fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger represents Michael and Vonda Shoels, whose son Isaiah was  
among 12 students killed by teen-age gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris in their attack on the school. Harris and Klebold also 
killed one teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels family spokesman Sam Riddle said Friday that Fieger and  
Colorado co-counsel Jack Beam were heartened by a California 
appeals court decision last week that reinstated a lawsuit against 
Navegar and Intratec. 
</P>
<P>
	That suit involves the TEC-DC9 a gunman used to kill eight  
people and wound six in a San Francisco office building in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shoelses in May sued the parents of Klebold and Harris,  
saying they should have known their sons were amassing a cache of 
guns and bombs to use in the attack. The lawsuit seeks $250 million 
in damages.

<HEADLINE> Klan's 'Free' Speech Costs Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- When the Ku Klux Klan came to Defiance,  
the city prepared for an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 250 police officers from several departments near the  
small northwest Ohio city came to keep the peace between at least 
300 protesters and 41 Klansmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The hourlong rally March 20 by the American Knights of the Ku  
Klux Klan was uneventful, but peace came at a cost of $17,500 in 
overtime and other expenses, such as fences. 
</P>
<P>
	Defiance, a city of 16,000, is not alone in spending lots of  
money to ensure that a relatively small number of Klansmen can 
safely hold a rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With nearly two dozen Klan rallies so far this year, the bill  
for taxpayers has reached about $800,000. In 1994, the state 
received reports of 32 events involving the Klan and four involving 
other white supremacist groups. There have been at least 20 Klan 
events this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ted Almay, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal  
Identification and Investigation, said rallies died down after 1994 
because a pivotal Klan organizer went to prison for beating an 
ex-girlfriend. The resurgence this year, he said, is partly due to 
James Roesch, an outspoken 18-year-old who calls himself Imperial 
Wizard of the American Knights of the White Kamellia. 
</P>
<P>
	Roesch said Klansmen don't ask for police protection, and  
anti-Klan protesters are the ones trying to provoke fights and 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we ask is to give our speeches,'' said Roesch, who lives  
in Rushylvania. ``There's many ways a city could save money. The 
way they spend money is ludicrous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even if protesters stayed away, officials say, they would  
have to prepare for confrontations anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't have adequate protection, things get out of hand  
and you catch a lot of criticism for that. If you're adequately 
prepared, you catch a lot of criticism from people who say it's 
overkill,'' said Defiance County Sheriff Dave Westrick. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of refinement, the state now provides an ``off the  
shelf'' plan to communities for dealing with rallies. The plan 
includes advice on crowd control, security and how best to separate 
protesters, Klansmen and the media, said Ted Almay, superintendent 
of the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the state is also promising to help cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Betty Montgomery said her office, for the first  
time, will make free metal detectors and fences available for use 
during rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Her office spent $8,000 on two walk-through detectors, six  
handheld detectors and several miles of chain-link fencing. 
</P>
<P>
	Almay said the goal is to ``ease the burden of the small towns.  
A city like Columbus, we'll help with intelligence and we'll help 
that day get things together, but when you go to Urbana or places 
like that, this is devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest cost to date has been in Cleveland, which said its  
Aug. 21 rally cost more than $537,000, mainly in overtime for 
police officers, street and water department employees, and other 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, a May 1 rally by the American Knights of the Ku  
Klux Klan in Zanesville -- population 28,000 -- cost the city $7,500 
and the Muskingum County Sheriff's Department an additional 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an unfortunate waste of taxpayers' money to have to do  
that, but in order to keep the city safe and officers safe, it's 
something you have to do,'' said Zanesville Police Chief Diane 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,  
Ala., said the number of Klansmen who show up rarely matters since 
they are always going to draw large protest crowds, whether or not 
communities ask people to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to recover the cost of rallies from the Klan itself  
have met with limited success. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1992, in a case involving a white supremacist group in  
Forsyth County, Ga., the Supreme Court said communities that impose 
permit fees for parades and rallies can't charge more for 
controversial groups just because they might need more police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a 1996 Klan rally in Ann Arbor, Mich., the city billed  
both the Klan and an anti-Klan organization $72,000 for the cost of 
security. The city never started collection action but hasn't ruled 
out the possibility, city attorney Abigail Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery said there are real legal problems ``in terms of  
billing a particular group which is exercising its First Amendment 
rights, and selecting out one group because we don't like it and 
saying, 'We'll protect you, but we're going to charge you,' but 
other groups we don't charge.''

<HEADLINE> No. 8 Florida 31, LSU 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Two years ago, when LSU fans tore down  
the goal posts to celebrate the upset of then-No. 1 Florida, Robert 
Gillespie was on the LSU sideline cheering for the Tigers, the team 
he expected to play for. 
</P>
<P>
	Things never quite worked out as Gillespie planned, and he  
scored two touchdowns Saturday for the Gators, including one with 
45 seconds left in the game that ensured a 31-10 victory for No. 8 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the guys in the line were questioning why we didn't  
down the ball,'' Gillespie said. ``(Quarterback) Doug Johnson came 
in, fired guys up and said we were going to put it in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A visit to Florida, where winning was a reality, convinced  
Gillespie he'd rather play there than try to help the Tigers build 
a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Florida we always expect to win,'' Gillespie said. ``We  
expected it today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pounding rain fell for much of the second quarter and  
halftime, turning the Tiger Stadium field into a flooded, muddy 
swamp in the second half. That prevented a Florida blowout but did 
not completely stop Steve Spurrier's high-powered offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillespie gained 108 yards on 21 carries in the slop, including  
66 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
	After last week's upset loss to Alabama, Florida (5-1, 3-1  
Southeastern Conference), which has not lost back-to-back games 
since 1992 and only twice since 1990, could not afford another loss 
and keep its SEC championship hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU (2-3, 0-3) was so inept in the first half -- picking up just  
32 yards on 35 plays while allowing the Gators to gain 251 yards on 
37 plays -- that even a solid second-half effort could not save 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got frustrated in the first half,'' LSU guard Trey Langley  
said. ``It's a big frustration that we can't run the ball. We were 
not communicating well. We have some young guys out there and 
confusion sets in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU rushed for minus 7 yards on 37 carries.  
</P>
<P>
	Florida's offense, which averaged more than 500 yards a game in  
the first four games, was slowed in the second half as much by the 
dismal conditions as the Tigers. Florida gained just 345 yards, but 
LSU had only 165. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not happy with way we played, this could be one of the  
most undisciplined team we've had in my 10 years at Florida,'' 
Spurrier said. ``Obviously, we were in good shape and almost blew 
the game. We kept messing around, made stupid penalties and allowed 
LSU back into game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took only 20 seconds for Florida to erase any lingering  
memories of their last visit to Tiger Stadium when LSU knocked them 
from their No. 1 ranking and snapped a 25-game SEC winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays into the game the Gators were ahead 7-0 as Johnson hit  
Darrell Jackson for a 73-yard gain and Gillespie scampered 
untouched another 7 yards to score. By the end of the first quarter 
Florida was up 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU scored on a 22-yard field goal in the second quarter, but  
Florida answered immediately as Bo Carroll took the ensuing kickoff 
four yards deep in the end zone and returned it for a touchdown. A 
27-yard touchdown pass to Alex Willis made it 24-3 Florida at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida scored on four of its eight first half possessions.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson completed 17 of 29 passes for 227 yards and a touchdown.  
He was intercepted once and sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to try and make something big happen on the first  
play and they came out and did exactly what we thought they would 
do,'' Johnson said. ``That's huge when you come into an other 
person's stadium and get off to a good start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LSU retained a bit of respectability on Josh Booty's 10-yard  
touchdown pas to Robert Royal that cut the Gators' lead to 24-10 in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Booty, who made his second start since forsaking major league  
baseball for LSU, completed 18 of 42 passes for 172 yards and a 
touchdown. He was intercepted three times and sacked twice. 
</P>
<P>
	On LSU's final possession, Booty had two incompletions, fumbled  
the snap, and tossed an interception that gave Florida the ball on 
the Tigers' 31. Five plays later, Gillespie iced the victory with a 
20-yard touchdown run, putting Florida up 31-10 with 45 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the field in their traditional white jerseys was the only  
fight LSU came close to winning. Spurrier had tried to block the 
Tigers from donning white, but was overruled by conference 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was Spurrier's 98th at Florida, tying him with Barry  
Switzer for the most victories in his first 10 years at a major 
college this century.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Judges Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton accused the Republican-led  
Senate of ignoring minority nominees to the federal bench for 
partisan gain, and told Hispanic leaders Saturday that America 
increasingly will ``look like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech summing up the progress and problems of America's  
fastest-growing minority group, Clinton said his administration has 
exceeded all others in appointing Hispanic judges. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said too many nominees are languishing in the Senate,  
waiting for approval, among them Richard Paez, the first 
Mexican-American to serve as a federal judge in Los Angeles. 
Clinton nominated Paez to the federal appeals court more than three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply dissatisfied with the Senate's partisan handling  
of some of my minority nominees,'' Clinton said at the annual 
meeting of the national Hispanic Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated some of the strong language he used earlier in the  
week to denounce the Republican-led Senate for rejecting the 
nomination of Ronnie White, a black judge who had earlier won GOP 
endorsements. The nomination went down on a straight party line 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a disgrace,'' Clinton said bitterly.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate's treatment of Judge White, and its failure to vote  
on the outstanding Hispanic nominees that are pending, creates a 
real doubt about the Senate's ability to fairly perform its 
constitutional duties to advise and consent,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who led opposition to  
the nomination, said White's record on crime -- not his race -- was 
the reason for the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bill Clinton's manipulation of race for political purposes is  
low demagoguery. It is bad for the country,'' Steve Hilton said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton also said Clinton should work with the Senate leadership,  
rather than denouncing it, but ``certainly should not send up 
soft-on-crime nominations like the White nomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago speech was Clinton's last on a three-day trip that  
began with addresses to labor and gay groups in New York on 
Thursday. In those speeches, and in addresses in Canada on Friday, 
Clinton struck the same chord again and again: ``The oldest fear of 
the human heart,'' he says, ``is the fear of people who are 
different from us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To warm applause, Clinton said Saturday that Hispanics are  
moving quickly ``into the mainstream of American life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national Hispanic population of 31 million is expected to  
overtake the non-Hispanic black population to become the largest 
minority group by the end of 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Hispanics will be a potent political force in the 2000  
elections, Clinton did not made a direct pitch for Democratic 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he recounted what he called the successes of the  
Clinton-Gore administration. He took at least partial credit for 
such advances as a 4.8 percent increase in the median household 
income for Hispanics last year. The overall national increase was 
3.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet too many Hispanic teen-agers still drop out of high school,  
and too many lack adequate health coverage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 62 percent of Hispanic adults ages 25 to 29 completed high  
school compared with 87 percent of blacks and 93 percent of whites, 
according to federal figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics themselves have forged a powerful unity among diverse  
members of their own ethnic group, Clinton said. A challenge for 
Hispanics, and for the rest of America, is to further such unity as 
America grows more ethnically diverse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always wanted an administration that looks like  
America,'' Clinton said in closing. ``You've heard that a dozen 
times, I bet. More and more, America will look like you.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Showdown at Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their political loyalties Saturday in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away,'' Gore said as the two delivered  
late-night addresses before Democratic activists. Bradley, a former 
New Jersey senator, suggested Gore resorted to attacks because he 
lacked vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that someone is confident in their own vision of  
the future, they don't need to resort to the darts,'' Bradley said. 
``I think I can talk about the future in a way that's compelling 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bradley acknowledged Gore's challenge to debate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great pleasure to be with you on the same platform for  
the first time,'' Bradley told the vice president. ``I welcome many 
other times in the campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also warned there's a need to end campaign attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``It takes discipline to be positive,'' said Bradley. ``I  
believe to the deepest core of my being that the American people 
want that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance at the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner was  
the candidates' first joint meeting since Gore uprooted his 
campaign to Tennessee to counter Bradley's surge in polls. Since 
then, Gore has sought a scrappier, homespun image and he is more 
directly confronting Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sat in separate sections of a large hall where the  
fund-raiser was held, but both worked the room and met briefly, 
shaking hands and exchanging greetings.

	``I did not walk away from the fight when (former Speaker) Newt  
Gingrich took over the Congress. I did not walk away from the fight 
when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I did not walk 
away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit,'' Gore said at 
a news conference, implying that Bradley turned away from Democrats 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996, two years after Republicans won  
control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also reminded Iowans that Bradley had voted against popular  
ethanol subsidies and other farm issues important to the states 
with the first presidential caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he were calling Bradley a quitter, Gore demurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a word I'd use to describe him,'' he said. ``Others  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley rejected any suggestions of disloyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Democrat since I cast my first vote in  
1964,'' said Bradley, who has suggested that Gore's centrist 
politics undermine his claim to the Democratic mantle. ``I am 
simply not going to deal with the darts that are being thrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has the backing of much of the party's establishment,  
especially in Iowa, the race has tightened and gotten new 
attention. A poll last week showed Bradley within a dozen points of 
Gore in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was taking advantage of his institutional support at every  
turn as he prepared for Saturday's event. The hall where the two 
will speak was turned into a sea of Gore campaign signs, drawing a 
chuckle from Bradley, a former professional basketball star with 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little bit like going into Boston Garden in  
the seventh game,'' said Bradley. ``You never know, you could turn 
around some of the Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his poll standings have improved, Bradley worked hard to  
play down expectations for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question we are up against entrenched power,''  
said Bradley. ``I don't have high expectations. We have to do OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates were relishing a competitive race they said will  
serve the eventual nominee well against the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real opportunity for us, whichever one of us emerges  
from the primary to be stronger because of the competition,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates walked Democratic precincts before their  
addresses, adding a grass-roots touch to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Um, who are you?'' 7-year-old Robert Buell asked, tapping Gore  
on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Vice President Al Gore,'' the vice president said with a  
laugh. ``Who are you?''

<HEADLINE> Army Reviews Training School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has begun a review that could lead to  
changes at its soldier training school in Georgia long criticized 
for human rights abuses committed in Latin American by some 
graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would be foolish to continue to let this issue fester  
without taking some action to take it off the table,'' Army 
Secretary Louis Caldera said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior Army officials said options under consideration include  
moving the School of the Americas from Fort Benning near Columbus, 
Ga., changing its name, reconfiguring the mix of students, or 
altering course content. 
</P>
<P>
	The school will remain open, said Caldera, who thinks relocating  
is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	He is convinced the review will produce changes that will  
satisfy most of the school's critics without sacrificing its 
mission of promoting democracy in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those minority of people who have demagogued this  
issue who will never be happy,'' Caldera said. ``But I think they 
will lose their support once they see that reasonable people are 
pleased with the changes the Army is making.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera hopes to make a final decision on ways to restructure  
the school before Congress begins its session next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera maintains that criticism of the school, including  
allegations that instructors have taught torture techniques to 
Latin American soldiers, is ``completely unfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't teach torture to American soldiers and we don't teach  
torture to foreign soldiers and we never have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Caldera said annual funding battles on Capitol Hill have  
taken their toll on lawmakers who support the school but who ``do 
not want to be cast as being against human rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After a while they're looking at us and saying ... `Can you  
find a way so we don't have to keep going through this,''' Caldera 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer, the House voted 230-197 to eliminate the $2 million  
in training funds for the school, about 10 percent of its total 
budget. The money was restored in a House-Senate conference 
committee, but the vote marked the first time the Army has lost in 
five showdowns on the House floor since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The school long has been the target of religious activists upset  
that graduates were linked to the 1989 murders of six Jesuit 
priests and two women in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists, led by the Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a Maryknoll  
priest, have turned up evidence over the years implicating hundreds 
of other graduates of the school in other human rights abuses in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	The House vote energized the school's opponents, and Bourgeois  
predicts 10,000 people will attend the annual November protest at 
Fort Benning's main gate to mark the anniversary of the El Salvador 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going away,'' said Bourgeois. ``We're going to keep  
coming back to Washington and to the main gate of Fort Benning in 
greater and greater numbers every year until that school is shut 
down.''

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Stock Quotes Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock  
Exchange have postponed for a second time plans to extend the 
operation of their stock quote tickers to accommodate after-hours 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
	The tickers provide the stock price information that scrolls  
across the bottom of television screens and is distributed to 
millions of investors via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq on Friday set a new target date of Oct. 25, subject to  
approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A NYSE 
spokesman said the exchange hasn't set a date and is awaiting SEC 
approval of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two markets initially planned to extend their ticker hours  
on Oct. 4. The date was then pushed back to this coming Monday 
before the new postponement. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage industry had requested the latest delay, asking  
for more time to update its trading systems to process after-hours 
trades, Nasdaq said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The postponement will provide them an opportunity to make  
adjustments to their systems or modify their processes,'' said 
Nasdaq's chief operating officer, J. Patrick Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq plans to keep its system open until 6:30 p.m. Eastern  
time, and the NYSE until 6:35 p.m. Both systems currently stop 
distributing quotes at 5:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in after-hours trading sessions scattered across a  
number of different markets -- primarily on electronic 
communications systems, or ECNs -- has prompted calls for the 
extension of hours of centralized stock information systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nasdaq last month offered to extend the hours of its ticker to  
address that need. A week later, the NYSE agreed to extend its 
ticker hours following a request from the Chicago Stock Exchange, 
which trades NYSE listed stocks for regional customers and has 
applied to the SEC to keep its market open until 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE and Nasdaq are also planning extended sessions, but not  
until next year.

<HEADLINE> No. 24 BYU 38, California 28 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- It's a bruising and bitter tradeoff for Kevin  
Feterik. Two straight weeks he has thrown for four touchdowns, and 
two straight weeks he has taken a beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Feterik threw for 414 yards and spread his passes to nine  
receivers as No. 24 Brigham Young beat California 38-28 Saturday 
night, spoiling a return to Provo by Bears coach Tom Holmoe. 
</P>
<P>
	Feterik was hot and cold, helping the Cougars (4-1) build a 21-0  
lead with three TD passes through the second quarter. But he kept 
California (2-3) in the game with three interceptions, two that 
were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse for Feterik, he was flattened on almost every play. The  
California pass rush poured through a soft offensive line, 
reminiscent of the pounding Feterik had in last week's victory at 
Utah State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought last week was bad. Tonight was a nightmare,''  
Feterik said, sitting in the interview room with ice packs on both 
elbows and his left knee. ``I got hit pretty much every play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmoe said that was the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``We did a good job on defense,'' he said. ``We hit the  
quarterback a ton. We must have hit him 30 times, maybe more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmoe was a standout cornerback at BYU from 1980-82 who, after  
a seven-year NFL career with the San Francisco 49ers, returned to 
Provo as a graduate assistant from 1990-91 while pursuing a 
master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Holmoe spent several minutes chatting on the field with  
Cougars coach LaVell Edwards before the game, he didn't want to 
talk about his relationship with BYU afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus for me is on our team, not on me,'' Holmoe said.  
</P>
<P>
	Feterik was 25-of-41 for 414 yards and the Cougars outplayed  
Holmoe's young Bears, but BYU couldn't pull away until scoring two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 31-21 after Feterik rifled a pass to Jonathan Pittman,  
who eluded Cal's Drae Harris and raced 44 yards untouched for a 
touchdown. Freshman Luke Staley ran 7 yards for BYU's final score 
with 1:21 to play. 
</P>
<P>
	California freshman Kyle Boller, making his third start, added a  
55-yard TD pass to LaShaun Ward with 2 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears had trimmed the margin to 24-21 with 18 seconds  
remaining in the third quarter when Damian Marzett slipped through 
a line of BYU blockers, caught Feterik's screen pass and returned 
it 80 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal's first points came in the second quarter when Deltha O'Neal  
caught Feterik's underthrown wobbler and returned it 19 yards for a 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to throw it away,'' Feterik said. ``I probably  
set a record for most touchdowns by the other team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Feterik threw for four TDs with one interception as  
the Cougars beat Utah State. This time, he had three TDs and looked 
almost flawless as the Cougars built a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, Feterik was 9-of-10 for 191 yards while Boller  
was 1-of-10 for 5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cal's defenders kept coming at Feterik, sacking him five  
times in the first half and hitting him hard on the release at 
least twice as often. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really impressed with Cal's defensive line,'' BYU center  
Jimmy Richards said. ``They ran a lot of stunts, a lot of twists. I 
was a little disappointed that Kevin got hit so much, but truth is, 
we still scored 38 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After O'Neal's TD made it 21-7, the Cougars ran three plays and  
punted. O'Neal struck again, returning a punt 31 yards to BYU's 30. 
Five plays later, Joe Igber went off left tackle for an 11-yard TD, 
cutting the margin to 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a special, special player,'' Holmoe said of O'Neal. ``I  
wish we had three or four of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BYU seemed ready to score again just before halftime. Feterik  
drove the Cougars 62 yards to Cal's 18, but his soft pass into the 
end zone became O'Neal's second interception. 
</P>
<P>
	Igber rushed for 116 yards on 18 carries for the Bears, going 55  
yards on Cal's first play from scrimmage.

<HEADLINE> FBI Wanted To Reward Waco Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- FBI supervisors sought to reward agents  
running its deadly 1993 Waco siege, proposing medals and 
``substantial cash incentive awards'' for members of the bureau's 
elite Hostage Rescue Team, newly released internal documents show. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are silent on the outcome of the request to reward  
agents who fired tear gas into the Branch Davidians' home, manned 
sniper positions and drove tanks; and an FBI spokesman said Friday 
he was unaware whether awards were granted. 
</P>
<P>
	But former FBI deputy assistant director Danny Coulson, the  
founding commander of the HRT and one of the top officials 
overseeing the Waco operation, said neither medals nor bonuses were 
handed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't approved and they received nothing,'' Coulson said  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI documents were recently turned over to investigators  
probing the bureau's conduct during the 51-day Waco standoff. They 
show that an extensive effort was made to honor the agents' ``brave 
and selfless actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One 13-page memo recommended the entire Hostage Rescue Team for  
the FBI Shield of Bravery, with individual commendations for agents 
who left their tank during the siege's fiery end to save a Davidian 
woman caught in the burning building. 
</P>
<P>
	Another memo proposed financial rewards for the HRT agents to  
recognize ``their exceptional and exemplary individual efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Coulson: ``We tend to want to demonize every FBI agent who  
was there ... (but) the American public needs to remember that 
agents did risk their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's conduct at Waco has come under renewed scrutiny  
from Congress and a special counsel appointed by Attorney General 
Janet Reno in recent weeks with the FBI's belated admission that 
its agents fired potentially incendiary tear-gas canisters in the 
hours before flames consumed the Davidians' retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Sect leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died April 19,  
1993 in the final hours of the FBI siege. 
</P>
<P>
	The thousands of pages of internal documents already turned over  
to investigators offer the most detailed glimpse yet of the FBI's 
inner workings at Waco. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents are a mix of the serious and the mundane, covering  
the FBI's evolving final-day tactical plan and daily intelligence 
reports to a local hotel's invitation to federal agents for a free 
Easter Sunday brunch. 
</P>
<P>
	The records outline the evolution of the FBI's rules of  
engagement for the final assault, dictating under what conditions 
agents could use deadly force. Several proposals were drafted, 
three of which would have permitted agents to use deadly force 
against unarmed Branch Davidians if they approached ``friendly'' 
positions and failed to respond to agents' commands. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has long denied that its agents fired any shots during  
the siege, and bureau officials stressed Friday that the final 
rules of engagement did not permit deadly force against unarmed 
Davidians. The bureau's long-standing policy, which permits agents 
to use deadly force in self-defense or defense of another, applied 
on April 19, said FBI spokesman Tron Brekke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would not be unusual, during the deliberation process, to  
consider various options,'' Brekke said of the earlier drafts. 
On-scene commanders had been worried by reports that Davidians 
might come out with explosives strapped to their bodies, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings in the documents:  
</P>
<P>
	--On seven occasions, agents threw flash-bang devices at  
Davidians who were outdoors to force them back inside the building. 
Koresh lieutenant Steve Schneider was ``absolutely distraught over 
being flash-banged,'' one FBI negotiator wrote April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI tallied the number of phone conversations negotiators  
had with each Davidian, the average length of each call and total 
time spent on the phone. The most prolific talker was Schneider, 
who had 459 conversations with FBI agents lasting nearly 96 hours. 
Second was Koresh, with 117 conversations spanning nearly 61 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI considered, at least briefly, abandoning the site.  
Under the ``retrogress from Waco'' plan, the proposed manpower 
requirements to provide cover as the forces retreated included four 
helicopters, four fixed-wing aircraft and 106 SWAT agents. 
</P>
<P>
	--Westinghouse Corp. offered, at no cost, the use of an aircraft  
and crew with ``state-of-the-art'' radar and infrared technology 
that not even the military possessed, one handwritten note stated. 
</P>
<P>
	--The FBI kept tabs on ``right-wing'' sympathizers who flocked to  
Waco during the siege and monitored Internet traffic.

rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. ``I did not walk

Gore resorted to attacks because he lacked vision. ``To the extent 
that someone is confident in their own vision of the future, they

<HEADLINE> Population Expected To Hit 6 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A majority of the 370,000 children born this  
Tuesday will be poor. Half will be Asian. And in theory, one will 
be the planet's 6 billionth person. 
</P>
<P>
	Most experts greet this milestone with anxiety. In just 12  
years, they note, humans have increased their number by 1 billion. 
During the 20th century, the world's population has tripled. And by 
2100, ecologist David Pimentel of Cornell University warned in a 
recent paper, ``12 billion miserable humans will suffer a difficult 
life on Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates for population control call it ``Y6B.'' They warn that  
if humanity can't clamp a lid on the population explosion it will 
spell serious trouble -- war, famine, economic collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everybody agrees that Oct. 12 is a day for doom and  
gloom. Economist Stephen Moore of the Cato Institute, a libertarian 
think tank in Washington, D.C., considers it an occasion for 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an incredible thing that we have 6 billion people,''  
he says. ``It's a real tribute to human ingenuity and our ability 
to innovate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore was a student of economist Julian Simon, who died last  
year at the age of 65. Simon criticized warnings about population 
growth, arguing that technological innovation would progress fast 
enough to support the human race. To an extent, that is what has 
happened this century. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of these prophecies of doom have really proven to be  
false,'' Moore says. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the United Nations, a leading advocate for population  
control, has found reason for encouragement in recent population 
growth, because the boom is proof of increased agricultural 
production, decreased infant mortality and prolonged life 
expectancy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ``Green Revolution'' that increased food production so  
dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s appears to have reached its 
limit. Total agricultural yields have leveled off and per capita 
food production has actually been falling since 1983, Pimentel 
notes in the current issue of ``Environment, Development, and 
Sustainability.'' And there is little chance that genetically 
modified crops and other biotechnology will reinvigorate 
agricultural production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can hope, but actually if you look, biotechnology's been  
with us for the last 20 years,'' Pimentel says. ``To state it will 
turn the food situation around, the evidence is not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pimentel argues that the optimal world population in the year  
2100 is 2 billion. To reach that population level, people would 
have to reduce their fertility from the current level of 2.7 births 
per woman to 1.5, a highly unrealistic prospect. But if they did, 
he says, those 2 billion people could enjoy a standard of living 
comparable to that of the average European today. 
</P>
<P>
	An international agreement reached five years ago in Cairo  
pledges all nations to cooperate in trying to limit population 
growth by providing family planning services throughout the 
developing world. The United Nations credits similar efforts with 
decreasing the fertility rate in those countries from six births 
per woman in 1950 down to about three today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can say with some pride that fertility rates have fallen  
sharply,'' says William Ryan, editor of the annual United Nations 
State of World Population Report. ``Of course a lot depends on 
choices and actions that governments make, particularly over the 
next couple of decades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Developed countries, especially the United States, have been  
accused of failing to meet the commitments they made in Cairo. 
Developed countries contribute about $2 billion a year to 
population control, less than half the amount they signed up for in 
Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not providing these resources will guarantee that we can't  
make the progress we would otherwise make,'' Ryan says. 
</P>
<P>
	It is his agency, the United Nations Population Fund, that  
declared Tuesday the ``day of 6 billion,'' the official date that 
the world population surpasses that figure. But population 
statistics being what they are, nobody knows for certain which day 
the clock will turn over. U.S. Census Bureau figures put the date 
nearly three months ago, on July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Whether the globe's population has already passed 6  
billion or not, at the close of the 20th century there are really 
two demographic worlds. One is poor, young and growing. In 
countries like Uganda and Niger, the median age is 15 and the 
growth rate is fast enough to double the population in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The other demographic world is wealthy, old and shrinking. The  
median age in Italy and Japan is 40. And the population growth in 
those countries has fallen to zero or below. 
</P>
<P>
	``Europe is a demographic catastrophe,'' says Moore, of the Cato  
Institute. ``If you take that trend out 500 years you're going to 
have eight Italians and three Irish on the face of the Earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Closer to the present, the United Nations projects that in 2050  
a quarter of the developed world will be older than 65. That is a 
higher proportion of retirement-age people than Florida has today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics will change. Environment will change,'' says Joseph  
Chamie, director of the United Nations Population Division. 
``Automobiles, consumption, clothing, living arrangements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As one world grows old, the other will grow up -- and have more  
children. There are about 1 billion teenagers living today, mostly 
in the Third World. Even though fertility rates are expected to 
keep falling, the simple fact that so many people will reach 
adulthood in the coming decades will boost population by another 
several billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if all those couples had only two children, population  
would continue to grow for another 40 years or so,'' Ryan says. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, that growing population faces enormous  
obstacles. In some parts of Africa, one adult in four is HIV 
positive. Worldwide, 8 percent of the population lives in a place 
without enough water. By 2050, a quarter of the world will have 
less water than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some experts believe the wars in the Middle East in the 21st  
century will be over access to drinking water,'' says Brian Dixon, 
director of government relations for Zero Population Growth, a 
Washington, D.C., advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
	Global warming and other environmental factors may also cause  
problems. If current estimates are correct, sea level will rise as 
much as 3 feet over the next century, displacing 72 million people 
in China and 71 million in Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem almost too much to handle -- the disease, the  
limited resources, the environmental threats -- but even the man who 
would like to see a world population one-third its present size is 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we can't make land and we can't make water, but I  
think we can turn things around,'' says Pimentel. ``I have great 
faith in human nature.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Winona Ryder's devotion to filming the  
best-selling memoirs of a young woman's life in a mental 
institution is deeply personal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a time, when I was 19, when I really, really thought  
I was going crazy,'' Ryder says in the November issue of US 
magazine. ``I was exhausted and going through a terrible 
depression. I had had panic attacks since I was 12.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old actress says she just snapped when her young  
neighbor Polly Klaas was murdered, and checked herself into ``a 
home for the crazies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would walk down the halls at night, and I'd see other people  
doing the same thing. We'd look at each other, like, 'Oh, hi. You, 
too?' ... I left after a few days and found a doctor and did 
intensive therapy for a year. Then I just made a choice to have a 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same choice facing her character in ``Girl,  
Interrupted,'' Ryder's producing debut, due out in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that it can offer something to other kids. Maybe if  
they think they're crazy, at least they'll know they're not 
alone.''

<HEADLINE> Delta Sells Stock in SAirGroup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines has sold its 525,000 shares of  
stock in SAirGroup, the parent company of Swissair. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction will result in a before-tax gain of about $29  
million and cash proceeds of about $114 million, the Atlanta-based 
airlines said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's shares in SAirGroup amounted to about a 5 percent stake  
in the Swiss company. Delta had held the stock since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Delta sold its 35.2 million shares of Singapore  
Airlines stock and repurchased 5 million shares of Delta stock held 
by Singapore. That sale came after Swissair pulled out of a 
three-way alliance with Delta and Singapore and sold its 8 million 
shares of Singapore stock.

<HEADLINE> Fusion 2, Rapids 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Eric Wynalda and Welton scored in a  
three-minute span in the second half Saturday night as the Miami 
Fusion secured an MLS playoff berth with a 2-0 victory over the 
Colorado Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami and New England entered the match, their regular season  
finale, separated by one point in the race for the fourth and final 
Eastern Conference playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion (13-19, 29 points) kept the one-point advantage with  
its victory, making the shootout victory by the Revolution (12-20, 
26) over D.C. United meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado (20-12, 38 points) had clinched a playoff bid in the  
Western Conference, but its place won't be determined until Dallas 
(18-13, 48 points) and defending champion Chicago (17-14, 47 
points) close their regular seasons Sunday at Tampa Bay and 
Columbus, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion took advantage of the quick goals to secure  
consecutive playoff appearances in the franchise's two seasons in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda gave the Fusion a 1-0 lead in the 49th minute, scoring  
his second goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's Henry Gutierrez centered a pass from the left wing which  
Colorado defender Marcelo Balboa cleared -- but to an open Wynalda. 
Wynalda blasted a left-footed shot into the upper left hand corner 
of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Three minutes later, Welton scored his eighth goal of the season  
when he reached a ball that Colorado goalkeeper Ian Feur came out 
to play. Welton got past Feur and successfully converted on an 
uncontested shot just inside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
	Fusion goalkeeper Jeff Cassar had three saves to record his  
third shutout of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, which finished the season with convincing home victories  
over Colorado and Columbus, will play at D.C. United next Saturday 
night in the best-of-3, first-round playoff series opener.

<HEADLINE> Gateway Recalls Foam `Stress' Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer manufacturer Gateway Inc. is  
recalling about 1 million foam rubber ``stress'' cows due to 
choking hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway has received three reports about pieces of the foam  
tearing away, posing a serious choking hazard to young children, 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	The foam cows are white with black spots, 4 1/2 inches long and 3  
inches high. The cow is supposed to relieve stress when squeezed 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gateway logo rubber cow was a giveaway with a computer  
purchase from September 1997 to September 1999. A few were sold for 
about $4 during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends that customers throw away the cow, or  
visit any Gateway store for an exchange. For more information, 
customers should call 1-877-206-4889.

<HEADLINE> Telecoms Elite Holding Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- MCI WorldCom's announcement of its plans for the  
largest corporate takeover has set the stage for the biggest-ever 
gathering of the top brass in the world's telecommunications and 
computer industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of companies are expected to reveal their latest  
inventions, adding fuel to the already booming markets in mobile 
telephones, satellite services and Internet links. 
</P>
<P>
	And analysts will be watching the U.N.-sponsored Telecom 99  
closely for any new announcements of major corporate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-day exhibition and forum, an event held every four  
years, opens today but will be closed to the public until the final 
two days -- Oct. 16-17. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition covers 1 million square feet of the sprawling  
Palexpo convention center at Geneva's international airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the products are mostly being kept secret until the  
show to retain the element of surprise, they are expected to 
include features that will make mobile phones more versatile. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. officials say they expect the show will also demonstrate  
that the line has been further blurred between fixed and cellular 
phones, with cordless phones that become mobiles and cellular 
phones that hook into a fixed-line network. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth of the Internet has shifted the emphasis on what is  
handled on networks. Some new networks stress moving packets of 
data and handle traditional voice conversations only as a sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	The equipment and services to be demonstrated are expected to  
foreshadow a further explosion in commerce over the Internet. New 
security features and encryption are likely, as well as new methods 
of compression to speed up the handling of data. 
</P>
<P>
	The speakers list reads like a Who's Who of information  
technology, including the head of Microsoft -- Bill Gates, Louis 
Gerstner of IBM, Michael Capellas of Compaq, Carly Fiorina of 
Hewlett-Packard, Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems and Larry 
Ellison of Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Also speaking will be Michael Armstrong of AT&AMP;T, Jun-ichiro  
Miyazu of NTT, Ron Sommer of Deutsche Telekom, Michel Bon of France 
Telecom and the heads of Nokia, Ericsson and Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard,  
who has already raised doubts about MCI's proposed $115 billion 
deal with Sprint, is expected to send a deputy, but key regulators 
from other countries will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Communications and industry ministers will be attending from  
China, Canada, Brazil, Kenya and other countries.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Attack Bush's Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Conservative candidates vying for the  
Republican presidential nomination criticized front-runner George 
W. Bush on Saturday for ``beating up on the conservatives'' and 
distancing himself from core GOP values. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern with Mr. Bush is what he's saying out there on the  
campaign trail,'' Pat Buchanan told about 1,000 people at the 
National Federation of Republican Assemblies convention. ``He's 
been beating up on the conservatives. He's been pandering to the 
media by beating up on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and fellow conservatives Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and  
Alan Keyes preached tax reform, anti-abortion policy and family 
values to members of the public and 320 convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	A non-binding straw poll was won by Forbes, who received 380 of  
829 votes, or 45.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely delighted,'' Forbes said. ``I think it shows  
conservatives are rallying to my candidacy. This is going to become 
a race similar to 1980, where the conservatives fought the 
outsiders. The outsiders won in '80, and we're going do it again 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan came in second with 172 votes, or 20.8 percent,  
followed by Keyes with 149 votes and Bauer with 86 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA, founded in 1996, is a grass-roots conservative  
organization that bills itself as ``the Republican wing of the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the event, each candidate mentioned the Texas governor  
directly, criticizing Bush's stance on big government and his 
reluctance to require that all judge appointees oppose abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who skipped the convention along with GOP hopefuls John  
McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Orrin Hatch, received 35 votes. McCain 
and Dole received three each, and Hatch none. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said earlier in the week that Republicans were too often  
pessimistic and confused limited government with ``a disdain for 
government itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This governor in Texas is the pessimist in the race. He is  
running as a Bush Republican and I will proudly run as a Reagan 
Republican,'' Bauer said to a chorus of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer called Bush's comments ``a surrender'' to expansive  
government and a departure from conservative values. 
</P>
<P>
	``That obviously hit nerves with the Republican Party. Those are  
two issues that Republicans care a great deal about,'' he said. 
``If the governor keeps making speeches like that it's going to 
guarantee that we're going to have an open race that's going to go 
all the way to the convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spent Saturday in Springfield, Mo., at a fund-raiser and  
cookout for Republican Rep. Roy Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Forbes, Bauer and Sen. Hatch traveled to Des  
Moines, Iowa, to stress their anti-abortion credentials before a 
gathering of the Iowa Right to Life convention. 
</P>
<P>
	All told the audience of about 250 that they would never abandon  
social issues such as abortion and euthanasia, and Forbes and Bauer 
said they would appoint only judges opposed to abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took a  
measured swipe at Bush's father, former President Bush, for his 
judicial appointments. ``To be honest with you, the most liberal 
pro-abortion judge on the Supreme Court was appointed by our last 
Republican president,'' he said in a reference to Justice David 
Souter. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kansas City convention, demands for comprehensive tax  
reform and anti-abortion Supreme Court justices drew wild cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, while pushing his proposed 17 percent flat tax, called  
for elimination of all individual taxes such as estate taxes, or as 
he put it, ``taxation without respiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes equated the tax reform movement to fighting slavery, and  
called for the abolition of the personal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people go out and work for the money, the people ought to  
be the ones in control of the management of that money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan both entered and left the stage to a chanting chorus of  
``stay, Pat, stay.'' Earlier this week, Buchanan said he was 
``leaning toward'' leaving the Republican Party to seek the Reform 
Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made no mention of the Reform Party during his  
20-minute speech. He canceled a news conference scheduled by the 
NFRA. His political director, Tim Haley, said Buchanan had been ill 
and had never promised to meet with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA delegates from 33 states will vote Sunday afternoon on  
one candidate the organization can back for the Republican 
presidential nomination. All candidates are on the ballot, and the 
group's bylaws require a two-thirds majority to earn NFRA backing.

<HEADLINE> McCain Book Topping the Charts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has yet to make a big  
dent in presidential preference polls, but he has approached the 
summit of literary success. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's family memoir, ``Faith of my Fathers,'' which he wrote  
with longtime assistant Mark Salter, topped the Los Angeles Times 
best sellers list for non-fiction and peaked at No. 2 on the New 
York Times, Chicago Tribune and Amazon.com lists. Each list tracks 
sales at different bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm overjoyed,'' McCain said of the results. ``The goal of  
this book was to have some young American pick it up and be 
inspired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book describes the Navy careers of McCain's father and  
grandfather -- the first father and son to reach the rank of 
four-star admiral -- and McCain's own military service, particularly 
the 5 1/2 years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fathers'' has shown some staying power. It is in its fourth  
week on the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is interesting is how long it's doing this well,'' said  
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of the trade magazine Publishers 
Weekly. ``Most major political books get on the list, few of them 
stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
briefly reached No. 10 on the Publishers Weekly list in 1996 with 
``Time Present, Times Past.'' The memoir was published as Bradley 
was preparing to retire from the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many campaign tomes quickly end up on bargain racks.  
</P>
<P>
	During its first release in 1996, ``Unlimited Partners'' written  
by then-candidate Bob Dole and now-candidate Elizabeth Dole sold 
about 200,000 copies -- only one-third of the first printing -- 
according to Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, presidential candidates are quick to put pen to paper.  
</P>
<P>
	There's Pat Buchanan's ``A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming  
America's Destiny;'' Steve Forbes' ``A New Birth of Freedom;'' Alan 
Keyes' ``Our Character, Our Future: Reclaiming America's Moral 
Destiny;'' and from former candidate and ex-Vice President Dan 
Quayle ``Worth Fighting For.'' Additionally, GOP front-runner 
George W. Bush is considering writing a book of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the candidates hope sharing their stories will  
improve their chances at election time. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Fathers'' may help McCain's candidacy, there is no  
question his campaign is helping book sales, said Steve Wasserman, 
book editor for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best salesman on behalf of a book is the author himself,''  
Wasserman said. McCain is touring the country non-stop and people 
are interested in learning more about him, he said.

<HEADLINE> Computers Track Gov't Money at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Treasury Department officials say they've  
moved to correct security problems and other weaknesses that 
congressional auditors found in computer systems handling the 
government's financial transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billions of dollars of payments and collections are at  
significant risk of loss or fraud, vast amounts of sensitive data 
are at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical 
computer-based operations are vulnerable to serious disruptions,'' 
the General Accounting Office said in a report this week. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an annual review, the GAO examined operations at the  
seven main data processing centers of Treasury's Financial 
Management Service from August 1998 to February 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	FMS spokeswoman Connie Craig said the agency has made  
significant improvements to its computer systems since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that we're in much better shape than is reflected in  
the report,'' Craig said Friday. ``It isn't reflecting current 
reality. We have taken a lot of steps to correct the weaknesses 
identified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FMS acts as the government's accountant, disburser and  
collections agency, working with the Federal Reserve and about 
11,000 financial institutions to carry out these duties. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, it oversaw $1.6 trillion in payments and $1.7 trillion  
in collections, including Social Security and veterans checks, 
income taxes and refunds, federal employees' salaries, customs 
duties and fines. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also keeps the balance sheets used by Congress and  
the executive branch to make decisions about the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Among weaknesses the auditors found at some or all of the FMS'  
main data centers: 
</P>
<P>
	--Inadequate security to control physical entry to the premises  
of data centers and the computer equipment and tape libraries they 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lax control over user IDs and passwords that allow access to  
sensitive computer records. 
</P>
<P>
	--Outdated or inaccurate data.  
</P>
<P>
	The GAO said 14 of 20 major problems identified in the previous  
year's audit had been corrected, and that the FMS was working on 
other improvements. However, it said auditors had identified new 
problems.

summit of literary success. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's family memoir, ``Faith of my Fathers,'' which he wrote  
with longtime assistant Mark Salter, topped the Los Angeles Times 
best sellers list for non-fiction and peaked at No. 2 on the New 
York Times, Chicago Tribune and Amazon.com lists. Each list tracks 
sales at different bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm overjoyed,'' McCain said of the results. ``The goal of  
this book was to have some young American pick it up and be 
inspired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book describes the Navy careers of McCain's father and  
grandfather -- the first father and son to reach the rank of 
four-star admiral -- and McCain's own military service, particularly 
the 5 1/2 years he spent as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fathers'' has shown some staying power. It is in its fourth  
week on the best-seller lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is interesting is how long it's doing this well,'' said  
Daisy Maryles, executive editor of the trade magazine Publishers 
Weekly. ``Most major political books get on the list, few of them 
stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
briefly reached No. 10 on the Publishers Weekly list in 1996 with 
``Time Present, Times Past.'' The memoir was published as Bradley 
was preparing to retire from the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Many campaign tomes quickly end up on bargain racks.  
</P>
<P>
	During its first release in 1996, ``Unlimited Partners'' written  
by then-candidate Bob Dole and now-candidate Elizabeth Dole sold 
about 200,000 copies -- only one-third of the first printing -- 
according to Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, presidential candidates are quick to put pen to paper.  
</P>
<P>
	There's Pat Buchanan's ``A Republic, Not an Empire: Reclaiming  
America's Destiny;'' Steve Forbes' ``A New Birth of Freedom;'' Alan 
Keyes' ``Our Character, Our Future: Reclaiming America's Moral 
Destiny;'' and from former candidate and ex-Vice President Dan 
Quayle ``Worth Fighting For.'' Additionally, GOP front-runner 
George W. Bush is considering writing a book of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the candidates hope sharing their stories will  
improve their chances at election time. 
</P>
<P>
	While ``Fathers'' may help McCain's candidacy, there is no  
question his campaign is helping book sales, said Steve Wasserman, 
book editor for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best salesman on behalf of a book is the author himself,''  
Wasserman said. McCain is touring the country non-stop and people 
are interested in learning more about him, he said.

<HEADLINE> Auction Has Simple Elvis Objects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The rather ordinary-looking television antenna  
was never meant to be sold, but when organizers of the Elvis 
Presley auction found it backstage they decided to put it on the 
block anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The King's 8-foot, Christmas tree-shaped antenna, which was  
shipped by accident along with other items selected to weed out the 
collection at Graceland, sold Saturday for $1,725. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real piece of Graceland, not just some document,'' Sue  
Fergerstrom of Springfield, Mo., said, laughing. ``And when he 
tries to contact me, I'll have better reception.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-day auction of thousands of Presley's belongings at  
the MGM Grand Hotel lasts until Sunday evening. It made its $1.4 
million fund-raising target Friday for a transitional housing 
project for homeless families in Memphis, said David Beckwith, a 
spokesman for Elvis Presley Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials will decide later how to use the remaining money, he  
said, and will probably give it to local charities or use it to 
build more exhibit space. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidders showed the greatest interest in things The King used and  
owned, while documents -- like Presley's first RCA contract -- 
produced disappointing bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items at Saturday's auction, all dating from the 1960s,  
included a battery-operated Hamilton wristwatch that Presley owned, 
which went for $36,875; a rocking chair, which went for $19,550; 
and a plain humidor with a brass plaque, which went for $28,750.

<HEADLINE> Johnson's Season Ends Inside Dugout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Randy Johnson could only watch from the dugout  
as the Arizona Diamondbacks' season came to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Buck Showalter's decision to save his biggest gun for a  
fifth game backfired as the Diamondbacks lost Game 4 to the New 
York Mets 4-3 in 10 innings and were eliminated in a game Brian 
Anderson started. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see how Randy could have pitched any better than Brian  
Anderson did,'' Showalter said of Anderson, who allowed two runs in 
seven innings. ``We felt it was our best option and we are 
comfortable with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson ended this season the way the AL's most dominating  
starter went out last season. Boston's Pedro Martinez also watched 
Game 4 against Cleveland in 1998, as Pete Schourek started and the 
Red Sox were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course I wanted to pitch,'' Johnson said. ``But I had my  
turn, and I had to wait for my next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Arizona's $52.4 million ace, was 5-2 with a 2.55 ERA on  
three days' rest over the last six seasons. One of those wins came 
in the first round of the 1995 playoffs, when Johnson beat 
Showalter and the Yankees in the third game, leading Seattle into 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	But he hadn't pitched on three days' rest since 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know everyone is kind of reaching back for 1995,'' Showalter  
said. ``Randy is older and ... who we have pitching today compared 
to who they had at that point back then, there is a lot of 
differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Playing into Showalter's decision is what happened to Johnson  
after the Mariners overused him down the stretch in 1995. Johnson 
missed nearly all of 1996 with a back injury and the Diamondbacks 
weren't willing to risk their biggest investment to win a 
first-round series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea here is not just to get through one round, but  
to be able to get through all of them,'' Showalter said. ``It is a 
real juggling act because you want to stay as strong as possible 
because what does it mean to win this series if you can't win the 
next one too?'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the core of this team expected to stay intact, Johnson said  
it won't be too long until that next postseason begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the talent we have on this team, no question we will be  
back,'' he said. ``It's not going out on a limb with the players, 
the leadership, the coaches and the ownership we have, that we'll 
be back in the playoffs again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that pitching Johnson would have guaranteed anything. He had  
lost his last six postseason decisions -- a major league record -- 
and was shelled for seven runs in eight-plus innings in a 138-pitch 
outing in Game 1 Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite that, the Mets sure weren't eager to face him again.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking over our shoulder at Randy Johnson,'' Mets  
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``If they say they weren't, I don't 
think they would be telling the truth.''

	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Faith Gallo, who was publisher of Pittsburgh  
Magazine and several other regional publications, died Friday 
following a five-year battle with leukemia. She was 62. 
</P>
<P>

including Richmond Lifestyle, Commonwealth Magazine and Carolina 
Lifestyle, before coming to Pittsburgh in 1984 as publisher of PBS 
station WQED's Pittsburgh Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	When she left the magazine in 1989, she moved briefly to Detroit  
to become the publisher of Detroit Monthly. She returned to 
Pittsburgh to serve as the director of the city's Parks and 
Recreation Department, a communications consultant and, most 
recently, a consultant to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy.

	ORONO, Minn. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings chairman John  
Skoglund has died of lung cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	Skoglund died Friday at his home in Orono. He was chairman of  
the Vikings' board until the team was sold last year to Red 
McCombs. His father, insurance mogul H.P. Skoglund, was one of the 
original owners of the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman, John Skoglund stayed out of the limelight. He said  
earlier this year that the satisfaction of owning part of the 
Vikings was enough for him.

<HEADLINE> Russian Air Force Shells Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- The Russian air force attacked  
suspected rebel bases and training centers in Chechnya, and seven 
Russian soldiers were killed in ground clashes, news reports said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian artillery shelled targets in Chechnya as federal troops  
continued to fortify their positions in the northern third of the 
breakaway republic, the Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Russian soldiers were killed and 37 were wounded in the  
latest fighting to establish a security zone in Chechnya, a Defense 
Ministry spokesman said, according to Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry's press service said 50 Islamic militants were  
killed in the clashes, which wiped out a rebel base near the 
village of Naurskaya, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Russian outpost on the border between Chechnya and Dagestan  
came under automatic weapons fire during the night from separatist 
bases inside Chechnya, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. There 
were no reports of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian ground forces invaded Chechnya two weeks ago. They want  
to establish a security zone there to prevent Muslim separatists 
from attacking neighboring regions in southern Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had accused Russia on Friday of violating the  
Conventional Forces in Europe agreement, which limits the number of 
tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft and other non-nuclear arms in 
Europe and sets specific ceilings for particular regions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said today that Russia  
had notified the West about its military deployment in the Caucasus 
region and that a temporary buildup was within the treaty's 
framework. 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of a temporary deployment of forces is  
provided for,'' Ivanov said. ``Here we are not committing any 
violations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says Moscow cannot claim its deployment is temporary,  
since it has long violated higher weapon ceilings for southern 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Militants twice invaded Dagestan this summer, and are blamed by  
Moscow for a series of September apartment explosions in Russia 
that killed about 300 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, refugees continued to flood from Chechnya into  
neighboring Ingushetia. About 142,000 people have fled the region 
so far, Interfax reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingush President Ruslan Aushev told Interfax that food, tents  
and other vital supplies to take care of the refugees were in short 
supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation is a humanitarian catastrophe for us,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> India Aviation Finishes Y2K Upgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India's civil aviation industry has  
upgraded its equipment and trained pilots and engineers to make 
sure computers don't go haywire on New Year's Day, an official said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are Y2K compliant. We have taken all precautions. We're not  
taking chances on anything,'' said P.V. Jayakrishnan, the top 
bureaucrat at the Civil Aviation Ministry, which controls all 
aviation activity in India. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,200 aircraft operate in Indian airspace every day, half  
of them landing or taking off from its airports, with a total of 
70,000 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K fears stem from computers that use only two digits to  
represent the year, meaning they could read 2000 as 1900 and 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Early last year, the government ordered its civilian and  
military airports to implement the changes required under 
international air safety rules, Jayakrishnan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the changes, the economics of international air travel  
can go awry if India is not Y2K compliant, especially since India 
is strategically located for civil aviation purposes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said all the systems have been tested and found  
satisfactory in tests conducted both by Indian and foreign 
agencies.

	Clinton Urges Nuclear Test Ban  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton said today a ban on nuclear  
testing is more important now than when President Eisenhower 
proposed it more than 40 years ago. He again urged the Senate to 
delay a treaty vote that means certain defeat for his 
administration. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would impose a 
blanket international ban on all nuclear test explosions. Clinton 
said the treaty, also signed by 153 other countries, is America's 
best chance at nuclear security for the future. ``Every year, the 
threat grows that nuclear weapons will spread,'' Clinton said.

	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops backed by tanks and  
artillery captured a strategic town in Chechnya Saturday after 
heavy fighting, while Moscow denied that it was breaking an 
international arms treaty by boosting its forces in the breakaway 
republic. Russian troops seized a town in the west of the mountain 
republic, but were repelled by Chechen fighters when they tried to 
advance, Chechen commander Hamzat Gilayev told The Associated 
Press. Moscow has said it wants to establish a security zone to 
prevent Islamic militants from attacking regions in southern 
Russia.

	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Bracing for a rival's onslaught, George  
W. Bush's political team has produced and tested a huge package of 
potential campaign advertisements -- including several designed to 
look like attack ads he could face. In focus groups conducted by 
the Bush team, the simulated attacks from wealthy publisher Steve 
Forbes did not hurt the Texas governor's standing when coupled with 
a Bush ad responding to the criticism, said knowledgeable officials 
close to the Bush campaign.

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their party loyalties today in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. ``I did not walk 
away,'' the vice president said as the pair prepared for late-night 
addresses before Democratic activists. Bradley, a former New Jersey 
senator, suggested Gore resorted to attacks because he lacked 
vision.

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor  
Co. reached a tentative agreement today on a new contract, hours

deadline passed. A joint statement announcing the deal contained no 
details. A source close to the talks said the agreement followed 
the pattern set by the UAW in deals with General Motors Corp. and 
DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year agreements with raises of 3 percent

	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for the parents of a student killed at  
Columbine High School said today he plans to expand the family's 
wrongful death lawsuit to include at least one gun manufacturer. 
Geoffrey Fieger said Florida-based Navegar and a subsidiary, 
Intratec, which made the TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol used during 
the April 20 attack, used marketing strategies designed to make the 
weapon attractive to criminals. Fieger represents Michael and Vonda 
Shoels, whose son Isaiah was among 12 students killed by teen-age 
gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.

	Clinton Chides GOP on Minority Judges  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- President Clinton accused the Republican-led  
Senate of ignoring minority nominees to the federal bench for 
partisan gain, and told Hispanic leaders today that America 
increasingly will ``look like you.'' Clinton said his 
administration has exceeded all others in appointing Hispanic 
judges. But he said too many nominees are languishing in the 
Senate, waiting for approval. ``I am deeply dissatisfied with the 
Senate's partisan handling of some of my minority nominees,'' 
Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> No. 5 Va. Tech 58, Rutgers 20 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PISCATAWAY, N.J. (AP) -- Michael Vick threw four touchdown passes  
and ran for another in a record-setting performance and No. 5 
Virginia Tech scored TDs on seven of its eight first-half 
possessions in defeating winless Rutgers 58-20 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The win marked the second straight year that Virginia Tech (5-0,  
1-0 Big East) has opened the second with five straight wins, and it 
set up an interesting matchup next weekend with No. 18 Syracuse 
(5-1) at Blacksburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	This marks the second time in three years Rutgers (0-5, 0-2) has  
opened the season with five straight losses under coach Terry Shea. 
The 58 points were the most given up at Rutgers Stadium by the 
Scarlet Knights since the last time the Hokies were here, winning 
59-19 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lopsided score, the game was tied 14-14 after the  
first quarter before Virginia Tech scored 35 unanswered points in 
the second quarter to take command. 
</P>
<P>
	Vick threw a 74-yard scoring pass to a wide-open Andre Davis on  
the opening play from scrimmage. Vick also hit Davis on a 13-yard 
TD to ignite the big second quarter that featured TD passes of 36 
and 5 yards to Ricky Hall, a 2-yard TD run by Shyrone Stith and 
Vick's own 22-yard TD run. 
</P>
<P>
	The four touchdown passes in a half set a school record, while  
the total equalled Virginia Tech's record for a game set previously 
by Don Strock and Maurice DeShazo. 
</P>
<P>
	Vick, who rushd for 68 yards and had 316 yards in total offense,  
broke a Big East Conference record for accuracy hitting 11 of 12 
passes for 248 yards. It broke the old record of 10 of 11 set by 
Rutgers' Ray Lucas in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last two games, Vick has completed 18 of 21 passes for  
470 yards and five touchdowns.

<P>
	After Vick's bomb to a streaking Davis on the opening play,

	The 14-14 tie marked the first time this season Virginia Tech  
had not led after the first quarter. That seemed to annoy the

<HEADLINE> Americans Working Longer Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Vittorio Giulini manages three clothing  
factories, oversees 300 employees and leads a national trade group 
of fashion manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	An American executive with similar duties might expect to work  
60 hours a week, plus a frequent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so Giulini, of Liola SpA in Milan. He arrives at his office  
at a civilized 9:30 a.m. and knocks off no later than 6:30 p.m. And 
he limits his work week to five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Saturday and Sunday?'' he asks in disbelief. ``Never.''  
</P>
<P>
	Few Americans flinch at working overtime if it means a bigger  
paycheck. And those striving to build more prosperous lives 
willingly endure long hours and short vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	But millions of Europeans share Giulini's unwillingness to  
forfeit free time, even if it means missing out on an economic boom 
like the one that has enriched so many Americans this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, dinner each day with the family and a month on the  
Mediterranean each summer are part of a lifestyle too precious to 
sacrifice for the mixed rewards of U.S.-style capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think industry suffers from that. In the end, you've  
got people who are content and happy in life and do their jobs 
properly when they're at work,'' says Roxanne Suratgar, a market 
analyst for the Italian oil engineering company Snamprogetti. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the World Bank, the United States had an average  
per capita gross national product of $29,080 in 1997, the most 
recent year for which data is available. 
</P>
<P>
	The richest of Europe's biggest economies was France, with an  
average per capita GNP of $22,210, followed in descending order by 
Germany, Britain and Italy. These data were adjusted for 
differences in exchange rates to compare actual purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent study suggests, however, that a major reason for the  
higher U.S. income level is simply that Americans work longer hours 
than Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans averaged 1,966 hours of work in 1997, according to the  
International Labor Organization, a U.N. agency based in Geneva. 
That's 235 hours more than the British, the hardest-working 
Europeans, and 310 hours, or nearly 39 working days, more than the 
French. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, Europe is closing its productivity gap with the  
United States even as most Europeans put in fewer hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, businesses are beginning to cut their work weeks to  
35 hours in response to a new law introduced by the Socialist-led 
government. Americans, by contrast, worked almost three days more 
in 1997 than in 1990, the ILO said. 
</P>
<P>
	These findings suggest that while Americans may own more cars  
and bigger homes, they have less time to enjoy them. So, who's 
really richer? 
</P>
<P>
	Giulini doesn't hesitate to answer: Europe.  
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of life is higher,'' he says, ``but it's not  
because we are better than Americans. It's because we have 1,000 
years of culture behind us. You can't put a price on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics might dismiss rustic villas and Roman ruins as lifeless  
scenery best suited for postcards. But Italy's teeming cafes and 
entrepreneurs give the place a very contemporary buzz. 
</P>
<P>
	Work habits in Britain are somewhat closer to those of the  
United States, especially in internationally competitive industries 
like banking. Bankers and lawyers in central London's financial 
district work as late into the night as their counterparts on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, professionals in Milan, Italy's commercial hub, are  
usually heading home by 6 or 6:30 p.m., says Suratgar, the market 
analyst, a Briton who has lived in Italy for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In much of Europe, citizens accept relatively high taxes in  
exchange for governments that provide vibrant cities, first-rate 
public transportation, free universities and bountiful social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Cafe owner Lena Munther of Stockholm, Sweden, is no better off  
financially than she was at the start of the decade. But the 
Swedish government has helped by easing her burden as the mother of 
a son with a hearing disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Her son Theo, now 20, received special instruction from  
kindergarten through high school, and the government paid for 
soundproof insulation in their home to make it easier for Theo to 
use his hearing aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``All such things were free. I wouldn't have been able to afford  
that if we hadn't had the social system that we have in Sweden,'' 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to state benefits, European employees generally  
enjoy more job security than workers in the United States. And, 
according to an American executive in Berlin, nonmanagerial staff 
in parts of Europe tend to be better educated and more efficient 
than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The American, Cary Bruce, is a managing director of Artemedia  
AG, a public relations firm that specializes in virtual reality 
modeling. He has one other observation: 
</P>
<P>
	``This idea that Europeans pack up and go home is more of a myth  
than a reality. Yes, it happens here, but it happens in the U.S., 
too.''

<HEADLINE>  Rangers Seem Psyched Out By Yankees  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Watching from home last October, Rafael  
Palmeiro couldn't understand how a power-hitting team like the 
Texas Rangers could score just one run in three playoff games 
against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmeiro has figured it out this October, now that he's part of  
a Rangers lineup that has scored just one run in two playoff games 
against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you think about the hype, the pressure, not scoring runs  
-- then you come to the plate and everything is so huge,'' Palmeiro 
said, spreading his arms wide and leaning back as if he'd been 
shoved. ``Everyone wants to win and is trying to do their best. But 
you can't because there's a big gorilla on your back and it's 
getting heavier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees will try to wrap up the best-of-5 AL divisional  
series tonight at The Ballpark. Should the Rangers win, Game 4 
would be Sunday in Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has won eight straight playoff games against Texas  
since losing the first meeting in 1996. The Rangers have scored two 
runs in their last 52 postseason innings against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is getting on Texas for not scoring runs, but  
they're playing a pretty good team and facing a pretty tough 
pitching staff,'' New York first baseman Tino Martinez said. ``I 
think it's more of a matter of us playing well than them choking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Clemens will try to continue the Yankees' run of great  
pitching and move closer to his goal of a World Series 
championship. It's about the only thing missing from his Hall of 
Fame-caliber career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've pretty much accomplished just about anything you would  
want to accomplish in 16 years of doing this,'' said Clemens, a 
five-time Cy Young winner. ``You sit there selfishly saying that, 
but that's the only way you can look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas starter Esteban Loaiza, the last Rangers pitcher to beat  
the Yankees, will make his first playoff start. It'll be the 10th 
of Clemens' career, but his first in four years. He's looking for 
his first postseason win since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens is coming off a poor season by his standards: 14-10 with  
a career-high 4.60 ERA. He was 1-1 with a 4.96 ERA against the 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	New York manager Joe Torre set his rotation so Clemens and David  
Cone, another former Cy Young winner, would pitch on the road. That 
also meant Clemens would get to start before family and friends in 
his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching in New York, I might not have had the opportunity for  
a lot of my siblings to see it live. As we speak, they're en 
route,'' Clemens said Friday afternoon. ``I've also got some 
college teammates who are going to be in the area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees might not be the same juggernaut that won 114  
regular-season games in 1998, but a victory tonight would put them 
on the same championship pace as their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers are the victims of bad timing.  
</P>
<P>
	Their three best seasons have come in the last four years, each  
setting up a first-round playoff matchup with New York. The Yankees 
went on to win the World Series the first two times. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's part of the problem,'' Palmeiro said. ``They're the  
best team in baseball over the last four years. If we don't play 
our best, we're not going to beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers led the majors with a .293 average and scored 945  
runs, second only to Cleveland. Six players hit 20 home runs, four 
had 100 RBIs and four scored 100 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	But a fifth-inning homer by Juan Gonzalez in Game 2 is Texas'  
only run this series. The Rangers are 0-for-9 with runners in 
scoring position, having failed to score in four situations with 
two on and one out or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see frustration on the face of everyone,'' Gonzalez said.  
``We try having fun, being relaxed. It's easy when you talk, but 
it's real hard when you see a lot of zeros on the scoreboard.''

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Penn State 31, Iowa 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Two big plays and a goal-line stand  
helped Penn State stay unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Drummond ran 68 yards for a touchdown on a reverse and  
Eric McCoo sped 47 yards for another score Saturday, sending the 
No. 2-ranked Nittany Lions to a 31-7 victory over Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than those two plays, Penn State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) had to  
scratch and claw for almost everything it got against an Iowa team 
that had been routed by Michigan State 49-3 the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes (1-4, 0-2) stalled Penn State by intercepting two  
passes and blocking a punt. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a chance to cut the lead to 21-14, Iowa couldn't punch  
it in from the Penn State 1-yard line, and a penalty for having too 
many players on the field led to a 10-yard touchdown run by Aaron 
Harris that clinched it with 10:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State surprised Iowa with the reverse on its second  
possession. Drummond, flanked to the right, came back to his left 
to take Kevin Thompson's handoff, turned upfield behind excellent 
blocking, dodged a defender at the Iowa 40 and raced down the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa trailed just 14-7 when McCoo broke through a hole in the  
middle of the line, cut to his left and outran the pursuit to the 
end zone, scoring with 4:36 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawkeyes got a break a short time later when Ryan Barton  
blocked Pat Pidgeon's punt and Iowa recovered at the Penn State 33. 
Ladell Betts was knocked out of bounds just short of the end zone 
on a 6-yard run, but Penn State held on two straight downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Betts was stopped for a 1-yard loss on third down and Brandon  
Short stopped quarterback Randy Reiners for no gain with an ankle 
tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the Hawkeyes' last gasp. Iowa did stop Penn State on  
third down early in the fourth quarter, but the Hawkeyes had 12 men 
on the field when Penn State punted, giving the Nittany Lions a 
first down at the Iowa 21. Harris scored two plays later to make it 
28-7. 
</P>
<P>
	Travis Forney, who earlier had missed his first field goal  
attempt in eight tries this season, kicked a 26-yarder for the 
final points. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State went up 14-0 at halftime when No. 2 quarterback  
Rashard Casey led a five-play, 63-yard drive that took only 39 
seconds. Casey ran the final 6 yards, slipping into the end zone 
with 9 seconds left in the half as three defenders closed in. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa drew to 14-7 in the third quarter on Reiners' 40-yard  
touchdown pass to fullback Rob Thein, who was wide open when he 
caught the ball in the middle of the field and rumbled into the end 
zone behind Kevin Kasper's block on cornerback Bhawoh Jue.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Transportation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $50 billion  
transportation bill into law Saturday, a wide-ranging measure 
funding transit and infrastructure projects, Amtrak and the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, includes $26.7  
billion for highways, a 10 percent increase from last year, and 
$5.8 billion for mass transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these funding levels will allow us to make the  
substantial improvements in infrastructure and mass transit that 
are necessary,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provides $571 million for Amtrak, including funds for a  
five-year plan to get the national passenger railroad operating 
self-sufficiently and eliminate the need for year-to-year 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	It contains all the money Clinton requested for Coast Guard  
operating expenses, $2.8 billion, including search and rescue 
operations and increased spending for law enforcement and drug 
interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	And it extends for one year a restraint on the government's use  
of new automobile fuel efficiency standards.

<HEADLINE> No. 21 Ohio St. 25, No. 17 Purdue 22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A wet field, a bad kick and a big hand  
helped Ohio State beat Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Johnson blocked a potential tying field goal with 53  
seconds left and Steve Bellisari's late 68-yard run preserved the 
lead as No. 21 Ohio State held off No. 17 Purdue 25-22 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a gutty performance,'' Ohio State coach John Cooper  
said. ``We're not the most talented team. This is not the best team 
we've had around here. But what can I say? They laid it on the line 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Drew Brees drove Purdue from its own 20 to the Ohio  
State 14 with just under a minute left. Brees' third-and-3 pass for 
Chris Daniels was tipped away by Buckeye cornerback Nate Clements, 
and coach Joe Tiller sent his field goal unit onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't able to cash in and had to settle for a field-goal  
attempt,'' Tiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 29-yard try by Travis Dorsch was a low line drive.  
Johnson, who broke through the wall over the middle of the line, 
batted the ball down with his right hand as he was falling to the 
soggy turf. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity presented itself. I was there and I made it  
happen,'' the junior defensve end said. ``I was just happy I had a 
part in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dorsch said it was difficult to remember details of the pivotal  
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to tell because everything happened so fast,'' he  
said. ``We're all out there with on common goal -- to make the kick 
-- and it didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two plays later, Bellisari slashed through a gap around left end  
and raced to the Purdue 21 to end the Boilermakers' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State (4-2, 1-1) took the lead for good on Jonathan Wells'  
2-yard run with 5:13 remaining. Michael Wiley added the two-point 
conversion run after a pass interference call against Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohio State won despite being beaten in most statistical  
categories. Purdue had more yards (380-369) and first downs (21-19) 
and kept the ball for almost nine minutes longer than the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a well-played game,'' Cooper said. ``We can play  
better than that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not until Bellisari's late dash on turf made slippery by an  
all-day rain did the Buckeyes rush for more yardage than Purdue 
freshman tailback Montrell Lowe, who piled up 153 yards on 25 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	The game was every bit as sloppy as the weather. Purdue had 12  
penalties for 86 yards and Ohio State had three turnovers that led 
to 16 Boilermaker points. The Buckeyes fumbled the ball twice in 
their last touchdown drive, but came up with the recovery each 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in a position to win in the fourth quarter and that's  
what you want,'' Tiller said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees, heralded as a Heisman Trophy contender, completed 24 of  
39 passes for 205 yards and was held without a touchdown pass for 
the first time in 19 games. He came in averaging two touchdown 
passes and 322 yards passing per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating because we've been known as a team that if  
the offense needs a score late, we can get it done,'' Brees said. 
``But today we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellisari struggled through the air, throwing two interceptions  
while completing just 10 of 26 passes for 174 yards. But he ended 
up leading the Buckeyes with 96 rushing yards on 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue led 13-7 at the half, but Ohio State retook the lead on  
Wiley's 7-yard halfback pass to tight end Darnell Sanders. Wiley 
lost two critical fumbles in last week's 42-17 loss to Wisconsin 
and was held out of the starting lineup for missing a class this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	He has now completed eight of his nine career pass attempts and  
has thrown for two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dan Stultz's 45-yard field goal put Ohio State ahead  
17-13, Purdue took a 22-17 advantage on Dorsch's 22-yard field goal 
and Lowe's 5-yard run at the outset of the fourth quarter. Lowe's 
TD was set up by Willie Fells' interception and 29-yard return to 
the Ohio State 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue fumbled the opening kickoff and seven plays later Derek  
Combs sidestepped two tackles on a 5-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boilermakers pulled even after Adrian Beasley's interception  
gave them the ball at the Ohio State 27. 
</P>
<P>
	After a first down, Brees handed the ball to wide receiver Vinny  
Sutherland on the reverse. Sutherland stopped quickly at right end 
and lofted a looping pass back to the left sideline. With no Ohio 
State defender within 15 yards, Brees waited on the pass, 
tightroped along the sideline and completed the 12-yard scoring 
play.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Delta Air Lines has sold its 525,000 shares of  
stock in SAirGroup, the parent company of Swissair. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction will result in a before-tax gain of about $29  
million and cash proceeds of about $114 million, the Atlanta-based 
airlines said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Delta's shares in SAirGroup amounted to about a 5 percent stake  
in the Swiss company. Delta had held the stock since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Delta sold its 35.2 million shares of Singapore  
Airlines stock and repurchased 5 million shares of Delta stock held 
by Singapore. That sale came after Swissair pulled out of a 
three-way alliance with Delta and Singapore and sold its 8 million 
shares of Singapore stock.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hugh Hefner's neighbors say he has gone from  
Playboy to bad boy and they've had it with the traffic and 
screeching cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmby Hills residents living around the Playboy Mansion say  
their street is clogged with cars every time Hefner throws one of 
his notoriously extravagant parties. His mansion only has parking 
for 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``They come roaring down the hill and screech their brakes and  
stop and then roar off,'' said Howard Weinberger, 83. 
</P>
<P>
	A small group of neighbors has been trying for two years to get  
the city to add parking restrictions on the weekends. Last week, 
they were shut down again, but the City Council promised to look 
for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Farley, a spokesman for Playboy Enterprises International  
Inc., said, ``If the restrictions go up, we'll live with them. We 
want to be a good neighbor.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Southern Mississippi turned perception  
into reality against No. 16 East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as one of the giant killers in college football, the  
Golden Eagles had actually gone 22 straight games against ranked 
opponents this decade without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
	That was until Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kelly threw three touchdown passes and workhorse Derrick  
Nix rushed for 171 yards in a 39-22 victory over the previously 
unbeaten Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to a week off, the Golden Eagles had lost to No. 4  
Nebraska and No. 13 Texas A&AMP;M in close games. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of speculation from a confidence standpoint,''  
coach Jeff Bower said of playing ranked opponents. ``Certainly we 
have played some tough opponents and it got us ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Mississippi's last win over a ranked team prior to this  
weekend was in 1990 at No. 13 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth straight victory by the Golden Eagles (3-2,  
2-0 Conference USA) over East Carolina (5-1, 1-1) and the 13th in 
the last 16 meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We played about as hard as I thought we could play,'' East  
Carolina coach Steve Logan said. ``There was no room for error and 
we made a couple on the offensive side of the ball. We let a chance 
for victory slip away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Barnes sealed the victory with a 60-yard interception return  
with 3:15 left, and Nix added a 19-yard TD run on his career-high 
42nd carry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking Liberty Bowl. That was the first thing that  
came to my mind,'' Barnes said of his key interception return. ``I 
just read his eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	East Carolina, off to its best start in 23 years, was playing at  
home for the first time since Hurricane Floyd flooded the campus 
and many portions of eastern North Carolina last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pirates got off to a quick 15-3 first-quarter lead, but the  
Golden Eagles then dominated the rest of the game and the clock as 
Nix gave the worst rushing attack in Conference USA a much-needed 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just kind of evolved that way,'' Bower said of the team's  
game-plan to run Nix that much. ``We wanted to run the football and 
get back to our old self on offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly also was clutch, throwing TD passes of 14, 37 and 24  
yards, his second scoring pass to Sherrod Gideon early in the third 
quarter giving the Golden Eagles a 25-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pirates weren't finished just yet. David Garrard threw  
his third TD pass -- a 42-yarder to LaMont Chappell on third-and-23 
with 12:17 left -- as East Carolina closed within three. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrard then escaped from sure sacks on two different third-down  
plays late in the game, only to be picked off by Barnes on a 
fourth-and-3 play near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Garrard) had run around and made some big plays and I think  
Leo just sat back on that one,'' Bower said. ``That's what happens 
so many times on a scramble, you get a big play either one way or 
the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each team owned a quarter in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
	A 46-yard punt return by Shawn Mills set up a short field goal  
by Brant Hanna before the Pirates scored 15 straight points in the 
opening 10 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Wilson's 68-yard run -- the longest this season for East  
Carolina -- set up his 1-yard TD reception from Garrard. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills stepped out of bounds on the ensuing kickoff at the  
Southern Mississippi 3, backing his team up. Three plays later, 
Kelly fumbled the ball into the end zone while being taken down by 
Ty Hunt. Buck Miciotto, trying to save his team a TD, batted the 
ball out of the back of the end zone as the Pirates went up 9-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Six plays after Southern Mississippi's free kick, Garrard make a  
nifty move in the pocket to avoid the rush and found Arnie Powell 
on a 44-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted the ball back,'' Kelly said of the early  
12-point deficit. ``We were moving the ball pretty well and I just 
wanted to put some points on the board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly threw two scoring passes less than 4 1/2 minutes apart midway  
through the second quarter, his second one a 37-yarder to Todd 
Pinkston, who has caught at least one TD in six straight games 
dating to last season's bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanna added another short field goal for a 19-15 halftime lead.

<HEADLINE> Double Murder Conviction Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- She was a wealthy woman, a mother of  
two children, with homes in Taiwan and California. She was also a 
woman betrayed, and in a case that captivated much of Asia, her 
husband helped get her convicted of murdering his mistress and 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a California court has reversed Li-Yun ``Lisa'' Peng's  
conviction, citing questionable police tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	If the ruling stands, she could walk free after suffering what  
the court called ``repeated, intentional and inexcusable 
deprivation of an individual's most basic constitutional 
protections from coercive tactics by the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My client is very pleased,'' said San Diego lawyer Charles  
Sevilla, who represented her on appeal. ``She's a middle-class mom 
who has been in prison going on six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crime received little attention in the United States, but  
media from China, Taiwan and elsewhere in Asia had reported every 
detail. A movie about the crime was filmed in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1991, electronics tycoon Tseng ``Jim'' Peng and his wife  
were a successful couple, shuttling between Taiwan and a home in 
Rancho Santa Margarita in California's Orange County. They were the 
parents of two sons, and Peng's worth was estimated at $200 
million, most of it from his Ranger Communications which made CB 
radios in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, during a business trip to mainland China, Peng became  
smitten with another woman. He brought 25-year-old Ranbing 
``Jennifer'' Ji to California, set her up in an apartment and gave 
her money to start a business affiliated with his. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave birth to his child, Kevin, in March 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Peng knew of the affair, even met with the mistress and  
threatened her with harm if she did not leave her husband. Once, 
she arrived unexpectedly from Taiwan and found Jim and Jennifer 
staying in her home. She later found the mistress' clothes and cut 
holes in them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 18, 1993, Jim Peng returned from a trip to Taiwan and  
found his mistress slain, stabbed 19 times and with a bite mark on 
one arm. In a crib in the bedroom of her apartment lay the body of 
5-month-old Kevin, suffocated with a T-shirt stuffed in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Jim Peng was the prime suspect, according to court  
papers, but after he passed a polygraph test detectives turned 
their suspicions on his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Peng was found guilty in 1996 after an initial trial ended  
in deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	But the road to that conviction was littered with legal  
violations, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peng was eager to help Orange County sheriff's deputies. He  
offered a reward, said he would search his wife's financial records 
and went through her wardrobe searching for a button that might 
match one found at the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
	He persuaded his wife to return to California from Taiwan. With  
no U.S.-Taiwan extradition treaty, Mrs. Peng could have escaped 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	After her return in January 1994, Mrs. Peng met with sheriff's  
deputies and was interrogated for nine hours. She was not told of 
her Miranda rights and deputies ignored her request for a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most fundamental errors in our jurisprudence were made  
during the investigation of this case,'' the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Believing Mrs. Peng was at the breaking point, the decision  
said, deputies brought in her husband to question her in Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
	He elicited an admission that she had seen Jennifer the day of  
the killing, they had quarreled and she had bitten Jennifer on one 
arm. DNA tests confirmed the saliva in the bite was hers. That 
became the key evidence against Mrs. Peng, who denied she was the 
murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	In its Sept. 30 ruling, the appeals court called the statement  
coerced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even an innocent person would make some kind of statement  
potentially incriminating after nine hours of threats, intimidation 
and bullying by law enforcement officers in the bowels of a county 
jail and then being confronted with the questions of the victim's 
paramour,'' the court said. ``The statements should have been 
suppressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case was sent back to the trial court for retrial, unless  
the prosecution decides to drop the charges or appeal to a higher 
state court. Pending a decision, Mrs. Peng remains in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Sheriff Tim Simon disputed the ruling, saying he and  
prosecutors will review it before deciding what to do with the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Weisselberg, a law professor at the University of  
California, Berkeley, said that unless detectives find more 
evidence, it would be a difficult case. 
</P>
<P>
	And the court concluded: ``Her statements were brutally  
damaging; without it her guilt was barely even insinuated.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Coach Ejected, Shoves Ump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets third-base coach Cookie Rojas shoved umpire  
Charlie Williams in the chest after being ejected in the eighth 
inning of New York's clinching 4-3 playoff victory over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas was incensed after Williams, the left-field umpire, ruled  
that Darryl Hamilton's looping drive landed foul with two runners 
on and the game tied at 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the ball hit on the line,'' Rojas said. ``We argued  
back and forth until he called me a (expletive). I'm not going to 
take that from anyone or any umpire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed that Williams, who was rated the worst umpire in  
the NL by players last year, made the correct call. NL spokeswoman 
Katy Feeney said Williams declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas ran from the coach's box to shallow left field to confront  
Williams and was immediately ejected. As the argument grew heated, 
manager Bobby Valentine sprinted out of the dugout to try to 
restrain Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He went out there with his emotion and they were arguing when  
I got there,'' Valentine said. ``They were heated into it, and some 
words were exchanged back and forth. Cookie was called something 
and blew a gasket, no doubt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coach was arguing face-to-face with the umpire when  
Valentine arrived. He shielded Rojas from Williams, but Rojas 
fought through and pushed Valentine into Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	First-base coach Mookie Wilson also tried to help restrain  
Rojas. It didn't work, as Rojas broke free and pushed Williams with 
two hands in the chest. Rojas will likely be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``He bumped me first,'' Rojas said. ``I'll go along with what  
the league president says, but I think he should apologize. He 
should be man enough to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine, Wilson and Robin Ventura -- who was on second base --  
finally restrained Rojas, who left the field to chants of ``Cookie, 
Cookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I respect the umpires, they are all professionals,'' Rojas  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine finished out the inning as third base coach -- the  
second time this season he has replaced Rojas for an inning 
following an ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Benedict took over in the ninth inning.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kentucky Starter Streck Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Former University of Kentucky football  
player Jeremy Streck, a starting senior guard last season, died 
Saturday of injuries suffered after being hit by a car. He was 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Streck had been in critical condition at the Ohio State Medical  
Center in Columbus since he was struck on Oct. 1. He was pronounced 
dead at 12:05 a.m. Saturday, said Ken Phillips, hospital 
administration manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the accident, police charged Paul K. Synadinos,  
20, of Gahanna, Ohio, with DUI. There was no immediate word whether 
further charges would be filed against Synadinos. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6-foot-5, 313-pound lineman from Cincinnati, Streck started 18  
games and played in 32 during his career at Kentucky. He started 
all 12 games last season at left guard as the Wildcats went 7-5, 
making their first appearance in a New Year's Day bowl game since 
1952.

<HEADLINE> Chilukki Wins $200K Oak Leaf Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Unbeaten Chilukki pulled away to win  
Saturday's $200,000 Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita by 1 1/4 lengths 
over Abby Girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory in the race for 2-year-old fillies was Chilukki's  
first beyond a sprinting distance, and made her the probable 
favorite in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies race on 
Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by David Flores, Chilukki, the 1-2 favorite, covered 1  
mile in the stakes-record time of 1:36 in winning her sixth 
straight race, and paid $3, $2.40 and $2.10. The $120,000 winner's 
share increased her career earnings to $562,723. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the way she relaxed today,'' trainer Bob Baffert said  
of the daughter of Cherokee Run. ``She does not need the lead. 
She's just professional, just so gifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chilukki had to wait out a stewards' inquiry before the result  
was made official. The stewards noted Chilukki drifted in nearing 
the finish line, causing Abby Girl and jockey Chris McCarron to 
steady momentarily. However, they ruled the incident had no bearing 
on the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Abby Girl, who won her previous two starts, crossed the finish  
line 4 1/4 lengths in front of Spain and returned $3.20 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain, ridden by Gary Stevens, was a half-length ahead of Crown  
Of Crimson at the wire and paid $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	She's Classy finished fifth and last in the 31st running of the  
race. Each of the five entries carried 118 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was run at 1 1-16 miles before 1997, when Vivid Angel  
won in 1:37 1-5. Excellent Meeting won last year in 1:37 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	A field of six, headed by Forest Camp and Dixie Union, is  
entered in Sunday's $200,000 Norfolk Stakes, a 1-mile race for 
2-year-olds.

<HEADLINE> Miami Gives Cuban Band Cold Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A performance by one of Cuba's hottest bands drew  
about 2,000 anti-Castro protesters to Miami Arena Saturday night, 
with many waving flags, shouting slogans and denouncing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	After being warmly welcomed elsewhere during a tour of the  
United States, Los Van Van got the cold shoulder in the heart of 
the Cuban exile community. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators carried signs reading ``Castro: 40 years of  
dictatorship and 40 years of slavery'' and ``Van: Get out of 
Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing against the music they play,'' said protester  
Luis Eseandal. ``This is about the Cuban government and Fidel 
Castro. That's why we're here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A disturbance broke out between police and protesters that  
lasted just a few minutes when about a dozen demonstrators hopped 
the steel barricades and tried to run to the entrance of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used pepper spray to control the rowdy group, and a  
handful of protesters were led away in handcuffs as supporters 
shouted their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter was treated for a minor cut after being hit in the  
head by a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Following weeks of controversy in Miami over the upcoming  
performance, Los Van Van began their concert of Afro-Cuban dance 
music at the Miami Arena in downtown, while the huge protest was 
staged outside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here because I like the music,'' said one ticketholder to  
the concert, Adriana Lopez, a native of Colombia who lives in 
Miami. ``It's an art and an expression from the soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why we have to get into politics over this,''  
Lopez lamented. 
</P>
<P>
	Concert goers were shielded by two rows of barricades as dozens  
of police officers kept watch over a crowd so crammed together they 
resembled revelers on a parade route. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Miami's Cuban-American community denounced Los  
Van Van as emissaries of Cuba's communist President Fidel Castro, 
and the appearance got canceled, only to be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not telling the truth,'' said protester Mirta  
Oliva-Rios. ``This group is a representative of Fidel Castro. We 
don't need that here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and city Commissioner Tomas Regalado,  
both Cuban-born, last month vented their objections to the concert 
on Spanish-language radio, and the dispute generated thousands of 
calls to city hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue after the  
show's cancellation at another city-owned venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba showed  
an anti-Castro film Saturday night a few blocks away, at the James 
L. Knight Center, the original site of the Los Van Van show, then 
made their way to the Arena to protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban exile group Democracy Movement issued a statement  
Saturday objecting to the ``insincerity'' of allowing Los Van Van 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides pretend for us to accept on its face value their  
claim that they are leading a 'people to people contact' policy 
when in reality, Castro's Van come to Miami to play while our 
Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz or Willie Chirino cannot go to Cuba to 
do the same,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Formell, who founded Los Van Van 30 years ago, rejected the  
label applied by opponents who call the group the ``official'' band 
of the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't do politics. We make music,'' Formell said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cultural exchange exemptions under the U.S. trade embargo allow  
Cuban bands to perform in the United States if they don't profit 
from the concerts.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Showdown in Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their political loyalties Saturday in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, for his part, warned that voters are demanding that  
politicans stick to the high road. ``It takes discipline to be 
positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used his speech to confront Bradley directly with his  
challenge to debate weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about it, Bill?'' said Gore, moving from behind the  
lectern to gesture to the former New Jersey senator sitting in the 
audience. Bradley merely smiled in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's speech was an earnest, serious look at the future of  
the Democratic Party, while Gore abandoned the lectern to wander 
the stage, gesturing energetically during a more passionate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore questioned Bradley's commitment to core Democratic issues,  
and Bradley suggested the vice president resorted to attacks 
because he lacked vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that someone is confident in their own vision of  
the future, they don't need to resort to the darts,'' Bradley said. 
``I think I can talk about the future in a way that's compelling 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bradley acknowledged Gore's challenge to debate  
without committing to any timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great pleasure to be with you on the same platform for  
the first time,'' Bradley told the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance at the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner was  
the candidates' first joint meeting since Gore uprooted his 
campaign to Tennessee to counter Bradley's surge in polls. Since 
then, Gore has sought a scrappier, homespun image and he is more 
directly confronting Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sat in separate sections of a large hall where the  
fund-raiser was held, but both worked the room and met briefly, 
shaking hands and exchanging greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away from the fight when (former Speaker) Newt  
Gingrich took over the Congress. I did not walk away from the fight 
when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I did not walk 
away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit,'' Gore said at 
a news conference, implying that Bradley turned away from Democrats 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996, two years after Republicans won  
control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also reminded Iowans that Bradley had voted against popular  
ethanol subsidies and other farm issues important to the states 
with the first presidential caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he were calling Bradley a quitter, Gore demurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a word I'd use to describe him,'' he said. ``Others  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley rejected any suggestions of disloyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Democrat since I cast my first vote in  
1964,'' said Bradley, who has suggested that Gore's centrist 
politics undermine his claim to the Democratic mantle. ``I am 
simply not going to deal with the darts that are being thrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has the backing of much of the party's establishment,  
especially in Iowa, the race has tightened and gotten new 
attention. A poll last week showed Bradley within a dozen points of 
Gore in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was taking advantage of his institutional support at every  
turn as he prepared for Saturday's event. The hall where the two 
will speak was turned into a sea of Gore campaign signs, drawing a 
chuckle from Bradley, a former professional basketball star with 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little bit like going into Boston Garden in  
the seventh game,'' said Bradley. ``You never know, you could turn 
around some of the Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his poll standings have improved, Bradley worked hard to  
play down expectations for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question we are up against entrenched power,''  
said Bradley. ``I don't have high expectations. We have to do OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates were relishing a competitive race they said will  
serve the eventual nominee well against the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real opportunity for us, whichever one of us emerges  
from the primary to be stronger because of the competition,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates walked Democratic precincts before their  
addresses, adding a grass-roots touch to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Um, who are you?'' 7-year-old Robert Buell asked, tapping Gore  
on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Vice President Al Gore,'' the vice president said with a  
laugh. ``Who are you?''

<HEADLINE> Other Martinez Shines for Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Ramon Martinez wasn't unhittable, as his brother  
so often is. 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't strike out a dozen batters or turn the ball over to  
the closer or even pick up a win, like Pedro did more than anybody 
else in baseball this season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ramon Martinez helped the Boston Red Sox in a way his little  
brother couldn't in their first-round playoff series against the 
Cleveland Indians: He helped them win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty big lift,'' said Red Sox shortstop John  
Valentin, who had a homer a two-run double as Boston avoided a 
three-game sweep with a 9-3 victory over Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``He hasn't pitched a whole lot this year. He's been hurt,  
coming off surgery. They decided to use him in the playoffs and he 
pitched very big. I mean, he gave us a chance to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A 20-game winner himself before a torn rotator cuff knocked him  
out for 15 months, the elder Martinez allowed two runs on five hits 
and three walks, striking out six. He left with two out in the 
sixth with the game tied at 2, tipping his cap in response to a 
hearty cheer from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates were just as appreciative.  
</P>
<P>
	``When somebody goes down,'' we seem to have somebody ready to  
step in,'' outfielder Darren Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez was baseball's best pitcher this season,  
compiling a 23-4 record and 2.07 ERA with 313 strikeouts to win the 
AL's triple crown of pitching. Heading into the playoffs, the Red 
Sox were considered a dangerous team only because Pedro was 
expected to win two games in a five-game series, and they only 
needed three. 
</P>
<P>
	But the younger Martinez couldn't win it for Boston in Game 1,  
leaving after four innings with a sprained back muscle. The Red Sox 
went on to lose 3-2 in the bottom of the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the condition of Pedro's back has been a concern, it  
won't really matter unless the team could stretch the series to 
five games. And, after losing Game 2 to teeter on the brink of 
elimination, it didn't look like it would matter at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, thanks to his brother, there's a chance the Red Sox will  
need Pedro to start Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll keep testing it. I'll try to play catch every day,'' the  
younger Martinez said. ``It's sore right now and we're working on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Martinez had to abort a throwing session short before  
Saturday's game, throwing the ball just a dozen times before 
trainer Rich Zawacki told him to cut it off. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's going to take a little longer,'' Pedro said. ``If  
you guys want me to throw in the 90s right now, I actually can't. I 
don't know (if I will) by game time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramon Martinez went 20-6 with a 2.92 ERA for the Los Angeles  
Dodgers in 1990 to establish himself as one of the game's top 
pitchers. But he tore his rotator cuff in 1997 and again last year 
after starting out with a 7-2 record and 2.83 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox signed him in the offseason with an eye towards next  
year. But he was ready to pitch again in midsummer, making 10 
rehabilitation starts in the minors before coming to Boston on 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he wasn't expected to make the postseason roster, he  
was pressed into duty when Pat Rapp left to help his wife through a 
difficult pregnancy. And Martinez responded with a strong outing 
that earned him two more starts and a spot in the playoff rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a chance and I was getting better and better. I got this  
chance to prove I can pitch, and here I am,'' he said. ``Once there 
is a chance, you take advantage of it.''

<HEADLINE> Ford, UAW Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The United Auto Workers and Ford Motor  
Co. reached a tentative agreement Saturday on a new contract, hours 
after a handful of workers walked off the job when a strike 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
	A joint statement announcing the deal contained no details, and  
officials declined to provide any, pending ratification meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the agreement followed the pattern set by the UAW in deals 
with General Motors Corp. and DaimlerChrysler AG -- four-year 
agreements with raises of 3 percent each year and a signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	A local union official in Tulsa, Okla., said the agreement  
allowed the spin-off of Visteon Automotive Systems, Ford's parts 
division. Wade McCaleb, secretary-treasurer of Local 1895, said 
workers at Visteon plants would remain Ford employees, while any 
new employees at Visteon will be covered by an agreement between 
the new company and the UAW that mirrors the one the union has with 
Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	UAW officials have said they were opposed to the company's plans  
for Visteon, which employs 23,500 UAW workers. Officials were 
concerned a separate Visteon could cut pay and jobs and even close 
plants to compete against other parts companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike deadline of midnight Friday was a first in U.S. auto  
industry negotiations this year and a sign of strain in what had 
been billed as a close relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the union said it did not authorize any work stoppages  
and workers at only a handful of plants walked off their jobs when 
the deadline passed. Plants scheduled to operate on Saturday were 
back in business by the day shift. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary walkout was designed to be ``kind of like a  
wake-up call'' to Ford, said Larry Senyard, treasurer of Local 325 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The walkouts came at Ford plants in St. Louis; Claycomo, Mo.;  
Flat Rock, Mich.; and St. Paul, Minn. There was no word on how many 
workers were involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had made $6.6 billion in 1998, thanks to a lack of work  
stoppages and bulked-up production at truck and sport utility 
vehicle plants. The average worker's profit sharing payment was 
$6,100. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what issues might have held up  
agreement on the contract for about 100,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	During a Labor Day parade in Detroit, UAW workers carried signs  
depicting Visteon as ``the alien within'' -- an orange monster 
busting out of the Ford logo. 
</P>
<P>
	And UAW President Stephen P. Yokich told union members in a  
taped message earlier in the week that Ford was being ``stubborn'' 
about accepting contracts agreed to by GM and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW negotiated some terms with DaimlerChrysler, GM and  
Delphi Automotive Systems that experts say could have applied to 
Ford and Visteon. The contracts included promises from the 
companies that they would not spin off, sell or close any division 
or factory. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract for Delphi workers mirrors GM's deal; it also  
allows Delphi employees to transfer back to GM and retire by Jan. 1 
with a GM pension. Other terms include a $1,350 signing bonus, 
improved pensions and better cost-of-living adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
	GM and Delphi workers are expected to complete voting on their  
new contract by next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The last national strike by the UAW against Ford was 1976; it  
was also the last time the UAW struck during negotiations. A local 
union in Atlanta struck Ford in 1986. The UAW has not held a 
national strike in years, but has held several local strikes at GM, 
including a 54-day strike at two Flint plants last summer that shut 
down most of the company's North American production.

<HEADLINE> Gateway Recalls Foam `Stress' Cows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer manufacturer Gateway Inc. is  
recalling about 1 million foam rubber ``stress'' cows due to 
choking hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway has received three reports about pieces of the foam  
tearing away, posing a serious choking hazard to young children, 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	The foam cows are white with black spots, 4 1/2 inches long and 3  
inches high. The cow is supposed to relieve stress when squeezed 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gateway logo rubber cow was a giveaway with a computer  
purchase from September 1997 to September 1999. A few were sold for 
about $4 during that time. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission recommends that customers throw away the cow, or  
visit any Gateway store for an exchange. For more information, 
customers should call 1-877-206-4889.

<HEADLINE> Citizen's Revolt Now A Barbecue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARBIDGE, Nev. (AP) -- It was supposed to be a citizens' revolt:  
Some 1,000 people armed with tools, rebuilding a remote mountain 
road despite government warnings that it would threaten an 
endangered fish species. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a judge ruled against today's planned reconstruction,  
protesters decided to do something a little less contentious -- hold 
a barbecue and rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not defy the order,'' state Assemblyman John Carpenter  
said Friday, just hours after vowing to defy U.S. District Judge 
David Hagen's decision. ``We will not break the law. The work party 
has been canceled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute involves a 1 1/2-mile section of road that leads to a  
campground and outhouse in the Humboldt Toiyabe-National Forest. 
Elko County and the federal government have been odds since a flood 
washed the road out in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service decided not to rebuild the road because  
eroding soil could foul the river and threaten the bull trout, now 
protected under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	But Carpenter had planned to lead citizens of this remote  
historic mining town with pickaxes and shovels to start 
reconstruction this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	At the request of the U.S. Attorney's Office, Hagen issued a  
temporary restraining order late Thursday blocking the action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our hope this project wouldn't happen because it would  
impact the bull trout,'' said Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Randi 
Thompson. ``It's spawning time and a very tenuous time for the 
fish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said her agency hoped to re-open talks with Elko County to  
resume working toward a reasonable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	If any trout were harmed, Thompson said the group could face  
fines of $12,000 per fish in civil penalties and $25,000 per fish 
in criminal penalties.

<HEADLINE> Few Serbs Remain in Kosovo Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The door cracks open, releasing a  
waft of stale air, and the old woman peers suspiciously into the 
dark stairwell. As one of a vanishing breed -- a Serb in Pristina -- 
her caution is well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Milanka Todorovic no longer ventures outside. The last time she  
did was last month, only to be beaten by a young ethnic Albanian 
who chased her back up a flight of stairs into her apartment and 
stole her front door keys and money. 
</P>
<P>
	She worries that another trip out might be her last -- that she  
could come back to find her apartment occupied by her assailant or 
other Albanian squatters from the countryside, such as those who 
moved into some Serb flats in her crumbling prefab high-rise when 
the owners fled. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my neighbors here were Serbs,'' she says, tears welling in  
her eyes. ``Now, they are all Albanians -- all strangers. We don't 
exchange greetings, and I am afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Old, feeble and alone, Todorovic is in many ways typical of the  
Serbs left in Pristina more than three months after the Serb forces 
they viewed as security against the ethnic Albanian majority pulled 
out and NATO troops moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	In times of peace, about 20 percent of Pristina's 200,000-plus  
residents were Serb. Grim-faced Serb police were everywhere, and 
the victims of repression were the Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, according to various estimates, only 400 to 3,000 Serbs  
remain in Kosovo's provincial capital. Most of the others have 
fled, victims of revenge -- feared or fact -- from ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbs were able to sell their homes before pulling up  
stakes. But some just left, leaving behind what they couldn't 
carry, and their apartments were occupied by ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbs like Todorovic who don't venture out, or can't because of  
ailments, survive on handouts brought to their door. The U.S.-based 
Adventist Development and Relief Agency delivers food to about 25 
Serb homes each day. 
</P>
<P>
	Relief worker Darlene Ward says about 20 percent of the people  
her group helps are physically able to leave their homes for food 
pickups but won't because they fear for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel they don't have the freedom to go to the local  
market,'' Ward says. ``Even if some market owners are willing to 
serve them, they could get harassed by others there. The moment 
they open their mouths it's quite clear they're Serb, because they 
don't speak Albanian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Herrera of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees  
agency says Serbs are subject to ``consistent incidents of 
harassment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As of late it's been more break-ins, verbal threats, youths  
throwing stones at windows, but you also have incidents of elderly 
persons being beaten,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Killings of Serbs are becoming less frequent, perhaps, Herrera  
says, because NATO soldiers now know the territory and respond more 
quickly to emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Serbs continue to flee.  
</P>
<P>
	``We will often go to an address where Serbs have asked for  
deliveries and not find anyone there,'' Ward says. ``About five 
families a week leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group's food deliveries used to be made from a large truck,  
but Ward says it switched to vans after hostile ethnic Albanian 
crowds berated workers for helping Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Even kids are hateful, she says.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had a case of an 8-year-old boy asking me, 'Why are you  
taking food to her? She's a Serb.' I told him the woman was old, 
and he replied, 'It doesn't matter; she's Serb.''' 
</P>
<P>
	So Todorovic stays inside her one-bedroom flat, windows shut  
tight, front door barricaded, passing each day from a worn couch 
she rarely leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	She opens the door only for the charity workers -- and only after  
they press their two-way radios against her door to let her hear 
the crackle of English as proof of who they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Canned goods, detergent, toothpaste, pasta -- the goods are  
crucial for survival, but field worker Leonora Mucaj's presence 
seems just as important to Todorovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Though an ethnic Albanian, the relief worker radiates  
reassurance. Speaking in perfect Serbian, she comforts the woman, 
squeezing her shoulder before leaving. As she closes her door, 
Todorovic smiles -- through tears. 
</P>
<P>
	At the van's next stop, Smilja and Slobodan Deljanin sit in a  
living room packed with boxes and crates. They are leaving this 
week for Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, after selling their 
one-bedroom flat to an ethnic Albanian for the equivalent of 
$25,000 -- below what used to be market value. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving up strong black coffee with a chaser of home-brewed  
liquor as a visitor looks at a photo album of weddings, family 
reunions and other mementos of better times, Smilja, 53, says she 
is afraid to go out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to a store only 100 meters away, and people threw rocks  
at us,'' she says. ``We are now the only Serbs here. The others are 
Albanians, from who knows where.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A friend, Milanka Jankovic, drops in to say hello. ``We're  
leaving in four or five days for Belgrade,'' she says when asked 
about her family's plans for the future. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes' drive away, Radmila and Nikola Simic emerge from  
a gate leading into a leafy garden, smiling and hugging Mucaj as 
they take possession of their food ration. They say they're 
staying. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are incidents -- Albanians knocking on the doors of Serb  
apartments and telling the owners to leave,'' concedes Nikola, 68. 
``But my home is Kosovo. I'd rather be killed in Pristina than move 
elsewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Families Join Reno on Hate Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The families of hate-crime victims Matthew  
Shepard and James Byrd Jr. appeared with Attorney General Janet 
Reno on Saturday night as part of a campaign to persuade Congress 
to include attacks on gays and lesbians among federal hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a freshman at the University of Wyoming, was killed a  
year ago in what prosecutors said was an anti-gay attack. Byrd, a 
black man, was killed in June 1998 when three white supremacists 
dragged him behind their pickup truck near Jasper, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights advocates say the Byrd family's presence was key to  
building support for the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has been 
passed by the Senate and must still be considered by the House. 
Among other measures, which Reno endorsed, the bill would add 
``sexual orientation'' to the description of peoples protected by 
federal hate crimes acts. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rallying dinner, Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the  
Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy group, praised the 
Byrd family for lending their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the Byrd family had the choice to stand with the gay and  
lesbian community... they made a moral decision'' to do so, Birch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Shepard, Matthew's father, described how one year ago he  
walked into a hospital and saw the motionless body of his son. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did believe gay people experienced equal treatment before,''  
Shepard said. ``I have never been so wrong in my life.''

<HEADLINE> Nike Discloses Factory Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Pressured by university protests of  
sweatshop conditions, Nike has made public all the overseas and 
domestic factories that make T-shirts, hats and sweatshirts 
licensed by five major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids really moved the process along,'' said Joel Seguine,  
spokesman for the University of Michigan, one of the five 
universities that add their logos to clothing with the Nike swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
	The list applies to clothing sold in student stores or as  
general merchandise, not to equipment for athletic teams, which is 
under separate license. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaverton-based Nike disclosed the factory sites Thursday on its  
Web site, www.nikebiz.com, listing addresses where clothing is made 
for Michigan, Arizona, Duke, Georgetown and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site listed 41 factories in 11 countries, including  
China, Bangladesh, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen factories were in the United States, mostly in  
the South. ``I'm sure that was a surprise to most people,'' said 
Vada Manager, Nike's director of manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing was welcomed by officials at all the schools.  
Several noted that Nike had made the disclosure well in advance of 
a March deadline the universities had set. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike Chairman Phil Knight offered to disclose the factory sites  
last March if the colleges required disclosure from all licensed 
manufacturers, which the schools have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists fighting sweatshop labor practices were quick to  
praise Nike, saying it would put pressure on other major athletic 
apparel and equipment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's smart of them and I hope other companies will follow  
them,'' said Dan Hennefeld, a spokesman for United Students Against 
Sweatshops, a student coalition that has pushed for labor reform.

<HEADLINE> Tough Going for Mattel's Barad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- For nearly two years Mattel Inc. chief  
Jill E. Barad dazzled Wall Street with a flashy style and marketing 
savvy that helped turn the toymaker into a worldwide powerhouse 
with brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	To many, she seemed the perfect leader for the world's largest  
toy company. Her enthusiasm and energy appeared boundless. Clad in 
smart, designer clothes, she promoted Mattel with gusto, sometimes 
even dancing to the music that blared out in meetings where new 
toys were unveiled to industry analysts and investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``My impression of her is that she is the consummate product  
person, that she loves the product,'' toy consultant Chris Byrne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors haven't shared that enthusiasm during the past  
year. For the second time in 10 months, Wall Street has been 
shocked by surprise announcements that Mattel can't live up to 
revenue estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The news earlier this week pushed the company's stock to its  
lowest point since 1993, with shares trading Friday at $11.81 1/4, 
down 50 cents. It's off nearly 75 percent from a 10-year high of 
$46.75 reached last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest miscalculation -- which has already generated two  
class-action suits by investors -- has left some analysts wondering 
if Barad is up to the job of turning Mattel around, or if she will 
even be given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board is faced with a tough situation. Do they make a  
management change or shuffle before their most important season of 
the year?'' said Eric Gustafson, a senior portfolio manager at 
Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure on Barad intensified this week after Mattel revealed  
that The Learning Company, a software maker acquired by Mattel in 
May for $3.8 billion, will lose up to $100 million in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The board appears to be willing to give Barad time. Barad met  
with directors on Wednesday in New York, telling members she had 
been advised of The Learning Company's troubles late last week and 
was trying to learn the cause of the problem, according to a source 
familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mattel spokesman declined to comment Friday, except to say  
Barad continued to have the full support of Mattel's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Barad, 48, took the helm of Mattel in January 1997, capping a  
16-year climb that began in the company's novelty toy unit. Under 
her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million 
product line into one of the world's most recognized brands with 
$1.9 billion in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
	And she seems to recognize the changing desires of kids today,  
who are more interested in high-tech toys by the age of 6 rather 
than playing with dolls and board games. Mattel's has stepped up 
its software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to 
capture shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	As Mattel's chairman and chief executive, Barad underwent a  
transformation of sorts. The one-time actress and beauty consultant 
-- one of only three women currently running a Fortune 500 company -- 
became a role model for millions of working women trying to break 
into the ranks of corporate management. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's romance with Barad and Mattel turned rocky last  
December after Mattel announced a $500 million shortfall for 1998 -- 
a disclosure came only weeks after a series of meetings in which 
Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its revenue 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel made a mistake when it based its original projections on  
the number of orders the company received in previous years, 
analysts said. Mattel ignored an announcement by Toys R Us, a key 
customer, that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, 
and the prospect that other retailers would do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
	What went wrong with The Learning Company is less clear. The two  
problems are similar, though, in that Mattel appears to have been 
oblivious to the problem until the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are to believe everything, it would appear they were  
totally out of the loop on what was going on with this latest 
acquisition,'' said Margaret Whitfield, an analyst at Tucker 
Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel is blaming the shortfall on a variety of problems,  
including the loss of a key distribution deal, an unexpectedly high 
return of unsold product from retailers and the write-off of bad 
debts. The explanation is disturbing to analysts because it 
suggests that The Learning Company was depending on a one-time cash 
payment from the distribution deal to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
	The larger question is why Mattel was in the dark. Officials at  
the software maker, like those heading other Mattel product lines, 
report directly to Barad. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the problems with The Learning Company were pointed out  
in a July report on Mattel issued by the Center for Financial 
Research and Analysis. Analyst Sirine Hafez reported The Learning 
Company's sales in the first half of 1999 fell well below 1998 
levels. There was also a big jump in accounts receivables, or money 
owed the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a good acquisition. That's where the problem lies,''  
said Jim Silver, editor of The Toy Book, an industry publication. 
``The rest of Mattel is fine. (The Learning Company) is one big 
problem, though.''

<HEADLINE> Bush's Slogan Has Family Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is taking pains in  
politics to be his own man, but a new biography says the Republican 
presidential candidate is using a slogan that was applied to his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservative'' was used by Ron Kaufman, an aide  
to the senior Bush when he was running for president in the 
mid-1980s, in a Christian magazine article designed to make 
religious conservatives comfortable with the candidate, the 
biography says. 
</P>
<P>
	``First Son: George W. Bush and the Bush Family Dynasty,'' was  
released Sunday. The book, the first in a new series of competing 
biographies coming out on the GOP front-runner, was written by Bill 
Minutaglio, a Dallas Morning News reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The evenhanded book leaves unsettled two questions from the  
governor's past. It avoids any ``dollops of drug tales'' -- the 
long-standing, still-unsubstantiated speculation about whether the 
younger Bush ever used illegal drugs; and it offers no proof his 
family pulled strings to keep him out of the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	``First Son'' details Bush's time living in Washington when he  
served as ``loyalty monitor'' in his father's presidential 
campaign. He was also the family's liaison with ascendant leaders 
of the religious right, who worried the vice president was not 
nearly as in tune with their issues as President Reagan was. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1986, the month the younger Bush suddenly stopped his  
years of hard drinking, the evangelical magazine Christian Herald 
published a cover story written by a Bush campaign aide in which 
Kaufman, head of the vice president's political action committee, 
said the candidate was best described as a ``compassionate 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The phrase gained limited currency in the 1988 campaign. It was  
used to describe both the vice president and a rival for the GOP 
nomination that year, Bob Dole. Indeed, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch 
of Utah, now running against the younger Bush, called himself a 
compassionate conservative way back in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the slogan is at the core of the governor's campaign.  
</P>
<P>
	The book says that once the vice president won the election, his  
son helped hand out political favors. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, Minutaglio writes, the younger Bush suggested a  
wealthy Texas publisher, Roger Horchow, be appointed chairman of 
the National Endowment for the Arts because he had given money to 
the Bush campaign. But when aides discovered the publisher had also 
contributed to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, he scratched 
his name from the list.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Transportation Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a $50 billion  
transportation bill into law Saturday, a wide-ranging measure 
funding transit and infrastructure projects, Amtrak and the Coast 
Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, includes $26.7  
billion for highways, a 10 percent increase from last year, and 
$5.8 billion for mass transit programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe these funding levels will allow us to make the  
substantial improvements in infrastructure and mass transit that 
are necessary,'' White House spokesman Jake Siewert said. 
</P>
<P>
	It also provides $571 million for Amtrak, including funds for a  
five-year plan to get the national passenger railroad operating 
self-sufficiently and eliminate the need for year-to-year 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	It contains all the money Clinton requested for Coast Guard  
operating expenses, $2.8 billion, including search and rescue 
operations and increased spending for law enforcement and drug 
interdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	And it extends for one year a restraint on the government's use  
of new automobile fuel efficiency standards.

<HEADLINE> Piazza To Miss Saturday's Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All-Star catcher Mike Piazza was out of the New  
York Mets' lineup for a second straight day with an injured left 
thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza, who missed Game 3 of the New York Mets series against  
the Arizona Diamondbacks, was possibly available for pinch-hitting 
duties today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a little better,'' manager Bobby Valentine said before  
the game. ``He might be able to pinch-hit if all the treatment 
kicks in. It is still swollen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza was icing his thumb before the game. He initially injured  
it Sept. 17 when he was hit by a foul ball against Philadelphia and 
re-aggravated it Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays of the thumb were negative but Piazza had a bad reaction  
to a cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Pratt, who went 1-for-3 with two walks in Game 3, started  
once again in Piazza's place.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Gives Redskins Boost at QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- With a cigar in his hand and a million  
stories to tell, Hall of Fame quarterback Sonny Jurgensen is a 
fixture at Redskin Park, an unofficial adviser for coaches and 
players -- especially quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurgensen's wisdom was much-needed in recent years as Heath  
Shuler and Gus Frerotte failed to master coach Norv Turner's 
complex game plans. Mondays seemed like an endless critical review 
of what went wrong -- until Brad Johnson showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Washington Redskins quarterback has been almost perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	``What does he need to ask me questions for?'' Jurgensen said.  
``He's playing as well as the position can be played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the bye week after four games, Johnson is having an MVP  
season. That's not just because of his incredible stats -- he might 
single-handedly save the jobs of most of the employees in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If Johnson leads the Redskins (3-1) to the playoffs, new owner  
Dan Snyder might not fire the coaching staff and clean house. And 
if Johnson and the league's top-ranked offense continue to put up 
37 1/2 points and 412 1/2 yards per game, he'll help hide the 
embarrassment of a defense allowing a league-worst 29 1/2 points and 
433 1/2 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first two years here, I thought we had a quarterback,''  
defensive end Kenard Lang said. ``Until I saw Brad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brimming with composure and confidence, Johnson has completed 63  
percent of his passes and has nine touchdowns with no 
interceptions. His 119.9 rating is second to Kurt Warner of the St. 
Louis Rams. Neither Shuler nor Frerotte ever led the Redskins to a 
fourth-quarter comeback victory; Johnson has done it two straight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows what he's doing and he takes control,'' Jurgensen  
said. ``He's a leader on the field. That's something the Redskins 
haven't had offensively in the last five or six years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Redskins are playing wild football, with final scores of  
41-35, 50-21, 27-20 and 38-36. It's easy to panic when the fourth 
quarter gets crazy, but that's when Johnson seems to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're up in the stands, you feel your hands are sweaty,''  
Johnson said, reflecting the game-winning drive in last week's 
38-36 win over Carolina. ``I had 10 people call me on the cell 
phone after the game, and eight of them said they about had a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it's a different feeling. Things were slow. I felt  
very comfortable. It seemed like in that last drive, everything 
kind of slowed down. I hit a few game-winning jump shots in high 
school. You want to define the moment, but you don't want to say 
your whole livelihood's on this one play, one drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is something kind of special.''  
</P>
<P>
	When the Redskins traded three drafts picks to Minnesota for  
Johnson in February, the big concern was his durability after an 
injury-riddled season with the Vikings. Johnson had surgery on his 
knee in May, still ices it down two to three hours a day and was 
given less work this week in practice to help ease the soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	But the injury hasn't been noticeable during games. Johnson has  
an uncanny ability to step out of the way of a blitz at the last 
possible second. Johnson has been sacked a half-dozen times this 
season, but his deft footwork has prevented at least a half-dozen 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that has impressed me about him is his awareness in  
the pocket,'' Jurgensen said, ``in feeling the rush and avoiding 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner also likes to talk about Johnson's awareness in the  
pocket. Watching the films, the coach notes how Johnson surveys the 
field while dropping back to pass, rather than waiting until he's 
in the pocket. That's not too difficult when the receivers are 
running short patterns, but Johnson can take in more than one 
option and still go deep without messing up the timing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have, in the past, gotten people open,'' Turner said.  
``When we get someone open now, he doesn't miss him. I don't think 
there are many people who throw the ball deep as accurately as Brad 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 31, Johnson's strength is his experience, but he still  
had to undergo some basic training when he arrived in Washington. 
As someone who made his name tutoring quarterbacks, specifically 
Dallas' Troy Aikman, Turner wants every mechanical part of the play 
to be perfect. The three-step drop, for example, must consist of 
one big step and two little steps -- and they must be done right. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very organized, the most organized person I've ever been  
around,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterback, in return, is helping to save Turner's  
reputation, which was hurt after his failures with Shuler and 
Frerotte and a bad breakup with veteran backup Jeff Hostetler last 
year. If the Redskins end their six-year postseason drought, the 
bulk of the thank-yous -- including the coach's -- will belong to 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``What he's done,'' Jurgensen said, ``is make everybody else  
better.''

<HEADLINE> Arizona 31, No. 22 S. Calif. 24 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Wrtier    	
</P>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Trung Canidate ran for 194 yards and a  
touchdown and Arizona offset its woeful kicking game with strong 
defense to defeat No. 22 Southern Cal 31-24 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10) had three of their seven sacks,  
an interception and scored on Kelvin Hunter's 24-yard fumble return 
after Canidate broke a 17-17 tie with an 11-yard TD run with 11:52 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-10) also had a defensive touchdown -- a  
44-yard fumble return by Antuan Simmons early in the second quarter 
-- and Mike Van Raaphorst threw TD passes of 18 yards to Windrell 
Hayes and 21 yards to Marcell Allmond. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allmond's score came with 28 seconds remaining. When the  
ensuing onside kick went out of bounds, Southern Cal's three-game 
winning streak against Arizona was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Keith Smith ran 57 yards for a TD and threw a 17-yard  
pass to Dennis Northcutt for another, directing an Arizona offense 
that gained 550 yards against an opponent that led the conference 
in every defensive category. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Mark McDonald had a 43-yard field goal, but missed two  
others to go 1-for-9 on the season. 
</P>
<P>
	His field goal in the second quarter was Arizona's first in six  
games, and gave the Wildcats a 10-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	David Newbury tied it with a 40-yard field goal just before  
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Bell intercepted Van Raaphorst with 10:49 left in the  
game, and the Wildcats marched within range of McDonald's second 
miss -- from 43 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans got the ball back with 9:21 remaining. But Joe  
Tafoya and Idris Haroon sacked Van Raaphorst on two of the next 
three snaps, and Southern Cal punted. 
</P>
<P>
	After an Arizona punt, Van Raaphorst tried to rally his team  
once more. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he was denied by Northcutt, Arizona's career  
receiving leader, who stepped in at cornerback to control Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Raaphorst threw two incompletions, a running play gained  
seven yards and Van Raaphorst fumbled the fourth-down snap. The 
ball was kicked around and wound up in Hunter's hands for the 
clinching TD. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trojans exceeded their first-half production when they  
marched 79 yards with the opening kickoff of the second half, and 
Hayes' scoring reception sent them to a 17-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats tied it again on a 17-yard pass from Smith to  
Northcutt with 41 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona needed only four plays to cover 95 yards for its first  
TD. Smith covered the final 57 yards on a draw 4:40 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith gained 22 yards on his next carry, but McDonald missed a  
41-yard field goal at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Cal linebacker Zeke Moreno, who scored on a fumble  
return and an interception return in a win over Oregon State last 
week, figured in his third defensive score in two games. He sacked 
Smith for 14 yards and caused him to fumble, and Simmons got the 
ball in the open and scored 52 seconds into the second quarter.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Boreanaz may be among the hottest hunks of  
the new television season as the 244-year-old vampire ``Angel,'' 
but his charm is vintage 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like a rugged, old-fashioned movie star. If this was the  
'50s, he might have changed his name to Rock,'' says 20th Century

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Sharpen Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their party loyalties Saturday in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away,'' the vice president said as the pair  
prepared for late-night addresses before Democratic activists. 
Bradley, a former New Jersey senator, suggested Gore resorted to 
attacks because he lacked vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that someone is confident in their own vision of  
the future, they don't need to resort to the darts,'' Bradley said. 
``I think I can talk about the future in a way that's compelling 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their appearance at the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner was  
their first joint meeting since Gore uprooted his campaign to 
Tennessee to counter Bradley's surge in polls. Since then, Gore has 
sought a scrappier, homespun image and he is more directly 
confronting Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away from the fight when (former Speaker) Newt  
Gingrich took over the Congress. I did not walk away from the fight 
when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I did not walk 
away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit,'' Gore said at 
a news conference, implying that Bradley turned away from Democrats 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996, two years after Republicans won  
control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also reminded Iowans that Bradley had voted against popular  
ethanol subsidies and other farm issues important to the states 
with the first presidential caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he were calling Bradley a quitter, Gore demurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a word I'd use to describe him,'' he said. ``Others  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley rejected any suggestions of disloyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Democrat since I cast my first vote in  
1964,'' said Bradley, who has suggested that Gore's centrist 
politics undermine his claim to the Democratic mantle. ``I am 
simply not going to deal with the darts that are being thrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has the backing of much of the party's establishment,  
especially in Iowa, the race has tightened and gotten new 
attention. A poll last week showed Bradley within a dozen points of 
Gore in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was taking advantage of his institutional support at every  
turn as he prepared for Saturday's event. The hall where the two 
will speak was turned into a sea of Gore campaign signs, drawing a 
chuckle from Bradley, a former professional basketball star with 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little bit like going into Boston Garden in  
the seventh game,'' said Bradley. ``You never know, you could turn 
around some of the Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his poll standings have improved, Bradley worked hard to  
play down expectations for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question we are up against entrenched power,''  
said Bradley. ``I don't have high expectations. We have to do OK.'' 
</P>

                        *AP Football Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Peter Warrick wasn't around, so Chris  
Weinke simply went to the next best option, and wide receiver Ron 
Dugans came through to bail out No. 1 Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugans turned a short pass into a 54-yard gain to set up Travis  
Minor's fourth-quarter 2-yard touchdown run that lifted the 
Seminoles to a 31-21 victory over No. 19 Miami on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Warrick, the Heisman Trophy favorite serving an indefinite  
suspension after his arrest on a grand theft charge of underpaying 
for designer clothes at a department store, watched his team 
struggle for three quarters before winning its 27th straight at 
Doak Campbell Stadium and 44th without a loss. Both streaks are the 
longest among major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	Dugans wasn't the only receiver who came to Weinke's rescue. In  
completing 23-of-34 for 332 yards, Weinke had first-half TD passes 
of 48 yards to seldom-used Germaine Stringer and 18 yards to tight 
end Ryan Sprague. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (6-0) has now beaten Miami (2-3) four years in a  
row, but this one was the toughest yet, especially without Warrick, 
who averages 154 all-purpose yards per game. Dressed in baggy blue 
jeans and a red golf shirt, Warrick paced the sideline cheering on 
his team and hoping his legal problems are cleared up next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly was sensational, hitting 27-of-41  
passes for 370 yards and three touchdowns, including two to Santana 
Moss, one an 80-yarder that tied the score 14-14 after one quarter. 
Moss finished with nine catches for 180 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Seminoles ahead 24-21 on Sebastian Janikowski's 38-yard  
field goal midway through the third quarter, Weinke led the 
Seminoles on a game-clinching 97-yard drive. After Dugans' 54-yard 
gain to the Miami 30, FSU moved down to the 13, when Miami's 
Leonard Myers was called for pass interference in the end zone 
against Dugans. 
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, from the Miami 3, Minor powered into the end  
zone and Florida State kept its national title hopes alive as 
80,976 fans broke into the Seminole War Chant. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor had 25 carries for 146 yards, with Dugans finishing with  
five catches for 80 yards and Stringer had three catches for 80 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without Warrick, the first half was filled with big plays --  
by both teams. Fittingly, it was 21-21 after 30 minutes, with the 
Hurricanes keeping the pressure on a shaky Florida State secondary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles opened a 7-0 lead on their second possession when  
Stringer, one of two replacements for Warrick, caught his 48-yard 
TD pass just 3:47 into the game. He beat Myers on a post pattern, 
caught the ball in stride at the 13 and scored untouched. When he 
returned to the bench, he was greeted by a towel-waving Warrick. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami, the last team to beat Florida State at Doak Campbell (in  
1991), wasted little time in pulling even. 
</P>
<P>
	King threw an 8-yard scoring pass to Reggie Wayne 3:08 later,  
the football sailing over the head of cornerback Mario Edwards in 
the left corner of the end zone and into the Hurricane receiver's 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles moved ahead 14-7, on Jeff Chaney's 3-yard TD run,  
and the Hurricanes responded on Kelly's 80-yard TD pass to Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles lost a scoring chance late in the first quarter  
when Dan Kendra fumbled at the Miami 10 and the Hurricanes Al 
Blades recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami took a 21-14 lead after an 89-yard march, with Kelly  
hitting Moss on a 6-yard TD, with Edwards again the beaten defender 
in the end zone. This time it was the Seminoles turn to even the 
score, with Weinke finding Sprauge behind Miami's linebackers on 
the 18-yard scoring pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments before kickoff, both teams had to be restrained from  
going at each other at midfield. One of the Miami players shouted 
something to a Florida State player, and both teams gathered near 
midfield, each forming a huge circle. All the players began jumping 
up and down in unison, jawing at each other, before coaches came 
over and broke things up.

<HEADLINE> Miami Protesters Snub Cuban Band </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A performance by one of Cuba's hottest bands drew  
thousands of anti-Castro protesters to Miami Arena Saturday night, 
with many waving flags, shouting slogans and denouncing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, believed to number between 4,000 to 7,500,  
outnumbered concertgoers, who numbered from 3,000 to 5,000, 
according to unofficial estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	After more than two hours of Afro-Cuban dance music by the  
popular group Los Van Van, ticket holders were escorted past 
jeering, refuse-throwing protesters angered that musicians popular 
in the Communist nation were allowed to perform in the heart of the 
Cuban exile community. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in riot gear kept the two sides from each other, and no  
clashes were reported after the concert. 
</P>
<P>
	After being warmly welcomed elsewhere during a tour of the  
United States, Los Van Van got the cold shoulder in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Demonstrators carried signs reading ``Castro: 40 years of  
dictatorship and 40 years of slavery'' and ``Van: Get out of 
Miami.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing against the music they play,'' said protester  
Luis Eseandal. ``This is about the Cuban government and Fidel 
Castro. That's why we're here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, a brief disturbance broke out between police and  
protesters when about a dozen demonstrators hopped the steel 
barricades and tried to run to the entrance of the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Police used pepper spray to control the rowdy group, and a  
handful of protesters were led away in handcuffs as supporters 
shouted their outrage. 
</P>
<P>
	A reporter was treated for a minor cut after being hit in the  
head by a rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Miami's Cuban-American community denounced Los  
Van Van as emissaries of Cuban President Fidel Castro, and the 
appearance got canceled, only to be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not telling the truth,'' said protester Mirta  
Oliva-Rios. ``This group is a representative of Fidel Castro. We 
don't need that here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami Mayor Joe Carollo and city Commissioner Tomas Regalado,  
both Cuban-born, last month vented their objections to the concert 
on Spanish-language radio, and the dispute generated thousands of 
calls to city hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue after the  
show's cancellation at another city-owned venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans of the failed 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba showed  
an anti-Castro film Saturday night a few blocks away, at the James 
L. Knight Center, the original site of the Los Van Van show, then 
made their way to the Arena to protest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cuban exile group Democracy Movement issued a statement  
Saturday objecting to the ``insincerity'' of allowing Los Van Van 
to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both sides pretend for us to accept on its face value their  
claim that they are leading a 'people to people contact' policy 
when in reality, Castro's Van come to Miami to play while our 
Gloria Estefan, Celia Cruz or Willie Chirino cannot go to Cuba to 
do the same,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Formell, who founded Los Van Van 30 years ago, rejected the  
label applied by opponents who call the group the ``official'' band 
of the Cuban government. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't do politics. We make music,'' Formell said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cultural exchange exemptions under the U.S. trade embargo allow  
Cuban bands to perform in the United States if they don't profit 
from the concerts.

<HEADLINE> Greenwood Lake Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Greenwood Lake likes to do it his way -- and that  
way is unnerving for a trainer and owner. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was the winning way Saturday as the colt came from way  
out of it to win the 1 1-16-mile Champagne for 2-year-olds at 
Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he takes himself back, but that's the way he  
likes to run,'' trainer Nick Zito said after his second straight 
victory in the Champagne. He won with The Groom Is Red last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just know he's not going to make it; he's too far back,''  
co-owner Joseph Cornacchia said of Greenwood Lake, who was last in 
the seven-horse field for the first three-quarters of a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jean-Luc Samyn, Greenwood Lake was 9 lengths behind  
with a little more than a quarter-mile remaining, but he was 2 1/2 
lengths ahead at the wire after charging past Chief Seattle with 
about 30 yards remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	In the race following the Champagne, Val's Prince took the lead  
just inside the eighth pole and won the 1 1/2-mile Turf Classic by a 
length over Dream Well for his second straight victory in a Grade I 
stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	While Greenwood Lake raced into the 2-year-old championship  
picture, favored More Than Ready finished a dismal fifth for his 
second straight loss after five straight victories that had made 
him the division leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwood Lake, winning for the second time in four starts,  
carried home scale weight of 122 pounds in 1:43 3-5 and paid 
$15.60, $5.10 and $3.20. He earned $240,000 from a $400,000 purse 
for owners Cornacchia, Dolores Conway and Fred Dematteis. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Seattle paid $3.90 and $3, and High Yield returned $2.60  
for show. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince, who won the Man o'War in his previous start,  
marked himself as the serious contender for the $2 million 
Breeders' Cup Turf on Nov. 6 at Gulfstream Park. Yagli, the 8-5 
favorite, was trapped on the hedge in the stretch and wasn't a 
factor in his second straight defeat after having won three 
straight stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Val's Prince, a 7-year-old gelding owned by Weiner Martin,  
carried home 126 in 2:28 3-5 and earned $360,000 from a purse of 
$600,000. He paid $8.10, $3.80 and $3. He is trained by James Bond, 
trainer of Behrens, the favorite for the $1 million Jockey Club 
Gold Cup Sunday at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought Val's Prince was the best turf horse in the  
country, Bond said, ``He sure looks that way to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France-based Dream Well, making his U.S. debut, returned $4.10  
and $3.60 after finishing neck in front of Fahris in the 
seven-horse field. Fahris paid $5.80.

<HEADLINE> Report: Brett on Rockies' List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Recent Hall of Fame inductee George Brett, the  
Kansas City Royals vice president of operations, is a candidate to 
replace Jim Leyland as manager of the Colorado Rockies, The Denver 
Post reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Dan O'Dowd, the Rockies new general manager, said  
Cincinnati Reds director of player development, Buddy Bell, remains 
the top candidate to replace Leyland who retired after one season 
in which Colorado finished 72-90, last in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, George Brett is an outstanding baseball person,''  
O'Dowd said. ``But to say anything more would be inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies need to get permission from the Royals to interview  
Brett, who has no coaching or managing experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing I've realized is that since I retired from baseball  
five years ago, I do miss it,'' the 46-year-old Brett said Friday 
from his suburban Kansas City home. ``I haven't done much in those 
five years, and I'm a very competitive person. I haven't been 
connected to any real business ventures. I feel my life slipping 
away a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``So after five years of slipping, I'm obviously very flattered  
that the Rockies have enough respect for me to consider me for such 
an important position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates being interviewed besides Bell and Brett  
include Rockies coaches Clint Hurdle and Rich Donnelly, and 
Cleveland hitting coach Charlie Manuel.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Damages Swell to $1.2B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARION, Ill. (AP) -- State Farm, already reeling from a $456  
million judgment earlier this week, was ordered to pay an 
additional $730 million in damages for using generic replacement 
parts to restore customers' cars to pre-accident condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamson County Circuit Judge John Speroni found Friday that  
State Farm had deliberately deceived its customers about the 
quality of aftermarket parts, modeled on manufacturers' originals 
but made without access to factory specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say they are not as good as those made for automakers.  
</P>
<P>
	In total, State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, has  
been socked with a nearly $1.2 billion judgment over its policy on 
auto-body repair parts. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawyers representing State Farm policyholders said the  
monetary award is secondary to the class action lawsuit's primary 
goal: to expose State Farm's practices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, getting a large corporation financially is not as  
important as exposing their fraud,'' said lawyer Patricia 
Littleton. ``That's the best part of this whole case -- they've been 
exposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm chairman and CEO Edward Rust Jr. promised an appeal  
of both verdicts and said the company was ``astonished'' by 
Friday's decision. The $456 million decision on Monday on a 
breach-of-contract claim was already considered to be the largest 
ever against an insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Speroni said State Farm violated its trust with 4.7 million  
policyholders by deliberately adopting a term he called misleading 
-- ``quality replacement parts'' -- to refer to aftermarket parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Speroni awarded $130 million to policyholders in compensation  
for the savings State Farm realized by its use of aftermarket 
parts. A $600 million punitive damages award was intended to deter 
State Farm from continuing deceiving its customers about the parts, 
the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Current and former policyholders who could have claims against  
the company would get an average of $100 each under the 
breach-of-contract judgment. It was unclear how many plaintiffs are 
affected by the consumer fraud judgment, or what their average 
share would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Rust said the consumer-fraud finding was particularly troubling  
because State Farm abides by regulations on use of aftermarket 
parts in every state where it does business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's been decided that by abiding by those regulations we  
have violated the law,'' he said at a news conference at the 
company's headquarters in Bloomington. ``That just doesn't make 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven other insurers are facing similar claims in at  
least 13 lawsuits filed around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analysts said it was unclear whether other companies  
might suspend use of aftermarket parts. But Steve Goldstein, a 
spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute, the nonprofit 
communications arm of the insurance industry, said none of the 
major insurers so far have indicated they had any plans to change 
their policies. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm and insurance industry groups say the move to suspend  
use of aftermarket parts will result in higher premiums and higher 
repair costs if allowed to stand. The insurance industry offered 
scathing criticism of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is not a good day for anybody but a handful of  
plaintiff lawyers and major stockholders in the three major car 
companies,'' said Kirk Hansen, director of claims for the Alliance 
of American Insurers, a trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	State Farm told its policyholders that parts used by the company  
are certified by an independent testing agency, meet high quality 
standards and meet the company's contractual obligation to restore 
a car to its pre-accident condition using parts of ``like kind and 
quality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in a 1997 memo introduced as evidence, a State Farm  
executive wrote, ``We may well say it is like kind and quality, but 
the bottom line is that it is not the same.''

<HEADLINE> Romanians Lead Gymnastics Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIANJIN, China (AP) -- Andreea Raducan floated and Maria Olaru  
flew, overshadowing star teammate Simona Amanar as defending 
champion Romania took the lead today in women's team qualifying at 
the World Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Romanians have lost 1997 triple gold medalist Gina Gogean to  
retirement, but Raducan stepped in serenely, scoring 9.812 on the 
balance beam and 9.800 in the floor exercises, where she sometimes 
seemed to barely touch the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Olaru's best was a 9.787 on the floor, but her consistency put  
her into the individual lead with 38.792 to 38.755 for Raducan and 
38.467 for Amanar, the 1997 all-around silver medalist, who scored 
9.812 on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Next best of the individuals was Czech gymnast Jana Komrskova  
with 38.137. The top 36 women advance to the competition for the 
all-around gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1997 bronze medalist China and a strong U.S. team yet to  
compete on Sunday, Romania led with 154.394 points to 153.576 for 
the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia, the 1997 runner-up, was a close second thanks to a saucy  
performance by defending individual champion Svetlana Khorkina, who 
sometimes appeared to be using conjuring tricks to flip from place 
to place. 
</P>
<P>
	She gained the day's best score, 9.837, on the uneven bars.  
</P>
<P>
	Third was Ukraine with 151.970, followed by Suatralia with  
150.688. Spain had 150.407, France 149.451 and Britain 146.982.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Sluggers Silenced by N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- The Texas Rangers exited the 1999 AL  
playoffs just as they had in their two previous playoff appearances 
-- with scarcely a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL West champs, who hit a major league-high .293 and scored  
945 runs during a 95-victory regular season, were the same old 
Rangers in the playoffs, unnerved and outclassed by the New York 
Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' lineup provided another futile performance Saturday  
night, managing only five hits against Roger Clemens and two 
relievers as the Yankees completed a three-game sweep of the first 
round with a 3-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second consecutive year, Texas scored only one run in  
three games against New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no jinx,'' said Rafael Palmeiro, who went 3-for-11 --  
all singles -- after hitting .324 with 47 homers and 148 RBIs during 
the season. ``You can say whatever. We didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't as good as I tried to be and I wasn't as good as I  
wanted to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers hit .141 in last year's sweep and batted just .152  
(14-for-92) this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sheer fact that people are thinking they have to do  
something different causes them to press and squeeze the bat,'' 
said Todd Zeile, who went 0-for-3 and grounded out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I saw in New York. Once we started falling behind,  
we felt the weight of the monkey, which has turned into a 400-pound 
gorilla,'' he said. ``We've said try a little easier. You have to 
relax to be successful at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, Rangers pitching was good enough to win if only the  
bats had shown up. Starter Esteban Loaiza gave up a three-run homer 
to Darryl Strawberry in the first, but shut New York out on three 
hits before giving way to reliever Jeff Zimmerman in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	As they had in the first two games, Rangers hitters made it easy  
on New York by showing little patience. The Yankees outscored Texas 
14-1 in the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a few months to analyze what happened this playoff  
and see how we can score at will pretty much in the season and then 
in three games not even smell home plate,'' Texas manager Johnny 
Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think sometimes we got confused,'' he said. ``We had a bunch  
of people telling people to be more patient, be more patient. ... 
We did something right for the first 162 games. Now, why did we 
have to change it for the next three?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' first at-bat with a runner in scoring position came in  
the fourth, when Lee Stevens grounded out weakly on the first 
pitch. The next Texas baserunner was Rusty Greer, who walked in the 
sixth. Slugger Juan Gonzalez followed with a dribbler to first and 
Palmeiro ended the inning by grounding Clemens' second pitch back 
to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Goodwin opened the eighth with a single off Jeff Nelson.  
Mariano Rivera came on and got Mark McLemore to line into a double 
play and struck out Ivan Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer led off the ninth with a single and went to second on a  
wild pitch. Gonzalez flied out, Palmeiro popped out and Zeile made 
the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas' vanishing offense has already become a tradition in the  
team's brief playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
	Since a 6-2 victory over the Yankees in Game 1 of the 1996  
division series -- the first postseason game in team history -- the 
Rangers have lost nine consecutive playoff games to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearly all the losses, Texas has been virtually unable to  
touch Yankees pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	New York manager Joe Torre said what many at The Ballpark were  
thinking: ``Obviously, when they've had trouble beating us, you 
know there's a psychological thing going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deep freeze affected even the Rangers' best hitters. Greer,  
a career .309 hitter, hit .091 in 1998's playoff disaster and had 
just one hit this series. Gonzalez, a two-time AL MVP, went 
1-for-12 in last year's series and 2-for-11 this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Greer said. ``You work all year to get there,  
then it's three and you're out.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Victim Parents Expand Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for the parents of a student killed at  
Columbine High School said Saturday he plans to expand the family's 
wrongful death lawsuit to include at least one gun manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger of Michigan said that Florida-based Navegar and  
a subsidiary, Intratec, which made the TEC-DC9 semiautomatic pistol 
used during the April 20 attack, likely would be named as 
defendants within two weeks. He said the companies' marketing 
practices were designed to make the weapon attractive to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt it could be used by legitimate hunters for legitimate  
purposes,'' Fieger said. ``It's marketed as being made of an alloy 
that doesn't carry fingerprints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger represents Michael and Vonda Shoels, whose son Isaiah was  
among 12 students killed by teen-age gunmen Dylan Klebold and Eric 
Harris in their attack on the school. Harris and Klebold also 
killed one teacher before turning their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoels family spokesman Sam Riddle said Friday that Fieger and  
Colorado co-counsel Jack Beam were heartened by a California 
appeals court decision last week that reinstated a lawsuit against 
Navegar and Intratec. 
</P>
<P>
	That suit involves the TEC-DC9 a gunman used to kill eight  
people and wound six in a San Francisco office building in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shoelses in May sued the parents of Klebold and Harris,  
saying they should have known their sons were amassing a cache of 
guns and bombs to use in the attack. The lawsuit seeks $250 million 
in damages.

<HEADLINE> Womack's Woes Cost Diamondbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just when it seemed like the Diamondbacks would  
be going back to Arizona for a deciding fifth game with Randy 
Johnson on the mound, Tony Womack helped send them home for the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, whose infield single keyed an eighth-inning rally that  
gave Arizona a 3-2 lead, dropped a fly ball in the bottom half of 
the inning that helped the New York Mets tie the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets eventually won it 4-3 on Todd Pratt's homer in the 10th  
inning to take the best-of-5 first-round series 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	So instead of playing behind the most dominating pitcher in the  
league in a deciding game, Womack will be reliving a woeful series 
all offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks' leadoff hitter went 2-for-17 in the series and  
was outclassed by Mets counterpart Rickey Henderson, who hit .400 
with six stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pitched me tough all series,'' Womack said. ``They tried  
to keep me off the bases and they did that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Womack's blunder in the field that will haunt him  
most. 
</P>
<P>
	With a runner on first and no outs in the eighth, John Olerud  
hit a high drive to deep right-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack, who had moved to right field from shortstop to start the  
eighth, appeared to misjudge it at first as it carried to the 
warning track. He got under it, but closed his glove early and the 
ball bounced off, putting runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
	``No excuses,'' he said. ``I just dropped the ball. I've been  
moving from infield to outfield all year and it hasn't been a 
problem. I didn't execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Cedeno hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game.  
</P>
<P>
	Womack, who made two errors in 258 chances in the outfield in  
the regular season, also committed an error in right field in the 
Mets' sixth-run sixth inning Friday night. He played over 100 games 
in the outfield this season compared to a total of about 50 games 
at second base and shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony is one of the big reasons we are here today,'' manager  
Buck Showalter said. ``I think it would be very unfeeling of me or 
anyone else to forget that. I know I won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, who were fourth in the league in fielding  
percentage this year, made four errors in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the eighth-inning miscue, this had been Womack's best game  
of the series. He made a diving stop in the hole at shortstop to 
rob Todd Pratt of a single in the fourth and probably saved a run. 
</P>
<P>
	With two outs and a runner on first in the top of the eighth,  
Womack reached on an infield single when second baseman Edgardo 
Alfonzo bobbled a grounder up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bell followed with a two-run double off Armando Benitez to  
give Arizona a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Diamondbacks couldn't hold it in the eighth and lost it  
in the 10th, bringing an end to a season that saw them win 100 
games in the regular season and win the NL West in just their 
second year.

But as flood victims across southeastern Mexico urged the president

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their political loyalties Saturday in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. Specifically, Gore 
criticized Bradley for leaving the Senate in 1996, two years after 
Republicans won control of Congress. ``I've always been a Democrat 
since I cast my first vote in 1964,'' said Bradley, who has 
suggested that Gore's centrist politics undermine his claim to the 
Democratic mantle. While Gore has the backing of much of the 
party's establishment, a poll last week showed Bradley within a 
dozen points of Gore in Iowa.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Meeting on Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The numbers are clear -- if not a bit astounding.  
</P>
<P>
	Hispanics now make up about 11 percent of the U.S. population,  
half of them younger than age 20. That means that by 2050, one of 
every four Americans will be of Hispanic descent, according to U.S. 
Census estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	With such figures in mind, Hispanic leaders are eager to groom  
young talent to add political clout to their numbers. Some of the 
most prominent leaders are meeting here this weekend, at the U.S. 
Hispanic Leadership Conference, to find it. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 8,000 people -- most of them between the ages of 18  
and 34 -- have signed up for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to high school students Friday, former Housing  
Secretary Henry Cisneros said that because the Hispanic population 
is expected to grow so much in their lifetimes, a great deal of 
responsibility is on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want us to be a poor, hostile, angry, uneducated  
population in America. ... You can be the ones to break the 
pattern,'' he said. ``Can you do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In response, the students broke into uproarious applause.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisneros is now head of Univision, a major Spanish-language  
television network. He was one of many Hispanic leaders who 
encouraged conference attendees to go to college, register to vote 
and organize politically -- all goals backed up at the conference by 
workshops and a college and job fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to keep people accountable,'' said Cisneros. ``We  
also, from time to time, have to defend ourselves when people come 
after us just because we are Latino.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Cisneros, officials attending the conference  
included everyone from Aida Alvarez, head of the U.S. Small 
Business Administration, to Raymond Anrecio, a manager at General 
Motors' Public Policy Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being here, I feel everyone is a role model. All of them give  
me good goals,'' said Davina Gonzalez, an 18-year-old high school 
senior from Santa Ana, Calif., one of many to swarm Cisneros to get 
photos or autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez -- who wants to be a child psychologist and made her  
first plane trip to take part in the conference -- said being chosen 
to participate was inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me very proud. It makes me feel like I will be able  
to be happy -- to live in a nice house with a yard, to have a family 
and to be able to buy them things they need,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Professors Remember Loyalty Oath </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- James Cherville was embarking on a  
teaching career at Berkeley in the chill of the Cold War when the 
edict came down: Sign an anti-Communist loyalty oath or get out. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to sign, but not before some soul-searching -- ``I had  
a wife and kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Teaching assistant Ralph Giesey also refused the oath and was  
fired. When he was offered a second contract, he felt he had no 
choice but to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the TAs there wasn't much choice. Even the assistant  
professors who did not have tenure -- it was quite a peril to lose 
the job,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giesey and his colleagues would work under the oath for three  
years before the California Supreme Court in 1952 ordered that 
those who had refused to sign be reinstated, and it would take 
years afterward for the fear and mistrust that had spawned similar 
loyalty oaths across the nation to begin to dissipate. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherville, Giesey and dozens of other loyalty oath veterans  
gathered on the Berkeley campus last week -- half a century after 
being forced to chose between pay and principles -- to reminisce 
about the days the Cold War wrapped chilly tentacles around the 
academic towers of the University of California system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the great mysteries of the University of California is  
this,'' said former UC President Clark Kerr, then a junior faculty 
member who signed the oath but went on to champion non-signers. 
``How could it be that the ... university could have been so 
triumphant academically and also been convulsed by academic 
turmoil?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil began when UC regents, acting on a proposal by UC  
President Robert Gordon Sproul, demanded that employees sign an 
oath disavowing any party advocating the overthrow of the 
government. That was later revised to an oath denying membership in 
the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, regents fired 31 faculty members who refused to sign --  
not because they were Communists, but because they believed it 
infringed on academic independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those axed was UCLA physicist David Saxon.  
</P>
<P>
	``In 1949, the first Russian atomic bomb was tested, and in 1949  
we had the University of California loyalty oath,'' Saxon said at 
the Berkley symposium last week. ``On that scale, the University of 
California loyalty oath was pretty small potatoes, but it was 
nonetheless an important event and it was a very disruptive 
event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saxon, who was later reinstated and in 1975 became UC president,  
said he wasn't motivated to rebel against the oath because of 
ideology but because he saw a breakdown in university government. 
Sproul may have had good intentions, he said, but he failed to 
``follow his solemn responsibility to shield the university from 
external forces and pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over the loyalty oath ended legally in 1952 after  
some non-signers sued and the state Supreme Court ruled they should 
be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	The regents rescinded the loyalty oath, but for several years  
afterward, UC employees were required to sign a state oath 
declaring they did not belong to any organization advocating the 
overthrow of the United States and listing any such groups to which 
they had belonged in the previous five years. State and federal 
courts later ruled it violated the freedom of speech and 
association. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after 50 years, the loyalty oath affair still casts a  
shadow -- it has been invoked recently by scientists fighting a 
proposal to require widespread polygraph testing at the nuclear 
weapons labs UC manages. 
</P>
<P>
	For those who were on campus in 1949, the struggle changed their  
views of government and their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherville, now 79, had planned to start a career teaching at  
Berkeley's extension branch when he was confronted with the oath. 
</P>
<P>
	He had worked with German prisoners of war while in the Army and  
was ``very suspicious'' of government-mandated oaths, he said, so 
he refused to sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt hypocritical after dealing with that kind of  
situation,'' he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Things worked out for Cherville. He was hired by the California  
College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland, taught at San Francisco 
State University, and became an English professor at Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	But he remembers vividly the year when his future seemed to hang  
on a signature. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very tough decision, but one I felt I had to make,''  
he said.

<HEADLINE> Teen Fatally Shot on Subway Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A 16-year-old boy was shot to death during a  
robbery attempt aboard a subway train, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with the Friday night  
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Eduardo Garcia was charged with murder, attempted robbery,  
weapons possession and criminal use of a firearm in the killing of 
Hansel Henriques, said police spokesman Officer Chris Cottingham. 
Police were seeking a second suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Henriques was shot in the face by one of two gun-toting bandits  
aboard the No. 2 train as it approached s station at 149th Street 
and Third Avenue in the Bronx, Cottingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after the 11  
p.m. shooting Friday. According to Cottingham, the victim was in 
the last car of the train when he was approached by Garcia and a 
second man. 
</P>
<P>
	When they displayed a gun and demanded the victim's chain,  
Henriques apparently refused and words were exchanged, Cottingham 
said. The victim was then shot once in the face.

<HEADLINE> Test Lets Companies Inspect Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government meat inspector's job has not  
changed for generations. All day long, inspectors sit in one place 
along a production line, poking each chicken or hog or cow carcass 
passing by as they look for defects, stray feathers or hair, and 
telltale signs of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department thinks that is a waste of time so it  
is testing a new system in which plant employees do most of the 
hands-on examination -- mostly looking for bruises and the like that 
have nothing to do with human health, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea is to free government inspectors so they can focus on  
potential hazards to human health such as salmonella and fecal 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Equipped with two-way radios, department employees can start  
moving along the lines to ensure the machinery is working properly 
and can conduct more extensive sampling of the meat. Some 
inspectors also can check meat in warehouses and other distribution 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental system started Oct. 4 at a poultry plant in  
Alabama. Additional poultry and pork plants will be added in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We clearly need to do something more effective, and the new  
system holds out some opportunity for that,'' said Carol Tucker 
Foreman, coordinator of the Safe Food Coalition, a consumer group. 
She oversaw the department's inspection program during the Carter 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no downside. The public continues to have inspectors  
in the plant at all times, doing more to protect health than they 
were before the pilot project.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Department inspectors are not so sure.  
</P>
<P>
	The American Federation of Government Employees, which  
represents 7,000 inspectors, has sued the Agriculture Department, 
contending the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1907 requires that 
the agency physically examine every meat and poultry carcass after 
it is slaughtered. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and other critics of the program say the department  
essentially is allowing companies to police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reducing public health standards and safeguards does not  
qualify as food safety reform,'' said Tom Devine, legal director of 
the Government Accountability Project, a whistleblowers group. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge refused last month to stop the pilot project,  
agreeing with the department that the law did not require 
inspectors to handle every carcass so long as they kept an eye on 
the meat. The union is appealing the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is part of a prevention-oriented initiative by the  
Clinton administration that is putting more responsibility on 
processors to reduce food-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies are required to identify key points in the  
manufacturing and packing processes where food can be contaminated, 
and then adopt new procedures and get new equipment to prevent 
potential contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 76 million people are sickened and 5,000 die each  
year from food poisoning. That includes 1.4 million cases and 600 
deaths from salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty chicken, turkey and pork plants have agreed to be part of  
the program. An independent lab will test the meat before the new 
program is started and after it has been running for a while to 
determine whether contamination levels have been reduced. So far, 
no beefpackers have volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
	The program can increase plants' expenses, but that is the cost  
of guaranteeing food safety, said Philip Clemens, president of 
Hatfield Quality Meats Inc., a Pennsylvania pork processor that 
volunteered for the program. ``Consumers both expect it and demand 
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project started off without a hitch at the Gold Kist Inc.  
poultry plant in Guntersville, Ala., said John Huie, the 
Agriculture Department's inspector-in-charge at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's allowed us to focus more on food safety and public health  
issues in the plant,'' said Huie, a veterinarian 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, one of the most modern of 10 that Gold Kist operates,  
used to depend on the inspectors to find cosmetic defects, such as 
bile stains, or signs of poultry diseases that were of no danger to 
humans, he said. Now plant workers are doing that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no incentive (for the company) to remove some of  
these quality defects. They would send every carcass and let us 
make a decision,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has cut its staff at the plant from 18 to 12. The  
six inspectors were moved to other plants in the area where the 
department had vacancies.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Showdown in Speeches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley tangled over  
their political loyalties Saturday in a rare showdown of Democratic 
presidential candidates, with the vice president suggesting his 
rival abandoned the party in its darkest hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' Gore  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, for his part, warned that voters are demanding that  
politicans stick to the high road. ``It takes discipline to be 
positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore used his speech to confront Bradley directly with his  
challenge to debate weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about it, Bill?'' said Gore, moving from behind the  
lectern to gesture to the former New Jersey senator sitting in the 
audience. Bradley merely smiled in return. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's speech was an earnest, serious look at the future of  
the Democratic Party, while Gore abandoned the lectern to wander 
the stage, gesturing energetically during a more passionate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore questioned Bradley's commitment to core Democratic issues,  
and Bradley suggested the vice president resorted to attacks 
because he lacked vision. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that someone is confident in their own vision of  
the future, they don't need to resort to the darts,'' Bradley said. 
``I think I can talk about the future in a way that's compelling 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Bradley acknowledged Gore's challenge to debate  
without committing to any timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great pleasure to be with you on the same platform for  
the first time,'' Bradley told the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance at the annual Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner was  
the candidates' first joint meeting since Gore uprooted his 
campaign to Tennessee to counter Bradley's surge in polls. Since 
then, Gore has sought a scrappier, homespun image and he is more 
directly confronting Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sat in separate sections of a large hall where the  
fund-raiser was held, but both worked the room and met briefly, 
shaking hands and exchanging greetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not walk away from the fight when (former Speaker) Newt  
Gingrich took over the Congress. I did not walk away from the fight 
when Reaganomics was put up for a vote on the floor. I did not walk 
away from the fight when farmers needed farm credit,'' Gore said at 
a news conference, implying that Bradley turned away from Democrats 
every time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never turned my back on the Democratic Party,'' the vice  
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley left the Senate in 1996, two years after Republicans won  
control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also reminded Iowans that Bradley had voted against popular  
ethanol subsidies and other farm issues important to the states 
with the first presidential caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he were calling Bradley a quitter, Gore demurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a word I'd use to describe him,'' he said. ``Others  
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley rejected any suggestions of disloyalty.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been a Democrat since I cast my first vote in  
1964,'' said Bradley, who has suggested that Gore's centrist 
politics undermine his claim to the Democratic mantle. ``I am 
simply not going to deal with the darts that are being thrown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore has the backing of much of the party's establishment,  
especially in Iowa, the race has tightened and gotten new 
attention. A poll last week showed Bradley within a dozen points of 
Gore in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was taking advantage of his institutional support at every  
turn as he prepared for Saturday's event. The hall where the two 
will speak was turned into a sea of Gore campaign signs, drawing a 
chuckle from Bradley, a former professional basketball star with 
the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a little bit like going into Boston Garden in  
the seventh game,'' said Bradley. ``You never know, you could turn 
around some of the Boston fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While his poll standings have improved, Bradley worked hard to  
play down expectations for his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question we are up against entrenched power,''  
said Bradley. ``I don't have high expectations. We have to do OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates were relishing a competitive race they said will  
serve the eventual nominee well against the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a real opportunity for us, whichever one of us emerges  
from the primary to be stronger because of the competition,'' 
Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both candidates walked Democratic precincts before their  
addresses, adding a grass-roots touch to their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Um, who are you?'' 7-year-old Robert Buell asked, tapping Gore  
on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm Vice President Al Gore,'' the vice president said with a  
laugh. ``Who are you?''

<HEADLINE>  India PM Seeking Consensus on Gov't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Fresh from his solid election victory,  
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India said he will seek a 
consensus among all parties to bring about economic and political 
changes, a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee's immediate concern will be to persuade opposition  
parties to allow India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, 
which successive governments have opposed. 
</P>
<P>
	His 13-month-old administration, which collapsed in April, also  
was unable to push through key bills to allow foreign insurance 
companies to set up shop in India after opposition parties stalled 
a vote in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time that the bitterness generated during the elections  
subsides. It is time that we created an atmosphere of consensus,'' 
Vajpayee told The Times of India newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong general elections were marked by bitter personal  
attacks, especially concerning the Italian ancestry of Vajpayee's 
main rival, Sonia Gandhi of the Congress party. Mrs. Gandhi, in 
turn, accused Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party of whipping up 
attacks on Muslim and Christian minorities and called his allies 
political opportunists. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee will be formally elected leader of his 22-party  
National Democratic Alliance on Sunday and he will then meet 
President K.R. Narayanan a day later to stake his claim to form the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Vajpayee faces the daunting task of pleasing all his allies in  
distributing Cabinet portfolios. Several parties have already 
sought key jobs for their lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Vajpayee said his government would like to  
quickly pass pending bills to reform the insurance sector, curb 
money laundering and streamline laws relating to foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest election, which concluded last week, Vajpayee's  
coalition won a clear majority, raising hopes that India would have 
a stable government for the first time in years. Four minority 
governments have fallen in three years.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Changes Training Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- After three fatal crashes, the Air Force is  
permanently grounding its T-3A Firefly training planes and turning 
its introductory flight training over to commercial flight schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Education and Training Command at Randolph Air Force  
base made the announcement on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new introductory training program, using Federal Aviation  
Administration-certified schools, is expected to save about $16 
million a year in operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	It also increases the training time for incoming pilots from 40  
hours to 50 hours and requires they earn a private pilot's license. 
After completing the introductory program, pilots enter the Air 
Force's undergraduate pilot training programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Firefly, a powerful British propeller plane capable of loops  
and other aerobatic maneuvers, has had reported problems with 
engine stalling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force Academy suspended the plane's use in 1997 after  
three cadets and three instructors died in Firefly crashes over a 
three-year period. Two of the crashes were blamed on pilot error, 
and the other remains unexplained, though Pentagon officials have 
said the instructor should have been able to recover the plane 
after it stalled. 
</P>
<P>
	The easily maneuverable planes had been used to assess if cadets  
could handle the rigors of jet school.

<HEADLINE> Mets Coach Ejected, Shoves Umpire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mets third-base coach Cookie Rojas shoved umpire  
Charlie Williams in the chest after being ejected in the eighth 
inning of New York's clinching 4-3 playoff victory over the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas was incensed after Williams, the left-field umpire, ruled  
that Darryl Hamilton's looping drive landed foul with two runners 
on and the game tied at 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed that Williams, who was rated the worst umpire in  
the NL by players last year, made the correct call. The Mets went 
on to win in the 10th inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Rojas ran from the coach's box to shallow left field to confront  
Williams and was immediately ejected. As the argument grew heated, 
manager Bobby Valentine sprinted out of the dugout to try to 
restrain Rojas. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach was arguing face-to-face with the umpire when  
Valentine arrived. He shielded Rojas from Williams, but Rojas 
fought through and pushed Valentine into Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	First-base coach Mookie Wilson also tried to help restrain  
Rojas. It didn't work, as Rojas broke free and pushed Williams with 
two hands in the chest. Rojas will likely be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine, Wilson and Robin Ventura -- who was on second base --  
finally restrained Rojas, who left the field to chants of ``Cookie, 
Cookie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine finished out the inning as third base coach -- the  
second time this season he has replaced Rojas for an inning 
following an ejection. Bruce Benedict took over in the ninth 
inning.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Attack Bush's Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Conservative candidates vying for the  
Republican presidential nomination criticized front-runner George 
W. Bush on Saturday for ``beating up on the conservatives'' and 
distancing himself from core GOP values. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern with Mr. Bush is what he's saying out there on the  
campaign trail,'' Pat Buchanan told about 1,000 people at the 
National Federation of Republican Assemblies convention. ``He's 
been beating up on the conservatives. He's been pandering to the 
media by beating up on us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan and fellow conservatives Gary Bauer, Steve Forbes and  
Alan Keyes preached tax reform, anti-abortion policy and family 
values to members of the public and 320 convention delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	A non-binding straw poll was won by Forbes, who received 380 of  
829 votes, or 45.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm absolutely delighted,'' Forbes said. ``I think it shows  
conservatives are rallying to my candidacy. This is going to become 
a race similar to 1980, where the conservatives fought the 
outsiders. The outsiders won in '80, and we're going do it again 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan came in second with 172 votes, or 20.8 percent,  
followed by Keyes with 149 votes and Bauer with 86 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA, founded in 1996, is a grass-roots conservative  
organization that bills itself as ``the Republican wing of the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the event, each candidate mentioned the Texas governor  
directly, criticizing Bush's stance on big government and his 
reluctance to require that all judge appointees oppose abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who skipped the convention along with GOP hopefuls John  
McCain, Elizabeth Dole and Orrin Hatch, received 35 votes. McCain 
and Dole received three each, and Hatch none. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said earlier in the week that Republicans were too often  
pessimistic and confused limited government with ``a disdain for 
government itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This governor in Texas is the pessimist in the race. He is  
running as a Bush Republican and I will proudly run as a Reagan 
Republican,'' Bauer said to a chorus of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer called Bush's comments ``a surrender'' to expansive  
government and a departure from conservative values. 
</P>
<P>
	``That obviously hit nerves with the Republican Party. Those are  
two issues that Republicans care a great deal about,'' he said. 
``If the governor keeps making speeches like that it's going to 
guarantee that we're going to have an open race that's going to go 
all the way to the convention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spent Saturday in Springfield, Mo., at a fund-raiser and  
cookout for Republican Rep. Roy Blunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Forbes, Bauer and Sen. Hatch traveled to Des  
Moines, Iowa, to stress their anti-abortion credentials before a 
gathering of the Iowa Right to Life convention. 
</P>
<P>
	All told the audience of about 250 that they would never abandon  
social issues such as abortion and euthanasia, and Forbes and Bauer 
said they would appoint only judges opposed to abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took a  
measured swipe at Bush's father, former President Bush, for his 
judicial appointments. ``To be honest with you, the most liberal 
pro-abortion judge on the Supreme Court was appointed by our last 
Republican president,'' he said in a reference to Justice David 
Souter. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kansas City convention, demands for comprehensive tax  
reform and anti-abortion Supreme Court justices drew wild cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, while pushing his proposed 17 percent flat tax, called  
for elimination of all individual taxes such as estate taxes, or as 
he put it, ``taxation without respiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes equated the tax reform movement to fighting slavery, and  
called for the abolition of the personal income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people go out and work for the money, the people ought to  
be the ones in control of the management of that money,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan both entered and left the stage to a chanting chorus of  
``stay, Pat, stay.'' Earlier this week, Buchanan said he was 
``leaning toward'' leaving the Republican Party to seek the Reform 
Party's presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan made no mention of the Reform Party during his  
20-minute speech. He canceled a news conference scheduled by the 
NFRA. His political director, Tim Haley, said Buchanan had been ill 
and had never promised to meet with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFRA delegates from 33 states will vote Sunday afternoon on  
one candidate the organization can back for the Republican 
presidential nomination. All candidates are on the ballot, and the 
group's bylaws require a two-thirds majority to earn NFRA backing.

<HEADLINE> Six Qualify for Euro Soccer Tourney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	World Cup champion France, Germany and Italy qualified for the  
European 2000 soccer championships Saturday, while England stayed 
in contention by squeezing into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Also gaining automatic spots in next year's tournament were  
Yugoslavia, Romania and Portugal. Playoff berths were secured by 
Denmark, Ukraine, Turkey and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of the day, the possibility existed that four of  
Europe's biggest soccer powers would fail to qualify for the 
16-team tournament in which the Netherlands and Belgium are 
co-hosts. 
</P>
<P>
	But France managed to win Group 4 by beating Iceland 3-2 and  
benefiting from a goalkeeping blunder that allowed Ukraine to gain 
a 1-1 tie with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	With two minutes left in regulation, Russian goalkeeper  
Alexander Filimonov mishandled a simple cross and fell backward. 
The ball slipped from his hands into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a personal catastrophe for me,'' Russian coach Oleg  
Romantsev said. ``We deserved a victory. A player of the quality 
like Filimonov's shouldn't miss such kicks and I will think twice 
before calling him to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italy labored to a 0-0 tie against Belarus in Minsk, but the  
result was enough to clinch Group 1. Denmark, which had already 
completed its qualifying campaign, finished one point behind Italy 
in second place and will go into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany, the defending European champion, finished atop Group 3  
by playing to a 0-0 tie with Turkey in Munich. Turkey settled for a 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a battle between bitter Balkan rivals, Yugoslavia tied  
Croatia 2-2 in Zagreb to win Group 8. Ireland threw away a chance 
to win the group by giving up a 90th-minute goal in Macedonia and 
will go to the playoffs instead. Croatia, third-place finisher at 
the 1998 World Cup, finished third in the group and was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Romania won Group 7 by beating Liechenstein 3-0, while Portugal  
downed Hungary 3-0 to claim an automatic qualifying spot as the 
best runner-up. The Portuguese finished with 23 points, three 
points ahead of the next best runner-up, Ukraine with 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic, which had already won Group 9, finished with  
a 10-0 record by beating the Faeroe Islands 2-0 in Prague. The 
Czechs, runners-up at the 1996 championships, are the first team 
European team ever to win all their qualifying games. 
</P>
<P>
	England got a reprieve when Sweden beat Poland 2-0 in Stockholm.  
The result ensured that England finished second in Group 5 and 
clinched a berth in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden already had qualified as a group winner and had nothing  
to play for Saturday. England needed a victory by Sweden, while 
Poland needed only a tie. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory left Sweden with 22 points. England and Poland both  
finished with 13 points, but England made the playoffs because of 
better head-to-head results. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, Spain and the Czech Republic had qualified as group  
winners. Belgium and the Netherlands qualified automatically as 
co-hosts. Scotland and Slovenia had clinched playoff spots. 
</P>
<P>
	The eighth and final playoff spot will be filled by Israel or  
Cyprus, both in contention for the runner-up spot in Group 6. That 
will be determined Sunday when Israel plays at Spain and Cyprus at 
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the playoffs is Wednesday in Aachen, Germany. The  
first-leg games are Nov. 13-14 and the second leg Nov. 17. The four 
winners advance to the championships.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soldiers Test Australians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Indonesian commandos have been carrying  
out patrols and probing the military capabilities of the 
Australian-led peacekeeping force, members of the force say, 
raising concern that such covert operations might lead to clashes. 
</P>
<P>
	The commandos are actively reconnoitering positions held by the  
peacekeeping force along the frontier separating East Timor, which 
has voted overwhelmingly for independence, and Indonesian-held West 
Timor, said foreign peacekeeping officers on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Such activity is often a prelude to an attack.  
</P>
<P>
	Several groups of soldiers, believed to be part of Indonesia's  
elite Kopassus special forces brigade, were observed conducting 
nighttime patrols around the foreign troops' positions near the 
town of Balibo this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were definitely soldiers, not militia,'' said Australian  
army Capt. Grant King on Thursday. King was on duty in Balibo and 
debriefed troops who spotted the infiltrators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians held their fire and the patrols eventually  
slipped back across the border to West Timor, he said. Australian 
soldiers on the spot confirmed that the patrols appeared to have 
been mounted by Kopassus troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers noted that the men were equipped with body  
armor, night-vision scopes and sophisticated automatic weapons 
issued only to Indonesian army elite troops. 
</P>
<P>
	The commander of the peacekeepers force, Australian Maj. Gen.  
Peter Cosgrove, today warned groups prowling around near his troops 
not to attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should not think they are unobserved. They should not  
think they are not vulnerable to a sanction if they were to take 
aggressive action,'' Cosgrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian generals have made extensive use of the crack  
Kopassus unit in recent years, particularly in a campaign to stamp 
out a separatist rebel movement in Aceh, the country's westernmost 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Although military analysts say its capabilities are limited --  
particularly when facing a modern, Western force such as the 
Australian army -- the brigade is the best that Indonesian has. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia has developed detailed information on the operations  
of the Indonesian military through years of military cooperation 
and intelligence gathering with its northern neighbor. Before 
bilateral relations soured over the crisis in East Timor, the 
nations conducted joint military exercises and were partners in a 
security treaty, now suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian soldiers are formally allowed to remain in East Timor  
until the national parliament ratifies the province's secession 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two remaining infantry battalions are restricted to the  
capital Dili, where they are barricaded inside government 
buildings. Their commander last week gave a ``100 percent 
guarantee'' that there were no Kopassus left in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a botched militia ambush on Wednesday of a convoy of  
peacekeepers in the southwest of East Timor bore the ``unmistakable 
imprint'' of a special forces operation, said a peacekeeping 
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two militiamen were killed and two Australian peacekeepers were  
slightly wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Assault rifles retrieved from the dead militiamen were both  
Indonesian army weapons: the Russian-built SKS, which has been 
phased out of service, and the Belgian FN, which is the standard 
infantry weapon today. 
</P>
<P>
	They are not available to civilians and can be obtained only  
from the army. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian military spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudradjat denied any  
Kopassus involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, Deputy U.N. Spokesman Manuel de Alameda e Silver  
said he had no knowledge of details of the ambush or who was 
involved. ``But of course, any action that is aimed at undermining 
the efforts of the MNF (multinational force) to restore security is 
of concern,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopassus -- along with the army's secretive intelligence bureau --  
is accused of organizing, training and arming the militia gangs 
last year to act as a counterweight to the pro-independence 
Falintil rebels who have fought Indonesian rule since the 
occupation of East Timor in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaked Indonesian army records showed a massive special forces  
buildup in East Timor last year, when the first militia gangs were 
set up, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. and The 
Australian newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Kopassus forces have been accused of engineering civil unrest  
and violence, and human rights groups claim Kopassus troops 
conducted a reign of terror in East Timor during 24 years of 
Indonesian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Human rights organizations also have blamed them for kidnapping  
dozens of pro-democracy activists during last year's protests that 
led to the ouster of Indonesia's longtime dictator Suharto. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, the unit has been among Indonesian troops  
participating in joint exercises with the U.S. military, despite a 
1992 ban on the training of Indonesia's armed forces imposed in 
reaction to the Southeast Asian country's poor human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials maintained the program was not  
covered by a law that bars Indonesian troops from taking part in a 
U.S. training program for foreign soldiers known as IMET. State and 
Defense department officials said the prohibition did not apply to 
the joint combined exercises carried out by the U.S. Pacific 
Command. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the U.S. Congress have questioned the U.S.  
training of Kopassus soldiers and officers, who they say received 
instruction from U.S. special operations advisers in skills like 
psychological warfare and reconnaissance missions. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month the administration suspended further military  
cooperation and arms sales to Indonesia after its armed forces 
allegedly instigated the campaign of violence that followed a vote 
for independence on Aug. 30.

<HEADLINE> Michigan St. Upsets Michigan 34-31 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Bill Burke had a vision about leading  
Michigan State past arch-rival Michigan. Still, he didn't see 
anything like this happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke passed for a school-record 400 yards and two touchdowns,  
and Plaxico Burress caught 10 passes for a school-record 255 yards 
and a score as the No. 11 Spartans held off the third-ranked 
Wolverines 34-31 Saturday in a showdown of Big Ten unbeatens. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of my keys is to visualize playing a good game,'' Burke  
said. ``I'm not sure I was thinking about 400 yards, though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The win left Michigan State, which began the season unranked,  
6-0 overall and 3-0 in the conference. The Wolverines, hoping for a 
second national title in three years, slipped to 5-1, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke completed 21 of 36 passes and became the first player to  
pass for 400 yards for Michigan State, breaking the mark of 369 by 
Ed Smith against Indiana in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had games where I felt better, but I just wanted to keep  
plugging away,'' Burke said. ``I just didn't want to do anything 
that could lose the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burress, who broke the school mark of 252 receiving yards by  
Andre Rison in the 1989 Gator Bowl against Georgia, wasn't about to 
let that happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``My motto is `Stay Dangerous'. I've got a new attitude,''  
Burress said. ``If I drop a pass, I just tell myself that the 
defense has to respect me, because they know I'll catch the next 
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The battle in the trenches, while not as glamorous, was just as  
important to the Spartans as the heroics of Burke and Burress. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, which had not allowed a rushing touchdown, went  
into the game allowing an average of just 42.8 yards per game on 
the ground. The Wolverines learned why, finishing with just six 
yards on 21 rushing attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan got school-record 396 of its 402 yards through the air,  
most of it on the arm of Tom Brady during a furious fourth-quarter 
comeback that came up short. The Spartans had 90 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just didn't put together four quarters of football,'' Brady  
said. ``We came on at the end, but to beat a team like this, you 
need to play 60 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, a senior who has battled highly touted sophomore Drew  
Henson for the quarterback job all season, played the first and 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Henson, who completed 6-of-12 for 111 yards, got the Wolverines  
their first touchdown on an 81-yard pass to Marcus Knight in the 
second quarter. But he wasn't able to move the offense in the third 
quarter and Brady brought the Wolverines back from a 27-10 deficit 
by directing three scoring drives in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady completed 30-of-41 for 285 yards, including two TD tosses.  
</P>
<P>
	The Spartans had dominated both sides of the ball until Brady  
got things going in the final quarter. The Wolverines rolled up 208 
yards during their fourth quarter blitz. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us up front and that was really where the game was  
won,'' Michigan coach Lloyd Carr said. ``They beat us on both sides 
of the ball and just did a tremendous job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State, behind the passing of Burke and big-play  
receptions by Burress, dominated the first two quarters, yet led 
just 13-10 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman T.J. Duckett scored on a 1-yard run and Paul Edinger  
kicked field goals of 39 and 43 yards in the first half for the 
Spartans. The Wolverines got a school-record 56-yard field goal by 
Hayden Epstein and Henson's bomb to Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan State kept the pressure on in the second half. Edinger  
missed a 44-yard attempt on the Spartans first possession, but with 
Burke and Burress hooking up for 17 yards, Michigan State drove 
49-yards in seven plays for a touchdown and a 20-10 lead on a 
19-yard TD toss from Burke to Gari Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Henson -- under a tremendous rush -- was picked off  
by Aric Morris who returned it 17 yards to the Michigan 18. Three 
plays later, Burke found Burress wide open in the end zone for a 
15-yard touchdown and a 27-10 lead with 3:02 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady replaced Henson on Michigan's next possession.  
</P>
<P>
	On his first drive, Brady completed 6-of-9 for 64 yards in an  
80-yard drive that ended in a 2-yard touchdown run by Anthony 
Thomas, closing the gap to 27-17 with 14:23 left in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't slow down Burke or the Spartans, however. Burke hit  
passes of 21 and 35 yards as Michigan State went 76 yards in six 
plays on its next possession, taking a 34-17 lead on a 14-yard 
scoring run by Dawan Moss. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, continuing the comeback quest, completed 8-of-8 for 75  
yards on Michigan's next possession, hitting David Terrell with a 
19-yard TD toss to make it 34-24 with 8:11 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Brady, hitting 9-of-11 for 86 yards, took the Wolverines 96  
yards on their next possession, hooking up with Aaron Shea for an 
8-yard touchdown, closing the gap to three points with 2:47 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	It was just the 12th time Michigan and Michigan State met when  
both were ranked by The Associated Press. Michigan had won the last 
five, but the Spartans now lead the series 6-5-1 in those 12 games 
</P>
<P>
	The higher ranked team has won nine of the 12 games, going  
9-2-1. The only other upset came in 1950 when Michigan State won 
14-7 in the first game of the season.

<HEADLINE> Nike Discloses Factory Locations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Pressured by university protests of  
sweatshop conditions, Nike has made public all the overseas and 
domestic factories that make T-shirts, hats and sweatshirts 
licensed by five major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The kids really moved the process along,'' said Joel Seguine,  
spokesman for the University of Michigan, one of the five 
universities that add their logos to clothing with the Nike swoosh. 
</P>
<P>
	The list applies to clothing sold in student stores or as  
general merchandise, not to equipment for athletic teams, which is 
under separate license. 
</P>
<P>
	Beaverton-based Nike disclosed the factory sites Thursday on its  
Web site, www.nikebiz.com, listing addresses where clothing is made 
for Michigan, Arizona, Duke, Georgetown and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web site listed 41 factories in 11 countries, including  
China, Bangladesh, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico and Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen factories were in the United States, mostly in  
the South. ``I'm sure that was a surprise to most people,'' said 
Vada Manager, Nike's director of manufacturing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The listing was welcomed by officials at all the schools.  
Several noted that Nike had made the disclosure well in advance of 
a March deadline the universities had set. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike Chairman Phil Knight offered to disclose the factory sites  
last March if the colleges required disclosure from all licensed 
manufacturers, which the schools have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists fighting sweatshop labor practices were quick to  
praise Nike, saying it would put pressure on other major athletic 
apparel and equipment companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's smart of them and I hope other companies will follow  
them,'' said Dan Hennefeld, a spokesman for United Students Against 
Sweatshops, a student coalition that has pushed for labor reform.

<HEADLINE> Bush Scolds Media for Intrusiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STORM LAKE, Iowa (AP) -- Former President Bush chided the news  
media Saturday for indulging in ``gotcha journalism,'' including 
the peppering of his son by queries about whether he has used 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been repeatedly asked about drug  
use as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president, speaking before nearly 700 people at a  
panel discussion with students at Buena Vista University, said 
``the national media has gotten too intrusive without reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people are a little tired of `gotcha journalism,'''  
Bush said. ``There's no accountability, and if you're a public 
figure, there's no recourse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, whose son won a straw poll in Ames this summer while  
positioning himself for the Iowa caucuses early next year, said he 
was a ``steadfast'' believer in freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	But he thinks reporters have gone overboard in the pursuit of  
his son and others in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said one newspaper, which he did not identify, made 150  
phone calls to his son's former college roommates, friends and 
others ``to find someone who would say they thought'' he used 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bush also said he thinks the media are beginning to  
rethink how they cover candidates and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of journalists are saying, `We have gone too  
far. We ought to be careful,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, he said the media are chasing a rumor and looking  
for a picture of his son supposedly dancing naked on top of a bar 
when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to change the world if such a picture exists,  
but George says it doesn't,'' the former president said to laughter 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush decried ``the ugly political climate'' and urged students  
not to give up on public service, whether running for office or 
volunteering at a local community center. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no definition of a successful life that doesn't  
include service to others,'' he said. ``I just hope that people, 
before they condemn everyone, will get involved in some way.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 3, Rangers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Of all the rebounds in Darryl  
Strawberry's career, this one tops the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry hit a three-run homer in the first inning and Roger  
Clemens made it stand up Saturday night, sending the New York 
Yankees into the AL championship series with a 3-0 victory over the 
Texas Rangers that capped a first-round sweep. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Strawberry announced he had colon cancer the day  
before New York played in Texas. The Yankees finished a first-round 
sweep the next day and dedicated the victory to their ailing 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	New York will start the ALCS at home Wednesday night against the  
winner of the Cleveland-Boston series. The Indians, whom the 
Yankees beat in six games last year on their way to the World 
Series title, lead the Red Sox 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Yankees, their 10th straight postseason win put them a  
step closer to their 25th Series championship and their third in 
four years. They also kept headed toward a Subway Series as the New 
York Mets advanced to the NLCS earlier Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clemens, his seven shutout innings of three-hit ball were  
certainly enough to placate Yankees fans who had been waiting, ever 
since he was acquired this spring from Toronto, for him to show the 
form that won five Cy Youngs. He earned his second postseason win 
in 10 starts, his other victory coming in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	And for the Rangers, this was another disappointing end as they  
lost their ninth straight playoff game -- all to the Yankees. This 
marked the second straight year hard-hitting Texas scored a total 
of one run in an opening-round sweep by New York. 
</P>
<P>
	This game was as good as over with two outs in top of the first  
when Strawberry went with a low and away breaking ball from Esteban 
Loaiza and sent it 415 feet into the left-center field stands for a 
3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At that point, the white towels waved by the 50,269 fans at The  
Ballpark to fire up the Rangers could've been a sign of surrender 
considering how bad their team was hitting. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring 5.83 runs per game in the regular season, the  
Rangers did nothing in this series, batting only .152 as a team. 
They hit .141 last year and overall have scored just two runs in 
their last 60 playoff innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Things were supposed to be different this time after the best  
season in team history. Instead, this game was the Rangers' worst 
of all. 
</P>
<P>
	They were held to five hits by Clemens, Jeff Nelson and Mariano  
Rivera and got only two runners past first base. Rivera pitched two 
innings for his second save of the series. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was locked in long before the game as he wowed  
teammates in batting practice by consistently reaching far-away 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, his incredible revival shouldn't be surprising. For  
all Strawberry has been through, the one consistent thing has been 
his sweet swing. It's the reason baseball keeps giving him second 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry even had another run-in during his comeback from  
cancer. An April arrest in Florida got him suspended for violating 
his aftercare program, delaying his return to the Yankees until the 
final month. 
</P>
<P>
	Another mid-1980s prodigy who came through was Clemens, who is  
seeking his his first World Series title to go with his individual 
pitching awards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket wasn't dominating, but he didn't have to be. He  
struck out two and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest inning was the first, and not because of the  
Rangers. What Clemens really was battling was eight days of rest 
and the emotions of his first playoff start in four years, plus the 
fact it was coming before dozens of friends and family in his home 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clemens handled it like a big-game pitcher is supposed to:  
He struck out leadoff hitter Mark McLemore looking on four pitches 
and needed just three more to retire the side. 
</P>
<P>
	His only jam was in the fourth when a two-out walk to Todd Zeile  
put runners on first and second. But Lee Stevens grounded out to 
first on the next pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	Loaiza, making his playoff debut, allowed only two runners to  
reach second after Strawberry's homer, both with two outs. In seven 
innings, he allowed five hits, three runs and a walk while striking 
out four. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Rangers were 0-for-13 with runners in scoring position  
in the series. ... Derek Jeter reached third base in a bizarre way 
in the first when a long fly to left popped off the top of the 
wall. Unsure whether it was a homer, Jeter ran it out only to run 
into second baseman McLemore after rounding second. The play was 
ruled a triple. ... Unable to get hits off Clemens, Tom Goodwin and 
Juan Gonzalez hit balls that hit him. Both turned into outs at 
first. ... Yankees manager Joe Torre wouldn't say whether David 
Cone, who would've started Game 4, would be his Game 1 starter in 
the ALCS. ... Former Dallas Cowboys star Roger Staubach took his 
ceremonial first pitch so seriously that he warmed up and took a 
glove to the mound. Sure enough, the toss had some zing to it. ... 
Zeile committed his second error of the series on a smash to third 
by Joe Girardi in the fifth. He made up for it by diving into foul 
ground to stop Chad Curtis' grounder, then throwing out the speedy 
runner. ... With losses by the Rangers and Houston Astros, there's 
no chance for a Texas vs. New York finals in baseball as there was 
in the NHL, NBA and WNBA this season. Teams from the Lone Star 
State won the other three. ... The Yankees won 12 straight 
postseason games -- all in the World Series -- from 1927-32. ... 
Texas was shut out seven times in the regular season, and twice by 
the Yankees in the playoffs. ... Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill 
did not play because of a bruised side. He should be OK for the 
ALCS.

<HEADLINE> Astros Look Forward to New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Forget about any sentimentality from the Houston  
Astros about playing for the last time at the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the greatest pleasures I have from all of this series  
is the fact that we've played our final game in the Astrodome,'' 
manager Larry Dierker said Saturday after Atlanta beat Houston 7-5 
to win their NL playoff matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe new Enron Field with its inviting grass playing surface  
will be more hospitable to the Astros. Houston never got past the 
first round of the playoffs in 35 years at the Dome, and its chance 
this year was ended in four games by the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the days go by, there is a lot of frustration where we've  
been the last three years,'' Dierker said. ``We are really looking 
forward to being at Enron Field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros packed up for the move to their $250 million  
retractable roof stadium without remorse. A crowd of 48,553, about 
6,000 short of capacity, watched the wrapup at the ballpark called 
the Eighth Wonder of the World when it opened in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Astrodome surface has never been a friend to the players'  
knees, backs and joints,'' third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``Also, 
the ball doesn't have the lift and carry that it does outdoors. I'm 
looking forward to the grass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros have won the NL Central three straight years, but  
have only two playoff victories to show for it. Atlanta swept them 
3-0 in 1997 and last year they ran into Kevin Brown and the San 
Diego Padres and were beaten 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we need to move to the new stadium to do better in the  
playoffs,'' first baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``I know everybody is 
excited about the new stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After falling behind 7-0 on Saturday, the Astros rallied and cut  
the Braves lead to 7-5, but it wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Possibly, physically it will be a lot better,'' second baseman  
Craig Biggio said. ``We won't get beat up by the turf so much. It 
should be exciting for the fans and we might have a little better 
karma there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros were twice six outs from reaching the World Series in  
the 1980 NLCS against Philadelphia. They failed to hold a 2-0 lead 
in Game 4 and lost 5-3 in 10 innings and in Game 5 they couldn't 
hold a 5-2 lead and the Phillies advanced to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, the Astros lost a marathon 16-inning game to the New  
York Mets in Game 6 with the Mets winning 7-6 and denying the 
Astros once again. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't had much luck here,'' Biggio said. ``But it hasn't  
been just our team. The teams in 1980 and 1986 also couldn't do 
much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Astrodome's spacious outfield gave the stadium a  
reputation as a great place for pitchers, Shane Reynolds sees it 
another way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Astrodome is not that much of a pitcher's park any more  
since they moved the fences in and put those flowers up,'' Reynolds 
said. ``I think the new stadium will be a good experience for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker anticipates adjusting his roster to fit the new stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what effect the new stadium will have. It's  
going to be some growing pains, for sure. I figure we'll be halfway 
through the season getting used to it. I think every team has to 
consider its own stadium because we play half their games there,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hampton, Houston's 22-game winner, hopes the Astros get a  
boost from a change in ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into a new stadium is always exciting,'' Hampton said.  
``Hopefully, we'll be a team that can start off having a World 
Series there in the new stadium. I certainly don't think it's going 
to hurt being there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Vitaly Pisetsky's 31-yard field goal in  
overtime gave 20th-ranked Wisconsin a 20-17 victory over No. 25 
Minnesota on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers won the toss and elected to defend the goal line in  
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota had two incompletions, a holding call, a 5-yard loss  
on a pass play and a false start. Then, on fourth-and-30 from the 
45, Jamar Fletcher intercepted Billy Cockerham's pass at the 5, and 
the Badgers' offense went to work, ending Minnesota's four-game 
winning streak and beating the Gophers for the fifth straight time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers (4-2, 2-1 Big Ten) and Gophers (4-1, 1-1) met as  
ranked teams for just the third time in their 109-year rivalry and 
for the first time since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota, ranked for the first time in 14 seasons, got a great  
performance from running back Thomas Hamner, who rushed 27 times 
for 144 yards and caught seven passes for 92 yards, including a 
49-yard TD. 
</P>
<P>
	The game for Paul Bunyan's Axe drew 63,108 mostly red-clad  
Badgers fans at the Metrodome, but Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez 
wasn't there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old coach was at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 75  
miles away, where he's awaiting a knee replacement. He watched the 
game on a big-screen TV and talked to his coaches by telephone from 
his hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Nystrom, who was wide left on a 27-yard field goal as the  
first half ended, connected from 37 yards out early in the fourth 
quarter for a 17-14 Gophers lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers tied it at 17 on Pisetsky's 36-yarder with 2:59  
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin tied it 14-14 in the first half when quarterback  
Brooks Bollinger and Nick Davis hooked up on an 81-yard pass play, 
third-longest in school history. Davis burned cornerback Jimmy 
Wyrick and outraced safety Delvin Jones for the score. 
</P>
<P>
	Cris Chambers' incredible 32-yard reception set up the Badgers'  
other first-half TD, a 3-yard run by Ron Dayne, who rushed 25 times 
for 80 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Chambers was hammered by cornerback Willie Middlebrooks and made  
the catch while sprawled out on the turf at the Minnesota 14. 
Dayne, who was banged up earlier on the drive, took it in from the 
3 to tie it at 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Badgers stopped the Gophers on their next drive, but Tim  
Rosga knocked down punter Ryan Rindels and two plays later, 
Cockerham hit Hamner sprinting down the right sideline for a 
49-yard score that put the Gophers on top 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers covered 86 yards in just six plays on the game's  
opening drive, which Cockerham capped with a 24-yard TD toss to 
Arland Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 63,108 was the Gophers' largest since Nov. 11,  
1995, when these teams played. The Gophers haven't beaten a ranked 
opponent since Sept. 21, 1996, when they upset No. 23 Syracuse 
35-33.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Ledee To Sub for O'Neill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Paul O'Neill, a career .341 hitter  
against the Texas Rangers, was out of the New York Yankees' 
starting lineup for Game 3 of the AL division series Saturday night 
with a bruised left side. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 2 star Ricky Ledee replaced O'Neill in right field and  
batted sixth. Chad Curtis took over in left and hit eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace O'Neill as the No. 3 hitter, manager Joe Torre moved  
up his usual Nos. 4 and 5 hitters, Bernie Williams and Tino 
Martinez, one spot in the order. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill was injured in the final weekend of the regular season  
when he ran into the stands in Tampa Bay. He was 2-for-8 with two 
runs in the first two games of this series, both New York 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to play tonight and I said, `If it was Game 5, you  
may be able to convince me of that,''' Torre said. ``I think it's 
sort of a nagging thing that bothers him, and I feel a lot better 
if he didn't play because of our situation right now.''
