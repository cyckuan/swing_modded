<HEADLINE> Swiss Government Proposes Armed Peace Missions Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss government Wednesday
proposed a new legislation that would allow armed peace missions,
but not combat roles, for Swiss military units abroad.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, which could take effect in 2001 at the
earliest, the parliament would have to approve missions that
involve more than 100 troops and last longer than three weeks,
according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendments to the Swiss military law take on an
added significance as Switzerland currently has a unit of just
over 140 men serving with international KFOR troops in Kosovo.
Those troops do not carry weapons even though some rifles were
taken along to protect the unit in case of extreme threats.
</P>
<P>
KFOR has asked Switzerland to help safeguard security in the
Serb province by contributing a contingent of armed military
police. That request has not yet been decided on, but a similar
one three months ago for civilian police to serve with United
Nations police troops in Kosovo was turned down.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland is not a UN member, but has constantly contributed
unarmed troops for various missions.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss constitution bans armed military missions abroad and
the modest armament of its troops in Kosovo has provoked a heated
political debate over whether the mission violates Swiss
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Much of the domestic criticism of that mission came from the
nationalist Swiss People's Party, which scored significant wins in
parliamentary elections over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting in Somalia Kills Six </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Heavy armed confrontations
flared up between rival militiamen in north Mogadishu, Somalia
late Tuesday afternoon, killing six and wounding more than 20
others.
</P>
<P>
The rival Agonyar and Warsengeli subclans under faction leader
Ali Mahdi Mohamed went into clashes using heavy gunfire including
anti-aircraft machine guns mounted on battle wagons and rocket
propelled grenades, storming the areas of Fagah, Kallunkah and
El-Tubboweyneh in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Neither side gained any territories and the fighting subsided a
little before mid night Tuesday. However, the fighting resumed
early Wednesday morning and the deafening exchange of gunfire
forced dozens of families to flee their houses for safety,
especially around the heavily populated area of Jungal.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not yet officially known, but
the two subclans had earlier clashed over a World Food Program
food convoy in Mahadday district, 113 kilometers north of
Mogadishu, 12 days ago. More than 14 people from the two warring
sides were killed and nearly 15 others wounded in that battle. But
later, with the intervention of elders from Mogadishu and the
neighboring Jowhar town, the dispute seemed to have been settled
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
However, according to sources close to the area where the
fighting broke out, armed youngsters from Mahadday district have
propagated the animosity to Mogadishu by joining militiamen
manning a checkpoint at Fagah junction.
</P>
<P>
Elders from both sides have been negotiating for a possible
cease-fire since Tuesday night. Prominent figures from both sides,
including Hajji Abukar Omar Addan, Moallim Fanah and others, are
exerting their influence in bringing the animosity under control.
</P>
<P>
The new fighting broke out at a time when the political
supporters of Mohamed and the officials from the recently
established Islamic court of North Mogadishu were meeting over the
representation of the Islamic council in implementing sharia laws
in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the fighting is seen as a total jeopardy to the
existence of the Islamic court in north Mogadishu especially in
its current embryonic stage. The Warsangeli subclan businessmen
are known to be the backbone of the court, and the Agonyar
politicians see this as a political overthrow against Mohamed, who
is currently in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Libya Sign Protocol of Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Libya signed on
Wednesday a protocol for strengthening bilateral cooperation,
especially in the economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Cyprus' Finance Minister Takis
Clerides and visiting Libyan Public Security and Justice Minister
Mohamed Belgasim al-Zuwiy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after signing the protocol, al-Zuwiy said that "after
the difficult years that Libya went through due to the sanctions,
we are now given the chance to start work and fill the gap that
was created."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus joined the seven-year United Nations' embargo on Libya,
which was suspended last April after Tripoli handed over the two
Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland in 1988, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks in Cyprus will have positive developments in
the relations of the two countries, especially in the economic and
political sectors.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the protocol provides for cooperation in various
sectors such as commerce, tourism, culture.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that Libya has proposed more agreements to cover
other sectors, and that Wednesday's protocol "opens wide the doors
to Cypriot entrepreneurs to develop trade and economic relations
in a friendly country, such as Libya."

<HEADLINE> China at Forefront in Food, Crop Irradiation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China has been at the forefront
in the use of radiation technology to increase food processing and
improve varieties of crops.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Dianyin, secretary-general of China Isotope and Radiation
Association, said today China had 60,000 tons of irradiated foods
in 1998, ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
According to estimations by Japan, the United States, France,
and Japan produced 30,000 tons, 20,000 tons and 15,000 tons,
respectively, of irradiated food each year.
</P>
<P>
Food irradiation using nuclear technology can maintain its
freshness, color and flavor and extend its shelf life.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said 513 improved varieties of crops have
been developed in China using nuclear radiation, accounting for 25
percent of the world's total, more than any other country in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The improved varieties are attributable to 300-400 million tons
in increased grain output each year, involving 10 percent of the
acreage under crops in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Isotope and radiation technology has been widely used in China
in other fields such as industry, medicine and environmental
protection.

At least seven people were killed in the attack by four gunmen,

<HEADLINE> Durable Goods Orders to U.S. Factories Fall in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
big-ticket manufactured goods fell 1.3 percent in September, held
back by weaker demand for airplanes and cars, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that orders for durable goods, items expected
to last at least three years, declined last month to a seasonally
adjusted 204.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the first decrease since a 2.4 percent decline in April
and followed a revised 1 percent gain for August.
</P>
<P>
September's performance was weaker than many analysts expected.
They were forecasting a 0.4 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The weak report comes as worries about the prospects of higher
interest rates have shaken Wall Street. Federal Reserve
policy-makers will meet on November 16 to decide whether to raise
interest rates for a third time this year to slow the economy and
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment posted the largest
decrease, falling 3.9 percent in September after a 3.6 percent
gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Weaker demand for airplane and aircraft parts and automobile
and car parts brought the biggest decreases in September. The
transportation sector had its first decline since April.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for industrial machinery, including computers
and machine tools, rose 0.4 percent in September, following a 2.1
percent decline in August.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which
includes semiconductors, circuit boards, telecommunications
equipment and home appliances, grew by 0.4 percent in September,
down from a 1.5 percent gain in August.
</P>
<P>
Excluding transportation, overall orders for durable goods fell
0.5 percent in September, the first decline since a 1.4 percent
drop in May.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current
demand, also fell a sizable 1.9 percent in September, the first
decrease since April.

<HEADLINE> GA President Lauds UNFPA for Many Successes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The president of the
54th General Assembly (GA) session, Theo-Ben Gurirab, Wednesday
spoke highly of the achievement by the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA), saying that "the focus of population challenges has
shifted from controversy to consensus in the span of UNFPA's 30
years."
</P>
<P>
Gurirab made the statement at the General Assembly on the
occasion of the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the
UNFPA's operations.
</P>
<P>
"We are here today to register the many successes achieved in
the field of population and development policies of states, and
the contributions" made by the UNFPA, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the 30 years of UNFPA's work, countries have made
appreciable progress in understanding population issues and in
undertaking measures to find solutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has resulted from the unstinting labor of thousands of
men and women all over the world, especially in the developing
countries," he said. "These people have worked tirelessly to
improve health care, raise educational standards, especially of
rural women and girls, and introduce population and development
policies."
</P>
<P>
"The Fund's practical contribution is visible in many parts
of the world," he said. "It is helping to build integrated
reproductive health programs, enlarge partnerships and promote
full recognition of women's rights and contribution to
development."
</P>
<P>
"Working closely with Governments, Parliaments and
non-governmental organizations, UNFPA has developed a workable
relationship of trust and mutual cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the fullness of time, population management has become
widely accepted as an element in development planning," he said.
"The sharing of experience and mutual support have further
enhanced UNFPA's activities."
</P>
<P>
Established in 1969 at the initiative of the General Assembly,
the UNFPA is the largest multilateral source of population
assistance to developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wages War Against Lewd Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday the government is ready to counteract
charges from producers of lewd films who will be affected by his
administration's all-out war against pornography.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, the president said he is confident that
the government can parry such charges because the makers of smut
films have overstepped the bounds of decency and have offended the
society.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for such charges. We'll prove to them that they
committed an offense," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also reiterated his admonition to the Movie and
Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) to stem the
proliferation of lewd movies.
</P>
<P>
He said the MTRCB board has to be reminded of its duty to
safeguard the movie going public from such indecent films.
</P>
<P>
"Any repetition of this kind of bold films will be dealt with
accordingly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the president ordered Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora to mobilize crime-busting agencies in the stepped up
offensive against lewd films and pornographic reading materials.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Zamora has the authority to tap policemen and
soldiers and local government officials in the anti-pornography
drive.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> PA, Egypt, Jordan Coordinate Stances Before Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- In preparing for the coming Oslo
Summit, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt and Jordan have been busy
working out a unified position on a number of thorny issues.
</P>
<P>
Egyptain Foreign Ministers Amr Moussa, his Jordanian
counterpart Abdel ilah al-Khatib, and Palestinian Minister of
Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath held a meeting
here before noon Wednesday to coordinate stances.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers discussed issues including the return of
Palestinian refugees, one of the key problems to be resolved in
the final-status talks with Israel, and prepared the ground for
the coming Oslo Summit.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and U.S. President Bill Clinton are to meet in Oslo early
November for the first tri-partite summit since Barak took office.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference following the three ministers'
meeting, they said their talks were "important, positive and
useful," dealing with the coordination of stances of their
respective countries.
</P>
<P>
They hoped the talks would form the basis for the resumed work
of the four-way Palestinian-Egyptian-Jordanian-Israeli committee
in charge of refugees which has been suspended since 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the coming Oslo summit, Shaath expressed hope that it would
positively move the peace process forward, initiate the "full and
real" implementation of the Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum and lead to
the commencement of the final-status negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt did not rule out the possibility of
attending the summit, adding that the important thing is to allow
the summit sufficient time to reach results, particularly with
regard to the obstacles facing the peace process such as Jewish
settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed Egypt's stance on the restoration of full
Arab rights.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Khatib arrived in Gaza earlier in the day where they
were greeted by Arafat. The three ministers will resume talks
Wednesday afternoon to define a unified attitude of their
countries.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up World's Advanced Wildlife Gene Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 27 (Xinhua)-- China will earmark one billion
yuan (over 112 million U.S. dollars) to establish a "super-gene
bank" for wildlife in southwestern Yunnan Province to guarantee
sustainable ecological development and protect bio-diversity.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan devised by well-known biologists in China, the
bank is expected to be the most comprehensive and advanced gene
base in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The gene bank will be the basic resource for the development
of China's biological technology, and it will enhance China's
capacity in international competition in the field," said Wu
Zhengyi, a noted Chinese botanist and academician of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
The diverse climate of southwest China's Yunnan Province makes
it a suitable habitat for a wide variety of animals and plants.
China has set up several special data banks there, including a
wildlife-cell bank and a fungus bank.
</P>
<P>
The new wildlife gene bank will use some advanced techniques
for storing the progenitive parts of plants and animals, and it
will serve as a way to preserve endangered species in addition to
man's efforts to protect them in nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the main task in the next five years
will be to store the genes of some 1,000 rare and endangered
species along with about 15,000 reproductions in the bank. And by
the year 2010, almost all of China's wildlife genes will be
included in the bank.
</P>
<P>
China has a responsibility to protect animal life, both because
it is a large agrarian country and relies mainly on its biological
resources to develop its economy, and also because it is one of
the 162 signatories of the United Nations' Convention on Bio-
diversity.
</P>
<P>
The world loses at least one species of natural life every day,
many of which are in China, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"To some extent, it is possible that a certain biological
species affects a nation's economy, and one gene has impacts on
its prosperity" said the botanist Wu, who has devoted his life to
the study of botany.

<HEADLINE> Former Long Jump World Champion May to stay in Sport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Long jumper Fiona May, who hinted
she will quit from athletics career this summer, said Wednesday
she will continue to compete.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 world titlist and 1996 Olympic silver medalist in the
long jump said she will no longer triple jump, though, reports
from Milan said.
</P>
<P>
The British-born May began competing for Italy in 1994, and the
next year became the country's first female world champion in
track and field.
</P>
<P>
In August, May said at the World Championships in Seville,
Spain she was "90 percent" sure she would quit at the end of the
season.
</P>
<P>
"I'll aim to jump well with any eye on the Sydney Olympics,"
May was quoted as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Italian wound up with the silver medal at the championships
when Niurka Montalvo of Spain surpassed her with the next-to-last
leap of the competition. Italy quickly protested, contending
Montalvo had gone past the takeoff line, but a six-member Jury of
Appeals let the jump stand.
</P>
<P>
Replays showed Montalvo's shoe was right at the edge of the
foul line.
</P>
<P>
In addition to her four medals from Olympics and World
Championships, May's resume includes the 1997 world indoor title
and the 1988 world junior crown.

<HEADLINE> Chinese to Become Second Language Outside Quebec: Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The 2001 national census of
Canada will show that Chinese will become the second most common
language outside the French speaking province of Quebec, the
National Post newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a new book by Jack Jedwab, a lecturer at McGill
University, the newspaper said Chinese will rank second in
replacement of French, which will drop to third position.
</P>
<P>
The forecast was based on the 1996 Canadian census, which
showed that the gap between French and Chinese was already closing
fast at that time.
</P>
<P>
French took second place with 588,885 people outside Quebec
saying they spoke French at home, while Canadians speaking Chinese
at home were recorded as many as 553,045, ranking third outside
Quebec in 1996.
</P>
<P>
English will remain the country's most used language spoken by
86.3 percent of Canadians in years to come. Within Quebec, French
will continue to be the most common language spoken by 82 percent
of the local population as mother tongue at home, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Italian was the leading home language in
Canada after English and French, but Chinese has been experiencing
rapid growth since the 1980s due to increased immigration,
according to the newspaper.

When contacted on telephone about the content of the letter,
both DRC Charge d'Affaires to Uganda Isabelle Ibura and Museveni's
Press Secretary Hope Kivengere declined to make comments.
</P>
<P>
"I accompanied the minister to State House. The minister
delivered the message to Museveni. So I am not in position to
comment on that," Isabelle said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni press secretary said that "the president read the
letter himself, without revealing its content."
</P>
<P>
Hope said that the DRC minister arrived here Wednesday morning
and delivered the message in the afternoon. She did not know how
long the minister would stay in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, who used to back Kabila coming to power in May 1997,
turned to back the rebels when the civil war in the DRC broke out
in August of 1998. The country has kept a strong military presence
in the eastern part of the DRC to allegedly chase off the rebels
of the Allied Democratic Forces who attack Uganda from bases in
the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Kinshasa has accused Uganda of invading a sovereign country
and filed a suit against Kampala in the international court in the
Hague. Uganda, however, said that it sent troops into the DRC for
the sake of its borders' safety.

ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan will not take any new

it has taken after Pakistan's nuclear tests last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong should strive to be
one of those few truly international financial centers where
liquidity would tend to flow in the new millennium, says a high-
ranking Hong Kong official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Venture Capital Conference Wednesday, Secretary
for Financial Services Rafael Hui said that for financial centers
throughout the world to meet the ever-growing challenges is no
longer just a matter of comparative advantage but also a matter of
survival in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As to the criteria for being such an international financial
center in the new age, Hui said, "Free and open market policies
must continue to be imperative."
</P>
<P>
"Equally important are the possession of a stable and liquid
capital market, with world-class market infrastructure, making use
of the most advanced information technology and telecommunications,
sophisticated but flexible regulation, strong foundations for the
rule of law, high-caliber personnel and professionals, and
political and social stability," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong does have all of those qualities, which should help
to consolidate our position as a world-class financial center," he
said.

<P>
To take on the challenges of the new millennium, he noted, a
Steering Committee on the Enhancement of Financial Infrastructure
in Hong Kong had recently put forward its recommendations,
including the development of a technology infrastructure, to be
named the "eFrastructure".
</P>
<P>
"With implementation of the eFrastructure, and with the
expected growth of the mainland market, Hong Kong can aspire to
become a major center for liquidity, clearing, settlement and risk
management in Asia and the portal for strategic links with global
markets in this, and other, time zones," Hui said.
</P>
<P>
Also well underway is the legislative reform that seeks to
modernize Hong Kong's regulatory regime to strengthen Hong Kong's
competitiveness and aim to promote a fair, orderly and transparent
market and facilitate introduction of new products and trading
systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the first few years of the next millennium, Hui remarked,
Hong Kong should continue to focus on at least three areas:
corporate governance, cross sector risk management, and
integration of financial markets and services.
</P>
<P>
Whether Hong Kong will be a winner or a loser in the next
millennium will hinge on its determination and commitment to
remain free and open, to resist the temptation for protectionist
and restrictive practices and to be firmly plugged into the global
market, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM to Visit U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy is scheduled to leave for Washington later Wednesday,
said the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
During the previously unannounced visit, Levy will sign an
agreement on establishing full diplomatic relations with
Mauritania, a North African country that is a member of the Arab
League.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony will be held Thursday at the U.S. State
Department in the presence of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel and the United States viewed the establishment of
full diplomatic ties between Israel and Mauritania as a milestone
in the promotion of normalization, which is widely seen as the
goal of the peace process that has been developing since the 1991
Madrid Conference, the Ministry added.
</P>
<P>
Israel will continue to work for the development and
strengthening of Israel's relations with other countries in the
region, it said.
</P>
<P>
Although some of Levy's agenda is being kept secret, it is
clear that part of his mission in Washington is to coordinate the
Israeli and U.S. positions in advance of next week's trilateral
summit among Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Levy's office said that the foreign minister's
trip to Washington was fixed almost two weeks ago and was timed
to take place after the appointment of Israel's head of the
final-status negotiating team and before the Oslo summit.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here also said that at least part of Levy's
trip would be directed at trying to revive the negotiations with
Syria. Levy is to stay in the U.S. through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after his arriving in the region Tuesday, U.S.
Middle East special envoy Denis Ross had met with Arafat in Gaza
Tuesday evening and discussed the summit with Barak Wednesday to
prepare for the Oslo summit.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmakers in Favor of Draft Decision on Macao Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers said in their
ongoing legislative session today that they're in favor of a draft
decision tabled by the legislature Monday which would abolish 12
existing Macao Laws that violate the Basic Law of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) also voiced their support for the proposal that
most of the existing laws and regulations in Macao will not change
after the hand-over on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The proposed nullification and revisions to the existing Macao
laws are in line with China's resumption of sovereignty over the
island, and accord with the principle of "one country, two systems,
" and the high level of autonomy and self-governance of Macao,
legislators said.
</P>
<P>
Teng Fu, a member of the NPC Standing Committee, said that
formulating the decision prior to the hand-over is "necessary and
conducive to the smooth transition and successful hand-over of
Macao to the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Xie Songkai, another NPC Standing Committee member, said that
detailed stipulations on abolishing and revising the existing laws
that contravene the Basic Law of the Macao SAR are feasible,
because China already has been through the same issues regarding
former Hong Kong laws at the time of Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Liang Guangda was especially pleased that the
discrimination against the Chinese in the existing Macao Law,
which prohibits any Chinese resident from being chief executive of
the region, will be gone if the draft decision is adopted.
</P>
<P>
Another 121 laws as yet have no Chinese versions and remain
intact. Li Daoyu, member of the legislature, urged the related
departments to get them translated quickly into Chinese so that
they can be reviewed by the top legislature soon.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reitrates Policy Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Judiciary chief Ayatollah
Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi on Wednesday reiterated that
confrontation with Israel enjoys high priority in Iran's foreign
policy and is the demand of the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Shahroudi made the remark during his meeting with Lebanon's
Ambassador to Tehran Adnan Mansour Hassan, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He called on Islamic countries to exert pressure on Israel in
order to restore their rights, and expressed his belief that "The
Islamic governments will not be trapped by the conspiracy of
compromise with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Iran cut off relations with Israel soon after the 1979 Islamic
revolution. It called for armed struggle against Israel's
occupation of Arab lands and vehemently opposed any compromise
with what it called "the Zionist regime."
</P>
<P>
The Judicial chief said that Israel is attempting to make
compromise with the Islamic and Arab governments because it is
afraid of the resistance by the Lebanese nation and a number of
other Islamic and Arab countries against its measures.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the resistance movement by the people in south
Lebanon against the Israeli occupation force there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement, spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been fighting
to oust Israeli troops and its ally, the South Lebanon Army, from
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese ambassador for his part appreciated Iran's support
to his country, IRNA said.

ATHENS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Greece and
Turkey are "on a good track", visiting Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cem, who arrived in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki to
attend the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Council meeting, said
the two neighboring countries were cautious in their moves and
looked forward to cultivating mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Describing this as a positive step, Gem said he hopes that
Greek-Turkish relations will be improved even further in the near

</P>
<P>
Cem is expected to meet with his Greek counterpart, George
Papandreou, later in the day to conduct an evaluation of the
results of the third round of talks between senior Greek and
Turkish diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The two NATO members have been at odds for decades over
territorial waters, air space, the demarcation of the continental
shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, both countries have been trying hard to
improve their relations, and senior diplomats of the two neighbors
ended a third round of talks in Athens Tuesday night. They
exchanged draft agreements that will be finalized at a working

</P>
<P>
As a goodwill gesture by Athens to Ankara, Greece said recently

<TEXT>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Tourism Secretary Gemma
Cruz Araneta said at the opening ceremony that the three-day
congress will focus on ecotourism, especially on coastal resource
management.
</P>
<P>
Araneta said untouched tourist destinations of the country will
deteriorate in terms of ecotourism attractiveness if the
government is not careful with the environment.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that ecotourism has already become the
fastest growing segment of the tourism industry. It is estimated
that worldwide growth rate of the ecotourism is 10 to 15 percent
per year.
</P>
<P>
"Here in our country, our ecotourism program is already part of
the reason why Philippine tourism has grown in recent years," said
Araneta.
</P>
<P>
The economic benefits of ecotourism are jobs for communities,
revenues for government and profits for companies, Araneta said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada created the
National Ecotourism Development Council (NEDC) to be the
policy-making body of the government for ecotourist matters.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, the NEDC should ensure "sustainable use,
development, management, protection and conservation of the
country's environment, natural resources and cultural heritage
enjoyment for the present and future generations."

TEHRAN -- Tehran is to host the first ever specialized fair of
chicken farming industry on November 1-5, spokesman of the fair
Mostafa Seyyed Mostafavi said on Tuesday.

saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran's chicken farming industry runs with a capacity of
producing 900,000 tons of poultry and 650,000 tons of eggs, and
some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of chicken products, including
650,000 tons of poultry and 525,000 tons of eggs, are produced
annually.
</P>
<P>
The country's chicken farming industry needs an investment of

</P>
<P>

dollars by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Assets of Saudi commercial banks abroad have exceeded 11
billion dollars and total foreign reserves of Saudi government
establishments stood at some 21 billion dollars, the

The average oil prices in the coming decade are expected to
reach 25 dollars per barrel, said experts who attended the Middle
East Refinery and Petrochemical Conference which concluded in Abu

<HEADLINE> China Takes Steps to Facilitate Law Enforcement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China is taking new steps to
tackle the enormous difficulties facing its law enforcement
agencies, hoping that by the end of next year all court rulings
will be announced on schedule.
</P>
<P>
According to a reform unveiled here today, the country's
judicial system will incorporate a new mechanism through which
announcements of provincial court verdicts will be managed and
coordinated by the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The move will reaffirm the authority of the supreme court and
help to resist the illegitimate interference by local governments
in court rulings.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, noted today
that local governments' protection of their own interests has led
to the suspension of numerous court rulings in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This will inevitably result in the failure to abide by the law,
lax law enforcement and letting law-breakers go free," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation will erode the public's confidence in the law,
which could harm the country's political and social stability, as
well as economic development, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are currently cases on record of violence against law
enforcement departments and personnel in the country, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 16 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities show that in the first nine months of this year,
there were 330 instances of violence, over 400 law-enforcement
officers were injured and 200 police vehicles demolished.

<P>
In the meantime, verdicts on a total of 920,000 cases had to be
suspended, Xiao revealed.
</P>
<P>
Li Guoguang, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,
asked all localities to work vigorously to get the new system in
place by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Once in operation, the mechanism is expected to put an end to
the current phenomenon that courts often have to travel to other
jurisdictions to get a fair verdict.
</P>
<P>
By then, the courts will be able to hand over their cases to
counterparts nearby, officials from the court said.
</P>
<P>
A special regulation on the matter is now being considered by
the supreme court and is expected to be promulgated within the
year.
</P>
<P>
The officials called on all localities to provide enough high-
quality personnel to their courts and all law-enforcement officers
to complete on-the-job training by the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court has also decided to launch a nationwide
campaign next month to deal with the backlog of cases, focusing on
those involving finance, real estate and state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Is Cult: People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- There's plenty of evidence to
prove that Falun Gong is no ordinary illegal organization, but in
fact a true cult, a commentary to be published in Thursday's
People's Daily concludes.
</P>
<P>
A prominent feature of a cult is its hierarchical structure,
through which practitioners strictly follow the instructions of
their senior member and are willing to sacrifice themselves for
this spiritual leader. Li Hongzhi, founder of the Falun Gong cult,
demands that his disciples think, act and even give their lives at
his command, it says.
</P>
<P>
Members of a cult are subject to a systematic form of mind
control, and Falun Gong is no exception. Li Hongzhi entices his
disciples with the bait of physical fitness, brainwashes his
followers with his heretical ideas, and intimidates Falun Gong
practitioners with his "super powers."
</P>
<P>
In order to gather more followers to his flock, Li fabricated
heretical ideas as the "doomsday" theory and the belief that the
Earth will explode, so as to frighten his disciples into following
his instructions without question, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
Li said that only he can postpone the explosion of the Earth,
only he can help Falun Gong practitioners enter heaven, and only
the Falun Dafa could save all the human beings.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that more than 1,400 people across
China have died as a result of practicing Falun Gong, and hundreds
of others suffered psychological distress.

<P>
The Falun Gong organization collected money from its followers
through the illegal publication and sales of books, pictures,
video and audio tapes and other forms of communication which
spread Li Hongzhi's lies, says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzhi and other core members of the organization became
newly-rich through exploiting the wealth and labor of Falun Gong
practitioners and by dodging taxes. Li is reported to have fat
bank accounts overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to the commentary, Falun Gong is also a tightly-
organized cult. Its supreme organ in China is the Falun Dafa
Research Society (FDRS) in Beijing. Under FDRS, there are 39
general stations, 1,900 instruction centers, and 28,263 exercising
sites, controlling a total of 2.1 million practitioners.
</P>
<P>
The organization has various departments which are in charge of
public relations, instruction and exercising, translation and
other affairs, and has strict management rules.
</P>
<P>
With this tightly-organized system and modern means of
telecommunication such as the Internet, Li was able to send his
secret "orders" quickly to every practitioner.
</P>
<P>
Li tricked the practitioners of Falun Gong into joining his "
kingdom," and gradually separated them from mainstream society,
eventually convincing them to fight against it, the commentary
says.
</P>
<P>
Since Li ordered his followers to round up the Guangming Daily
in August of 1996, Falun Gong has held 78 illegal demonstrations
each with more than 300 people, with the rounding-up of thousands
of followers outside Zhongnanhai on April 25 this year as the
worst event.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, and 1970s, various cults have cropped up in
Western countries and caused great harm to society. The demand of
people to crack down on such cults has never been so urgent, says
the commentary.
</P>
<P>
No government will turn a blind eye to the cult's illegal deeds
in threatening people's lives and social stability. The Chinese
Communist Party, which takes the welfare of its people as its
prime concern, will take firm action in its ban on cults.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Raises Prices of Petroleum Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC)
has raised the prices of diesel and kerosene effective from
Wednesday to stop smuggling of petroleum products out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
NOC said in a press release issued here Wednesday that it
decided to raise the prices because the price gap between Nepal
and India had caused extensive smuggling of petroleum products to
India and there was no way to stop it in view of the price hikes
in the Indian markets.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, India hiked the price of petroleum products
by 35 percent. The price of diesel is 23.52 Indian rupees (0.33
U.S. dollars) per liter in Indian markets, while its price stood
at 15.5 rupees ( 0.22 dollars) per liter in Nepal. Kerosene is
being sold in Indian open markets at 16 rupees (0.23 dollars) to
19 rupees (0.28 dollars) per liter.
The new prices in Nepal is 23 rupees (0.32 dollars) per liter for
diesel and 13 rupees (0.2 U.S. dollars) per liter for kerosene.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China may cancel regional and
business restrictions on foreign insurance firms within five years,
according to a government plan, part of which was disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Li, an official with the Policy and Research Department of
the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), made these
remarks at an international forum on China's insurance industry,
which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurance firms have been recently approved to expand
their business in China into the cities of Dalian, Shenzhen,
Chongqing and Tianjin, while previously they could only operate in
Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on the five-year plan for China's insurance
sector, Yuan said regional restrictions might be canceled in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign insurance firms may also have their business expanded
from personal life insurance and property insurance for foreign-
funded enterprises to other fields, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China will also amend the current Insurance Law and make a
series of related laws and regulations concerning the management
of foreign insurance companies to the healthy development of the
insurance market, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to a projection by the CIRC, China's insurance market
will expand by an annual rate of 13 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2004, the premium income for insurance firms is
expected to reach 260 billion yuan, accounting for two percent of
China's gross domestic product, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai stressed Nepal's support for the one-China policy
when meeting a visiting Chinese delegation here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He told the delegation of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
that Nepal has always supported China's policy on Taiwan and Tibet
and maintained that they are the inseparable parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Describing the talk about Nepal having some kinds of relations
with Taiwan as a misunderstanding, the prime minister said "We
have not kept any relations with Taiwan, and we have always
supported China's sovereignty over Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai said that Nepal and China are close neighbors and
have maintained friendly and cordial ties for centuries.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any problems between us, if anything at all,
that is to further promote our friendship and enhance mutual
cooperation and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhijian, the head of the CPC delegation, said that CPC
values Nepali government's support for China's policy on Taiwan
and Tibet and reiterated China's consistent stand on the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
"China is determined and fully committed to solving the Taiwan
issue and unifying the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China has always pursued the foreign policy of the
five principles of peaceful co-existence in dealing with
international relations.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has been developing relations with
other countries on the basis of equality, mutual respects and
non-interference of their internal policies, whether they are big
or small, rich or poor, powerful or weak, and stands for peaceful
resolution of disputes between countries, instead of use of force.
</P>
<P>
The basic purpose of China's foreign policy and foreign
activities is to "serve our economic development as well as to
maintain the world peace," Li Zhijian said.

<HEADLINE> Table Tennis Great Waldner Keeps Low-key in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHONGSHAN, Guangdong Province, China, October 27 (Xinhua) --
Sweden's Jan-Ove Waldner, one of the table tennis all-time greats,
kept low profile on the eve of the annual World Cup action.
</P>
<P>
The first player to have won a "Grand Slam" of the Olympic,
world championships and World Cup titles was bundled with Asian
champion Wang Liqin of China, Qian Qianli of Austria and Koji
Matsushita of Japan in Group D. The two group leaders of four
groups move into the eight-man knock-out stage.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that I won't finish last at the 16-player World Cup,"
said Waldner. "As for the championship, I can't say for certain."
</P>
<P>
Waldner is expected to reach the last eight since wildcards
Qian and Matsushita won't pose serious challenge to the 34-year-
old Swede, who last time won the World Cup in 1990. Wang is
technically strong enough, if not mentally, to shake Waldner as
the group leader. The lanky Chinese, who failed to live up to the
billing as China's best hope at the world championships in the
Dutch city Eindhoven in August with a straight-set loss to
Frenchman Damien Eloi, vowed not to let the home crowd down.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't found my best form but my performance won't
disappoint you," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
European champion and world top-ranked Vladimir Samsonov will
vie for the top placing with 1995 world champion Kong Linghui of
China and current world bronze medalist Werner Schlager of Austria.
The other player in Group A -- Liu Song of Argentina is set to go
out early.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Liu Guoliang, the only other "Grand Slam" winner in the
world, will fight a grudge match with South Korean Kim Taek Soo
who ousted Kong and Liu en route to the Asian Games title last
December. The other players in Group B are former world No. 1
Jean-Michel Saive of Belgium and Peter Jackson of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Two-time World Cup champion Zoran Primorac of Croatia was
grouped with 1991 world champion Jorgen Persson of Sweden, North
American champion Johnny Huang of Canada and African champion
Segun Toriola of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Defending World Cup champion Jorg Rosskopf of Germany opted out
of the annual event to recover from a nagging shoulder injury. He
asked his Borussia Dusseldorf teammate Samsonov to bring the World
Cup trophy to the organizers here.

HONG KONG, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong International

by readers of a prestigious British travel magazine.

<P>
Deemed a "runway success," HKIA scored an overall average
satisfaction level of 90.95 percent in the airport category of the
1999 Readers' Travel Awards of Britain's Conde Nast Traveler

percent behind the first-prize winner, Changi Airport of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
HKIA topped five of the 11 criteria by which airports were
judged in the annual awards. These were efficiency of check-in;
efficiency of transfer; luggage handling; flight information and
clarity of signs; and food and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
The results of the awards came from questionnaires sent to
readers. The data was collated and analyzed by an independent
market research company.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Airport Authority (AA) Chief Executive Officer Billy
Lam Chung-lun said: "The Airport Authority is thrilled to have won
these latest accolades for the performance of HKIA."

<P>
"Our hard work since airport opening is producing good results.
This award is a gratifying and valuable endorsement from the
people who matter most -- our airport users," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Unbothered by Popularity Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Wednesday that the slide in his popularity rating is
a natural phase in any president's term, adding that the same
happened to his predecessors, presidents Aquino and Ramos.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview, Estrada said he is not bothered by the
low popularity rating he has been getting recently in opinion
surveys, stressing that he has gone campaigning for elections, and
is now just interested in serving the nation.
</P>
<P>
Results of a survey released Tuesday by the Social Weather
Stations showed that Estrada's net satisfaction rating fell 37
percent points to 28 percent in October from 65 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
"I will not change. I will stand firm in my convictions to
reform the economy. Nothing can stop me. I will continue to work
as president and I will continue my program," he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the slide in his popularity rating to what he
described as "disinformation" initiated by his political enemies,
who continue to link his proposed economic reforms to
"Charter-change."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was also blamed for the series of oil price
hikes which were already beyond his control since the downstream
oil industry in the country has been deregulated long before he
assumed the presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we try to do something about the things that are
within our control," he said.
</P>
<P>
He particularly cited his order of reducing the price of rice
and sugar sold by the National Food Authority.
</P>
<P>
He also noted the reduction from 16 percent to 9 percent on the
interests on low-cost and socialized housing and the extension
from 25 years to 30 years on the maturity of housing loans
incurred on all government housing agencies.

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao said
here today during a meeting with Koichi Kato, former secretary-
general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan, that a
partnership of friendly cooperation between China and Japan is in
the fundamental interests of the two countries' people.
</P>
<P>
Wen, also member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, told Kato, who arrived
here Tuesday on a three-day visit at the invitation of the CPC,
that such a relationship between the two countries will also be
conducive to the peace, prosperity and stability of the Asia-
Pacific Region and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's state visit to
Japan last year, and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's visit
to China this year, have ushered China-Japan relations into a new
stage where both sides work to establish a partnership of friendly
cooperation dedicated to peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier spoke highly of Kato's contributions to Sino-
Japanese relations, and said he hopes that LDP friends will
continue their efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendly
cooperation and exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Kato said that it will be conducive to bilateral relations and
the stability and development of Asia for young Japanese statesmen
to increase friendly exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqiu, minister in charge of the Central Foreign Affairs
Office of China, met with Kato yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Restructure State Railway Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has pledged to
restructure its ailing railway sector before the end of the year,
the Guardian newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Kema Chikwe Tuesday described the Nigeria
Railway Corporation, a monopolizing state owned company, as a
"sick baby" , saying President Olusegun Obasanjo was determined
to revive the corporation.
</P>
<P>
She also revealed that the transport ministry was consulting
with Julius Berger, a German contracting firm with broad business
in Nigeria, to determine the actual cost of completing a new
railway line in the country.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese company is currently undertaking the rehabilitation
of some 3, 000-Kilometer railway system in the West African
country. Though most of the work was finished last year, the
completion of the several hundred million U.S. dollar project,
which cover more than 80 percent of the country's existing railway
system, was delayed due to Nigerian sub- contractors' tardiness in
supplying rail materials.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government has recently pledged to address the problem
promptly.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Opera "Peony Pavilion" Revised to Suit Modern Tastes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The audience in Shanghai gave
a standing ovation recently to the newly revised Chinese opera "
The Peony Pavilion," written by renowned Chinese playwright Tang
Xianzu (1550-1616) some 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Peony Pavilion," an opera in the 600-year-old Kunju style,
tells the story of a young woman who meets her lover in a dream,
but dies longing for him. When her ghost finds the man, she is
brought back to life and they marry.
</P>
<P>
The uncut original version of the play in 55 acts, jointly
produced by the Lincoln Center of New York and the Shanghai Kunju
Opera Company, was scheduled for a global tour in 1998.
</P>
<P>
But that version was canceled because it was criticized by
audiences and artists alike as showing "feudalism, superstitious
beliefs, and pornography."
</P>
<P>
The revised version, directed by Guo Xiaonan, is in three acts
and 34 scenes, and requires three nights for a full performance.
</P>
<P>
"Audiences in modern times like to watch compact dramas with a
brisk rhythm," Guo said. "That's why I changed the play this way."

<P>
Li Shoucheng, an official with the Shanghai Bureau of Culture,
said the new version is free of pornography, superstition and
feudalism, and unfolds the essence of Chinese culture in the form
of operatic drama.
</P>
<P>
Famed as the "Oriental Shakespeare," Tang Xianzu finished "The
Peony Pavilion" in 1598, a work reflecting Tang's desire for
freedom of love against the bondage of feudal ethics.
</P>
<P>
The new version, advocating humanism, has been in preparation
since August 1998, and features nearly 150 characters.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jurong, a drama expert at Fudan University, said that
compared to the previous version, which had exaggerated plots
about sex, this one not only inherits traditional values of
Chinese opera, but also meets the demands of modern audiences.
</P>
<P>
Cai Minxia, a student at East China Normal University in
Shanghai, said, "I have spent three nights watching the entire
version of the play. I think it can challenge Hollywood
masterpieces such as 'The Ghost' and 'Titanic'."
</P>
<P>
This operatic drama is sure to become popular at universities,
she predicted.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Dragon Looms in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- After eight successive years
of fast growth, Australia's economy is approaching the point where
further growth will be impossible without stocking the fires of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that prices rose 0.9 percent in the
July-September period -- the highest figure since September 1995
and the annual inflation rate rose to 1.7 percent, which was also
the highest figure for three years.
</P>
<P>
It is a strong signal indicating an interest rate rise could be
just days away. There are speculations that the board of Reserve
Bank of Australia will hold a meeting next week and raise the
interest rate.
</P>
<P>
Politicians in the country prefer to take an optimistic
attitude. Earlier this month, Prime Minister John Howard declared
that the economy of the country was in its best period and it did
not need any break. Four months ago, Treasurer Peter Costello
declared there was no life left in the inflation dragon.
</P>
<P>
Now, Costello blamed the higher than expected result on the
doubling of world oil prices.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that without the oil price rise, inflation would
have almost halved in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, there are also other factors to raise the interest
rate including the growing household debt. Australian households
on average now owe 105 percent of their disposable income and
their debts are keeping high further.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank Governor Macfarlane indicated a rate rise was on
the cards, saying the bank had no intention of surprising
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The Australian financial markets forecast a rise of up to half
a percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Overture to Iran for Normal Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department Spokesman
James Rubin recently reiterated the U.S. overture to Iran for a
normal relationship in an interview with the Iran News daily
published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have offered to enter into a dialogue without precondition
as to subject matter or outcome," said Rubin, referring to the
goodwill remarks by several U.S. officials on relations between
Washington and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the dialog is to establish a road map of
reciprocal steps each side could take to address each other's
concerns and thereby develop a more normal relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Rubin said that in order to open a dialog, neither the
U.S. nor Iran needs to commit to specific policy changes in
advance, "We must sit down face-to-face to raise and address the
concerns each of us has with regard to the actions of the other."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after
radical Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran in
the heydays of the stormy Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the U.S. imposed economic embargo to
contain Iran and pressure it to change policies on issues such as
the Middle East peace process, international terrorism and weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk on October 14
called for an "unconditional dialog" between the U.S. and Iran,
but stressed that the U.S. could not lift its sanctions until Iran
made some policy changes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Rubin also called on Iran to offer help in
the probe of the 1996 bombing of the U.S. military base in
Khorbar, Saudi Arabia, and warned that a conclusion of Iran's
involvement would leave Tehran open to a U.S. response, including
possible military action.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his recent warning, Rubin told Iran News that the
U.S. has no offensive military intentions towards Iran, but
"reserves the right under international law to respond militarily
to a state-sponsored terrorist attack on its ose
responsible are brought to justice, and we expect the government
of Iran to cooperate in this effort."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. has made it clear to Iran that the
Washington will not lift sanctions unless Iran cooperates in the
fight against terrorism. "Cooperation in the Khobar bombing would
be a first and important step in that direction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin underlined that the U.S. opposes terrorism under any
circumstances, whether it is directed against Americans or
against Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Restating the U.S. concern over the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews
on espionage charges, he said that the charges are groundless,
"several of those arrested are religious leaders and their
students, and one is a 16-year-old boy."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Iranian authorities would handle
the case "in a fair and transparent manner in keeping with
accepted international standards of due process and justice."
</P>
<P>
These Iranian Jews were arrested in April, accused of spying
for Israel, but Tel Aviv denied any link between them and its
intelligence services.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft to Unveil Windows 2000 Next February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. announced
on Tuesday that its new operating system -- Windows 2000 -- will
be available for retail purchase on February 17 next year, said a
report from the world's largest software maker.
</P>
<P>
Windows 2000 is intended to replace Microsoft's high-end
operating systems, Windows NT, which has become increasingly
popular with businesses.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the much-ballyhooed launch of Windows 95 four years ago,
the launch of Windows 2000 will have little immediate impact on
consumers and is chiefly a milestone for corporate managers
evaluating whether to upgrade systems.
</P>
<P>
However, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has said the launch of
Windows 2000 will be one of the company's most important moves,
forming the foundation of all future operating systems and paving
the way for the company to make deeper inroads into corporate
computing.
</P>
<P>
Though the release of Windows 2000 has been widely anticipated,
the company is reticent over launching such a widespread product
until its customers are ready.
</P>
<P>
"While we are working closely with the industry to prepare
solutions for retail availability in mid-February, we stand firm
on our commitment to release Windows 2000 only when our early-
adopter customers agree it's ready," Deborah Willingham, vice
president of the Business Enterprise Division at Microsoft, said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said that Windows 2000 will be sold at a price of 99
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Stresses Importance of Macao's Smooth Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said Tuesday that ensuring a smooth handover of Macao is in
the fundamental interests of both China and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
During talks with his Portuguese counterpart Jorge Sampaio here,
Jiang said that a series of important issues facing Macao's
transitional period have been solved thanks to the joint efforts
and cooperation between China and Portugal since they signed a
joint declaration on Macao.
</P>
<P>
He said that this has created necessary conditions for Macao's
smooth handover and for implementing the policy of "one country,
two systems", "governing Macao by Macao people" and high-degree
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with nearly two months left before the handover,
both sides will speed up consultations and resolve the remaining
issues in light of the long-term development of their friendly
relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reaffirmed that after China resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao, the central government will strictly abide
by the policy of "one country, two systems" and the basic law of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (MSAR) and will not
interfere with the affairs that fall within the jurisdiction of
MSAR's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He added that Portugal's legitimate rights and interests in
Macao and the customs and cultural tradition of the Portuguese
descendants in the region will be protected and respected.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Macao will undoubtedly play the role of bridge
and bond between China and Portugal and between China and the
European Union in developing their relations in the days to come,"
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that ensuring a smooth and successful handover of Macao
represents an important manifestation of the friendly relations
and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he will go personally to Macao for the handover
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Russian Forces Seize More Villages in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian forces are advancing
deeper into the breakaway republic of Chechnya after reaching the
edge of its capital Grozny, Interfax reported Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Units of paratroopers and marines from the Russian federal
forces were massed on the outskirts of Chechnya's second largest
city of Gudermes, 32 kilometers east of Grozny, Interfax quoted
the forces' temporary press center as saying.
</P>
<P>
After seizing the villages of Azamat-Yurt, Stepnoye, Nizhny
Gerzel and Kadi-Yurt in the Gudermes district, the federal troops
encircled the rebel-held villages of Engel-Yurt and Komsomolskoye,
while the Interior troops and police units cleaned the villages of
Stepnoye and Azamat-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
Russian planes and artillery continued strikes at rebel
positions in Gudermes, controlled by the irreconcilable rebel
commanders Salman Raduyev and Arbi Barayev.
</P>
<P>
All populated areas in Chechnya's Shelkovskoy, Naursky and
Nadterechny districts have been cleared of rebels, with five of
the 31 populated areas in Grozny district liberated and one
encircled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, controls at the Russian borders with Azerbaijan and
Georgia have been tightened and new border posts set up in Tsunta
and Tsumada to prevent rebel incursions from Chechnya, said
Interfax.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency Situations Ministry said the number of Chechen
refugees has increased to 190,000 and the Federal Migration
Service has registered about 142,000 refugees. More than 2,500
tons of humanitarian-aid materials have been sent to the North
Caucasian region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Russian troops were reported to have moved closer on
the west, northwest and eastern sides of Grozny and to strengthen
their air and artillery strikes at rebel targets in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian television said Tuesday that up to 200 federal tanks
attacked an area 14.4 kilometers from Grozny. But later the
Chechen side denied reports that the federal troops had entered
Grozny from the north and had fought with the guerrillas for the
first time in the outskirts.

<HEADLINE> Britain Looks to Court to End Beef War With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The British government said
Wednesday that it was time to act on its threat of legal action
against France over its illegal ban of British beef imports.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to take action against the French through the courts,
" Agricultural Secretary Nick Brown told a British television.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to play by the rules....We will look to the (
European) Commission to take prompt action," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brown's remarks were made after French Agricultural Minister
Jean Glavany urged Britain on Wednesday to end an escalating row
over British beef .
</P>
<P>
Glavany told BBC tlevision that Britain and France should work
as a team and stop poisoning mutual trade interests. But he gave
no indication that he might consider lifting France's ban on
British beef imports.
</P>
<P>
Tempers in the "beef war" are flaring on both sides of the
English Channel in recent days. British supermarkets have started
to withdraw French products from their shelves, while angered
French farmers blockaded British trucks from entering France on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
France still refuses to lift its ban on British beef, which has
been ended by the European Commission in August, saying it is not
yet convinced that the British meat is totally safe in the wake of
the "Mad Cow" disease health scare.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Overture to Iran for Normal Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. State Department Spokesman
James Rubin recently reiterated the U.S. overture to Iran for a
normal relationship in an interview with the Iran News daily
published on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have offered to enter into a dialogue without precondition
as to subject matter or outcome," said Rubin, referring to the
goodwill remarks by several U.S. officials on relations between
Washington and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the dialog is to establish a road map of
reciprocal steRubin said that in order to open a dialog, neither the
U.S. nor Iran needs to commit to specific policy changes in
advance, "We must sit down face-to-face to raise and address the
concerns each of us has with regard to the actions of the other."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Iran severed diplomatic relations in 1980 after
radical Iranian students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran in
the heydays of the stormy Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the U.S. imposed economic embargo to
contain Iran and pressure it to change policies on issues such as
the Middle East peace process, international terrorism and weapons
of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk on October 14
called for an "unconditional dialog" between the U.S. and Iran,
but stressed that the U.S. could not lift its sanctions until Iran
made some policy changes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month Rubin also called on Iran to offer help in
the probe of the 1996 bombing of the U.S. military base in
Khorbar, Saudi Arabia, and warned that a conclusion of Iran's
involvement would leave Tehran open to a U.S. response, including
possible military action.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his recent warning, Rubin told Iran News that the
U.S. has no offensive military intentions towards Iran, but
"reserves the right under international law to respond militarily
to a state-sponsored terrorist attack on its citizens."
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the Khobar bombing, our investigation will
continue," he said, "We are determined to see that those
responsible are brought to justice, and we expect the government
of Iran to cooperate in this effort."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. has made it clear to Iran that the
Washington will not lift sanctions unless Iran cooperates in the
fight against terrorism. "Cooperation in the Khobar bombing would
be a first and important step in that direction," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin underlined that the U.S. opposes terrorism under any
circumstances, whether it is directed against Americans or
against Iranians.
</P>
<P>
Restating the U.S. concern over the arrest of 13 Iranian Jews
on espionage charges, he said that the charges are groundless,
"several of those arrested are religious leaders and their
students, and one is a 16-year-old boy."
</P>
<P>
He expresseional standards of due process and justice."
</P>
<P>
These Iranian Jews were arrested in April, accused of spying
for Israel, but Tel Aviv denied any link between them and its
intelligence services.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Liquor Auctioned Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest stored
liquor, confirmed to be a tribute given to the imperial family
during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), and still drinkable, was put
up at auction in Beijing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the China Guardian Auctions Co.
Ltd., yesterday's auction fetched 3.5 million yuan in total
transactions, with the highest price at 60,000 yuan per kg.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time such items were ever put on auction in
China, and the buyers are permitted to take it out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The liquor is part of the more than 2,000 kg of spirits made in
1845 and kept in four wooden containers which were found in the
city of Jinzhou in northeast China's Liaoning Province in June
1996 during the relocation of a local distillery.
</P>
<P>
The liquid, which was sealed in an ancient wine cellar, was
confirmed by the Guinness Records Headquarters in London in July
1998 as the world's oldest cellared spirits.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by Jinzhou's Administration of State Assets, the
China Guardian Auctions Co. packaged 100 kg of the ancient liquid
into 50 units, with the largest unit having four kg of liquor and
the smallest 500 g.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China is now equipping its
largest state-owned fleet of some 1,500 trucks with state-of-the-
art telecommunications technologies.
</P>
<P>
International Freight Co. Ltd. of the China Ocean Shipping
Corporation (COSCO) has armed its 1,460 heavy-duty trucks with
OmniTRACS, a computerized system specially designed for
transportation, the company announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The 35 centimeter-diameter OmniTRACS units, produced by U.S.
telecommunications giant Qualcomm, were installed on the roof of a
truck's cockpits.
</P>
<P>
Anyone in the truck is able to carry out two-way digital
transmissions through this "fat hamburger," which some experts
have nicknamed the OmniTRACS.
</P>
<P>
In this way, headquarters can easily position the running
trucks on a computerized map. The central management body can also
send instructions and information to individual trucks through the
system, which is on the basis of Code Division Multiple Access (
CDMA).
</P>
<P>
"The system can be linked to the Internet, and freight owners
can thereby obtain detailed information about their goods," said
Ye Weilong, general manager of COSCO International Freight Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> UK Peers Bid Goodbye to Hereditaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's House of Lords has
voted to end the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit and
vote in the upper chamber, the BBC reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of peers packed the upper chamber on Tuesday to take
part in the third reading debate of the House of Lords Bill, which
will end the centuries-old tradition.
</P>
<P>
It cleared the Lords by 221 votes to 81 on Tuesday night and
will now return to the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
The government has agreed to 92 hereditaries remaining in the
chamber until the long term reform is completed. Peers will begin
to vote on Wednesday for those hereditaries who will remain.
</P>
<P>
Lords Leader Baroness Jay said the time had come to wish
hereditary peers well and say "thank you and goodbye."
</P>
<P>
She urged peers to allow the bill to pass so the Commons could
consider it as amended by the upper chamber and cautioned against
voting down the legislation.
</P>
<P>
"It is not constitutionally right for this House to deny the
elected House the chance to consider whether a bill which has been
amended in this way is, in its new form, acceptable to it."
</P>
<P>
Lady Jay said Parliament had spent 19 days considering the
issue so no one could say the issues had not been "aired, duly
explored and fully responded to."
</P>
<P>
Reform was "long overdue" and "necessary first step" to remove
the profoundly undemocratic element that hereditary peers
represented, she continued.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 27 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN should adopt a
unified stand by nominating only one among them for the post of
commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force in East Timor,
Malaysian Armed Forces Chief Zahidi Zainuddin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This could strengthen ASEAN's chances of getting the post, he
told reporters after attending the official opening of the
Five-Power Defense Arrangement second professional forum entitled
"Command and Control Warfare" here.
</P>
<P>
"If all the countries in ASEAN start asking for the job, it is
not unified, whereas you go as one," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among ASEAN countries, Malaysia and Thailand are the
front-runners for the top post in the peacekeeping force. A Thai
officer is the deputy commander of the Australian-led
International Force in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday
that his country was willing to lead the U.N. peacekeeping force
if required by the world body.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, from which East Timor chose to break away, said it
wanted someone from ASEAN to lead the U.N. force, while East Timor
pro-independence leader Jose Ramos Horta was against any ASEAN
country leading the mission.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday approved the establishment
of the U.N. Transitional Authority in East Timor comprising almost
8,950 peacekeeping troops, 200 military observers and 1,640 police

<P>
As well as the clock, it contained a battery, a gas canister,
250 grams of gunpowder and 2.5 kilograms of potassium chloride.

No claims of responsibility have been made but police are
looking at possible links with a package of plastic explosives
sent to a police office in Milan Tuesday.

That bomb, hidden inside a videocassette, was defused after a
policeman became suspicious.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Striking primary school teachers
in Nigeria are expected to return to class next week as the
government has agreed to pay all arrears of teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of a meeting between the
government and teachers in capital Abuja on Tuesday said that the
government agreed to pay the wages for January, February, March
and August which amount to 11.42 billion naira (about 114.2
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference after the meeting brokered by the
Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Minister of Labour and Productivity
Chief Tonye Graham-Douglas said that following the consensus
reached at the meeting, the Nigeria Union of Teachers shall call
off its five-week-long strike within a week from Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to put in place a mechanism to ensure
the prompt payment of teachers' salaries through the various state
primary education boards, the New Nigerian newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that a national body would be established
within one month to address the issue of unpaid pensions and
gratuities of primary school teachers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLC has agreed to shelve its proposed nationwide
strike scheduled to start on November 1 in sympathy with the
striking teachers.

On the teachers' salaries allegedly diverted by some state
governments, Special Adviser to the President on Education Chief

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts will launch a
new law enforcement campaign next month with one major aim: the
execution of court rulings on debt-ridden state enterprises.

Even when a debtor enterprise loses a lawsuit, it is often
unable to repay the debt. Without new investment, the debt cannot
be repaid, and a vicious circle is created.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, who insists that rulings must be enforced, urged
courts across the country to seek "strict but flexible" solutions.
</P>
<P>
At an ongoing national meeting on law enforcement, the SPC
suggested that some debtor firms whose products are still
marketable could possibly turn debts into shares.
</P>
<P>
The debtors should pay the debt in kind or by labor in order to
avoid losses of the debtees, Xiao said.

PARIS, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The main armed nationalist group
of the French island of Corsica, the Front de Liberation National
Corse-Historique (FLNC-Historique), claimed on Wednesday six
bombing attacks this month.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or injured in these attacks, which aimed at
government properties when office time was over.
</P>
<P>
The targets of the attacks included a forestry supervision
office, the house of a tax inspector, a police garage and three
tax collection offices, said FLNC in a signed fax to Agence France-
Presse.
</P>
<P>
At a clandestine press conference early this month, the FLNC
rejected government appeal for laying down arms as a precondition
for changing the status of Corsica toward a greater autonomy from
France.

LONDON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The House of Lords on Tuesday night brought down the curtain
on 800 years of its history when it backed the Government's plans
to expel hereditary peers.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Anglo-French beef dispute deepened on Tuesday, as the
European Commission acknowledged it could have difficulty taking
legal action against Paris without a consensus among scientists on
the safety of British beef.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Hereditary peers were heading for the exit from parliament
Tuesday night after the House of Lords approved the Bill
abolishing their right to make the country's law. Only 92 of the
750 hereditary peers will remain after the biggest constitutional
reform this century.

The Independent:
</P>

the Channel.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair's personality ratings with the voters are
beginning to suffer a marked decline, according to the latest
opinion poll. One in three of the electorate now sees him as
increasingly arrogant, while his popularity rating had fallen from
80 percent two years ago to 52 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- General Pervez Musharraf,
chief executive of Pakistan, arrived here Wednesday on his first
visit to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since he seized power in
a military coup earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Musharraf is expected to meet UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan and give a speech to prominent
members of the Pakistani community in the country.
</P>
<P>
UAE is home to some 600,000 Pakistani workers.
</P>
<P>
The military ruler arrived here from Saudi Arabia, where he
held talks with King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz and Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz during his first trip abroad since
seizing power.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said he was satisfied with the support he gained in
talks with the Saudi leadership.
</P>
<P>
On October 12, Musharraf dismissed Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's government and declared himself chief executive of the
country three days later.
</P>
<P>
UAE has said that it regards the coup as Pakistan's internal
affair and hopes security and stability will prevail in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan enjoys traditional good relations with Saudi Arabia
and UAE. Musharraf's visit is seen as an attempt to break his
government's isolation and seek financial support for Pakistan's
battered economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday dismissed as "mere speculations" reports that
Tourism Secretary Gemma Cruz-Araneta and Environment and Natural
Resources Secretary Antonio Cerilles are now on their way out.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio program, the president said he has not made
up his mind about any revamp in his cabinet, although he noted
that all the members of his official family usually submit
courtesy resignation at the start of every year.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth to reports that I will be firing Araneta and
Cerilles. There is no cabinet revamp at this time, I'm still not
thinking of having a cabinet revamp," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Estrada admitted that he will review the performance
of all the members of his cabinet to make sure they are all doing
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
But so far, he said he sees no reason to remove any member of
his cabinet, adding that they are so far performing well in their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The president earlier said that he is expecting all members of
his cabinet to submit their accomplishment reports on or before
the first week of November.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will base his decision whether to retain them,
on the output they have delivered over the last 12 months.

GENEVA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union (EU)
Tuesday finished a new round of talks on China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO), according to local trade sources.

The Chinese delegation led by Long Yongtu, chief trade

WTO accession since the very beginning.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Fire safety in urban centers will
be given unprecedented attention in China in the wake of rapid
urbanization and the extensive use of industrial and electrical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
China has funded a key state laboratory on fire disaster at the
Chinese University of Science and Technology in Hefei, capital of
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium on urban fire safety was recently
held in the scenic Huangshan Mountain, Anhui, attracting more than
150 people from the Chinese mainland and overseas. Participants
presented 73 academic papers dealing with topics ranging from city
fire safety and risks, fire-prevention designs in construction to
fire disasters and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,700 people died in China last year from 116,727 reported
fire disasters. These fires cost the nation 1.15 billion yuan.
Beijing alone reported 3,700 fire disasters from January to July
this year with an estimated loss of 27.6 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Reinvestigate Fighter Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Defense Ministry
Wednesday decided to reinvestigate last month's jet fighter crash
of the country's air force.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Defense Minister Cho Sung-tae said the initial
results published by the air force are not convincing enough.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he ordered the reinvestigation because of
public suspicion of the probe results issued by the air force.
</P>
<P>
An F-5F jet fighter of the air force crashed last month just
minutes after takeoff as its engine burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
The air force, after investigation, said the crash was caused
by water seeping into the fuel tank and safety valves of the
fighter were inoperative.
</P>
<P>
South Korean media questioned how the water seeped into the
fuel tank, why the safety valves were inoperative and why the
required sampling and draining processes were skipped at final
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Minister said it will take legal action and heavily
punish anyone who neglected his duties in the maintenance job.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean National Assembly, or parliament, Wednesday
also decided to form a probe team to find out the truth behind the
crash.

JERUSALEM, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- National Security Council head David Ivry, a former air
force commander, has been appointed ambassador to the United
States to replace Zalman Shoval, a political appointment of former
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been under mounting pressure
recently to choose a loyal ambassador to replace Shoval since the
final-status talks are scheduled to begin in earnest.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon could bring
the Israeli-Syrian peace process to an end, Syrian officials were
quoted as saying by the Al-Nahar daily published in Lebanon
Tuesday. The Syrian officials said Israel's attempt to separate
the Lebanese and Syrian tracks was "very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
They emphasized that Israel cannot ensure quiet along the
northern border without a peace agreement and that peace with
Syria will bring stability to the region.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Police Tuesday arrested two bodyguards of Faisal Husseini,
the senior Palestinian official responsible for Jerusalem affairs,
alleging they attacked an Israeli security guard accompanying
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook during a meeting between the
two officials.
</P>
<P>
The incident immediately became a symbol of the sovereignty
issue. Husseini said the incident showed that the Israelis "feel
deeply that they have no sovereignty in Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Tuesday
he is confident that the special Wye funding to Israel would be
passed despite Congressional opposition. Speaking after a meeting
with Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Cohen said the 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars of aid is not just a goodwill donation, but vital for
U.S. strategic interests.

ISLAMABAD, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Rafiq
Tarar Wednesday underscored Pakistan's positive approach towards
non-proliferation and the centrality of the Kashir dispute to
peace and security in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Talking to visiting Japanese State Secretary for Foreign
Affairs Ichita Yamamoto, Tarar expressed the hope that India would
reciprocate the positive initiatives announced by Chief Executive
Pervaiz Musharraf in his policy statement.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the international community would lend a
supportive hand to this process, said an official statement.
</P>
<P>
In his first policy statement on October 17 after a military
coup, Chief Executive General Musharraf announced a unilateral
military de-escalation on Pakistan's international borders with
India and initiating the return of armed forces that moved to the
border not long ago.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf hoped that this step would serve as a "meaningful
confidence building measure."
</P>
<P>
Tarar underlined the close and cooperative nature of
Pak-Japanese relations and appreciated the understanding evinced
by Japan for the recent developments in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The president said that as announced by the chief executive,
the top priorities of the new government were the strengthening of
the Federation, rapid revival of the economy and ensuring law and
order in the country.

Yamamoto appreciated the circumstances leading to the recent
political change in Pakistan. He lauded Pakistan's commitment to

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Accelerate Port Cargo Clearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Ports Authority (KPA)
has introduced radical verification changes in the clearing of
cargo at the port of Mombasa to curb delays.
</P>
<P>
KPA Managing Director Joseph Munene said in a statement on
Tuesday the customer-driven measures had to be taken because the
cargo clearing process was cumbersome and costly to port users.
</P>
<P>
Munene noted that Mombasa port was losing business to the port
of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania partly due to delays caused by
clearance of cargo, "East African Standard" newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new arrangement, port users will no longer be
required to take the pink copy of the Mombasa Port Release Order
to port police station for final release as this will now be done
at the container terminal.
</P>
<P>
Customers will also not be required to take photocopies of
clearance document to the port authority security, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Munene said the officials in charge of central document office
will prepare and display a verification time schedule to port
customers, which details the vessel's name, arrival time,
commodity and yard allocation of the container.
</P>
<P>
Cargo will be released immediately after the verification
exercise is completed, the port authority head pledged.

<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The retail sales of China's
consumer goods is expected to reach 270.3 billion yuan this month,
which would mean a year-on-year increase of about 6.7 percent,
according to sources at the State Administration of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in urban areas is expected to hit 167.3 billion
yuan or a growth of about eight percent, while sales below the
county level may increase four percent to 103 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration said consumer goods markets
in many Chinese cities are gathering steam from September, with
retail sales increasing at a faster rate than in previous months.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this positive change to government macro-control
policies such as increasing some urban residents' income, plans to
tax interest on savings deposits, and the issuing of more treasury
bonds, all of which began taking effect in the latter half of the
year.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, retail sales nationwide totaled 2,

Asian tourists, including Thais, due to the economic recovery in
the region, and the 20 percent average reduction of hotel prices
in the territory," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT),
overall outbound tourists fell nearly 15 percent last year when
compared to those in 1997, due to the economic crisis, with Thai
tourist arrivals in the Hong Kong felling by 35 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Rice Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists have
improved the quality of hybrid rice based on new research by Yuan
Longping, who is known as the "Father of Hybrid Rice".
</P>
<P>
Yuan's strain is expected to be used on major hybrid rice
fields by next year, which is expected to increase output by 5
billion kg.
</P>
<P>
He announced the new strain early last month, after producing
12,000 kg of grain per hectare on a dozen experimental fields in
Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces.
</P>
<P>
A research team in Fujian Province found that they could
further improve the rice by using nuclear radiation technology to
produce mutated rice that could increase per-unit yields by 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rice is expected to help add 5 billion kg of hybrid
rice annually in China, according to Yang Rencui, a professor at
Fujian Agriculture University.
</P>
<P>
China has 110 million hectares of land for grain and expects to
produce 495 million tons of grain this year, about the same as for
1998.
</P>
<P>
Yang says that China has developed its rice in three stages
this century. The first period was in the 1960s, when scientists
reduced the height of the stem to keep it from bending. Yuan began
using hybrid technology in the 1970s and increased rice output.
</P>
<P>
The high yields, however, have depended on a chemical called
gibberellin that helps avoid genetic defects, but it means higher
costs, Yang says, and excessive use of the chemical has a negative
effect on genes, but genetic changes proved to be a solution to
that problem. His research team is trying to register a new rice
gene with the International Rice Heredity Association.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Leaves for Landmark Visit to France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami left here early Wednesday morning to start his landmark
visit to France, the first one by an Iranian head of state since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Khatami told reporters that Iran and
France share identical views, as France enjoys a special type of
independence in Europe and Iran a specific position in the region,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tehran-Paris ties are in the interest of both countries, he
said, France holds a pivotal stance in the area of civilization
and bilateral relations are ties between the two nations which
have played a determining role in their fate.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two can be effective in serving
stability and security in both Europe and Asia, Khatami said,
reiterating that Iran is willing to establish relations with all
countries on the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day official visit, the Iranian president will
hold talks with his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin, Senate President Christian Poncelet and
other French officials.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that Khatami will focus his talks on
bilateral relations, ties between Iran and the European Union and
his proposed dialog among civilizations.
</P>
<P>
French officials have said that the talks will also touch the
West's concern on Iran's stance over the Middle East peace
process, international terrorism, weapons of mass destruction as
well as human rights status in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and the European countries are warming
up. Khatami made his first European tour since taking office to
Italy in March, whereas Austrian President Thomas Klestil has just
concluded his visit to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Khatami's visit to Paris would also
leave a positive impact on relations between Iran and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of his Paris trip, Khatami will also attend
the general conference of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization general and address the
conference on dialog among civilizations.

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese soldiers soon will be
enjoying a new generation of army food which is more diversified
and better tasting.
</P>
<P>
The General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation
Army (PLA) disclosed today that it has developed China's third

A packet of the new provisions, consisting of high-energy,
nutritional, and flavorful elements, is sufficient to meet the
needs of one man for a whole day, according to a PLA source.
</P>
<P>
This new generation of military provisions comes in different
categories, including those for common use and those for long-
distance military operations, so as to meet the needs of different
military units and a variety of combat situations.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Police Seize Deadly Key-Ring Pistol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus police seized a deadly
key-ring gun, only the seventh ever to be seized in the world, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gun was found when police arrested Leonidas Aidinidi, a
26-year-old Greek from Georgia, on Monday night at the Elefitheria
Square in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The gun was loaded, said the police, adding that it had a
chamber for two 32-calibre bullets and could kill at a distance of
20 yards (about 18 meters).
</P>
<P>
The micro-weapon, about three inches long and as wide as a
matchbox, could be brought for 20 U.S. dollars, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Another eight bullets were found at Aidinidi's apartment in
Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The gun is the first of its kind ever seen on the island.
Interpol had informed the authorities in 177 countries, including
Cyprus, of the gun's existence as far back as March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Police said airport security worldwide had also been warned to
be vigilant to the gun because the tiny weapon, although made of
metal, could not be spotted by metal detectors, making it ideal
for terrorists and hijackers.
</P>
<P>
The first of the pistols, called The Wasp, was seized at
London's Heathrow Airport in 1998. Since then, others have been
found in Australia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Australian police found an instructions booklet written in
Bulgarian with the weapon they discovered last year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Allocates Funds to Fight  Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has set
aside a budget of 300 million shillings (about four million U.S.
dollars) for famine relief as many parts of the country are facing
an acute shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary Zakayo Cheruiyot in the Office of the
President Tuesday announced the government decision after he held
an emergency meeting with all the eight provincial commissioners
in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Wednesday quoted Cheruiyot as saying that out
of the allocations, 240 million shillings will be used to buy food
and the rest for transport payment.
</P>
<P>
Cheruiyot said that his government requires one million bags
(90 kgs per bag) of maize for the next six months to feed the
affected people.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that famine has affected 21 districts in five
provinces, mainly in Rift Valley and eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
So far, the permanent secretary said, 64,000 bags of maize have
been distributed to the affected districts, adding that the
current situation had been caused by bad weather and crop failed
and also because "the rains came late.''
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will soon distribute 258,000 bags
of maize and beans available in store.
</P>
<P>
According to Cheruiyot, the Kenyan government was coordinating
with the United Nations the provision of water, and looking at the
needs for human health and livestock health in the famine-stricken
districts.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that the government is taking disciplinary
action against any civil servants found interfering with food
relief or misusing relief food.

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua)-- China plans to cut the number of
its domestic air flights by 7.9 percent to 11,140, while
increasing overseas flights by 2.76 percent for the period from
October 31 to March 25.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (

Beginning May 1 this year, the CAAC reduced the number of

Last year, domestic aviation suffered great losses because of

<HEADLINE> Giant Pandas To Have Goat Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Local giant pandas soon will be
drinking goat milk as a result of a recent deal between the Heifer
Project International (HPI) and the Giant Panda Research Center in
the Wolong Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
HPI is a non-governmental and non-profit U.S. charitable
institution which help developing countries with their animal
husbandry.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, HPI's China office will send some 60 fine-breed
goats to needy households in the reserve area and the research
center will buy the goat's milk from these farmers.
</P>
<P>
He Xiaoping, deputy director of the Wolong Nature Reserve, told
reporters that baby pandas cannot eat bamboo until they are 18
months old, and adult pandas also need milk for their health.
</P>
<P>
That's why the research center usually buy large quantities of
powdered milk to cope with the needs of the 46 pandas in the
center, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Goat milk is more digestible than powdered milk and is better
for pandas," said He Xiaoping, adding that the cost also is much
lower.
</P>
<P>
This agreement offers a long-term source of milk for the pandas
in the center, and also provides local farmers a good opportunity
to earn extra money, he added.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Suicide Rate Rises Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 27 (Xinhua) -- The suicide rate in South Korea
surged almost 50 percent in 1998 compared to the previous year, as
the country has been plagued by a financial crisis since the end
of 1997, a report released said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the statistics by the South Korean National Statistics
Office, 19.9 of every 100,000 persons committed suicide in 1998,
up from 8.7 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
In terms of suicide age, the biggest rise came from the elderly
aged 60 and over.
</P>
<P>
In the group of 60 to 64 year-old, the suicide rate, which
stood at 12.6 of every 100,000 in 1989, kept on rise, hitting 20
in 1997 and then surging to 34.1 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The suicide rate of 65 to 69 year-old age group more than
doubled from 15.3 in 1989 to 33.4 of every 100,000 persons in 1998
while the figure of the 70 to 74 year-old age group soared from 18.
4 to 36.1 persons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the suicide rate among the young people aged 14 to
19 also climbed, with 9.6 of every 100,000 taking their own lives
last year compared with 6.6 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
On sexual distinction, 57.9 of every 100,000 men committed
suicide last year, a surge from the 19.7 in 1989, while the
suicide figure of female jumped to 14.1 from 7.7 of every 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the increasing elderly suicide rate to a
much weakened social position brought by industrialization and the
economic and psychological hardships caused by the financial
crisis, which occurred in November 1997 due to corporate failures
and bad loans of financial institutions.

Royal Government of Cambodia to accelerate the reform process."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any well-thought idea and comment," he added.
</P>

BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- According to an agreement
reached by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRA) and
China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), insurance firms can
buy shares of security investment funds, "China Securities News"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that insurance firms need to diversify their

</P>
<P>
Chinese insurance companies first participated in stock
investments at the end of 1980s through setting up securities
companies. However, with the issuing of the insurance law in 1995,
the stock market could no longer rely on insurance capital.
</P>
<P>
"China Securities News" also reported that the Chinese
insurance companies reaped 124.7 billion yuan in premium last year,
whereas in 1998, insurance companies had 179.6 billion yuan in
assets. However, between 40-60 percent of its capital has been
lying idle in banks, which has lowered interest rates, prompting
insurance companies to seek new venues for investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 27 (Xinhua) -- India's software exports
registered a growth of 37 percent in the first half of the current
financial year beginning on April 1, the Hindustan Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Export revenue from software touched 103.7 billion rupees (2.4
billion U.S. dollars) in the first six months ending on September
30 compared to that in the same period last year, according to the
Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC).
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted ESC chairman Vivek Singhal as saying that
during the second half of the 1999-2000 fiscal year, software
exports were likely to exceed 130 billion rupees (3.02 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The overall annual growth in software exports would go up by
some 33 percent as against 177.75 billion rupees (4.13 billion
dollars) achieved in the previous year, said Singhal.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government has decided to bring ESC under the
planned Ministry of Information Technology.
</P>
<P>
Singhal said the decision would encourage software exports in
the country, and implementation of the government policies in a
coordinated manner to achieve the target of 50 billion dollar
exports by the year 2008 would be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Priorities now should be to diversify into information
technology-related services and encourage small units, the ESC
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the government to offset the imbalance between the
south, which accounted for 80 percent of the software exports, and
the northern parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> More New Zealanders in Money Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- More New Zealanders are
getting into financial trouble and becoming bad credit risks.
</P>
<P>
Baycorp, a debt collection and credit check agency in New
Zealand, released new figures here Wednesday, showing that in the
first six months of this year, 22.8 percent of the people it
checked had an adverse credit record. Last year's figure for the
same period was 19.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise continues a long-term trend.
</P>
<P>
Baycorp does about 15,000 credit checks a day. Credit checks
are done on people applying for a mortgage, a credit card, hire
purchases or other credit. An adverse record could be produced by
missing payments on these or other services, such as a phone bill.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show New Zealand has a higher rate of credit
problems than Australia, where up to 10 percent of people have
credit problems.
</P>
<P>
The result confirms statistics that show New Zealanders to be
high spenders and poor savers. This contributes to the country's
high balance of payments deficit, which is currently 6.3 billion
NZ dollars (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) and forecast to rise to 8.6
billion NZ dollars (4.5 billion U.S. dollars) within the next
year.

<HEADLINE> MBA Students Welcomed in Chinese Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen enterprises have
recently signed an agreement with the School of Business
Administration attached to China's prestigious Qinghua University,
inviting MBA students to do further training.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth in China has made us realize the crucial role
of senior managing staffs," said Zhou Huan, chairman of the Datang
Telecom Group under the Ministry of Information Industry, adding
that out-of-date managing systems and lack of qualified managers
have been main reasons for the mismanagement or bankruptcy of many
enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
After graduating, most MBA students started working for joint
ventures companies. There were only nine MBA schools in China in
the early 1990s with a total of 80 students as against 56 MBA
schools in China with more than 8,000 students.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangwu, vice-president of Qinghua University's MBA school,
said that students doing a MBA must put their knowledge into
practice as they enter the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
After having done two months of practical training with an
enterprise, Liu Wujie, a MBA student, said that China is short of
experienced and competent managing staff.
</P>
<P>
Liu worked in a state-owned enterprise during the summer
vacation earning a monthly salary of 3,000 yuan (360 US dollars).
The manager was impressed with Liu's work and asked him to return
after graduation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zhangwu said that China is now in great need of MBA
graduates. Foreign enterprises, state-owned enterprises and public-
owned firms are now competing for qualified, talented graduates.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Drops Significantly in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's unemployment rate
has dropped significantly to 8.6 percent in the first quarter of
1999 from 13.6 percent in the corresponding period of 1994,
according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate fell by a big margin due to the rapid economic
growth and resultant employment opportunities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said a large number of industries and self-employment
projects which started islandwide had accounted for the decline of
unemployment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many industrial parks have been set up throughout the country,
generating a large number of direct and indirect employment.
</P>
<P>
Over 50,000 jobs will be created at Sri Lanka's recently opened
first international standard industrial park spreading over 168
hectares of land at Sitawaka in suburban Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Other industrial parks will generate 89,500 direct and indirect
employment opportunities. The five parks in the south alone will
house 89 factories, expecting to create more than 22,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The figures also show that Sri Lanka's per capita income had
risen to 840 U.S. dollars last year from 588 dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The prestigious Heritage Foundation Institute together with the
Wall Street Journal has ranked Sri Lanka 27th in the economic
freedom index on a par with South Korea, Norway and Sweden out of
151 countries.

<P>
ZAGREB, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Speaker Vlatko Pavlrtic
said Tuesday that it is impossible to achieve success in a global
economy if the gaps between rich and poor countries only gets
wider.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a international seminar titled: "Croatia
2000 -- the Challenges and Opportunities in the New Era", which
began here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said small countries should not bind their own hands and
feet. On the contrary, they should try to reach their development
goals, which they can not realize by themselves, but only through
participating in the process of economic globalization, according
to the Zagreb newspaper Glasnik.
</P>
<P>
The speaker called on outstanding figures in the scientific,
social and political fields to make contributions to the full-
scale development of Croatia.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Values Long-Term Friendly Ties With Portugal, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said Tuesday that the fact that he has visited Portugal twice in
six years proves that China attaches importance to developing long-
term and stable friendly relations with the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a state banquet given in his honor by his
Portuguese counterpart Jorge Sampaio, Jiang said that recent years
have witnessed continued expansion of Sino-Portuguese friendly
cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and scientific-
technological fields and deepening of mutual understanding between
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Sharing broad consensus and common interests in handling major
international issues, both countries care for world peace and
development and hope to step up friendship and cooperation based
on equality and mutual benefit. China is ready to make joint
efforts with Portugal to actively explore new ways and fields to
expand bilateral cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
When the Chinese government resumes the exercise of
sovereignty over Macao in less than two months, it will mark
another important step forward in the Chinese people's cause of
achieving complete national reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth settlement of the Macao issue, which results from
cooperation between the two countries, offers the world a good
example of solving problems left over by history through peaceful
negotiation, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Macao to China, the Chinese government
will unswervingly carry out the principles of "one country, two
systems," "Macao people governing Macao" and "high level of
autonomy" in the region, he said, adding that Macao will certainly
have a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
The successful settlement of the Macao issue will provide a
new starting point to better advance the Sino-Portuguese friendly
cooperation, he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ruling parties of Serbia and
Montenegro republics of Yugoslavia have been discussing their
relations for the past two days.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with a delegation from the Socialist Democratic
Party of Montenegro (SDPM) here on Tuesday, Gorica Gajevic,
general secretary of the Serbian Socialist Party, told reporters
that the form of federation of Yugoslavia is in the interests of
both peoples in Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
A unified country will be absolutely capable of guaranteeing
the equality of the two republics, she said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also agreed that to promote the development
of the Federation of Yugoslavia is the goal of the two parties and
transformation of the federal's function could only be realized
through legal means, the party secretary added.
</P>
<P>
Svetozar Marovic, vice chairman of the SDPM and president of
the Montenegrin Assembly, said that the proposal by the
Montenegrin government "is not to divide the country", but to
realize "a more open, more democratic and more promising
commonwealth."
</P>
<P>
The delegation of Montenegro also held talks with
representatives from the Yugoslav United Left party.
</P>
<P>
On October 25 and 26, delegations from the Serbian Radical
Party, the SDPM and the Socialist People's Party also discussed
this matter.
</P>
<P>
The government of Montenegro passed a draft plan on August 5,
proposing the name of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia be
changed into the "Commonwealth of States of Montenegro and Serbia.
" It also asked for reconsideration of relationship between the
two republics.
</P>
<P>
The proposal has been submitted to the Serb government and the
Montenegrin Assembly, which is expected to discuss it during its

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Newly appointed Indonesian
State Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Mahadi Sinambela said
he would be committed to sports development in his new post.
</P>
<P>
"I will commit myself to sports because, so far, sports
development in the country has been shoved aside," he was quoted
by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Citing an example, Sinambela said soccer fields have changed to
malls as a result of the impact of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the National Sports Council (KONI) secretary-
general Rudolf S. Warouw and sports observer Mangombar Ferdinand
Siregar both expressed hope that Sinambela would be able to push
House of Representative members to issue a Sports Law.
</P>
<P>
The law, which is needed to develop sports in the country, was
submitted to the House in early 1990, but there has been no
progress.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of homework that must be finished by the new
minister. He should not only issue political statements but also
get involved in sport activities," Siregar said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls for Just, Rational New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here Tuesday that China is ready to work hard with Portugal
and other European Union (EU) countries for the establishment of a
just and rational new political and economic order in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted by Portuguese President Jorge
Sampaio, the Chinese president said that as the world is
undergoing profound changes and the overall international
situation is generally moving toward detente, the world is far
from peace within the existence of hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard world peace and promote common development are
two major themes facing mankind, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and calls
for increasing mutual trust and peaceful settlement of existing
disputes on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-
Existence as well as carrying out economic-technical cooperation
on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that as the EU is an important force on the
international arena, the strengthening of dialogue and cooperation
between China and the EU and their common efforts for the
establishment of a durably stable constructive partnership toward
the new century will not only conform to the interests of the two
sides, but will also benefit peace, stability and development of
the world.

<HEADLINE> American Writer to Put Chinese Soccer Women into Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, October 27 (Xinhua) -- He does not care about soccer,
but he is deeply impressed by those Chinese women who play it.
</P>
<P>
With four best-sellers in America to his credit, Gay Talese is
considering a best-selling story following his visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"It is a team story not an individual story, it is about
sportsmanship and team effort," said Talese, the well-known
prolific American writer who flew to see the Chinese women's team
last week.
</P>
<P>
"I love the Chinese women's team, I don't like the sports, nor
soccer. I like the behavior of them, they are women of good
breeding, of good manners, that is why I came here."
</P>
<P>
The day he gained his initial knowledge about the Chinese women
soccer squad he came up with the idea of having a personal
interview with them.
</P>
<P>
The knowledge from the television during the third Women's
World Cup was limited but enough to touch him.
</P>
<P>
"They are one of the most impressive and admirable aspects of
the modern China life, in my opinion, and they are the modern
personification of China today and future," said Talese.
</P>
<P>
Why?
</P>
<P>
"Because women have never been so physical, so successful and
yet still are women. They are not women looking like men, they are
not women wanting to be men, they are women who want to be women,
but they are physical, successful and impressive."
</P>
<P>
But in the United States it is not the case, said the American-
Italian writer.
</P>
<P>
"In my country there are a lot of women who are envious of men,
they want to be like men. They are feminist while Chinese women
are feminine. There is miles difference between feminist and
feminine."
</P>
<P>
But what touched Talese most was the good manners of the
Chinese women after they lost the penalty kicks and the chances
for the third World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
"From the faces of the Chinese women (after the final match), I
think this is a country of dignity and they have good manners,"
said Talese.
</P>
<P>
The writer was in particular filled with sympathy for Liu Ying
when she suffered the great disappointment of missing the penalty
kick which costed the Chinese women squad dearly.
</P>
<P>
"Liu Ying endured the disappointment with grace and great
sportsmanship. She did not complain, she accepted her fate and
moved on into the future, expecting that next time things will be
better."
</P>
<P>
That has been the main motive for him to come to China on his
own expense, hoping for an interview with Liu.
</P>
<P>
"She is a woman of fortitude and hope and courage. As I said,
watching on television, I thought she personified the best
qualities of women in the world of international sports -- women
who do their best, who remain courteous and dignified even when
things do not work out to their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
"I want to talk to her, I want to hear her explanation, in her
own words, her hopes, and aspirations for herself and for her team,
" said Talese.
</P>
<P>
Talese was glad to know Liu has had 15 goals to her credit
including one converted penalty kick in the just-concluded season.
</P>
<P>
"Liu is loved by her team and admired by her coach. Her coach
told me that Liu Ying would not hesitate to have a kick now. Her
life has been successful and is getting up since that kick.
</P>
<P>
"She will become a better and stronger person because of that.
The future will be bright for she now has experience of
perseverance. The remarked champions are the people who persevere.
"
</P>
<P>
The media failure to do a full coverage of the World Cup has
been the other motive behind his Chinese journey.
</P>
<P>
"It is terrible," he said of the American reporting of the
World Cup. "They did not tell me anything about the Chinese team
except they lost. So it is hard to say how I am hopeful to be the
first person to write not only a good story but also a big story
about China today through the advancement of the women athletes.
</P>
<P>
"In modern China which is the land of future, the regime has
got equal opportunity for women and the people over here I met are
the personification of the regime," said the writer. "I believe
the Chinese women's soccer type is part of China's movement toward
modernization and world leadership."
</P>
<P>
"I want to write the story for nobody has ever read the story
in the United States," Talese said.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Howard Defends Constitutional Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 27 (Xinhua) -- With Prime Minister John
Howard's official intervention last night, the republic debate in
Australia starts to reach its peak.
</P>
<P>
Howard issued a detailed statement to defend the present
constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Believing the republic will not give Australia a more effective
system of government, Howard said: "Not all change is for the
better, I can not support change for change's sake."
</P>
<P>
Countering the argument that the Queen is a borrowed monarch
from another country and Australia should have it's own head of
state, Howard said the Queen is the Queen of Australia. "However,
under our present constitution, the governor-general is
effectively already the head of state."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the republic would not enhance Australia'
independence nor its democracy.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held on November 6 to decide whether the
country will be changed into a republic in which a president would
be appointed by a two-third majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Latest polls showed a very sensitive balance between the
monarchists and republicans. To republicans, the thing is their
division into two rivals. The so-called "direct-election"
republicans opposed the proposed republic model and claimed to
vote no. The opposition leader and republican Kim Beazley has
proposed a two-step strategy to vote yes first and then try to
have another constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
However, Howard ruled out any possibility of another convention
in his statement, saying that "if voters chose a republic,
politicians from all sides would ensure there would never be
another referendum to allow Australians to move to a directly
elected president."
</P>
<P>
The remarks are believed to be a heavy blow to republicans,
many of whom are seriously concerned that they would be defeated
owing to the division.
</P>
<P>
The monarchists and direct-election faction will vote no. But
Howard said that "my cause is not their cause." In his view, a
directly elected presidency could produce rival power centers in
the political system and create serious divisions within the
society.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that two influential republicans, former prime
ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating, will add their weight to the
yes side.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay to Hold General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay will elect a
president, a vice-president, 30 senators and 99 deputies from a
list of 425 candidates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
There are five parties taking part in the elections, but the
wide variety of groups and sectors in each party is the reason for
such a high quantity of candidates.
</P>
<P>
The coalition of the leftist Progressive Movement (Encuentro
Progresista), presented 208 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Colorado Party, with Jorge Batlle running for
president, put up 68 candidates, compared with 93 nominated by the
ex-president Luis Lacalle-led National (Blanco) Party.
</P>
<P>
The social democrat New Space Party (Nuevo Espacio), led by
Rafael Michelini, presented 22 candidates, and the minority Civic
Union Party, 34.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.4 million Uruguayans are permitted to vote in the
elections, and voting is obligatory by law.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said no single candidate will receive an absolute
majority, indicating a second round election planned for November
28.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Income From Taxes Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's State Internal Revenue
Department collected a total of 27.521 billion Kyats (91.7 million
U.S. dollars) of taxes in the first half of this year, a 2.5
percent drop from the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official Economic Indicators, in the
half-year period, Myanmar also gained a total of 389 million
dollars from customs duties, a fall of 46.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the
Myanmar government has adopted some new policies to collect taxes
in the country in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Exemption of customs duties on the import of agricultural
implements, including related machinery, pesticide and fertilizer,
was among the measures taken to ensure that agriculture, the
mainstay of the country's economy, is not effected.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include raising the customs duties of luxury
goods imported and levying an 8 percent commercial tax on
commodities sold in foreign currencies beginning January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Needs to Import More Edible Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's domestic production of
edible oil is not meeting its demand and it still has to import a
large amount of such oil.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the country's
Central Statistical Organization, Myanmar imported a total of 53.4
million U.S. dollars' worth of edible oil in the first half of
this year, 12.6 percent less than the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that in 1998, Myanmar imported a total
of 121.7 million dollars' worth of edible oil. The figure for 1997
was 124.7 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population is growing at an annual rate of 2 percent.
As there is no corresponding adjustment of the cultivated area of
oil crops with less per-hectare output, Myanmar is still
insufficient with edible oil.
</P>
<P>
To strive for self-sufficiency in the oil, Myanmar has leased
out large plots of vacant and virgin land to be run by private
entrepreneurs, providing the oil crop growers with agricultural
loans and granting advance payment for the crops.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Further Control Airlines Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Transport Minister
David Collenette reaffirmed the country's decision to retain
control of the airline industry for the next century during a
recent meeting in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
He told the lawmakers there may be a change in the current
limit of 10 percent ownership by individuals in Air Canada, but
the remaining "25 percent limit on foreign voting shares will not
be changed."
</P>
<P>
Collenette made the statement after the country's top two
airlines, Air Canada and Canadian Airlines, were locked in a
merger fight that threatened to delay the restructuring of the
airline industry.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada and Canadian Airlines are respectively siding with
Star Alliance and AMR's Oneworld alliance, in which American
Airlines controls 25 percent of Canadian Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada is teaming up with Lufthansa, United Airlines and
the Canadian imperial Bank of Commerce to seek 35 percent of its
own shares in a counterbid for the merger proposed by the Toronto
based Onex Corp, which is believed to be a partner of American
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders are expected to vote on the merger on November 8
after Onex first made it public in late August at a price of 5.7
billion Canadian dollars (about 3.8 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent ownership limit of Air Canada is a key
bargaining chip, which has to be lifted even if the necessary two
thirds of the shareholders would vote for the merger proposed by
Onex.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada was reported to have approached Canadian Airlines
with its own merger proposal last winter. The secret merger talks
turned out to be an open fight between global alliances because of
differences over debt issue, job cuts and control of lucrative
Asian routes.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) have invited its members to apply to host the
13th Asian Cup in 2004.
</P>
<P>
All bids must have the backing of the governments of the
respective countries and the closing date for the bids is December
31 this year, AFC General Secretary Peter Velappan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The successful host will be decided by the AFC executive
committee which meets in Lebanon in October next year during the
12th Asian Cup, he said in a press statement released here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AFC members have been warned against organizing
international invitational tournaments and friendlies without
prior approval.
</P>
<P>
There has been a tendency among a number of national
associations in recent months to organize international
tournaments and friendlies without approval, Velappan said, adding
"such arrangements are in violation of the statutes of the AFC
regarding the organization of invitational tournaments and matches.
"
</P>
<P>
He said that in some instances, applications to organize the
events were submitted very late to the AFC.
</P>
<P>
The AFC at its executive committee meeting here recently
decided that all national associations must comply with the AFC
statutes or face severe disciplinary measures including fines and
sanctions, he said.

<HEADLINE> Peru-Ecuador Peace Irreversible: Peruvian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori said here on Tuesday that the peace between his
country and Ecuador is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who on Tuesday began an official three-day visit to
Ecuador to celebrate the first anniversary of the peace treaty
between the two countries, made the statement at a press
conference on Tuesday in the Government Palace of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori stressed that one of the achievements of the peace
accord, signed one year ago by Ecuador and Peru, was the attention
by the governments of Lima and Quito in national problems and not
in conflicts, and that this also extends to the populations of the
two countries, especially the residents of the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The host president, Jamil Mahuad, stated that the fruits of
peace with Peru were clear and evident. The investments had
arrived in the form of irrigated land, construction of highways,
communications and bridges, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad and Fujimori expressed their belief that the way to
achieve peace is to reach an investment level to the sum of 3.5
billion dollars for the realization of border projects.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador singed a peace agreement in October of 1998.
The accord went into effect on May 13, 1999 and ended a
long-standing border dispute between the two neighboring countries
that erupted into wars in 1941, 1985 and 1995.

<HEADLINE> L.America, China Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Trade between the Latin
American countries and China has increased in a very dynamic way,
an official report said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volume of exchange increased from 639 million U.S. dollars
in 1979 to 2.271 billion dollars in 1990, and tripled in 1996 to
6.729 billion dollars, said the statement released by the Latin
American Economic System (LAES) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that throughout 1998, the exchange totalled
8.312 billion dollars, of which, Chinese sales accounted for 5.322
billion dollars, while purchases accounted for 2.989 billion
dollars. In general, there was a higher dynamism in Chinese
exports, which provoked a rise in the trading deficit for many
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that one characteristic of the trade is that
it continues to be concentrated in certain countries. In general,
countries which have ports in the Pacific have a higher and more
diversified trade pattern. In the case of the Central American
countries and the Caribbean, the exchanges are more limited, with
the exception of Cuba and Panama.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the principal Latin American and Caribbean exports
were, in order, from Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Peru, Mexico and
Cuba, while the principal importers from the same region were in
order, Brazil, Panama (Canal Zone), Peru, Mexico, Chile, Cuba, and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
The 10 principal export products from Latin America to China in
1996, were soya, sugar cane, fish meal, iron, cotton and wool
fibres, steel laminates, copper, wood pulp, iron and steel tubes,
fertilizers and fish products.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Russia Overreacts on Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that Russia overreacted to the
U.S. plan on anti-ballistic missile system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen, Albright said that the threat
"that comes to all our countries from rogue states" is a "common
problem."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, a Russian defense spokesman confirmed a
comment by first deputy defense minister Nikolai Mikhailov that
Russia had enough weapons to overwhelm any anti-ballistic system
deployed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
In order to deploy its anti-ballistic missile system legally,
the U.S. is pressing Russia to modify the landmark 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. Russia strongly opposed the
move.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post quoted Mikhailov as saying that Russia had
ability to penetrate any anti-ballistic missile shield and that it
would develop its "technical capabilities" further if pushed to do
so by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"If the United States violates the 1972 ABM treaty... Russia
can unequivocally defend itself by improving its weaponry,"
Mikhailov said.
</P>
<P>
Some believe the arms control agenda is in danger of collapsing
as the U.S. Senate rejected a global nuclear test ban treaty one
week ago and the temperature of the U.S.-Russian disputes is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think that the whole arms control agenda is in danger
of collapsing," Albright told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I must say, though, that I was troubled by the reports today
of some statements by the Russian military that I think are an
overreaction to our desire to deal with what we believe is a
common problem," she added.
</P>
<P>
"And so I don't want us to -- anybody, whether here or in
Russia, to be reviving old problems. We should be trying to solve
new problems," Albright added.
</P>
<P>
On another thorny issue, the two foreign ministers also joined
in urging Russia to pull back its forces from Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Russia not to repeat the mistakes of the past in
Chechnya, and instead to open a dialogue toward a peaceful
resolution with legitimate Chechen partners," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Saying he completely agreed with Albright, Aartsen said "a
warning toward Russia is necessary."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Iraqi Opposition Groups to Unite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in order
to use Iraqi opposition force to overthrow President Saddam
Hussein, has urged Iraqi opposition groups to "stand together on
the world stage" for the U.S. purpose.
</P>
<P>
Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering told the opposition
groups in a letter on Monday that the Iraqi opposition groups
should unite before Washington could help oust Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi opposition groups will hold a four-day meeting,
starting on Friday, at a New York hotel, discussing "Iraq's
future."
</P>
<P>
Pickering said Americans "wish to support... the rebirth of a
strong, unified liberation movement and organization."
</P>
<P>
"I hope each of you will choose to stand together on the world
stage in New York in a few days... to inspire your countrymen with
a powerful vision of national unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The New York meeting will bring together 300-400 delegates,
representing groups ranging from the Iraqi Kurds to Shi'ite
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The largest single organization is the Iraqi National
Congress (INC). One possibility is that the INC can persuade
other groups to join, creating a single opposition alliance, but
some delegates would prefer an alliance under another name.
</P>
<P>
Pickering insisted that there is no alternative to the renewed
and reunified Iraqi national Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has congressional approval to
spend $100 million on the Iraqi opposition, mostly in the form
of surplus Pentagon equipment, but it has hesitated to give out
anything until the Iraqi opposition begins to look credible.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Newspaper Readership Remains Competitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Online usage is not hurting
print product and newspaper readership in the top 50 U.S. markets
remains "healthy and competitive," particularly when compared to
the performance of other media, according to a report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, U.S. online users -- particularly online newspaper
readers -- remain strong consumers of the print product, said the
report from the Newspaper Association of America (NAA), a
nonprofit organization representing the 54-billion-dollar
newspaper industry and more than 2,000 newspapers in the U.S. and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
According to NAA's research data, among all Internet users in
the top 50 American markets, 61 percent read a daily newspaper on
paper, and nearly three-quarters read one on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 67 percent of online users who looked at an online
newspaper in the past six months also read a printed daily
newspaper; and on Sunday the figure jumped to 78 percent.
</P>
<P>
"These numbers are tangible evidence that newspapers are a
considerable force not only in print, but also online -- and that
they compliment each other nicely," the NAA report said. "The
online arena has given newspapers the perfect forum in which to
expand their already well-known brands, reaching ever-broader
audiences."
</P>
<P>
The report said that other media were not as fortunate as the
print media. The average half-hour of prime-time broadcast
television, for example, continued its steady decline, capturing
38.5 percent of the audience in the fall report, compared to 39.6
percent in spring. Radio morning drive also registered a decline,
with the average quarter-hour capturing 24.5 percent of the
audience, a drop from 25.7 percent in spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- China has reduced the
number of births by 338 million in the past 30 years due to its
family planning efforts, a Chinese delegate to a U.N. session said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The success has contributed to China's economic development and
pushed back the 6 billion world population day by four years, said
the delegate Liu Jingtao.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's most populous nation with 1.2 billion
inhabitants, has made family planning, population growth control
and the enhancement of the quality of population as its
fundamental policies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.N. session on the implementation of the
Program of Action of the 1994 Cairo Conference on Population and
Development, Liu said much remains to be done worldwide to achieve
the goals set forth in the Conference.
</P>
<P>
The economic crises and natural disasters in some countries and
regions have had a serious effect on the process of implementation
and local wars and regional conflicts threaten peace and
development, the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
There are still many couples and individuals in the world who
dong't have adequate access to basic reproductive health and
family planning services while official development assistance in
the population area has been cut drastically. Liu pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Native Logs Seized in Rights Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- In a latest dispute over
aboriginal rights, the provincial government of New Brunswick has
seized a load of Crown lumber, saying aboriginals have no right to
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Natural Resources Minister Jeannot Volpe and Justice Minister
Brad Green of the Atlantic Canada province confirmed the seizure
Tuesday after taking the action at the Belledune mill Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government issued a warning Tuesday of possible charges
against any illegal cutting, transporting or purchasing of wood.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported a demonstration by Mi'kmag loggers Monday
near the largest Mi'kmaq reserve with a population of 2,300.
</P>
<P>
Citing a Supreme Court ruling of last month, the demonstrators
said the court upholds a treaty of centuries old that give them
rights to log, hunt and fish.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government disagrees with the point, insisting
the Marshall decision does not cover logging.
</P>
<P>
Invoking a 1760 treaty, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in
the case of Donald Marshall Jr. that Maritime Mi'kmaqs and
Maliseets have rights to year-round hunting, fishing and
gathering, which natives interpret to include logging.
</P>
<P>
The event came after tensions were reported at nearby Burnt
Church between natives and non-natives over right to fish Atlantic
lobsters. The federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans recently
removed several hundred native lobster traps from Miramichi Bay.
</P>
<P>
Federal Fisheries Minister Herb Dhaliwal has said the Burnt
Church reserve can have no more than 600 traps.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has calculated the cost of satisfying
all aboriginal demands at some 200 billion Canadian dollars (about
136 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Native Indians, including Mi'kmaqs and Maliseets, number more
than 780,000 out of the total population of 30.5 million in
Canada.

<HEADLINE> Oman Calls for Continued Compliance With Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Omani Petroleum and Natural
Gas Minister Mohammed al-Ramhi on Tuesday urged major oil
producing countries to stick to the output quota set last March,
which has raised oil prices dramatically since being implemented.
</P>
<P>
Sticking to the quota will contribute to better oil prices
than last year, eliminate the setback in oil prices and boost
revenues of the countries depending mainly on oil in their
exports, he told the Oman News Agency in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) and other major oil producers, including Oman, agreed in
Vienna last March to cut output by 2.1 million barrels per day to
raise oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Strict compliance with the quota since April 1 has pushed oil
prices back to over 20 U.S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining of the reduction by OPEC countries will have a
positive return for producing and importing countries alike as
well as for the stablization of the oil market," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"Non-compliance with the Vienna agreement will bring a fall in
the prices to the old level of 10 dollars for a barrel and that
will be unsatisfactory for all," he warned.
</P>
<P>
OPEC states have decided to roll-over the cutbacks in
production until their next ministerial conference on March 22 in
Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The official anticipated the oil prices to continue to rise
during the last quarter of this year due to the reduction in the
world oil reserves and the arrival of winter season.
</P>
<P>
"Those are factors that will help boost prices in world oil
markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the forthcoming OPEC meeting in March 2000 will
be very important and that its outcome will determine the
situation of oil markets.

<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan stocks touched a fresh
1999 low Tuesday and brokers predicted that rising yields on
treasury bills would continue to erode investors' interest in
equities.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-share index dropped 7.22 points
or 0.31 percent to close at 2,339.11.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market is likely to fall further as interest
rates on treasury bills have gone up steadily in recent months,
pulling investors to the money market.
</P>
<P>
The yield on 91-day treasury bills stood at 17.79 percent last
Thursday from below 10 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
Turnover slowed to 5.8 million shillings (about 77,333 U.S.
dollars) compared with the market's average daily turnover of 14
million shillings (about 186,000 dollars). Only 145,000 shares
traded Tuesday compared to 436, 000 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors were absent from the market.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Currency Stable Against U.S. Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan currency shilling
Tuesday remained stable against the U.S. dollar as inter-bank
activity was almost to a standstill, local dealers said.
</P>
<P>
They said that as the dollar supply was very small there was
virtually no demand for dollars from offshore and local accounts.
</P>
<P>
Three leading commercial banks in capital Nairobi listed the
shilling at 75.28/33 to the dollar while two others posted the
shilling at 75.25/35. Traders noted they were narrowing margins
to attract trading.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan central bank posted the shilling at an opening mean
commercial rate of 75.28 to the dollar from 75.39 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi Foreign Exchange has been relatively quiet in the
past two weeks as dealers are awaiting an International Monetary
Fund (IFM) decision on whether it will resume talks with the
Kenyan government on loans.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo held talks
with IMF officials in Washington for the resumption of the loans
suspended in 1997, but he returned without any results.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the IMF is supposed to communicate its decision
to Kenya next month and follow up with a visit to the east African
country in December this year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The heads of the six
principal organs of the United Nations on Tuesday called on U.N.
member states to honor financial obligations to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Their appeal was made in a brief statement following their
second annual meeting at U.N. Headquarters in New York while
reviewing the developments in the organs.
</P>
<P>
The heads particularly called on those states which have failed
to meet their financial obligations under the U.N. Charter "to
sustain and support the Organization at this crucial time in world
affairs".
</P>
<P>
The biggest debtor to the U.N. is the United States which owes
1.7 billion U.S. dollars in dues, more than half the U.N. budget.
</P>
<P>
The High-ranking U.N. officials including Secretary-General
Kofi Annan also discussed on-going preparations for the Millennium
Summit scheduled to be convened next September in which world
leaders will design the priority agenda for the next century.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for More Efforts to Fight Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Degradation of drylands
or desertification affects 70 percent of the world's 5.2 billion
hectares of agricultural drylands in 110 countries, or some 30
percent of global land area, the U.N. said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The well-being of 250 million people have already suffered and
an additional one billion people are at risk, according to figures
released by the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP).
</P>
<P>
Africa and Asia are seriously affected, but also parts of North
America and Europe. Desertification costs the world 42 billion
U.S. dollars a year, 9 billion dollars in Africa alone.
</P>
<P>
Degradation results in migration and political instability
while desertification played some part in sparking off at least
ten recent armed conflicts in arid lands, such as Somalia,
according to U.N. statistics.
</P>
<P>
Degradation of arid and semi-arid lands is caused primarily by
overcultivation, overgrazing, bad irrigation practices and
deforestation, as well as by drought and climate variability.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Mobilization to fight desertification came before the 159
member countries of the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD) meet in Recife, Brazil from November 15-26 to promote
efforts in this direction.

LISBON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
arrived here Tuesday morning for a state visit to Portugal at the
invitation of Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio.
</P>
<P>
This is Jiang's first state visit to the country. In 1993,
Jiang stopped over and visited the country on his way back from a
foreign visit.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jiang's arrival, Sampaio held a full-scale
welcoming ceremony for the Chinese president, which included a
review of the guards of honor and a 21-gun solute.
</P>
<P>
Later, Jiang was also welcomed by the mayor of Lisbon, who gave
him a golden key, symbolic of the city's warm feelings towards the
Chinese leader.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio and his wife Maria Rita greeted Jiang and his wife Wang
Yeping at the airport as well as Chinese Ambassador to Portugal
Wang Qiliang and staffs from the Chinese embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his written statement delivered at the airport
that China has attached great importance to its relationship with
Portugal, which has enjoyed smooth development in recent years in
the political, economic, cultural and technological sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the
two countries have kept deepening, Jiang said. "The two
governments have also maintained good cooperation on the issue of
Macao's return to China."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president noted that China and Portugal have common
interest in promoting the sacred cause of peace and development of
the world. China is willing to, together with the Portuguese
government and people, make continued efforts to further
consolidate the long-term and stable bilateral relationship of
friendly cooperation oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he is looking forward to exchanging views with
Portuguese leaders on developing bilateral relationship and issues
of common concern and having wide contacts with people from all
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president believes that his current visit will
further deepen mutual understanding, promote friendship, expand
range of common understanding and boost cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's entourage arriving on the same special plane include
Vice Premier Qian Qichen and his wife, Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan, Minister in charge of the State Development Planning
Commission Zeng Peiyan, Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng, Director of the Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office of the State Council Liao Hui, Special Assistant
Hua Jianmin, Deputy Director of the General Office of the CPC
Central Committee You Xigui and Deputy Director of the Policy
Research Office of the CPC Central Committee Wang Huning.
</P>
<P>
This is the third leg of Jiang's six-nation trip in Europe,
Africa and Asia. He has already paid state visits to Britain and
France.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) on Tuesday foiled an attempt to
hijack a passenger plane of the Iran Air, the IRGC said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Iran's outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq Organization
(MKO) tried to hijack the passenger plane en route from the
capital Tehran to Orumiyeh, the northwestern province of West
Azerbaijan, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed culprit attempted to direct the plane to fly to
France but the attempt was foiled by the security guards aboard
the plane, the statement said, adding the plane with all its
passengers landed safely at Orumiyeh airport.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC dispatches security guards aboard Iranian passenger
planes.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq-based MKO participated in the fighting to topple the
former Iranian shah regime before the 1979 Islamic revolution. But
it was outlawed in 1981 due to sharp political differences with
the ruling mullahs.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Media Urged to Promote Unity After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Tuesday warned media against anyone who dares to
challenge the foundation of unity laid by late president Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the warning in a special meeting with editors of
local media in the State House in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"It is your responsibility, as journalists, to expose all those
bad elements who put national interests aside in order to promote
their personal interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would not tolerate any individual or groups
whose minds are focused on derailing the country's foundations
including the Union between the Mainland and Zanzibar, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He urged the media to educate the people so as to enable them
to implement the ideals of Nyerere who brought up Tanzania as one
family regardless of tribe, religion or sex affiliations.
</P>
<P>
Since Nyerere died of leukemia at the age of 77 at a London
hospital on October 14, Tanzanian leaders both on the mainland and
the Zanzibar isles have vowed on several occasions to consolidate
the union initiated by the founding father in 1964.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa also commended the press and the electronic media in
Tanzania for their "super coverage" of Nyerere's hospitalization
and his funeral over the past month.
</P>
<P>
"Even the foreigners who came to Tanzania for Nyerere's funeral
were amazed by the massive and impressive preparations made by
Tanzanians to accord a befitting farewell to their fallen hero,"
Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
The body of Nyerere was buried in Butiama, a small village near
Lake Victoria, on October 23, following a grand state funeral
attended by hundreds of thousands of Tanzanians as well as some
400 foreign dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
Born in Butiama on April 13, 1922, Nyerere led the then
Tanganyika to win an independence from British colonial rule in
1961.

TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday denied Iraq's
claim that it was involved in the 1997 killing of former Iraqi
Minister of Endowments and Religious Affairs Abdullah Fadhil Abbas
al-Samaraa.
</P>
<P>
"The claim on Iran's involvement in the assassination of Iraqi

attribute their domestic problems to Iran in order to tackle their
international problems, he was quoted by the Islamic Republic News

</P>
<P>
Iraq's Security Directorate said in statement on Monday that
four men had been arrested in Iraq on charges of spying and
assassinating Abdullah on January 11, 1997. The Iraqi television

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Tuesday expressed the hope that the humanitarian
operation in Iraq would be run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Annan wrote a letter to the United Nations Security Council
Monday, complaining that the Security Council's sanctions
committee has been placing an increasing number of holds on Iraq's
import contracts.
</P>
<P>
Annan also attached to his letter a note from the head of the
U.N. Iraq Program, Benon Sevan, which said the number of holds
overall continues to increase despite some efforts by the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Annan said "In fact, the attachment to
the letter from Mr. Sevan makes it clear that these holds are
having an undesirable impact on our humanitarian activities."
</P>
<P>
"In some instances, goods which have been shipped as part of
the package have to sit and wait because part of it has either
been withheld or is not in, therefore they could not distribute
it," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
"I would want to see the UN run a smooth humanitarian operation
in Iraq with a capacity to deliver all that the Council has
approved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I want them to look at the policy of the holdings and then
review it periodically to make sure that they are not holding back
anything that would help the program," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has frequently accused the United States and Britain for
blocking the approval of those contracts.

CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign
Minister Mustafa Ismail on Tuesday called for promoting his
country's trade with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Sudan needs Egyptian products, especially those in the food and
textile sectors, Ismail said after meeting with Egyptian Prime
Minister Atef Obeid.
</P>
<P>
Sudan seeks to overcome obstacles to the cooperation in the
economic and trade areas and step up efforts to enhance trade, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A number of joint committees are negotiating agreements on the
prevention of dual taxation, and the encouragement and protection
of investment between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, called on Egypt to
bolster investments in the fields of agriculture, petrochemicals
and agricultural industrialization in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Obeid stressed the importance of
encouraging investments between the two Arab neighbors and
raising the trade volume, he added.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia. Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring Islamic militants
attempting to topple its secular government and install a strict
Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the goodwill showed by the two countries
and frequent exchanges of visit by senior officials have
substantially improved the bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Deregulate Telecom Industry: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government would
deregulate the telecommunications sector in order to improve its
performance, Minister of Communications Mohammed Arzika said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government would issue a license to a second carrier to
compete with the state-owned telecommunications monopoly as a part
of the new policy of deregulation, Arzika said when launching a
new policy on telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
But the minister did not give an exact date for the telecom
deregulation.
</P>
<P>
A third carrier would also be launched on the basis of
"economic viability," Arzika said, adding that the government
"wants to encourage new entrants into the market to encourage
competition and improve performance" of the country's
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Nigeria Telecommunications company NITEL enjoys
the monopoly of providing the conduit for telephone users, even
for private telephone providers recently introduced in the
country's commercial capital of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Nigerian government announced the slashing of the
fees for telephones from 50,000 naira (about 500 U.S. dollars) to
20,000 naira to enable Nigerians to use the 300,000 idle telephone
lines that could not be taken up because of the prohibitive fees
charged by NITEL.
</P>
<P>
Under the new policy, a national institute of
telecommunications is to be established to provide the manpower
needs of the sector, in addition to a research and development
center to conduct research on telematic and telecommunications
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Lack of Funds Imperils U.N. Population Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- A four-year fall in
contributions to the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) is imperiling
developing countries' family planning, maternal death reduction
and HIV/AIDS prevention programs, the UNFPA said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
As the U.N. General Assembly marks the 30th anniversary of its
founding on Wednesday, UNFPA available resources can cover only
two thirds of its commitments in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The lack of 72 million U.S. dollars in the 1999 income may lead
to an additional 1.4 million unwanted pregnancies and 1.24 million
induced abortions and unwanted births, UNFPA figures show.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA expects its income to be 248 million dollars this year,
against the all-time high of 312.6 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The figure for this year is 29 million less than in 1998 and 42
million less than in 1997. The elimination of United States's
funding for UNFPA is among the factors causing this year's
shortfall. In 1998, U.S. contributed 20 million dollars to UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
Funded by voluntary contributions from donor governments, UNFPA
was established in 1969 to support population programs in
developing countries. It has seen its funds decline since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Fund helps developing countries improve reproductive health
and family planning services on the basis of individual choice,
and formulate population policies in support of efforts towards
sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Holding Iraq's Import Items Deters UN Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) --The number of Iraq's
import items on hold has increased in recent months which deterred
the implementation of the United Nations humanitarian operation in
Iraq, a U.N. official said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq
Hans Von Sponech said if water equipment does not arrive on time,
Iraqi people are not having access to better water, and this is
only facet of the things.
</P>
<P>
Complementary items on hold is a big headache, and it means
that some of the items could be utilized in humanitarian
circumstances but they could not be because they are waiting for
items that are not released from hold, Sponech said.
</P>
<P>
It is a complex picture that has been worsened in recent months
and it has also the reason why U.N. Secretary-General Kofi has
written a strong letter of concern about the circumstances to the
security Council.
</P>
<P>
Sponech said he and his co-workers would convey to the Security
Council and U.N. officials of Iraq program the impact of these
holds.
</P>
<P>
The very reason of the hold of contracts is the inadequate
technology information, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sponech visits the headquarters of the United Nations every
three months. He will return to Iraq in November.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-general Kofi Annan on Monday complained to the
Security Council that its sanctions committee has been placing an
increasing number of holds on Iraq's import contracts.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World
Food Program (WFP) announced Tuesday that it is launching a 21.6
million U.S. dollar appeal to widen its ongoing emergency food
distribution to displaced people in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Under the six-month program, scheduled to begin November 1, WFP
will facilitate the return of East Timorese, who fled their homes
following the announcement of the results of the August 30
referendum in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
The referendum paved the way for the territory's independence
some two to three years away before a U.N. transitional
administration makes all-round preparations.
</P>
<P>
A U.N.-authorized multinational force dispatched on September
20 has started to restore peace and security in East Timor which
saw tens of thousands of locals flee to West Timor, Indonesia to
escape violence and anarchy.
</P>
<P>
The WFP intends to distribute food to 413,000 East Timorese,
half of the population of the territory and to start
"food-for-work" rehabilitation projects in the territory.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acclaims Chinese American WWII Veterans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has paid high tribute to some 20,000 Chinese Americans who served
in the fighting against fascism during World War II, describing
their "untold story" as "one of great patriotism and heroism".
</P>
<P>
"I am honored to recognize the contributions of Chinese
Americans during World War II," Clinton said in a statement
immediately released after he met with a group of Chinese American
veterans and family representatives in the Oval ~Office of the
White House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised Asian Americans' "loyalty to the country", in
an apparent effort to quench the mounting outcry from the Chinese
American community here in protest against racism and injustice
shown in the so-called Wen Ho Lee espionage case, in which the
former Chinese American scientist in Los Alamos National
Laboratory was charged with stealing nuclear secrets for China.
</P>
<P>
"It is intolerable that the patriotism of Asian Americans
continues to be questioned, in the light of the recent allegations
of espionage at one of our national laboratories," Clinton said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Asian American scientists have made significant
contributions to national security, and have made the U.S. the
foremost leader in scientific achievements. "Yet instead of our
thanks, many have received nothing but suspicion and prejudice."
</P>
<P>
"Racism and stereotyping have no place in our nation of diverse
peoples who trace their ancestry to every corner of the globe. The
remarkable men and women who I met today are examples of why our
diversity is our greatest strength," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese American veterans and family representatives, along
with some government and military officials, attended a ceremony
at the Women's Memorial at Arlington Cemetery on Tuesday, October
26, 1999, which has been declared a National Day of Recognition
for Chinese American Veterans of WWII.
</P>
<P>
"This National Day of Recognition is an opportunity for America
to finally pay tribute to the 20,000 Chinese American veterans who
served their country during WWII," said George M. Ong, National
President of the Organization of Chinese Americans.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's event culminated with the premiere of a documentary
film featuring Chinese Americans' heroic service in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour documentary, entitled "We Served with Pride: The
Chinese American Experience in WWII", looked into life of 26
Chinese American veterans who participated in major battles
overseas, as well as Chinese American civilians who worked on the
homefront in service organizations and defense work.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over One Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces said on
Tuesday they seized some 1,127 kilograms of various kinds of
narcotic drugs during the past few days in the northeastern
province of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
Some 887 kilograms of opium and 40 kilograms of heroin were
seized from traffickers in a series of gun battles with the
traffickers while some 200 kilograms of opium were confiscated at
the eastern borders, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes, five members of a smuggling gang were
killed and 13 others arrested, the forces said, adding two rifles
and 215 rounds of ammunition were also seized from the
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Iranian anti-drug headquarters Hassan Fallah
said on Sunday over 146 tons of various kinds of narcotic drugs
were seized by the security forces throughout the country during
the first six months of the current Iranian year which started
March 21.
</P>
<P>
Iran started a large-scale anti-drug campaign in 1989 after the
Iranian Majlis passed a strict anti-drug law, which authorizes
capital punishment for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Iran has always complained that it has been fighting alone
against drug trafficking through its territory to Europe while the
production in its eastern neighbor Afghanistan is increasing year
by year.
</P>
<P>
Fallah said that over 8,000 billion rials (about 2.67 billion
U.S. dollars) is annually spent on fighting drug trafficking in
Iran.

KAMPALA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni Tuesday appealed to the political groups in the country
to work together without frustrating each other so that the basis
is laid for the development and modernization of the country.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal in a keynote speech at a two-day
conference organized by the World Bank in conjunction with the
Ugandan government in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The country is likely to be plunged into a crisis if one group
is bent on frustrating other groups, he warned, urging government
officials and legislators to work expeditiously and avoid delaying
investors from establishing their firms.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the country is experiencing some bottlenecks
in the economy because the national import bill is higher than the
export bill resulting in higher U.S. dollar rates against the
Ugandan shilling.
</P>
<P>
The numerous sectors of the government have been encouraged to
concentrate on the privatization program in order to trigger
further growth in the economy.
</P>
<P>
The conference is aimed at reviewing the outcomes of more than
a decade of the economic reforms in Uganda and drawing lessons for
the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio held talks here Tuesday
afternoon, exchanging views in an in-depth manner on the issue of
Macao, bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Believing that Jiang's visit will drastically push forward the
development of bilateral relations, Sampaio said that it is of
vital significance for Jiang to visit Portugal on the eve of the
Macao handover.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between the two countries to this end during
the transitional period of the Macao handover has strengthened the
bilateral relationship, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese president said that China is a big country and
is playing a more and more important role over international
affairs. Portugal will be the rotating chairman of the European
Union in the early half of next year and it will help deepen the
relationship between the EU and China.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said that strengthening the relationship between Europe
and China is an important factor of world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that his visit on the eve of the Macao handover
demonstrates the good will of the Chinese government and people
toward developing and strengthening Sino-Portuguese relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president elaborated China's stand and principle on
the issue of Macao. Since the joint communique between the two
countries on the issue of Macao was signed and through the efforts
and cooperation of both sides, Jiang said, a series of important
issues facing the transitional period of the Macao handover have
been solved, which has created necessary conditions for Macao's
smooth transition and handover, and for the implementation of the
policy of "one country, two systems," "governing Macao by Macao
people" and high level of self-administration.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the smooth handover of Macao complies with the basic
interest of both China and Portugal," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that after China resumed sovereignty over Macao,
the central government will abide strictly by the policy of "one
country, two systems" and the basic law of the Macao SAR, and it
will not interfere with the affairs within the range of
self-administration of the Macao SAR.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Macao will undoubtedly play the role of being a
bridge and link between China and Portugal and China and the EU in
developing the respective relationship in days to come," Jiang
stressed, adding that he himself will go to Macao and participate
in the ceremony of handover.
</P>
<P>
Sampaio said he was pleased to hear Jiang's comment on this
issue. History will prove that the Macao handover will surely be
smooth. The relationship between Portugal and China as well as
that between the EU and China will be surely strengthened, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Within two months, said Sampaio who will also go to Macao and
participate in the handover, Portugal and China will work together
to solve the remaining issues within the transitional period.

WASHINGTON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Tuesday praised Pakistan's leader Pervez
Musharraf for withdrawing troops from the border with India, and
urged both Pakistan and India to pull back in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
She told a news conference that the United States is aware that

Albright attributed the latest military clash in Kashmir to the

On Monday, four Pakistani soldiers were killed when a squad

Uri sector, according to an army statement from Srinagar, the
summer capital of Indian Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese FM to Meet Mubarak, Deliver Message </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail said here Tuesday that he will deliver a message to
President Hosni Mubarak from his Sudanese counterpart Omar
al-Bashir during a meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The message deals with Egypt's efforts to help realize national
reconciliation in Sudan, especially in light of threats to Sudan's
territorial integrity and security, Ismail said after meeting with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
He expressed belief that the Egyptian-Libyan peace initiative
on Sudan complemented the efforts exerted by the Eastern African
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, or IGAD.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese official, who arrived in Cairo on Saturday, called
for coordination of African-Arab efforts to ensure the stability
of Sudan, which he said would reflect positively on African
stability and Arab security.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Libya proposed in August a five-point peace plan
calling for permanent cease-fire in Sudan and a preparatory
meeting on a comprehensive peace conference for Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the Muslim opposition parties have
accepted the initiative. But the Sudan People's Liberation Army
(SPLA), the major rebel force in the south, rejected the plan,
saying that it favored the role played by IGAD in mediating a
solution to its war with the government.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim parties and the SPLA have formed an umbrella group,
the National Democratic Alliance. The political parties want to
share power with al-Bashir's Islamic government while the SPLA has
been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy for the mostly
Christian south.

Deiss and Dimitrov also found a solution to the thorny issue of
repatriating Kosovar refugees across Macedonian territory.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia said it would now allow overland refugee transports,
provided Skopje was notified a week in advance.
</P>
<P>
Kosovar refugees, willing to return to their home region to
rebuild their lives, have had to return by air so far. Deiss said
that the first bus convoy with returning refugees, who get
financial and material help from the Swiss government, would be
prepared immediately.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Kosovar refugees poured into Switzerland
at the height of the latest Balkan conflict, making Switzerland
one of the main havens in Europe, along with Germany.
</P>
<P>
But hundreds of refugees have already gone back voluntarily to
try to rebuild their lives in the war-torn Serbian province. The
Swiss government has said that the refugees must go back by May
2000, a decision that would, if implemented, affect about 65,000
people.

<HEADLINE> London Millennium Wheel Protest Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Environmental activists ended a
demonstration atop the world's biggest ferris wheel Tuesday when
the last two protesters came down.
</P>
<P>
The pair, who scaled the London Eye on the bank of the Thames
river, were arrested as soon as they touched the ground. They had
spent more than 24 hours clinging to the structure in central
London to protest against major dam projects across the world.
</P>
<P>
Police said they expected the nine mainly Basque activists to
be released soon, and British Airways, which partly owns the
so-called Millennium Wheel venture, said it would not press
charges.
</P>
<P>
The organizers of the protest by the Basque lobby group
Solidarios con Itoiz and India's anti-dam body Narmada denounced
the arrests, saying they would now take their protest -- aimed
principally at Spain's Itoiz and India's Narmada dams -- to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The 20 million pound (33.23 million U.S. dollar) Millennium
Wheel is one of several new attractions being built for the
British capital's New Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The 135-meter-high wheel towers above London and gives a
panoramic 40-kilometer view of the city's skyline.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 26 (Xinhua) -- No serious accident were
reported in the first week of Mozambican elections, the National
Police Command said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The police said in a release that there are only 33 recorded
breaches of the law.
</P>
<P>
It is noticed that minor provocations by the two contesting
political parties are the order of the day, despite appeals from
both the Frelimo and Renamo (National Resistance of Mozambique,
the biggest opposition party) leadership that their followers
should avoid provocative behavior.
</P>
<P>
In Frelimo's southern stronghold of Gaza, supporters of the
ruling party have given Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama a rough
ride. Dhlakama's rallies, in the provincial capital Xai-Xai on
Saturday, and in Chibuto on Monday, have gone ahead under strong
police protection.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Frelimo and Renamo supporters clashed in the town
of Manjacaze, where Renamo general secretary Joao Alexandre was
speaking, Renamo beat up the district police commander.

<HEADLINE> Britain Steps Up Call for N.Irish Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's newly-appointed
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson warned the province's
feuding parties Tuesday that they would not be forgiven if they
blocked the road to a lasting peace by wrecking the Good Friday
accord.
</P>
<P>
"The public expect their politicians to deliver what they voted
for -- a real chance for local people to take charge of local
affairs," Reuters quoted Mandelson as saying in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Northern Ireland will not understand if it is
allowed to slip away. They will never forgive those who put
unnecessary and unjustifiable barriers in the path of a permanent
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on the eve of what is seen as a final effort to
revive the stalled Good Friday agreement by U.S. mediator George
Mitchell in fresh talks with pro-British unionist and Irish
republican parties.
</P>
<P>
The parties have failed to bridge a wide gulf about guerrilla
disarmament and new political structures in seven weeks of
negotiations chaired by Mitchell, who led the talks which produced
the accord on April 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Mitchell said "significant differences" remained
between the groups but he promised to resume talks Wednesday in
Belfast and signaled he might have a formula to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson, brought into the cabinet as Northern Ireland
secretary just two weeks ago, was emphatic the parties must
translate the accord into political reality so as to build
prosperity and stability after years of strife.
</P>
<P>
If people wanted to see new jobs in the region, and more money
spent on education and health, there had to be unbreakable peace,
Mandelson said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Get Rid of Injustices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The next ministerial meeting of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be held in Seattle next
month should focus on removing injustices in the organization, a
trade relations expert said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
International South Group Network director Yash Tandon made
these remarks when addressing delegates of a two-day ministerial
meeting in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"It would be grossly unfair to push developing countries to yet
another round of trade negotiations with an agenda of new issues
such as the environment, competition policy, government
procurement, industrial tariffs and labor standards when the old
issues are becoming a festering sore," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said such an attempt would put an unsustainable pressure on
the developing countries, worsen their already bad situation and
induce loss of faith in the system.
</P>
<P>
The WTO, he said, would face a serious credibility problem and
its role in helping integrate the developing countries into the
global economy would be seriously impaired.
</P>
<P>
"A round with new issues would be unfair to the poor countries
and a danger to the credibility of the WTO because the developing
countries are already heavily burdened under the Uruguay Round
Agreements, many of which they cannot fulfil," he said.
</P>
<P>
For several decades, the industrialized countries have excluded
 agriculture and textiles from the General Agreement on Trade and
Tariffs (GATT) system to protect their own producers, Tandon said.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, was one of the major reasons behind the lack of
 sufficient growth in many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The official said the West is trying to impose its own
standards and regulations regarding product quality, sanitation,
origin, labor and organic products on the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"These do not take into account the differential levels of
development between countries of the South and those of the North.
 These non-tariff barriers are now a more formidable barrier of
trade than tariff barriers, and they effectively block further
industrialization and diversification of the economies of the
South," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams U.S., Britain for Refusing to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Ministry on Tuesday
slammed the United States and Britain for their refusal to
increase funds to rehabilitate the country's dilapidated oil
sector.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the U.S administration
and the British government are denying the Iraqi oil sector the
opportunity of obtaining materials and spare parts needed to
perpetuate and develop its protective systems.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. and British delegates launched a
campaign in the United Nations Security Council to block
U.N. Chief Kofi Annan's request to increase Iraq's oil sales by
300 million dollars to finance repairs of its petroleum industry
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi statement said the U.S. and British representatives
in the U.N. Sanctions Committee had, up to October 17, put on hold
33 percent of the contracts Iraq signed in the fifth phase of the
oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal now in its sixth phase which
expires next month, Iraq is allowed limited oil sales in every
six months to buy food, medicine and other daily necessities for
its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at the
Sanctions Committee of deliberately impeding the endorsement of
its contracts signed under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has also argued that the humanitarian program has
failed to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people, and that
the total lifting of the sanctions off Iraq is the only solution
to Iraq's humanitarian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since 1990
following its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Iran Lauds France's Share in Buy-Back Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the
ground-breaking visit of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to
Paris, a senior Iranian official Tuesday lauded France's
"significant share" in the country's buy-back projects.
</P>
<P>
"Since the initial buy-back offerings to expand Iran's oil and
gas fields, some 6 billion U.S. dollars worth of contracts have
been signed with international companies, with the French firms
taking the lion's share," Deputy Oil Minister for International
Affairs Mehdi Hosseini said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami will start an official visit to France on Wednesday,
the first by an Iranian head of state since the 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran signed its first buy-back agreement after the Islamic
revolution with the French company Total in 1996, Hosseini said in
an interview with the Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The 1-billion-dollar venture to expand Iran's off-shore Sirri
oil fields A and E in the Gulf was signed four months after the
United States imposed embargo on Iran, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the average oil production in the Sirri fields is
over 80,000 barrels per day (bpd) and it is scheduled to reach
120,000 bpd by the end of the current Iranian calendar year ending
March 20, 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said French companies and banks have had an active presence
in Iran's petrochemical sector by signing 503 million dollars
worth of contracts with the Iranian National Petrochemical
Industry Company.
</P>
<P>
The opportunities for French companies and banks in the
downstream projects, especially in petrochemicals, will also be
significant since the sector's plans call for up to 20 billion
dollars of investments in the next 15-20 years, he added.

<HEADLINE> Intel, Microsoft To Join Dow Industrials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp.
and other two companies will be added to the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, the New York Stock Exchange announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The other two companies are the retailer Home Depot and the
telephone company SBC Communications. The change will take effect
next Monday
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 companies make up the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and the four companies will become its new components,
replacing Sears Roebuck, Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, Chevron and Union
Carbide.
</P>
<P>
Intel and Microsoft are the two most influential companies in
personal computers and the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen for
Wall Street's best-known market measures. The two companies will
join International Business Machines (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard in
the Dow Average, giving the blue-chip index four major technology
components.
</P>
<P>
SBC Communications is the biggest local phone company in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of Intel, Microsoft and SBC into the Dow Average
reflected the technology and information revolution that has been
reshaping the U.S. economy over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The removing of Sears and other three companies from the Dow
are reflective of a past era when heavy industry dominated the
economy for most of this century.
</P>
<P>
The 30 stocks now in the Dow Average are all major factors in
their industries, and their stocks are widely held by individuals
and institutional investors. These 30 stocks represent about a
fifth of the 8 trillion-plus U.S. dollars market value of all U.S.
stocks and about a fourth of the value of stocks listed on the New
York Stock Exchange.

Minister John Anderson said on Tuesday that his government will
continue to enhance it's relations with China.
During his meeting with Jia Qinglin, a CPC politburo member and
the secretary of the CPC's Beijing Municipal Committee, Anderson
said that the frequent visits in recent years by leaders of the
two countries have led to the strong growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who is also the leader of the Australian National
Party, said that the two countries share interests in many fields
in the Asia-Pacific region and the two economies are highly
complementary.
</P>

<HEADLINE> More Angolan Refugees Flock into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The number of Angolan refugees
entering Zambia over the past few weeks has increased
significantly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) confirmed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Since October 8, a total of 650 new arrivals have been
registered in the North Western Province while another 200
refugees accommodated into Kalabo in the Western Province,
spokesman for UNHCR Dominik Bartsch said.
</P>
<P>
The sudden increase in Angolan refugees is attributed to
renewed warfare between the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and the Angolan army in Moxico
Province, bordering Zambia's Western and North Western Provinces.
</P>
<P>
Several groups of refugees may still be on their way towards
Zambia, mostly through bush paths, Bartsch said, adding that UNHCR
is bracing itself for a larger influx should the bombing raids in
the border area continue.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has been hosting refugees from Angola for several
decades, with some 32,000 Angolans currently accommodated in the
provinces mentioned above while another 120,000 settled in the
border areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The five member states of the
CIS Customs Union -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan -- signed the Moscow Declaration here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The five presidents signed the declaration after their meeting
on a session of the union.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, the main objective of integration on
the present stage is to complete the creation of the Customs
Union, which is an indispensable condition for the upsurge in the
development of the national economies, the improvement of living
standards and the promotion of steady democratic development.
</P>
<P>
Positive economic results have been achieved within the
framework of the union. The formation of common legal space has
been started, and the directions of the harmonization of national
legislation have been outlined, said the declaration.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the meeting expressed their resolve to ensure
the fulfillment of the priority tasks within the framework of the
development of integration processes for the near future. These
include the effective functioning of the common market of goods,
services, capital and manpower, the creation of conditions for the
stable restructuring of the national economies, as well as the
implementation of coordinated tax, monetary, crediting, financial,
trade, customs and tariff policy.
</P>
<P>
By the declaration, the union's work for resolving the key
economic problems "confirms the effectiveness of the integration,
whose pace differs from one country to another, within the
framework of regional associations and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) in general.
</P>
<P>
"We oppose any manifestations of international terrorism, of
political and religious extremism, which jeopardize the security
of the society and people in our countries. Our union is open for
any CIS country, which shares its principles and is ready to
assume in full volume the commitments drawn from the adopted
documents," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan established the
Customs Union of the CIS on October 22, 1997 in order to boost
trading among them. Tajikistan joined the union on November 24,
1998.

<HEADLINE> World Factoring Volumes Double in Six Years: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Global factoring volumes
have exceeded 500 billion U.S. dollars for the first time,
doubling the amount of the past previous six years, according to
international factoring authority Andrew Henning on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents a growth of 17 percent over the previous year,
said Henning, who was addressing the Association of South African
Factors and Discounters (ASAFD) in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Henning said that last year's growth in factoring volumes was
all the more surprising in view of the financial and economic
turbulence experienced in some parts of world.
</P>
<P>
"This level of growth was quite remarkable given the economic
difficulties being experienced in Asia, a region that has
traditionally been an important area of growth for the factoring
industry," Henning said.
</P>
<P>
He added that factoring was becoming a preferred method of
financing growth in an increasingly sophisticated business market.
</P>
<P>
"Factoring has been showing consistently high levels of growth
world wide now for many years, with total volumes almost doubling
over the last six years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures compiled by Factors Chain International (FCI),
the world' s largest network of factoring companies, Henning said
the America recorded the highest level of growth in 1998, up 23
percent on 1997 figures, as against 21 percent in Europe and 14
percent in Australasia.
</P>
<P>
"Despite its difficulties, Asia was able to maintain the levels
achieved in 1997," said Henning. "However, there was a reduction
in factoring volumes in some markets hit with recession."
</P>
<P>
Factoring provides businesses with finance against their
outstanding invoices for both domestic and export sales.
Businesses can rise up to 80 percent of the value of their
invoices as soon as the goods are shipped, with the balance, less
charges, being furnished when customers pay.
</P>
<P>
Factoring companies can also provide a full invoice collection
service and 100 percent protection against bad debts.
</P>
<P>
There are now more than 50 countries with an established
factoring industry, a figure that is increasing every year.
Similarly, the number of factoring companies around the world
increased to 700 from 650 in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Irish Police Unearth More Arms in Search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Irish police said Tuesday they
had unearthed four bombs and a rifle magazine during a search for
dissident republican arms north of Dublin, capital of the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The finds followed a major haul Monday which included
bomb-making materials and a rocket launcher, said a Reuters report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"The search is part of an ongoing campaign against dissident
republican groups," the report quoted a police spokesman as saying
in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Irish media reports said the arms, found near Gormanston,
County Meath, 32 kilometers north of Dublin, belonged to the
so-called Real Irish Republic Army, the group responsible for the
1998 bombing of the Northern Irish town of Omagh which killed 29
people.
</P>
<P>
Several men were arrested last Wednesday in a raid on what
Irish police described as a "dissident republican training area"
near north Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The Real IRA has joined mainstream guerrilla groups such as the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) and its Protestant, pro-British foes
in observing a ceasefire as part of Northern Ireland's shaky peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But security sources believe the Real IRA has been gearing up
for renewed attacks on targets in Northern Ireland and mainland
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Pharmaceutical Industry Joins WHO Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese Ministry of Health
and Welfare and 12 Japanese pharmaceutical companies have joined
the World Health Organization's effort to find more effective
anti-malarial drugs by launching a new alliance among them
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese pharmaceutical industry has been very successful
in discovering new molecules of potential benefit in human
medicine. Important new products have been developed successfully
from these which are now used to treat a wide range of human
diseases and ailments," said Dr Carlos Morel, director of WHO's
Program on Tropical Disease Research.
</P>
<P>
However, Morel added, in most cases, such molecules have not
been tested for activity against malaria parasites.
</P>
<P>
The impact of malaria on world health is enormous. According to
WHO, malaria kills over 1 million people each year, mostly small
children in Africa.
</P>
<P>
With over 300 million clinical cases of malaria each year,
malaria causes an impact on morbidity (quality of life) greater
than all the other tropical parasitic diseases put together. As a
consequence, it has a major effect on economic productivity and
livelihood in malaria endemic areas of the world.
</P>
<P>
WHO complains that the development of anti-malaria drugs has
not kept pace with the size of the problem.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to address the problem, WHO Director-General Dr
Gro Harlem Brundtland launched the Roll Back Malaria initiative
last year with one of its primary objectives as to foster more
research and development of antimalarials.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Developing Countries Ought to Have Say in </HEADLINE>

<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, October 26 (Xinhua) -- The global
economy is not sustainable without developing countries, said an
Egyptian official here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is becoming more apparent that what has happened in the
Uruguay Round, imbalances and things of that nature, cannot be
repeated and should not be repeated," Egypt's Minister of Economy
and Foreign Trade Youssef Boutros Ghali said at a press conference
held at the end of a two-day informal ministerial meeting of 25
members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on behalf of the developing countries,
Ghali said that the developing countries should play a greater
role in the new round and that the two thirds of the world
population should not be left on the margins of the world
development.

"I have a much more positive feeling that during the new round
the developing world is going to play a substantially more active
role in shaping the system that we would see in the 21st century,"

LONDON, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Former England and Arsenal
striker Ian Wright may join Celtic after his current club West Ham
gave a green light for the Scottish side to take over his contract.
</P>
<P>
Wright has been on loan to Nottingham Forest, but his term ends
on Wednesday and Celtic have offered to take over the contract
following the broken leg suffered by their Swedish front runner
Henrik Larsson.
</P>
<P>
Wright, who will be 36 next month, has said he intends to
retire at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
West Ham manager Harry Redknapp said: "I know he wants to play
regular first team football and with Larsson breaking his leg, I
think Ian would fancy it at Celtic.
</P>
<P>
"If he wants to go I won't stand in his way. From our point of
view, if he is not playing here the deal makes sense."

<HEADLINE> Trial of Famous Iranian Reformist Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative Special
Cleric Court Tuesday announced the trial of reformist cleric
Abdullah Nouri, a close ally to the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami, has been postponed from Wednesday to next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The court said in a statement that the decision was made upon a
request by some members of the press jury, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The local daily Tehran Times reported Wednesday that seven jury
members demanded the postponement because Khatami will start a
ground-breaking visit to France on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The court prepared a 44-page charge against Nouri, accusing him
of attempting to pave the way for the recognition of Israel,
distorting Islamic teachings, disturbing public opinion and
publicity for Ayatollah Husseini Ali Montazeri, former designate
successor of late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled trial of Nouri, former interior minister
impeached by the conservative Majlis (parliament) in June last
year, triggered a new wave of tensions between the hard-line
conservatives and the moderate supporters of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Moderates claimed that the trial of Nouri, who is also managing
director of the popular moderate daily Khordad, is part of the
efforts of the powerful conservatives, who dominate the country's
most important organs, to win the next Majlis elections slated on
February 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Public opinion here goes that the trial or possible conviction
against Nouri will provide grounds for his disqualification from
the Majlis election.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, a top vote-winner in the first local council polling
last February, recently stepped down from his post as chairman of
Tehran City Council to run for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Nouri might be elected the Majlis
speaker if the reformist moderates win the parliamentary polling.
