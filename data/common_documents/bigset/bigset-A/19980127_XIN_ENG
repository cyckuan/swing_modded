<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Marks Jiang's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Wednesday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
stressing political negotiations constitute a key to promoting the
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech
titled "Continue to strive for the accomplishment of the great
cause of reunifying the motherland", in which he set forth an
eight-point proposal for the resolution of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Experience of the past three years has fully proved that
President Jiang's speech has both practically important and
historically profound significance," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that adherence to the "one China" principle is
the core of the eight-point proposal, as well as the foundation
for developing cross-Straits relations and realizing peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Any words or actions that oppose the 'one China' principle
are in fact attempts to split China," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that it is indispensable for China's
peaceful reunification and key to the further development of the
current cross-Straits relations to hold as soon as possible
political negotiations between the two sides across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful reunification is our basic principle. And there must
be a proper way to realize peaceful reunification, which we
believe is political negotiations across the Straits," the
editorial says, adding that the Communist Party of China has
always been seeking early negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the concept of realizing peaceful
reunification step by step has reflected the flexible and
pragmatic nature of the Chinese government's policies, and that it
is in the common interests of both sides of the Straits to first
end their hostility through political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It points out that whether the cross-Straits negotiations can
happen depends on how much sincerity the Taiwan authorities have
in improving the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities can make a serious
response to our suggestions and proposals, and take concrete steps
to discuss with us on the procedures of political negotiations,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the rapid development of world economy has posed
challenges and also offered opportunities to both sides across the
Taiwan Straits in terms of economy, and that the Taiwan
authorities should not allow political differences to stand in the
way of economic cooperation across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that the Chinese government fully respect Taiwan
compatriots' demand to develop political democracy, as well as their
wishes for the cross-Straits relations to maintain stability and
continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, once the motherland is reunified under the principle
of 'one country, two systems', the interests of the Taiwan
compatriots won't be harmed by any means, and no change will take
place in their current way of life," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Taiwan compatriots will surely have a better
understanding of the 'one country, two systems' principle from the
convincing facts in Hong Kong after its return to the motherland,"
it adds.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Arafat Meet on Tuesday, Says Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat will meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on Tuesday on the outcome of his recent visit to
Washington, said Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that he himself will have talks with
Arafat prior to the two leaders' meeting upon the latter's arrival
here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat will brief Mubarak on the outcome of his recent trip to
Washington and meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and the
Palestinian stand towards the development in the peace process in
the light of these talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said other Arab talks will be held after
Arafat's visit to Cairo, the second one in a week.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan made a surprise visit to Cairo Sunday
for talks with Mubarak on pushing forward the peace process, which
a senior Egyptian official said marked the commencement of a
series of Arab consultations.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks in the U.S., the Palestinian leader started
a Maghreb tour during which he visited Mauritania, Morocco,
Algeria and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
On the way, Arafat has been voicing his frustration with the
Washington talks which he described as a "failure" and urging
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fulfill his
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, during a stop in Algiers Sunday, called for holding an
emergency Arab summit to look into the latest developments in the
Arab world, with particular focus on the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
To drum up European support for the peace process, Arafat is
now in London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
whose country holds the six-month rotating chairmanship of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is being accompanied by PLO Executive Committee
Secretary Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath and Arafat's Information Adviser
Nabil Abu Rydainah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since last
March when Israel started to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The recent talks Clinton held in Washington with Arafat and
Netanyahu have failed to break the ice.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Openness, Transparency in Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union foreign
ministers today urged the Algerian government to show "greater
transparency" over the recent massacres that claimed thousands of
lives in the north African country.
</P>
<P>
"The EU demands greater transparency by the Algerian
government, especially with regard to the situation in which
terrorist groups continue to perpetrate cowardly and brutal
attacks on innocent civilians," an EU spokesman told the press.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers were holding a general affairs council
meeting which was scheduled to also deal with issues of EU
enlargement and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers called on Algeria to allow the United
Nations officials to visit the country to help end the wave of
violence.
</P>
<P>
An EU troika mission travelled to Algeria last week. The
mission at ministerial level was sent after Algeria refused to
receive an earlier proposal of an EU troika mission of mid-level
officials.
</P>
<P>
Robin Cook, foreign secretary of Britain that is serving the
rotating presidency of the 15-nation union, said that the troika
mission was sent in the hope of finding out if there was anything
the union could do to help.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether an Algerian foreign ministry official would
be invited to go to London for further discussions, the British
foreign secretary said that no date was set for it.
</P>
<P>
"Our willingness to help needs to have response from the
Algerian government," Cook told a press briefing in between the
sessions of the foreign ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
The EU troika mission was led by Derek Fatchett, minister of
state from the British Foreign Office. The Troika also includes
ministers from Luxembourg and Austria.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years, up to 70,000 people have been killed in
the Algerian civil war between government forces and Islamic
fundamentalists.

<HEADLINE> Investigators to Question Clinton's Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater investigators are
preparing to question aides and friends of President Bill Clinton
before a federal grand jury about allegations that Clinton had an
affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a White House aide said, "We're working this out
almost hour by hour."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to get the facts out more quickly and more
publicly than Bill Clinton," White House communications director
Ann Lewis said on NBC's "Today" show. "We have to do this in a way
that is appropriate."
</P>
<P>
Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr spent much of Sunday at his
office amid a report by ABC News that an eyewitness saw Clinton
and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky in an intimate
encounter in the spring of 1996, just before Lewinsky was
transferred to the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta
and former deputy chief of staff Evelyn Lieberman denied that
either had been notified by any White House aide or Secret Service
agent who might have witnessed "certain sexual activities between
the president and Monica Lewinsky."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's lawyer William Ginsburg pressed, meanwhile, for an
immunity deal for his client, pledging to "remain in Washington as
long as it takes to see that the truth in every detail, wherever
it may fall, comes out."
</P>
<P>
On shows on NBC, CBS and ABC Sunday, Ginsburg said he has
talked to investigators about what Lewinsky, 24, will tell them in
exchange for immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Clinton last week denied having any "improper sexual
relationship" with the young woman or that he asked her to lie to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky filed a sworn affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case denying an affair with Clinton -- an assertion
that is contradicted by secretly taped conversations now in the
hands of Whitewater prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
On ABC, Ginsburg said he had made "a couple of oral attorney
proffers" to Whitewater prosecutors. A proffer is an outline --
ordinarily in writing -- of what evidence a potential cooperating
witness in an investigation will provide investigators.
</P>
<P>
A source familiar with the matter reportedly said Lewinsky
is willing to tell prosecutors that she had sex with the
president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's longtime friend Vernon Jordan is among those facing
grand jury appearances as early as Tuesday in the investigation.
Lieberman is also expected to be subpoenaed as well.
</P>
<P>
White House political consultant Paul Begala criticized Starr
for "firing off subpoenas like an Uzi" submachine gun.
</P>
<P>
Clinton talked through the weekend with heavyweight advisers,
including former Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor.
</P>
<P>
Polls found many Americans deeply concerned about whether
Clinton had an affair with the then-21-year-old Lewinsky and
whether he encouraged her in recent months to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
Polls by the Los Angeles Times, USA Today, CBS News-New York
Times, ABC News, Newsweek and NBC News-Wall Street Journal found
that many Americans regard the allegations involving Clinton and
Lewinsky -- if proven -- as grounds for his departure from office.
</P>
<P>
The president and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton tried to
maintain an air of normalcy Sunday, attending religious services
as usual. Clinton rehearsed his Tuesday night State of the Union
speech before watching the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House of
Representatives, spoke cautiously about the possibility of an
impeachment inquiry should Clinton be found to have encouraged
Lewinsky to commit perjury. "Nothing much will happen until the
Democrats decide something should happen," he said.

<HEADLINE> Technology Key to Progress: Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A Zimbabwean educationist said
Monday there is need for developing countries to embrace modern
technology so as to produce goods at low costs and compete on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
''Industrialized countries are able to produce at low costs
because they use computers and modern technology in
manufacturing. It is imperative for developing countries to
embrace technology and produce at low cost so as to compete in
international markets,'' Vice-Chancellor of the National
University of Science and Technology (NUST) of Zimbabwe Phineas
Makhurane said.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a Commonwealth in-country training program
on information technology for manufacturing held in Bulawayo, the
country's second largest city by the NUST's Department of
Computer Science in collaboration with the U.S.-based University
of Warwick's manufacturing group.
</P>
<P>
He also said NUST graduates could influence the introduction
of technology-oriented entrepreneurships in the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
''Our aim is to produce a graduate who is not a stranger to
the non-formal sector. It's that sector that will eventually make
the difference as the country's industrial base may actually
begin to shrink because we pay too much lip service to attracting
foreign investment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President of the Confederation of Zimbabwe
Industries Jonee Blanchfield said there was need to close the gap
between the education and industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
She said that students from universities should be attached to
industry so that they will have an inside knowledge to what
happens there.
</P>
<P>
''Otherwise there is a crisis of expectations from both the
employer's and the graduate's point of view. If industry could
sponsor specific students, that would make it even more
sensible,'' she said.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Tohtab Aubakirov, the defense
and space industry adviser to the president of Kazakhstan, said
here Monday that the Baikonur Cosmodrome which is leased by Russia
has a great scientific potential and a bright future for further
development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press conference where he briefed
reporters on the plan to launch the "Union TM-27" spacecraft,
which will send Kazak astronaut T. Musabayev on January 29 to the
Russian Space Station "MIR" to do scientific research for 104 days.
</P>
<P>
Aubakirov said the Kazak astronaut will do research in the
fields of geography, agriculture, geomorphology, physics,
chemistry, space biology and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Shkolnik, president of the Ministry of Science, told
the press that rumors of the elimination of Baikonur Cosmodrome
were groundless. He said lots of international space projects will
take place in Baikonur Cosmodrome. Kazakhstan and Russia will
jointly work to make the space center succeed and to lift the
facility out from under the temporary problems of finance,
environment and tariffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- South African captains of
industry and commerce are confident in the country's political
future and they predicted a growth rate of 2.6 percent this year,
according to a survey released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, according to the survey of executives of the top
100 industrial companies on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, is
nearly one percentage point more than the 1.7 percent growth
estimated for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Market Research Bureau of the
University of South Africa, also foresee an inflation rate of 8.1
percent, which is about the same level as last year.
</P>
<P>
The prime overdraft rate is expected to decrease to 18 percent
by December 1998 and there would be an improvement in South
Africa's balance of payments account and in net gold and other
foreign reserves, South African Press Association quoted the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the country was also expected to go up
this year in response to the business and socio-political
optimism, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the report warned of a potential damage to the
economy due to the combined impact of the El Nino phenomenon, the
international banking crisis and the depreciation of South
African currency Rand, to the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange rate could rise to an average 5.03 Rand
against the Dollar, up from the current level of about 4.9.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for politicians and economists to put their
heads together and devise means of curbing the wild swings that
are fast becoming a feature of financial markets, and of
insulating the world economy from damaging consequences," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the positive pointers to a bullish economy, 92 percent
of the interviewed believed that the government was behind set
targets in its macro-economic strategy of Growth, Employment and
Redistribution (GEAR).
</P>
<P>
"More than three quarters of the executives are of the view
that the basic conditions of employment bill will have a
detrimental effect on employment," the report said.

The prices of basic goods were increased by an average 20
percent at the beginning of this year, with the private sector
attributing the increases to the devaluation of the Zimbabwean
Dollar and high interest and inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
The soaring prices triggered the three-day food riots which
started Monday in Harare and the dormitory town of Chitungwiza
before spreading to other cities like Chegutu and Mutare.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the police Sunday said people should
ignore the message and go to work as usual.
</P>
<P>
There was a normal flow of traffic going in and out of the
city center, dispelling fears that commuter operators might be
forced by sources of the rumors to stay away to get off the
roads.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavily armed Zimbabwe national army soldiers
maintained their heavy presence at most points leading into the
city center in a bid to flush out any suspected looters from
gaining entrance into the city.
</P>
<P>
The police, together with the soldiers, had so far recovered
millions worth of goods looted during the riots in the high
density areas.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Soldiers Urged to Give Up to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An officer of the West African
Peace-keeping Force (ECOMOG) Monday called on soldiers of Sierra
Leone's military junta to surrender, just three months for the
planned hand-over of the military regime.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred soldiers have done so and the surrenders have
been influential among the junta forces, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, 300 Sierra Leonean army personnel,
150 police officers, including some from the special security
division and over 400 former rebel fighters have voluntarily
surrendered to ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Some of them went to the sub-regional force with arms, the
report quoted an ECOMOG Colonel as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among those who surrendered are two of the top leaders of the
former rebel group Revolutionary United Front, which had fought
successive governments of the country since early 1990s until it
allied to the junta immediately after the coup last May.
</P>
<P>
However, the names of the surrendered army-menr and police
officers, as well as some eminent civilians, were not disclosed
for security reasons and the safety of their relatives in town,
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The Colonel called on the junta army to lay down their
weapons, saying that "their future is very bright."
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord on the crisis in Sierra Leone, combatants
in the country should be disarmed in December last year and the
junta hand over power to the ousted civilian government led by
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in April this year.
</P>
<P>
But junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma later dismissed the
deadline as unrealistic due to ECOMOG's inability to start the
disarmament exercise and the delay of international relief goods.
</P>
<P>
Despite the change in the junta's stance, both the United
States and west African countries have insisted that the Koroma
regime follow the peace accord strictly.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. fact-finding team paid a three-day visit to Freetown
two weeks ago to pave way for the deployment of U.N. military
observers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Member nations of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) are consulting to search for modalities to
resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG officer said the multi-national force will follow
whatever decision taken by the U.N. and ECOWAS to restore
constitutional order in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Govt Outlaws LTTE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
outlawed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the official
TV station Rupavahini said in a special statement Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the Sri Lankan government decided to ban the
LTTE with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
But the TV statement did not elaborate. Government officials
were not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
The decision came one day after a powerful truck bomb exploded
in Kandy, the ancient Sri Lankan capital 115 km east of Colombo,
killing 12 people and damaging the holiest place of worship of Sri
Lankan Buddhists, the Tooth Relic Temple, Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Three LTTE suicide attackers were also among the dead.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting government troops in a bid to create
a separate state of their own in the north and east of the island
nation.
</P>
<P>
The decision is seen as a crucial step and it might suggest the
government is going to toughen its stance towards the LTTE,
political observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Although several countries, including India and the United
States, have already banned the LTTE before, the Sri Lankan
government had stopped short of taking the step until Monday,
leaving the door open for the LTTE to hold talks with it.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reinforces Chagas Disease, Leprosy Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Board of the World
Health Organization (WHO) today called for continuous
international efforts to eliminate Chagas disease by 2010 and
leprosy by 2000.
</P>
<P>
In two resolutions to be submitted for adoption by the World
Health Assembly in May, the WHO executive board outlined what it
felt should be the major thrusts of action against these two
public health threats.
</P>
<P>
Chagas disease exists only on the American continent and has
already affected 16 to 18 million people, while some 100 million,
or 25 percent of the population of Latin America, are at risk of
acquiring the disease, according to WHO statistics.
</P>
<P>
The disease is caused by a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi,
transmitted to humans by triatomine bugs and it extends from
Mexico to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
While expressing its satisfaction with the progress made by
member states in eliminating the transmission of Chagas disease,
the executive board called on WHO and its director-general to
support ongoing efforts to eliminate transmission by 2010.
</P>
<P>
As for leprosy, the World Health Assembly in May 1991 set a
target of prevalence at below one case per 10,000 population as a
gauge for the global elimination of leprosy as a public health
problem by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the global prevalence of leprosy has been reduced
by 76 percent due to program coverage and implementation of
multidrug therapy throughout the world, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
The number of endemic countries has been reduced from 122 in
1985 to 55 at the beginning of 1997, while the cumulative number
of individuals cured had reached 8.4 million by the beginning of
1997.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Marks Jiang's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tuesday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
stressing political negotiations constitute a key to promoting the
relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, President Jiang Zemin delivered a speech
titled "Continue to strive for the accomplishment of the great
cause of reunifying the motherland", in which he set forth an
eight-point proposal for the resolution of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
"Experience of the past three years has fully proved that
President Jiang's speech has both practically important and
historically profound significance," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that adherence to the "one China" principle is
the core of the eight-point proposal, as well as the foundation
for developing cross-Straits relations and realizing peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
"Any words or actions that oppose the 'one China' principle
are in fact attempts to split China," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stresses that it is indispensable for China's
peaceful reunification and key to the further development of the
current cross-Straits relations to hold as soon as possible
political negotiations between the two sides across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
"Peaceful reunification is our basic principle. And there must
be a proper way to realize peaceful reunification, which we
believe is political negotiations across the Straits," the
editorial says, adding that the Communist Party of China has
always been seeking early negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the concept of realizing peaceful
reunification step by step has reflected the flexible and
pragmatic nature of the Chinese government's policies, and that it
is in the common interests of both sides of the Straits to first
end their hostility through political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It points out that whether the cross-Straits negotiations can
happen depends on how much sincerity the Taiwan authorities have
in improving the cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities can make a serious
response to our suggestions and proposals, and take concrete steps
to discuss with us on the procedures of political negotiations,"
it says.
</P>
<P>
It says that the rapid development of world economy has posed
challenges and also offered opportunities to both sides across the
Taiwan Straits in terms of economy, and that the Taiwan
authorities should not allow political differences to stand in the
way of economic cooperation across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
It also notes that the Chinese government fully respect Taiwan
compatriots' demand to develop political democracy, as well as their
wishes for the cross-Straits relations to maintain stability and
continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, once the motherland is reunified under the principle
of 'one country, two systems', the interests of the Taiwan
compatriots won't be harmed by any means, and no change will take
place in their current way of life," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Taiwan compatriots will surely have a better
understanding of the 'one country, two systems' principle from the
convincing facts in Hong Kong after its return to the motherland,"
it adds.

LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international
rating agency assigned ratings today to Hongkong's SPC Credit Ltd
at a long-term rating of A+ and a short-term rating of F1.
</P>
<P>
The Individual rating is B/C, reflecting the bank's
satisfactory performance and risks profile, while the Legal rating
of 3 indicates the agnecy's expectation of shareholder support,
and important factor behind the security ratings.
</P>
<P>
This is Fitch IBCA's first rating of a restricted lilcense bank
since Hongkong's return to Chinese sovereignty in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
SPC Credit is a Restricted license Bank established in 1974. It
was initially owned by Security Pacific Corporation and became a
subsidiary of Bank of America after the merger between Security
Pacific and the bank.
</P>
<P>
SPC Credit's focus is on consumer finance and small business
lending in Hongkong, and expanding its consumer finance business
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
IBCA said, like other lenders in Hongkong, SPC Credit has been
affected by volatile Hongkong dollar interest rates and faces a
more challenging economic environment.
</P>
<P>
The bank is, however, currently in sound shape and has a good
record of profitability and asset quality, it added.

<HEADLINE> Museveni: People Enjoy Secured Life in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 26 (xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni said
here Monday that people at present enjoy a secured life as their
primary human rights in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at a rally marking the 12th anniversary of the
National Resistance Movement (NRM) government Monday afternoon in
Kampala, Museveni said the NRM government has done everything it
can to gain a better life for the Ugandan people.
</P>
<P>
This is the main difference between his government and the
previous regimes, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Ugandans have been killed before the
NRM assumed power, it is estimated.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan people now govern their country through national
elections, and these elections were very rare before the NRM
government took power, Museveni said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has witnessed three elections in the past 24 years.
After the Ugandan people elected their parliament and the
president in 1996, another local election is under way, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The president urged his people to carefully exercise their
right to elect their candidates.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, the South African President, also delivered a
short speech on the occasion, saying that Africa's renaissance
can reach its full when every African has his or her political
and economic freedom.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that there are still too many Africans who do not
enjoy real freedom, and are forced to live in poverty, illiteracy
and diseases.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here for a one-day visit, is the main
guest at the celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Discovers New Type of Solar Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An international team of
astronomers, led by Dr. Richard Harrison of the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory in Britain, has discovered a new type of solar
activity.
</P>
<P>
Short-lived flashes, which astronomers called blinkers, have
been found erupting sporadically over the surface of the Sun, the
Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) said today in a press notice.
</P>
<P>
The blinkers were detected by the Coronal Diagnostic
Spectrometer on board the European Space Agency's Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory(SOHO), according to the RAS.
</P>
<P>
These flashes are distributed over the entire Sun and are
visible for several minutes, each of them about the size of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
The blinkers appear to be rather insignificant since they emit
only one millionth the energy of a solar flare.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers said that the new discovery may help to resolve two
outstanding problems in solar physics.
</P>
<P>
The blinkers may represent sites of plasma heating or particle
acceleration, astronomers said, which they thought may explain how
the Sun ejects the solar wind and why there is a big difference in
temperature between the outer atmosphere and the surface of the
Sun.
</P>
<P>
The blinkers seem to be the visible representation of a
transient process which is basic to the way the solar atmosphere
works, astronomers said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Increase Rice Exports to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's rice exports,
mainly to Europe, are expected to reach 600 million U.S. dollars
in the current fiscal year, 100 million dollars more than the set
annual target, the Commerce Ministry predicts.
</P>
<P>
The demand for Pakistani rice has risen in the international
market, particularly in Europe, the ministry says.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, Pakistan's rice
exports during the first half of the 1997-98 fiscal year starting
July 1 rose by 7.45 percent to 210.11 million dollars as against
195.54 million dollars in the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
As the European Union (EU) has lifted the restriction on the
quantity of Pakistani rice to be exported to European countries
this year, the country's exports are expected to grow to around
25,000 to 30,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The EU had limited the export amount of Pakistani rice to 9,000
tons last year before lifting the unilateral restriction after the
Pakistani government lodged a strong protest last November.

<HEADLINE> Intel to Cut Chip Prices by About One Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The world largest chip maker Intel
Corporation has announced that it would cut its chip prices by
about one third on average worldwide with immediate effect, the
German news agency DPA reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Joachim Rissmann, a senior manager
of Intel's German subsidiary, in an interview with the DPA. The
price cuts were aimed to boost demand on the PC market, Rissmann
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Rissmann, Intel would also launch series
production of the 333 megahertz Pentium II processor soon on the
basis of the 0.25-micrometer technology instead of the current
0.35-micrometer technology.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests to Pool $8.5bn for SADC Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The 14-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is trying to pool 8.5 billion U.S.
Dollars for the 500 programs planned by the regional
organization.
</P>
<P>
Prega Ramsary, the SADC chief economist said here Monday that
more efforts should be made to collect money from SADC member
countries, so as to change the trend of relying mainly on foreign
sources.
</P>
<P>
Ramsary estimated that about 80 percent of the fund for SADC
programs under way are from international communities, a trend
that must be changed.
</P>
<P>
As for the 48 energy programs which costs about 924 million
U.S. Dollars, for instance, 627 million Dollars have been
secured, but 96 percent of the fund come from outside SADC, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The economist said that the 83 agricultural programs which
need about 518 million Dollars, are employing 83 percent of their
money from outside, he said.
</P>
<P>
SADC is made up by South Africa, Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namabia, Democratic Congo,
Seychelles, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Loyalist Party Leaves N.Irish Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- One of the pro-British
Protestant parties in the Northern Ireland peace talks, the Ulster
Democratic Party (UDP), announced on Monday it would quit from the
talks on the future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The party was in danger of being expelled from the process
because of its close links with a paramilitary group, the Ulster
Freedom Fighters (UFF), which last week admitted breaking its
ceasefire to murder a number of Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, party leader Gary McMichael told a
news conference that he was not willing to see his party
"humiliated" by being thrown out of the talks when they resumed
Monday in London.
</P>
<P>
But he said the party was still committed to the peace process
although it stayed away from the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We fully expect to be expelled from this process. We are not
walking away. We want back into the negotiations, with the same
power as all the other parties, as quickly as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of parties for talks disagreed on whether it
was up to them or to the government to decide whether the UDP
should be expelled for links with terrorist groups responsible for
the killings in the past few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Get Cellular Phone Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Botswana will have its
first cellular telephone links by May and a complete network by
the end of the year, the Botswana Telecommunications Authority
(BTA) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two 15-year operation licenses, 1.29 million Rand (262,000
U.S. Dollars) each, would be issued to two joint partnerships to
build the network, South African Press Association quoted BTA
spokesman Claes Rosvall as saying.
</P>
<P>
One partnership involves Portuguese Telecom, a Zimbabwean
company and a Botswana company and the other involves French
Telecom and five Botswana companies.
</P>
<P>
Both operators are required to establish a network covering
the country's rail and road network from Lobatse in the south to
Francistown in the North, Rosvall said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, one operator should also cover the trans-Kalahari
highway, and the other the northern tourist areas of Maun and
Kasane, he said. The networks should be accessible to all users.
</P>
<P>
The deals also require that operators offer fax and data
services and charge cheaper call rates than South Africa.
</P>
<P>
French Telecom said his company could set up a network in
Gaborone, Botswana capital, within four months after obtaining a
license, and could cover most of the country within a year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defends Construction of Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government Monday
defended its construction of a military air base in Cyprus after
Turkey lodged protest against it.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily
press briefing Monday that the military air base near the western
coastal town of Paphos belongs to the Republic of Cyprus and the
stationing of Greek military aircraft there would depend on
developments.
</P>
<P>
"The base, to be inaugurated in March in the presence of the
Greek defense minister, will be named after the late Greek
Premier Andreas Papandreou, to honor him as the man who helped
consolidate our defense pact with Greece," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "it is our duty to boost our defenses and
the pact with Greece is our reply to the unprecedented upgrading
of the Turkish military."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had completed the construction of the air base which
will be used by the Greek air force planes following the Cypriot
presidential elections scheduled for February 8.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Greek fighters would be stationed at the newly-built
air base, the spokesman said "if the prevailing situation
necessitates their permanent presence here, then they will be here
permanently."
</P>
<P>
The decision to have Greek aircraft at the base lies with the
governments of Cyprus and Greece and any needs that may arise, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece agreed upon a joint defense pact in November
1993, under which Greece provides Cyprus with military assistance
in case Cyprus is attacked.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said that it would protest the delivery of the air base
to the U.N. Secretary-General and the Security Council, while
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash warned he would "break the
wings" of Greek aircraft that may be deployed at the base.
</P>
<P>
"The base does not belong to Greece, it belongs to the
Republic of Cyprus to serve its defense purposes and facilitate
those powers which, in accordance with the 1960 treaties, have an
obligation to protect the integrity and the independence of the
Republic from outside attacks," Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Guarantee, signed in 1960 when the island gained
independence from the British colonial rule, stipulates that
Greece, Britain and Turkey are the three guarantor powers of
Cyprus' independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been maintaining a 35,000-strong troops in Cyprus'
northern areas, where the Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a
breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was
recognized only by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Just as last week's food riots
was settling, University of Zimbabwe (UZ) students announced
Monday that they will take to the streets Tuesday to protest
against the recent steep rises in the prices of most basic goods.
</P>
<P>
The students said in a statement distributed at campus, bus
termini and supermarkets that there was no reason for people to
go back to work when the prices of mealie meal, cooking oil,
bread and other basic commodities had actually not been reduced.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena said, "we
believe this document, with many others distributed during the
disturbances of January 19 and 20, are coming from the same
source. They should be ignored in their entirety."
</P>
<P>
"May we remind members of the public that it is an offense to
print or distribute any pamphlet which is likely to create public
disorder," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged individuals and companies receiving fax messages
calling for people to stay away from work or incite violence to
send these faxes to their nearest police station.
</P>
<P>
"We, however, support the demonstration that the students at
campus intend to stage," he said, adding, "we will be behind them
if they feel that the nation is being short changed, but what we
do not want is the repeat of last week's looting."
</P>
<P>
The riots which started in Harare and Chitungwize last Monday
spread to other towns, leaving a trail of looting and destruction
of property worth millions of Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Addis to Host Forum to Attract Capital for Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international
meeting, ''the Addis forum'' will be held here on March 8-9, 1998
to attract capital for Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a press conference held here on Monday
afternoon by the organizing committee which was sponsored by a
group of organizations and international firms including
Corporate Council on Africa, Global Coalition for Africa,
Sheraton Addis, Gulf International Bank, International Pepsi-Cola
Bottler Investments Ltd, US-Saudi Arabian Business Council and
World Times.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the press conference, members of the organizing
committee said ''the Addis forum'' was created to attract global
capital to Africa and to promote and encourage business and other
productive activities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
To that effect, the organizing committee said, the forum will
help attract international and domestic attention to Africa's
economic potential and business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
According to the committee, the forum is the first in series
of conferences in Africa and it will provide a mechanism for
foreign business executives, African governmental entities and
African business people to hold a policy dialogue aimed at
addressing perceived impediments to attracting capital to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The committee said, the committee has sent invitations to 11
heads of states of African countries, including Uganda, Botswana,
Eritrea, Malawi, Mali, Morocco, Tanzania, Tunisia, Ghana Zimbabwe
and Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 world investment report published by the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development states that foreign direct
investment (FDI) rose by 10 percent in 1996 to a record of 349
billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, of the 349 billion Dollars in FDI, developing
countries received 129 billion Dollars, only 5.3 billion Dollars
flowed to Africa and Africa's share of FDI thus represent 1.5
percent of global FDI and 4.1 percent of developing world FDI.
This represents Africa's lowest share of FDI since the early
1980s.

<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
stayed in narrow trading ranges earlier on Monday until a firmer
opening on Wall Street, which is supported by U.S. President Bill
Clinton's new denial of the alleged sex scandal and news of a big
computer industry merger.
</P>
<P>
On the London market, dealers emerged from the trenches after a
better-than-expected start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares, which kicked off
the week with a cautious start, was boosted by news of the 9.6
billion U.S. dollars merger of computer giants Compaq and Digital.
</P>
<P>
The market closed 55.8 points higher at 5,237.2, lifted in late
trade by President Clinton's outright denial on television of the
sex claims made against him.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares' floor trading, which ends before
Wall Street opens, ended 12.53 points lower at 4,224.78 on the
DAX-30 index.
</P>
<P>
Investors were shying away from the market, due to the dollar's
fall against the Deutschmark, with most individual shares lower,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris closed at 3,000.47, up 34.32 points,
lifted by the twin effects of an improving dollar and solid gains
on Wall Street.

Traders said that market confidence returned as the dollar rose

<HEADLINE> Africa's Industrialization Lopsided, Says UNIDO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Industrialization in sub-Saharan
Africa has been lopsided with only six states contributing about
three quarters of manufacturing value added (MVA), according to
the U.N. Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
Only South Africa accounted for 58 percent of the MVA of
Africa south of the Sahara, while the other five, including
Cameroun, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe, accounted
for 16.5 percent, UNIDO said, quoted by the News Agency of
Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, four-fifths of sub-Saharan Africa's industrial
production is classified as low-technology, while the shares of
capital intensive, hi-tech sectors have declined," UNIDO said in
the latest edition of its newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The organization urged African government policy makers and
aid agencies to map out a new industrial strategy for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
It said despite very limited successes recorded in some
fields, structural adjustments had failed to reverse what it
termed de-industrialization or to create right policies for
industrial development through the private sector and new global
parterships.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Calls for US Support in Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Monday called for bigger involvement of American private
sectors in supporting Egypt's economic development drive.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement during a meeting with Egyptian
members of the Egyptian-American Presidents' Council which
convened here, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Council was formed under the initiative of Mubarak and
U.S. Vice President Al Gore for trade partnership in March
1994. It groups 15 top executives from each side.
</P>
<P>
"The Council, firstly, should continue its role in Egypt's
economic liberalization process and expanding privatization
measures," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with the Egyptian side of the Council, the
president said that Egypt's economic progress is "preconditioned
on effecting tangible changes" in the Egyptian economy and the
Egyptian-American relations in general.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released following the meeting,
Mubarak said the Council has played an important role in
establishing the bridges between the private sectors of both Egypt
and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"It is acting as a catalyst in building the bridges between the
two economies that will make transfer of technology, know-how,
managerial skills and investments possible -- indeed, necessary,"
said the communique.
</P>
<P>
According to an American member of the Council, the U.S. has
only two other bodies of this kind, one with Russia and and the
other with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Egypt-U.S. Presidents' Council, decided in June 1997 to
begin talks on the possibility of drawing up a free trade
agreement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Current U.S. investment in Egypt accounts for only 6 percent
of total foreign investments in the country.

<HEADLINE> Smile Train Project Launched in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua)-- A joint bold new initiative aimed
at providing reconstructive surgery to indigent children in developing
countries around the world was launched here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project named "The Smile Train" was announced by Charles B.
Wang, chairman of Computer Associates International, Dr. William
Magee Jr, co-founder and chairman of the U.S. Operation Smile, and
Brian Mullaney, Director of Operation Smile, at a press conference
at the Asian Society.
</P>
<P>
The Smile Train, loaded with surgical equipment, computers and
medical supplies, will carry teams of Operation Smile volunteers on
missions to small villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
The train is expected to start in China in early 1999, Mullaney
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Smile Train volunteers from China and around the world will work
side by side with local surgeons and nurses as they operate on
hundreds of children at each stop, he added.
</P>
<P>
The project has raised more than 18 million U.S. dollars including
the contributions of 10 million U.S. dollars from Wang and 1 million
from Microsoft's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
It has also garnered the support of government leaders from around
the globe, including Chinese President Jiang Zemin, former U.S.
President George Bush, and retired U.S. Army General Colin Powell,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The Smile train is scheduled to stay in China for five years. The
goals of the five-year prototype test include visiting 100 villages and
small towns, recruiting, training and supporting 100 partner hospitals,
training 10,000 medical professionals and leaving behind 15 million
U.S. dollars worth of medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Mullaney estimated that the total budget of the project in China
would be some 30 million U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
After its initial success, the Smile Train will go to other
developing countries including Kenya and India, Mullaney disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The non-profit organization Smile Operation was founded in 1982
by the husband-and -wife team of Dr. Magee, a plastic surgeon, and
Katheleen Magee, a nurse and clinical social worker.
</P>
<P>
Working with volunteer professionals, donated equipment and
supplies, Operation Smile provides free reconstructive surgery to
children and young adults in developing countries and the United
States, liberating them from disfiguring conditions such as cleft
palates, cleft lips, tumors, burns, and scars.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans Mass Vaccination Against Yellow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Health Minister Rear
Admiral Jubril Ayinla said here Monday his ministry plans to
vaccinate every Nigerian against yellow fever.
</P>
<P>
The government has directed that everybody should be
vaccinated against the disease, said the minister, quoted by the
News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The federal government and other agencies responsible for
health matters will fund the national program, he said without
giving the cost of the proposed nationwide vaccination.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the program will be carried out in
conjunction with the national health care agency and other bodies
responsible for disease control in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would continue to focus attention on
the primary health care system since "prevention is better than
cure".
</P>
<P>
Currently, the government was focusing attention on primary
health care for the rural dwellers because people with "little
education are prone to diseases than those who have basic
knowledge of how to prevent diseases", the minister added.

<HEADLINE> UN Security Council Urges Parties Concerned to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today unanimously adopted a resolution, calling
on the parties concerned to cooperate with international community
so as to complete the identification process timely in Western
Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council reviewed the latest
report by the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution, the Security Council approved the
development of the engineering unit required for demining
activities and of the additional administration staff required to
support the deployment of military personnel suggested by the
Secretary-General in his report to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council expressed its intention to consider positively the
request for the remaining additional military and civilian police
assets for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in
Western Sahara, as soon as the Secretary-General reports that the
identification process has reached a stage which makes the
deployment of these assets essential.
</P>
<P>
It urged the the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia
el-hamra and Rio De Oro (POLISARIO Front) and Morocco to cooperate
with the special representative of the secretary-General and to
cooperate further with the Special Identification Commission in
order that the identification process can be completed in a timely
fashion in accordance with the Settlement Plan and the agreements
reached between the parties for its implementation.
</P>
<P>
Western Sahara had been a Spanish colony until 1976 when Spain
withdrew and released itself from international responsibility
over the territory. The territory was subsequently occupied by
Morocco, a move which was opposed by POLISARIO Front. The
POLISARIO Front took up arms against Moroccan forces.
</P>
<P>
Following diplomatic initiatives by the Organization of African
Unity and the United Nations, the Security Council approved a
Settlement Plan for Western Sahara in 1990. Under the plan, there
would be a ceasefire, and a transitional period during which the
Special Representative of the Secretary-General would be in charge
of all matters relating to the referendum, assisted by the United
Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
The plan was eventually bogged down by the two parties'
differences on certain groups of people to be included in the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough was achieved last year when a new Special envoy
of the Secretary-general brought the two parties together and they
agreed to resume the identification process.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Resume Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A high-level official
delegation from the European Commission, the executive body of
the European Union (EU), has been in South Africa for a new round
of talks toward a free trade agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held in Pretoria Wednesday and Thursday,
said an EU statement.
</P>
<P>
"On the agenda for these talks are issues relating to tariff
liberalization and other trade aspects," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"During the latest round held in Brussels in December 1997,
the parties made significant progress on issues ranging from the
movement of capital to competition policy."
</P>
<P>
During talks earlier last year, South African negotiators
proposed that the agreement between the two regions should cover
all trade within a period of 10 to 12 years, and that the EU
should phase down its tariffs faster than South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations for a free trade agreement between the two sides
started as early as in 1994. It is believed that a comprehensive
agreement will be reached in mid-1998 between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member EU block is South Africa's largest trading
partner.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Missile Plan Poses Threat to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that the building of Iranian
ballistic missiles arsenal could constitute the greatest threat
to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of Israeli Knesset (parliament)
State Audit Committee, Netanyahu said that the Iranians were
moving ahead with the development of long-range ballistic
missiles, which reportedly would have a range of 3,000 kilometers,
capable of hitting Israel.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the danger Iranian long-range-missile
developing plan could pose to Israel is the greatest since the
founding of the Jewish country in 1948.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also accused the Russian scientists of
helping the Iranians, adding that without this aid Teheran could
not develop the weapon system.
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Washington last week, Netanyahu discussed
the Iranian threat with both the United States President Bill
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, hoping that the U.S. would
exert pressure on Russia to stop its technical aid to Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu also said that Israel is preparing for the
possibility, that the political efforts to prevent Iran from
acquiring long-range ballistic missiles, would fail.
</P>
<P>
"We are presently engaged in a political effort to stop the
Iranians, this is not simply a lobby. We are talking about our
lives and our very existence. We are also taking the required
measures to stop this threat, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Iranian President Mohammad Khatami really
wanted to improve relationship with the United States, the first
thing he should do is to halt the development of the long-range
ballistic missiles, which are offensive.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and military ties between Israel and Iran gave way
to belligerence after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been accusing Tehran of developing nuclear and other
non-conventional weapons to point at the Jewish state and of
arming Hezbollah (Party of God) guerrillas who have been fighting
Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Ruling Party to Hold Annual General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Lesotho
Congress for Democracy (LCD) is to hold its first annual general
meeting in Maseru this weekend, South African Press Association
(SAPA) quoted an official of the party as reporting Monday.
</P>
<P>
LCD Deputy Secretary-General Monyane Moleleki said delegates
of the party would discuss preparations for the mountain
kingdom's upcoming general election, possibly in April, and the
local government elections later.
</P>
<P>
The local government elections bill, tabled for its second
reading in parliament Monday, would also be discussed, Moleleki
said, noting, "this is totally a new bill because the last time
Lesotho had local government structures was 30 years ago."
</P>
<P>
Local governments in Lesotho were abolished through an act of
parliament by the late prime minister Leabua Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
Moleleki said the party's leadership would also be discussed
at the conference in view of LCD leader and Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle's decision to leave the government.
</P>
<P>
It was not known whether or not Mokhehle would also stand down
as party leader. "Should he decide he is relinquishing the
position, that means the meeting will have to find a
replacement," Moleleki said.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Cooperation Agreement Signed by Russia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- An agreement on cooperation was
signed Monday by the Russian State Duma and the Tajik parliament,
according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
The accord is part of State Duma chairman Gennady Seleznyov's
official visit to Tajikistan. Seleznyov arrived in Dushanbe,
capital of Tajikistan, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to develop relations with each other and
promote contacts in such fields as human rights, ethnic relations,
regional policy, culture, education, environment and other areas
of humanitarian cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also intended to facilitate work to draft laws on economic
cooperation, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference after the signing ceremony,
Seleznyov said that the two countries have virtually limitless
prospects for economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Russia should support Tajikistan's accession
to the Customs Union as an important step in developing such
cooperative relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the Russian peacekeeping forces in Tajikistan, Seleznyov
said that the Russian forces are the only guarantor of stability
in that country. But he agreed that the Russian peacekeepers
should be gradually withdrawn from Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Tajik National Reconciliation Commission to
continue its work.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik authorities and its opposition signed the General
Agreement on Peace and National Concord in Moscow in June 1997 and
there is still need to continue the dialogue between the two sides
within the framework of the Commission for National
Reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov is to inspect a border post on January 27, where
Tajik and Russian troops are guarding the border between
Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that bilateral accords are planned to be signed
at the end of the visit of the Russian delegation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Dialogue with Greece on Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkey said on Monday that a
constructive dialogue may be the best way to settle disputes
between Turkey and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said at a
weekly press conference that Turkey has made its views on the
issue very clear on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
This is believed to be in response to the remark made by Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos last week that Greece intends
to bring the case to the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
"We are open to a third party mediation, including the courts,
but the two sides concerned have to decide which issues require
that," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey's earlier suggestion that a dialogue
mechanism be set up by the two sides is still valid, adding that
Ankara is waiting for "a positive and constructive response from
Greece."
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Turkey attached special importance to the
settlement of the Turco-Greek disputes, the spokesman said it is
not realistic to try to solve each problem through different means.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, have long been at odds over some issues, including
airspace limit, sovereignty over islets in the Aegean, its sea-bed
resources as well as the thorny Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Greece, with support of many nations of the European Union, of
which Greece is a member state, favors a judicial settlement in
the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, has always held that the two countries should
solve their problem through bilateral talks which are also open to
a third party.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek warplanes and naval vessels are frequently
involved in minor frictions over and in the Aegean Sea, touching
off accusations time and again.
</P>
<P>
Their disputes over an uninhabited islet in the eastern Aegean
almost brought the two neighboring countries to the brink of an
armed conflict in early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Eritrean Resolution on Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The ministers in Eritrea
have adopted a resolution on popular participation in
agricultural production, the latest issue of the English weekly
''Eritrea Profile'' reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the resolution was adopted at a meeting held
last Thursday when the cabinet of ministers discussed the work
plans of the Ministry of Agriculture for 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the ministers underlined the vital
significance of popular participation in efforts to effectively
implement agricultural development programs planned for this
year.
</P>
<P>
In line with the decision passed by the cabinet, the report
said, the envisaged popular participation will take effect before
the onset of the rainy season from June to September and the
scheme will be applied yearly, taking into account the
experiences acquired in the process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed that efforts will be mounted to raise
agricultural production on the basis of the application of modern
inputs, alongside steps to ensure the productivity of the
traditional farming sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is planned that demonstration plots in various
locations will be selected for the purpose of modern agricultural
development projects.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the meeting decided that peasant farmers will be
encouraged and assisted to take part in marketing their produce
through the mechanism of cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea had poor harvests in agriculture for the last two
years due to droughts in the country.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects Bilateral Dialogue with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece today turned down a
proposal by neighboring Turkey to have bilateral political
dialogue between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that
Athens would not discuss issues that had already been settled on
the basis of international treaties or international law.
</P>
<P>
He added that any discussion of those issues before Turkey
recognized the jurisdiction of the international court at the
Hague would be held "in a vacuum."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements by Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos on Sunday that disputes between Greece and Turkey could
be solved by seeking recourse to international organizations,
Reppas said that Pangalos just tried to tell Turkey that if it
believed it had any problem with Greece, it should refer those
issues to the international court rather than resort to
"aggressive and provocative" military action.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Greece's stance towards Turkey had not
changed, namely a step-by-step approach to differences with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey, two rivalries for decades,
have been worsening in recent months following Turkey's failure to
become the European Union's prospective candidate and continued
military exercises by the two countries in the eastern Aegean Sea.

<HEADLINE> Liberians Saddened by ECOMOG's Departure: Troop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Liberians are unhappy with the
ongoing withdrawal of the West African Peace-keeping Force
(ECOMOG) from their home country, the ECOMOG chief said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"They are not happy that we are reducing our troops. They like
Nigerian soldiers," said Maj.-Gen. Timothy Shelpidi, the newly
appointed ECOMOG force commander on his way to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"We are reducing troops right now. There is not much happening
in Liberia except in Monrovia," he said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
"Where there is nothing happening, there is no point having
soldiers in that country," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major contributor of materials and financial and
human resources for the peace keeping operations in Liberia,
began pulling out its troops from that country last December,
with the arrival of about 1,200 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG troops were sent to Liberia in 1990 in the heat of the
civil war which was ignited by the battle launched by former
warlord and the current president Charles Taylor against the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force has helped end the seven-year bloody
civil war which claimed the lives of 150,000 people, displaced
about one million others and destroyed the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The peace-keepers also provided security for a successful
election that brought Taylor to the nation's top seat.
</P>
<P>
Several west African countries have dispatched their troops to
join the ECOMOG contingent, which is expected to leave the
country next week.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, crowds of about 12,000 people assembled
in the capital Monrovia Sunday morning at a farewell party
marking the departure of ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
They held banners and flags saying, "ECOMOG, we love you."
"Thank you, ECOMOG" and "Farewell, our west African friends".
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the city and surrounding towns, people gathered
around the radio sets all day listening to a live broadcast of
the parade by two local radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord that brought to an end the Liberian civil
war, ECOMOG will be involved in the restructuring and training of
Liberia's post-war army.
</P>
<P>
But Taylor reportedly did not want ECOMOG to be involved in
the restructuring and training of the Liberian armed forces,
saying that it was his constitutional right to do the job by
himself.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that Taylor has begun training soldiers
of his former warring faction to replace members of the armed
forces of Liberia recently demobilized.
</P>
<P>
However, Shelpidi dismissed the reports, saying that he was
not aware of it.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo for Brief Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here Monday night from London for
a few hours' visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is being accompanied by PLO Executive Committee
Secretary Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Planning and International
Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath and Arafat's Information Adviser
Nabil Abu Rydainah.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the airport, Shaath told reporters that
Arafat will brief Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the outcome
of his recent visit to Washington and listen to Mubarak's opinion
on the current Mideast situation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian minister said they are returning home from
Washington "empty-handed."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have implemented their part of all the
agreements (signed with Israel), but Israel destroyed everything
and offered nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters earlier
that he himself will have talks with Arafat prior to the two
leaders' meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan made a surprise visit to Cairo Sunday
for talks with Mubarak on pushing forward the peace process, which
a senior Egyptian official said marked the commencement of a
series of Arab consultations.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks in the U.S., the Palestinian leader started
a Maghreb tour during which he visited Mauritania, Morocco,
Algeria and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
On the way, Arafat has been voicing his frustration with the
Washington talks which he described as a "failure" and urging
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fulfill his
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, during a stop in Algiers Sunday, called for holding an
emergency Arab summit to look into the latest developments in the
Arab world, with particular focus on the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
To drum up European support for the peace process, Arafat also
flew to London for talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair
whose country holds the six-month rotating chairmanship of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since last
March when Israel started to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The recent talks Clinton held in Washington with Arafat and
Netanyahu have failed to break the ice.

<HEADLINE> Kigali Wants Rwandan Refugees Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
reiterated its desire to have all its refugees remaining outside
the country return to the motherland, according to a RNA special
dispatch to Xinhua here Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government is not going to leave a single stone
unturned to ensure that these people, whether they are innocent
or not, return home," the Chairman of the Government commission
for Repatriation Kabaija (only name) was quoted by Rwanda News
Agency (RNA) as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kabaija was reacting to the case of about 12,000 Rwandan Hutu
refugees in two refugee camps in Congo (B) allegedly on grounds
that there is no fair justice in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A European Union official, Hubert Onidi, who is in charge of
humanitarian aid to African, the Caribbean, and Pacific countries
is said to have conducted a mission in the above camps and found
out that they were unwilling to return to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Onidi has been quoted by media reports as saying that these
refugees have requested land from Congolese authorities to grow
crops because they are afraid of being repatriated.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with these refugees is that the majority want to
return, but there are ex-FAR -- former Rwandan government
soldiers -- groups intimidating them," Kabaija said.
</P>
<P>
Their repatriation is further crippled by some aid agencies
and international organizations which allegedly want to
perpetuate the refugee problem on unclear motives.
</P>
<P>
"There are sympathetic elements in the international community
which are interested in the perpetuation of the refugee problem
which, for us, would have ended a long time ago," he charged.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of refugees in Congo Brazzaville is made of ex-FAR
and Interahamwe Hutu militia who sided with former Zairean Armed
Forces (FAZ) of late dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko during the
Congolese rebellion last year.
</P>
<P>
Kabaija said that these refugees could have returned home but
aid agencies rather contributed to the flight further west in
providing non-military materials but which were crucial
militarily.
</P>
<P>
Kabaija accuses the ex-FAR and the Hutu militia, together with
these humanitarian organizations of being behind the current
miserable plight of these refugees.
</P>
<P>
There are over 10,000 Rwandan refugees in Congo (B), 3,000 in
the Central African Republic (CAR) and about 20,000 in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 others who tried to cross to eastern Gabon were
repatriated to Rwanda by the Gabonese authorities who used their
airplanes to air-lift them to Kigali.
</P>
<P>
For Rwandan government officials, all refugees must return
whatever the status they want, and it is essential that all
governments should assist them to resolve this problem.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. High Commission of Refugees and some agencies
are accused of not providing a helping hand in the matter, and
are said to negotiate asylum for groups of refugees from
northwestern Rwanda, in the districts of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri in
the countries like Central Africa.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Ministry Says China Worried About Tensions in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said today that China is deeply concerned
about tensions caused by UN weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said that China is asking all parties concerned to resolve
their disputes through dialogues and other peaceful ways to
avoid any further deteriorating situation that could affect the
peace and stability of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that China believes that disputes between countries
should be resolved on the basis of the UN Charter and
international norms and opposes the frequent use of force or the
threat of force.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that Iraq should implement UN resolutions
completely and effectively, but at the same time, Iraq's concern
about its sovereignty and security should be respected by the
international community and Iraq's efforts to implement UN
resolutions should get an objective and just evaluation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The continuation of problems left over from the Gulf Crisis for
the past seven or more years has caused some serious disasters and
had a bad impact on countries in the Gulf region, he said. China
sincerely hopes that all parties concerned will continue to
cooperate to solve these remaining problems as soon as possible
and restore stability and rebuild the region, he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Supports Projects for Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Tuesday
announced support for 50 projects in member states that provide
assistance to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The projects range from construction and refurbishment of
reception centers in southern Italy and the Netherlands to
assistance for the voluntary return of those persons who receive
temporary protection in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Two programs with a budget of 13.75 million ECU were
established last year to facilitate these projects.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 budget amounts to another 16.75 million ECU to support
the reception and voluntary return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner for Justice Anita Gradin highlighted the
contributions the reception program could make in responding to
mass arrivals within the European Union of people fleeing crisis
regions.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has supported projects that will help member
states to ensure that asylum seekers and refugees are received
humanely," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
She said the reception centers in southern Italy are
experiencing a significant influx of refugees from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The commission also emphasized the importance of the voluntary
return program," said Gradin. "By using EU funds to support
projects which meet the needs of Bosnians who have found
protection in (EU) member states and now wish to return."
</P>
<P>
The voluntary repatriation program enables refugees to return
to Bosnia-Herzegovina and will equip them to make a major
contribution to the reconstruction and the rebuilding of civil
society.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is hosting training programs and skill
retraining courses for a wide range of returnees to Bosnia,
including medical professionals, teachers, mine clearance
specialists, construction workers, craftsmen, agricultural workers
and entrepreneurs who wish to set up small businesses.

<HEADLINE> Schooling Provided for Egyptian Children Returned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday ordered speedy
arrangements for proper schooling for the children of Egyptians
sacked by Qatar, the victims of a growing row between Doha and
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Education Hussein Kamel Bahauddin
announced some measures to facilitate the enrollment process for
the beleaguered parents, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
</P>
<P>
"If any document required is not available, a statement of the
required details will be obtained from the parents and the child
will be admitted in school without any difficulty," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
As regards Egyptian teachers whose services have been
terminated by Qatar, they will return to the schools where they
had worked, he said.
</P>
<P>
This step was taken as Qatar is to lay off more Egyptian
expatriates amid the escalating the row with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari Interior Ministry has decided to lay off large
numbers of Egyptian expatriates. The Qatari National
Telecommunications Authority on Sunday dismissed all its 74
Egyptian workers, bringing the number of Egyptians fired to
234 after tensions mounted between the two countries since
November 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian diplomats in Doha, the rest of the 5,000
Egyptians working in Qatar's public sector can expect their
dismissal by summer if relations between the two countries do not
improve.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Embassy in Doha decided to cancel the annual
ceremonies marking Eid el-Fitr to help Egyptians process their
documents and leave Qatar as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa has reiterated the
necessity that Qatar should stop all measures against Egyptians
working in this small rich Arab emirate.
</P>
<P>
Hiring Egyptian workers in Qatar was banned since November 1997
when relations between the two countries hit the lowest point as
Egypt decided to boycott the controversial Middle East and North
Africa economic conference held Doha to protest the Mideast peace
stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Tensions heightened as the two sides quarreled over alleged
Egyptian involvement in a failed coup in Doha in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's mediation in December between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Qatari Emir Sheik Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani
failed to produce concrete results.
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 Egyptians are living in Qatar, whose foreign labor
accounts for two-thirds of the countrys' entire population.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The German Air Force has
temporarily grounded its Tornado fighter jets amid suspicions that
the crash of such a warplane off the northern German coast a week
ago may have been caused by a technical defect, the German Defense
Ministry announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
If the suspicions are confirmed, it must be clarified whether
other Tornados are also affected, a defense ministry spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the search for the ill-fated Tornado is still under
way. Over the past few days, only small parts of the wreckage have
been found.
</P>
<P>
The Tornado crashed in the Atlantic near the northern German
island of Borkum last Tuesday after returning from a training
mission in the Netherlands. Two soldiers on board, including the
pilot, were killed in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Innovation Boosts Capacity of Fiber Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Lucent Technologies Inc.
has developed a system that can transmit as many as 400 billion
bits of date per second over a single strand of fiber, a spokesman
for the company said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new development is a new achievement of Lucent in its race
to meet phone companies' demands for more robust transmission
capacity as internet and data traffic are growing a year.
</P>
<P>
The system, which delivers five times the bandwidth of current
systems, raises the standards for such systems, which use a
technology known as dense wavelength division multiplexing.
</P>
<P>
The new system, when configured to work with eight fibers, can
transmit as many as 3.2 trillion bits of data a second--the
equivalent of 90,000 encyclopedia volumes in one second, Lucent
said.
</P>
<P>
Lucent has planned to begin shipping the product world-wide in
the fourth quarter of this year. That could give competitors time
to develop and deploy their own rich transmission systems.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T Corp. said Monday that it plans to deploy Lucent's new
system to double the capacity of its 40,000-mile fiberoptic
network by the end of the year.

<P>
"I don't think it's the solution, but I'm not the coach, that's

<HEADLINE> 3 Islamic Militants Sentenced to Death in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Cairo court on Tuesday passed
death verdicts to three Islamic militants convicted in the murder
of 26 policemen, largely known as the 33-member Major
Assassination case, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The State Supreme Security Court also sentenced four other
defendants to life imprisonment with hard labor, three to 15 years
in prison with hard labor and five to a ten-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Three others were sentenced to five years in jail and the
remaining suspects were acquitted in the nine-month-long court
proceedings. Two terrorists that were at large had been shot in a
crossfire with the police.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was pronounced in a 10-minute session that was
attended by the foreign and local press under tight security.
</P>
<P>
Events of the Major Assassinations case involved 18 bloody
terrorist acts that were carried out by 33 terrorists from the
Destruction and Devastation group, a branch under the Islamic
Group, in the Upper Egyptian governorates of Sohag, Assiut and
Minya since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In addition to killing the policemen in 1993-94, they also were
accused of plotting to kill 46 other people, and attacks on
vehicles carrying foreigners in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence first passed in December, has been approved
by Egypt's mufti, the chief government cleric.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants have launched an anti-government campaign
since 1992. More than 1,300 people have been killed in the
violence. Most of the victims have been policemen or extremists.

MOSCOW, January 27 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin and
visiting Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov signed a joint
declaration on friendship and cooperation Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The declaration said the two countries intend to take joint
"preventive action" in order to preclude armed action on the
Balkans and in Europe.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony in the Kremlin, Yeltsin said the
foundation for the friendship and fraternity between Russia and
Macedonia had been formed.
</P>
<P>
This document is the first inter-state document signed by the
two countries' leaders, the Russian president said.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly determined to cultivate our relations on the
basis of equality, non-interference in each other's domestic
affairs, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,"
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Gligorov, for his part, said that Russia is among the first to
recognize the Republic of Macedonia and that is "most important"
for the Macedonian people.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the nation's historical friendship with Russia, the
Macedonian president said the Russian and Macedonian peoples were
always close and united by a common history.
</P>
<P>

During the visit, the two sides are expected to sign five
inter-governmental agreements.

<HEADLINE> China's Tiananmen Square on New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people from all
over the country gathered in Beijing's Tiananmen Square this
evening, on the eve of Spring Festival, the Chinese lunar new year.
</P>
<P>
Spring Festival is the most important holiday for the Chinese,
and the world's largest square was lit up with thousands of bulbs,
laser lights, and large red lanterns, a traditional symbol of
happiness and good luck in China.
</P>
<P>
The sight of the lights and lanterns even prompted many locals,
who usually stay home for a traditional family reunion feast, to
venture out to the square.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Ge Binyi, who had braved the bitter cold to come
out and fly a home-made kite in the square, was being followed by
a large group of kids who were shouting excitedly. "I feel so
happy," the 62-year-old man said, "our country is getting stronger
and our lives better year by year, and the lanterns symbolize an
even better year."
</P>
<P>
Three others, Lu Bo and his wife and child, who came from the
city of Yichang in central China, wandered around the square to
take pictures in front of every set of lights and decoration. Lu
said that it was the first time for them to come to Beijing to
celebrate Spring Festival, and although it will cost six to seven
thousand yuan, they can afford it because of salary increases.
</P>
<P>
Qi Zengju, a 74-year-old Beijing resident, said that the
colorful decorations on a 14-meter-high arch hung with red
lanterns symbolize reunification of the country, and that everyone
hopes for an early reunification of the motherland.

<HEADLINE> EU, Russia Hold First Cooperation Council Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed support for
the planned enlargement of the European Union when the two sides
met Tuesday for their first cooperation council meeting.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said his country has
no reason to oppose the bid by several central and eastern
European countries to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, whose country
is currently serving as the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
union, said his Russian counterpart expressed support for the
enlargement which is set to begin in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and
Cyprus were chosen last December to be included in the first wave
of accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Cook and Primakov were joined in the council meeting by the
foreign ministers of all other European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was the first following the initiation last
December of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed
between EU and the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation council is intended to encourage high-level
discussions on a wide range of issues of common interest,
including political, economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The meeting however did not produce any solid results though
the EU tried to persuade Russia to further open its markets, to
cancel quotas imposed on EU carpets, and to drop trans-Siberian
overflight right fees the EU claims are used as subsidies for the
Russian carrier Aeroflot.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, European commissioner in charge of central
and eastern European affairs, said the first cooperation council
meeting is expected to turn out a beginning rather than a
conclusion on consultation.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has become an important trade partner with
Russia in recent years, with 40 percent of the Russian trade in
goods going to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Also discussed at the meeting were bilateral relations,
anti-dumping policies, Russia's bid for accession to the World
Trade Organization, and cooperation in justice and home affairs.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Police Uncover Counterfeit Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian newspapers reported
Tuesday that police in Nograd state discovered 75 million furint
(375,000 U.S. dollars) in counterfeit money.
</P>
<P>
The report said the fake bills were found inside a car during a
routine traffic check. The fake bills were still on large sheets
of paper and had not yet been cut into individual bills.
</P>
<P>
In the report, police claim the fake bills were manufactured by
the owner of a printing house and the owner of a trading company.
</P>
<P>
The report says the fake bills were extremely well made and are
difficult to distinguish from real money, even with the assistance
of precision instruments used to detect counterfeit money.
</P>
<P>
Police maintain the production of the counterfeit money is
related to the theft several years ago of special imported
printing paper which is used to print money. Police said the case
is still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> China Spending Several Billion Yuan on Yangtze River Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A large project to improve
shipping conditions at the mouth of the Yangtze River by clearing
and deepening the channel started today in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to cost three billion yuan (about 350
million US dollars) in its first phase, which will take three
years. In that time, the depth of the shipping channel there is
expected to go from 7 to 8.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
This will mean nearly 20 billion yuan in profits for Shanghai,
China's most important seaport, during the next two decades,
shipping experts predict. Last year, the port handled over 2.5
million standard containers.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the three-phase project is to lower depth
at the mouth to 12.5 meters to allow more than 100,000-tonnage
ships to enter Shanghai harbor.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng wrote inscriptions for the project,
saying: "Improving the deepwater channel at the Yangtze River
mouth to help build Shanghai into a world economic center and
bring about a new leap of development in the Yangtze River delta."
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi attended
the project's opening ceremony, which was presided over by Huang
Zhendong, minister of communications.
</P>
<P>
Wu called this "a magnificent project that will last until the
next century,, one that shows China's improved shipping conditions
and a major step forward in developing Shanghai into an
international shipping center.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Crashes out of Australian Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras
lost his first set and then the match in a quarter-final of the
Australian Open on Tuesday in Melbourne, crashing 6-4, 6-2, 6-7,
6-3 to unseeded Slovak Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who was seeking for his 11th Grand Slam and his third
Australian Open trophy, never lost one single set before the
dismal clash in previous seven matches.
</P>
<P>
Kucera, ranked 20th in the world, kept press with his stormy
service game upon the Man of Mission who was will under his best
form.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Kucera had never made a third-round appearance
of any grand slam tournament, but gave little chance to the
defending champion to come back to the game.
</P>
<P>
The Slovakian has won two tournaments this year - the Hopman
Cup team exhibition event in Perth and the Sydney International.
</P>
<P>
Chilean ninth seed Marcelo Rios is the other seed survives in
the men's draw.
</P>
<P>
Kucera had been in brilliant form leading into Tuesday night,
winning 14 out of 15 matches this month - in the Hopman Cup in
Perth, the Sydney international tournament which he won and here
at the Open.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the match, he said he was looking forward to
playing Korda.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time they have met in a professional
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to be in the semi-finals, and happy to be playing my
countryman almost - I hope to win," Kucera said.
</P>
<P>
"I had a very good preparation ... that's why I'm playing so
well now."
</P>
<P>
The unemotional Slovakian said he was in the best form of his
career and said he was still coming to terms with tonight's
amazing win.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a little bit later, I will jump somewhere," he said in
reference to his apparent lack of excitement.
</P>
<P>
Kucera said Sampras had started very aggressively, but he had
been able to keep with the American's rhythm.
</P>
<P>
"Then I think he started to push a little harder and he started
to make some mistakes," Kucera said.
</P>
<P>
Sampras said he had been out-played Tuesday night and thought
he did not react well to Kucera's initial charge.
</P>
<P>
He agreed his forehand was also off, but offered no excuses.
</P>
<P>
"I got impatient out there and missed some shots," he
said. "There's no excuse, my hat's off to him, he played a great
match."

The New York Times:

the United States responds to a foreign policy problem.

The Washington Post:

<P>
-- At a moment of maximum political peril, President Clinton
plans tonight to open a national debate on the most sacred and
untouchable of government programs, Social Security. White House

budget surpluses for shoring up Social Security against the
enormous tide of baby boom retirements that threaten its long-term
future.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kucera Beats Sampras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Slovakian Karol
Kucera produced the match of his life in Melbourne Tuesday night
to pull off the upset of this Australian tennis open, beating
world No.1 Pete Sampras in four sets.
</P>
<P>
Only last night, Andre Agassi said he would not bet against
Sampras winning his second-successive Australian title.
</P>
<P>
But reputation and odds counted for nothing to 23-year-old
Kucera, ranked 20th in the world, who harried and ran Sampras
around the court to win 6-4, 6-2, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Kucera had never made it past the third round of a grand slam
tournament before this year, while Sampras had also won this open
in 1994 and this time had not dropped a set in the event before
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The gallant Slovakian will meet sixth-seeded Petr Korda in the
semi-finals after the Czech rallied to beat fourth-seeded Swedish
Jonas Bjorkman earlier Tuesday at 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time Kucera and Sampras had met in a
professional tournament, with Sampras winning their previous
encounter at Wimbledon in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Sampras was well off his game, making far too many unforced
errors, while Kucera was magnificent.
</P>
<P>
Kucera controled the tempo of the match from the outset,
breaking Sampras in the first game of the first set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras launched a spirited counter-attack in the third,
breaking back twice to force the tiebreak, and looked to be
gaining momentum early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
But Kucera broke him in the sixth game and then held serve for
the match.
</P>
<P>
Kucera's serve was a dangerous weapon, with the Slovakian
firing down 18 aces to Sampras' seven, while the American star
made 46 unforced errors. The Slovakian only made 21.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Step Up Tibet's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China's International Business
Daily says that the Tibet Autonomous Region needs to improve
foreign trade to meet international challenges and rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
It says that during the 1991-1995 period, foreign trade had an
average annual increase of 70 percent, with a trade volume of 540
million US dollars, nearly six times that of the previous
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign trade is still limited to general merchandise
and processing trade, and the service trade, engineering, and
labor exports have not been tried, and export goods are mainly
primary products like wool and hand-made carpets, with little
added-value.
</P>
<P>
Border trade only accounted for 10 percent of the region's
total foreign trade and needs to be developed. These foreign trade
problems are related to the backward status of agriculture, the
geography, transportation difficulties, and a shortage of
qualified personnel.
</P>
<P>
Tibet needs to increase agriculture input, improve its
infrastructure, and produce major products with local
characteristics to create favorable conditions for foreign
trade. It needs to increase trade with countries other than Nepal,
where about 90 percent of its exports go.

<HEADLINE> Barclays, Standard Banks in S. Leone Urged to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Scores of customers claiming
to have cheque and deposit accounts with Barclays and Standard
Chartered Banks in Sierra Leone Monday called for the reopening
of the international banks.
</P>
<P>
The two banks were closed down after the May 25 coup last year
which toppled the civilian government.
</P>
<P>
"I am virtually living as a destitute because I am now deep in
debt. I have to shut myself in and refuse to answer the door bell
fearing that people have come to collect their debts," said one
customer who has a large amount of money deposited in the
Barclays.
</P>
<P>
Maciama Turay, a petty trader, said she cannot send her
children to school because she cannot provide uniform, shoes and
lunch for them.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know whom to talk to. We have been in touch with
the Governor of the Central Bank but he said he could do very
little except facilitate our complaints to the headquarters of
both banks in London. This is a rough plight," she added.
</P>
<P>
Other customers of Barclays and Standard Chartered Banks said
they were now "financially displaced."
</P>
<P>
"My business is in ruins," said one customer while another
threatened legal action to gain access to his savings.
</P>
<P>
One of the hardest hit sector is the privately owned
educational institutions which cater for kindergartens and
primary school children.
</P>
<P>
"We have now put our teachers on half salaries until Barclays
reopens," said headmistress Elfrida Lewis of the Hope Preparatory
School.
</P>
<P>
Senior personnel of both Banks fled the country after the
coup, making it difficult to get transactions.
</P>
<P>
Both banks carry about 70 percent of all banking transactions
in the country while they have purchased millions of dollars of
Treasury Bonds and Bills from the Bank of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Although they have been inoperative, both banks had kept all
their employees on their payroll until last week when Standard
Chartered reportedly sacked about 90 of its staff.
</P>
<P>
Barclays will shortly fire some 100 workers including some in
managerial positions.
</P>
<P>
Observers said both banks may be assessing the security
situation in the country before deciding whether to reopen their
doors or otherwise.

<HEADLINE> Non-Communist Parties on Anniversary of President's Speech on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Non-communist parties in China
and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a forum
today to mark the third anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's
speech on the reunification of the motherland or the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, vice-chairwoman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
chairwoman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee
of the Chinese Kuomintang, presided over the forum.
</P>
<P>
She told the gathering that the Chinese people will not
tolerate any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", and she urged the Taiwanese authorities to accept the
one-China position as soon as possible, make joint efforts to
improve cross-straits relations and contribute to the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
She said that non-communist parties and the All-China
Federation of Industry and Commerce will continue to follow
Jiang's speech on the Taiwan issue, and make more links and
exchanges with people in Taiwan to increase understanding.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Siwei, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic National Construction Association, told the gathering
that President Jiang's Eight-Point Proposal expresses the desire
of all quarters, including his association, and the Taiwanese
authorities should respond to Jiang's proposal, hold negotiations,
and open direct postal, commercial and transport links at an early
date.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, president of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, said that cross-straits economic and trade exchanges
are playing an important role in the economic prosperity of both
two sides, but that some obstacles mean that economic cooperation
can only be done in an indirect way and seriously hinder the
development of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that industrial and commercial sectors on
both sides will make an effort at economic cooperation and
contribute to the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Others who addressed the forum include Wu Xiuping,
vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic
League; Xu Jialu, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Association for Promoting Democracy; Jiang Zhenghua, chairman of
the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers'
Democratic Party; Luo Haocai, chairman of the Central Committee of
the China Zhi Gong Party; Zhao Weizhi, vice-chairman of the
Central Committee of the Jiu San (September 3) Society; and Li
Minkuan, secretary general of the Central Committee of the Taiwan
Democratic Self-Government League.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Minister: Preparation for Arab Summit Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Tuesday that no measure has been taken so far for
convening an Arab summit on Mideast peace but prospects of holding
it "are available," Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Moussa following the talks between Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat, who has been calling for such a summit.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two leaders here touched on the Arab
action in face of the stalled peace process, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Arafat and the Palestinian delegation
expounded the outcome of recent Washington talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, the Israeli proposals and the
U.S. stance, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that all Israeli proposals were not enough to
salvage the peace process," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
The talks came within the context of consultations Egypt plans
to hold with a number of other Arab countries to discuss the
outcome of the meetings Clinton had with the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks, Arafat, who arrived here Monday night,
informed Mubarak of the results of his tour of Britain and Arab
Maghreb region, including Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria and
Tunisia, on his way back from Washington.
</P>
<P>
In Algiers and London, the Palestinian leader called for
holding an emergency Arab summit to look into the latest
developments in the Arab world, with particular focus on the
Palestinian cause, and map out the next steps that should be taken
to confront the Mideast peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
His appeal coincided with a statement by the Cairo-based Arab
League that backed any Arab call for holding a new Arab summit on
the grave conditions of the peace process and the failure of
Washington's peace overtures.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the airport, Palestinian Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath told reporters
that they are returning home from Washington "empty-handed."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have implemented their part of all the
agreements (signed with Israel), but Israel destroyed everything
and offered nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been voicing his frustration with the Washington
talks which he described as a "failure" and urging Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fulfill his obligations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Washington, a spokesman for the Department of
State said the U.S. believes that the Arab countries have the
right to hold a summit to discuss the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said there are current talks with Israel and
the PNA in order to assess reactions of both sides to recent
U.S. proposals that try to "strike an acceptable balance" between
an Israeli withdrawal of troops from the West Bank and Palestinian
implementation of security measures.
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken by the Palestinians according to the
U.S. proposals would involve exchanging intelligence information
with Israelis and shutting down religious and social institutions
that belong to the militant radical group Hamas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have remained deadlocked
since last March when Israel started to build a new settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Extends Lunar New Year Greetings to Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of
China, extended his warmest wishes to the Hong Kong citizens
Tuesday on the eve of the Lunar New Year.
</P>
<P>
In his televised Lunar New Year message, Tung and his wife,
Betty, wished all the HKSAR citizens good health and a prosperous
year.
</P>
<P>
This is the first Lunar New Year after the establishment of the
HKSAR on July 1, 1997, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the principles of "one
country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people running Hong" have
been welcomed by the whole community, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Central People's Government and the
hard work of the Hong Kong people, the HKSAR has made a good
start, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We have drawn up long-term goals for the future development of
Hong Kong and we are now turning them into reality," Tung pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the hardship resulting from the recent Asian
financial turmoil, Tung said the SAR government "will take all
possible steps to provide a helping hand."
</P>
<P>
The government is doing its best and will certainly take the
interests of the entire community into account despite the fact
that the measures now under consideration may not meet the needs
and aspirations of everyone, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from doing our utmost to tackle the immediate problems,"
he added, "we will strive to lay a firm foundation for the
long-term development of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial turmoil gives Hong Kong an opportunity to
make quicker adjustments to some negative factors of Hong Kong's
economy, such as the soaring property prices, high inflation and
negative interest rates, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We must remain calm and collected to overcome these temporary
setbacks," he said. "Once this has been achieved, the foundations
for our future progress and prosperity will be further
strengthened."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there are two things that the government must
do.
</P>
<P>
First the government should endeavor to work for the well-being
of the next generation. "Only by doing this shall we be able to
plan for Hong Kong's future with a new vision and commitment."
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, the government must regard the people of Hong
Kong as members of a large family, to ensure that the elderly, the
poor and the underprivileged are well cared for and are provided
with a sense of security.
</P>
<P>
Describing his post as the greatest honor given to him and the
greatest challenge of his life, Tung pledged to "exert every
effort to perform my duties and work hand in hand with you all
toward the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Tung and his wife have sent a Lunar New Year greeting card to
the people of Hong Kong via the Internet and they will also tour
the Lunar New Year Fair at Victoria Park Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
On the Lunar New Year's Day, they will visit two homes for the
elderly in Tai Po and distribute presents to a gathering of
elderly people there.

<HEADLINE> Australian Stocks Pulled Down by Banks, Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Major banks pulled the
Australian stock market down Tuesday as investors renewed their
interest in gold stocks after a surge in the gold price overnight.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said investors were taking their money out of banks and
sitting on the sidelines, ready to buy back into the sector again
when the prices of bank stocks fell further.
</P>
<P>
Reynolds &AMP; Co.'s Peter Struk said Australian investors were a
"little bit wary" at the moment.
</P>
<P>
"The uncertainty with Asia, Hong Kong going to be closed for
the next few days for Chinese New Year and Clinton looking like he
may have to resign ... I think a combination of all that pulled
the market down," Struk said.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries Index closed 19.4 points down at 2603.9.
</P>
<P>
Gold smashed through the 300-U.S.-dollar barrier in London
overnight after a strong rise on Friday but lost some ground to
close at 297.1 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones broker Philip Toop said that after a
promising start this morning the market picked up on the
negativity of last week's Asia-inspired nervousness and dropped
off.
</P>
<P>
"The whole market ended up a bit weaker," Toop said. "Ongoing
concern about Asia exposure has continued to dampen the sector."
</P>
<P>
The banking index finished the day down 124.1 points, or 2.28
percent, at 5327.1, led by ANZ bank which fell after Moody's
downgraded its rating outlook to negative.
</P>
<P>
ANZ slipped 32 cents to 9.38 Australian dollars, Westpac bank
35 cents to 9.72 Australian dollars, Commonwealth 22.7 points to
18.29 Australian dollars and National Australia Bank 42 cents to
19.77 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials Index was down 40.4 points at 4463.4 while
the All Resources Index shaved off 1.5 points to 1120.5.
</P>
<P>
The gold index finished the day 32.6 points higher at 1062.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney gold bullion finished trading 8.95 U.S. dollars
stronger at 299.75 U.S. dollars, up from Friday's close at 298.35
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the resource sector, BHP fell 20 cents to 13.87 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 263.06 million shares worth 553.01
million U.S. dollars with falling stocks slightly overshadowing
rising stocks by 574 to 538.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Residents Say They're Confident about 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey of 500 Beijing
households found that 10.2 percent believed the country's economy
will grow at the same rate as last year, while 78.9 percent said
it will be even faster.
</P>
<P>
Of those questioned, 89.7 percent believed that social security
will be better, while young people and relatively better educated
people tend to have higher expectations for their income.
</P>
<P>
This shows that rapid development has provided more
opportunities for the young and the better educated, according to
an expert. "Thus, the survey indicates that the future Chinese
society will be dominated by the better educated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the biggest wishes of many residents for the new year are
health, house and wealth, so the most popular greetings for the
traditional lunar new year's eve this evening is "Wish you good
health, prosperity, and a new house in the new year," according to
the expert.

BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing woman, Hu Xiuying,
has invited a group of foreigners to share the family feast in
downtown Beijing for the Chinese lunar New Year's eve.
</P>
<P>
This is the hostess' fifth time to prepare the festival dinner
for foreign tourists. This time, a German woman, one of 33 guests,
could be seen making her first dumpling and displaying it to her
companions and Chinese hosts. "This is equal to your Christmas
Eve," Hu explained, "we always get together to make dumplings,
watch TV, and often stay up all night."
</P>
<P>
Nearly all families in China consider this reunion dinner the
most important festival.
</P>
<P>
Hu's room contained the large Chinese character "Fu," meaning
"good fortune," and the New Year's zodiac sign of the tiger.
</P>
<P>
The Germans announced that the dumplings were delicious, and
that the Chinese family was hospitable. The activity was arranged
by a tourism office specially working with folk customs.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three million overseas tourists visit the Chinese
capital annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin's personal envoy to Iraq Victor Sivaliok arrived here
Tuesday afternoon on a brief visit to discuss the development of
situation with the Iraqi leaders.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released upon his arrival, Sivaliok, Russian
deputy foreign minister, said that he was assigned by Yeltsin on
an urgent mission to discuss with "our Iraqi friends" the
development of situation concerning Iraq at this particular time,
the Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was also entrusted with undertaking efforts to
find a way out of such situation through political and diplomatic
means.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy renewed his country's firm position of
rejecting the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, U.N. chief arms inspector Richard Butler failed to
persuade Iraq to allow inspectors to enter presidential sites to
carry out work after three rounds of talks with Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has proposed to freeze any discussions or actions with
respect to the question of inspectors' access to presidential
sites before technical evaluation meetings come to an end in April.
</P>
<P>
The United States described the Iraqi proposal as unacceptable,
and has warned of military solution to the standoff between Iraq
and the U.N. Special Commission in charge of eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia, France and China have said that they strongly
object to the use of force against Iraq and called for diplomatic
solution to the standoff.

<HEADLINE> Ramos: Asia Remains Attractive Market Despite Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here Tuesday that Asia will remain an attractive global
market and investment destination despite the financial crisis
that has affected many countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing officials and employees of the Department of Foreign
Affairs, Ramos said this was precisely why the Philippines sought
to promote regional financial cooperation through the Manila
Framework last November.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Framework, a set of recommendations for regional
cooperation to promote financial stability in the international
monetary system with the support of the International Monetary
Fund, was adopted as a core action strategy for the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) member economies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said last year's informal meeting of APEC Leaders in
Vancouver, Canada, brought the regional community even closer
together in managing the problems of currency depreciation and in
harmonizing the members' actions for regional trade liberalization
and economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We of Southeast Asia, in particular, continue to make good
headway in our economic integration through increased intra-ASEAN
trade and ASEAN trading scheme utilizing our own national
currencies, sub-regional growth zones like the East (ASEAN) Growth
Area (EAGA), liberalized arrangement such as the ASEAN Free Trade
Area (AFTA) and the expanded APEC forum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is for these reasons that I, as your president and as
ASEAN chair, believe the region, in spite of its on-going
difficulties, will remain stable and eventually regain its growth
momentum in the foreseeable future," he said.

Many workers who came to Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone, from other parts of China, have chosen to remain in
the city during the Spring Festival, which is usually an occasion
for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at Shenzhen's labor department, about a
third of the transient workers stay put during the traditional
festival, providing some relief for transportation workers.
</P>
<P>
Employers have planned various kinds of entertainment, and
tourist resorts have cut prices in half, and people working during
the holiday get more pay.
</P>
<P>
Another result has been that many restaurants have signs in

Kunming and Guangzhou Blossom Year Round
</P>
<P>
Kunming, in southwestern China, has been called the "Spring
City" for its pleasant weather all year round, and now more people
buy fresh flowers to decorate their homes.
</P>
<P>
Flowers with symbolic significance are especially popular: young
people buy roses to give to lovers, or buy lilies to send to the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
People from the north like to visit food and amusement fairs,
but in China's southern city of Guangzhou, visiting flower fairs
has become popular.
</P>
<P>
The city's eight districts have large flower fairs, but the
central flower fair is the biggest, covering three blocks with
many visitors and various types of flowers.
</P>
<P>
Flower fairs have enriched people's lives, and provide
opportunities and challenges for businessmen.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A strong rally by gold kept
the Australian dollar above 67 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Maintaining its 1-U.S.-cent gain made in Asia trading Monday,
the local dollar closed at 67.23 U.S. cents Tuesday, from 65.93
U.S. cents in local trading on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local dollar was boosted by the improvement in the gold
price, which rose to above 300 U.S. dollars an ounce at the
weekend for the first time in two months.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange dealer from National Australia Bank said
gold sent the Australian dollar flying on Friday evening and
bullish sentiment fueled further gains from there.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said the local currency was also supported Tuesday
by heavy North American buying.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Countries Remain Calm in Oil Price Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf oil producers
have shown concern over the continuous oil price slide starting
from the beginning of 1998, but indicated they would not be hurry
to take immediate response for fear of bringing about
counter-productive effects.
</P>
<P>
The average oil prices in the world market fell to under 15
U.S. dollars a barrel last week with a downtrend still being
perspective, wrecking a month-old agreement that raised the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)' output
by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Oil Minister Issa Mohammed Al-Mazidi Sunday blamed the
falling world oil prices on quota violations by some of its
fellow OPEC members, as well as Asia's economic trouble caused by
a wide-spread financial crisis and Iraq's possible increased oil
exports under an enlarged oil-for-food formula.
</P>
<P>
In last November, OPEC oil ministers decided to raise their
output ceiling for the first three months of 1998 by 2.47 million
barrels per day to 27.5 million. Meanwhile, Russia proposed to
double the volume of the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food scheme which
currently allows Iraq to export 2 billion dollars worth of oil
every six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The loss of more than three dollars a barrel in crude prices in
a few weeks has more than offset the increase in Saudi Arabia's
OPEC quota. Saudi Arabia was allowed to produce 8.76 million
barrels per day under the new quota system.
</P>
<P>
As for Kuwait, the average price for its crudes is slightly
below 13 dollars a barrel according to the last deal. But actual
average price in the second half of 1997 was 18 dollars and it
projected oil revenue at 2.55 billion Kuwait Dinars (8.4 billion
dollars) on a production of 2 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
But the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have been
avoiding taking any immediate measures to stop the fall of the
world oil prices and refrained from calling for an emergency
meeting of the 12-member OPEC.
</P>
<P>
GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates
(UAE), Oman, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
"They believe a hasty response could send the wrong message to
the market which is already very jittery," a Gulf oil analyst told
Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Al-Mazidi said Sunday that the situation is not
yet alarming for its finances although the average price for
Kuwait's oil exports has dropped below a budgeted 13 dollars a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia indicated last week that it wants to watch market
developments a while longer before deciding even whether it will
support emergency talks.
</P>
<P>
It said it has no intention of providing a lone prop to the oil
market by cutting back production below its new 8.76 million
barrels per day allocation.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has also indicated it will not easily reverse policy.
</P>
<P>
However, the sharp decline in oil prices this month could
force the Gulf oil exporters, especially Saudi Arabia, to put the
brakes on expenditure in 1998. Saudi Arabia carried out a lavish
spending because of high earnings from high oil prices during the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf countries called on OPEC members to strictly abide by
the quotas, indicating that without quota violations prices would
be much higher.
</P>
<P>
Reports said OPEC ministers have increased informal contacts
through the current turmoil in oil markets though there is no
prospect of an emergency meeting of the ministers.
</P>
<P>
OPEC oil ministers are due to hold their next scheduled meeting
in Vienna in June. OPEC groups Algeria, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and
Venezuela.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Mulato Hospital, the most
sophisticated one in Uganda, has acquired radiotherapy facilities
for treatment of complicated cancers, "The New Vision" reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Kaggwa, the director of the hospital, said the
facilities worth 1.2 million U.S. Dollars were donated by
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
According to Kigula Mugambe, the head of the Radiotherapy Unit
in the hospital, the facilities will be used to treat cancer of
cervix, throat, mouth, eye and AIDS-related skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
Radiotherapy is a conventional treatment for advanced cancer
cases. The patients are treated with radiation daily for four to
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Most local cancer patients report for medical help at their
advanced stage, Mugambe said. With radiotherapy, local doctors
can save many lives, he added. The treatment has attracted
patients from as far away as Rwanda, Zaire and southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The government-sponsored hospital has acquired other
facilities and more classified staff members in recent five
years. "We can now manage more complicated cases than ever
before, irrespective of the cause," Kagwa said.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets With Arafat on Washington Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat in his palace on Tuesday morning, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks came within the context of consultations Egypt plans
to hold with a number of other Arab countries to discuss the
outcome of the meetings U.S. President Bill Clinton had with the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's talks, Arafat, who arrived here Monday night,
informed Mubarak of the results of his tour of Arab Maghreb
region, including Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, on his
way back from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was later expanded to include PLO Executive
Committee Secretary Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), Planning and
International Cooperation Minister Nabil Shaath and Arafat's
Information Adviser Nabil Abu Rydainah.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz also attended
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also expounded the outcome of his talks on Monday with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair whose country holds the
six-month rotating presidency of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
In London, the Palestinian leader called for holding an
emergency Arab summit to look into the latest developments in the
Arab world, with particular focus on the Palestinian cause, and
map out the next steps that should be taken to confront the
Mideast peace stalemate.
</P>
<P>
His appeal coincided with a statement by the Cairo-based Arab
League that backed any Arab call for holding a new Arab summit on
the grave conditions of the peace process and the failure of
Washington's peace overtures.
</P>
<P>
Upon their arrival at the airport, Shaath told reporters that
they are returning home from Washington "empty-handed."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have implemented their part of all the
agreements (signed with Israel), but Israel destroyed everything
and offered nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been voicing his frustration with the Washington
talks which he described as a "failure" and urging Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to fulfill his obligations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have deadlocked since last
March when Israel started to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Drive for Non-oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria launched Monday an
11-member advisory committee on the export processing factories
scheme in a bid to further promote non-oil export, local press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will cater for companies given export processing
factories status but are outside the country's export processing
zones, the first to be commissioned soon in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Such factories will enjoy the same incentives as those located
in the export processing zones.
</P>
<P>
At the inauguration ceremony in the capital Abuja, Minister of
Commerce and Tourism Emmanuel Udugu explained that the scheme was
planned to "encourage industries to source raw materials locally,
create jobs, increase capacity utilization and generate foreign
exchange".
</P>
<P>
According to him, the committee is expected to create
awareness about the operations of the export processing zone
scheme.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's conviction that
"diversification of the national economic base by way of
developing the non-oil export sector is the only viable and less
painful option for our economic recovery and national progress".
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to establish more export processing
zones in different parts of the country to "aggressively pursue"
non-oil exports in "semi-processed or processed form", the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas processing zones will also be established in
Rivers state in the southeast, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has over the past few years focused on the development
of non-oil sectors in its drive to reduce over-dependence on oil,
the main sources of the nation's foreign exchange and government
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the first export processing zone in Calabar
started in November 1991 and more than 90 percent of it has been
ready.
</P>
<P>
However, the shortage of investors has delayed the
commissioning of the zone, the minister disclosed early this
month.
</P>
<P>
At present, only two investors, one producing garments and the
other producing wood work, have installed their machines at the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 companies, both local and foreign, have received
the approval to invest in the zone, but they have not come to
start business.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact, the government has planned to establish more
export processing zones in different parts of the country to
"aggressively pursue" non-oil exports in "semi-processed or
processed form", the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas processing zones will also be established in
Rivers state in the southeast, he added.

PARIS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton took counter-offensive on Monday
by denying all rumors about a sex scandal involving him and a
former White House intern. Meanwhile, everything shows that the
American people have not yielded to the frenzy over the sex
scandal fanned by the media and that they are waiting for further
facts to be established, as 59 percent of the Americans said in a
poll that the president has done a good job as head of state.
</P>
<P>
-- The scandal involving Clinton with a former White House
intern, Monica Lewinsky, who is Jewish, has developed into a
thesis on Jewish conspiracy in Arab newspapers, which did not
hesitate to claim a conspiracy in the death of Princess Diana, who
was having an affair with a Muslim when she was killed. Moreover,
the scandal erupted one day after Clinton met with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House and failed to reach
any agreement over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- When making his declaration denying a sex scandal involving
him with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, Bill
Clinton did not answer any question from the journalists and gave
no "complete" explanation as the White House promised. Meanwhile,
the bargainings are continuing between independent prosecutor
Kenneth Starr and the lawyer of Lewinsky, William Ginsberg, on the
immunity required by Lewinsky before she comes out to give a new
testimony on whether she had a liaison with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- A guide who organized a racket rambling by teenagers last
Friday in the French Alps mountains, which resulted in an
avalanche that killed 11 ramblers and injured nine, was arrested
by police on Monday. Daniel Forte is under judicial inquiry and
could be put on trial.

<HEADLINE> Trucks Banned From Bomb-Ravaged City in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Security forces guarding Sri
Lanka's ancient capital of Kandy have banned all trucks from the
city after a truck bomb explosion killed at least 16 people and
damaged the holiest Buddhist shrine of Dalada Maligawa, said news
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Security in the city has been tight since the bomb rocked Kandy
Sunday morning. No trucks are allowed to enter the city, some 115
kilometers east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation work on the damaged Dalada Maligawa (Tooth Relic
Temple) has been under way. About 3,000 workers, together with
troops, have been called in for the reconstruction project, local
radio reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Colombo, the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) organized a demonstration this morning in protest
against the government's decision to ban the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The government announced Monday night that the LTTE was
outlawed with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
This decision came one day after some LTTE rebels staged the
bomb attack on the temple. The outer wall, entrance and roof of
the temple were damaged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of the Red Cross has condemned the
attack in Kandy. A news release from the ICRC Colombo Office said
Tuesday that the organization strongly condemns this deliberate
attack on civilians and a place of worship.
</P>
<P>
It added that the attack constituted a serious violation of the
rules of international humanitarian law, which forbid
indiscriminate attacks against the civilian population and
cultural monuments and places of worship.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's External Trade Up in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The value of Hong Kong's
total exports increased by 4.2 percent in 1997 over the previous
year, a local government spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Within the total exports, the value of re-exports rose by 5
percent, while the value of domestic exports decreased by 0.4
percent. The value of imports registered an increase of 5.2
percent for 1997 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
According to the external trade figures released on the same
day by the Census and Statistics Department of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, the value of Hong Kong's
re-exports, domestic exports and imports all registered
year-on-year increases in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports comprising re-exports and domestic
exports in December rose by 6.7 percent over a year earlier to
124.4 billion HK dollars (16 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the total exports, the value of re-exports increased by
7.4 percent to 105.7 billion HK dollars (13.6 billion U.S.
dollars), while the value of domestic exports increased by 2.8
percent to 18.7 billion HK dollars (2.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The value of imports rose to 137.8 billion HK dollars (17.7
billion U.S. dollars) in December 1997, or by 4.9 percent up over
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest trade statistics, the spokesman said
that the values of both re-exports and domestic exports showed a
faster year-on-year growth in December 1997 than in the preceding
month.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, the value of total exports registered "a
moderate growth." Taking into account the continued easing in
export prices in 1997, total exports were likely to have grown
slightly faster in real terms in 1997 than in 1996, he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- As the traditional Chinese
Lunar New Year is around the corner, more and more Hong Kong
residents rush out for their holiday travel.
</P>
<P>
Most of the travelers make run for China's inland for family
reunions or visits to their relatives there.
</P>
<P>
Carrying a big bag on his back, Mr. Cheung lined up at the Lo

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Down in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents in Kampala
in 1997 numbered at 4,623, some 20 percent down from the figure
of the previous year of 5,566, "The New Vision" reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of fatal accidents in 1997 is 236, comparing
to 272 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
There were 240 traffic deaths in 1997, among them 143 were
pedestrians, while the corresponding figures in 1996 were 289 and
171. Traffic injuries in the two years were 1,517 and 3,022
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Declining trend of traffic accidents in the city is a result
of intensified attempts by concerned authorities, said Grace
Turyagumawe, the officer-in-charge of traffic in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Mass media and other agencies launched a massive education
campaign to teach people proper use of the roads to reduce
traffic accidents, and the police in the city stopped some
drivers who did not have valid driving permits and vehicles in
dangerous mechanic conditions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The authorities also will deploy traffic personnel on the
common accident areas and busy areas to minimize traffic
accidents, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Traffic Department's Speed Control Unit has also
strengthened and provided with transport to patrol all the major
roads leading to and from the city, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The total traffic accidents in the country also showed a
declining trend, with 7,670 incidents in the first 11 months in
1997 and 9,135 in 1996, said John Cossy Odomel, the inspector
general of police.
</P>
<P>
Odomel is optimistic on the trend, saying that police will
intensify its efforts to check on incompetent drivers to minimize
road accidents.

<HEADLINE> Renewed Communal Clash Kills Eight in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
feared dead and about 50 seriously injured in a renewed clash
Monday between Ife and Modakeke communities in west Nigeria, the
official newspaper New Nigerian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hostilities, which started early Monday morning with
warriors freely using weapons during the attack, was a major
setback in the on-going peace process between the two rival
communities which signed a peace accord last December.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence was caused by some Ife youths, who
stormed the Oke-Yidi praying ground where the Modakeke Moslem
faithfuls go for prayers and started felling the trees.
</P>
<P>
Reports said it was the claim and counter-claim over the
ownership of the land that degenerated into the bloody clash.
</P>
<P>
The state Police Commissioner, Sunday Aghedo, confirmed the
clash but declined knowledge of any casualties.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence is at least the fifth round in a series
since the first unrest was triggered off by the relocation of the
Ife-east local government headquarters from Modakeke to Oke-Ogbo
in Ile-Ife last August.
</P>
<P>
The bloody clashes have claimed the lives of more than 100
people, injured over 200 others and caused huge economic losses
as many houses were burnt and other properties damaged.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha will soon name a new Chief of General Staff to
replace Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, who is now in detention
for alleged complicity in the failed coup plot last December.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian newspaper, This Day Tuesday quoted a "highly
reliable source" as saying that the new chief of general staff
would most likely come from the navy, which has recently elevated
six Commodores to the rank of Rear Admirals.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff is the number two leader in the Nigerian
military government, second only to General Sani Abacha, who is
also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Diya was appointed the Chief of General
Staff in November 1993 soon after Abacha took over power from the
interim government of Chief Earnest Shonkan.
</P>
<P>
More than 72 military officers as well as civilians have been
arrested in connection with the coup on December 21, 1997. The
government said they will be tried by a martial court.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Central Bank Cuts Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Israel has
decided to cut its key lending rate from February by 0.5
percentage points to 12.9 percent, the bank said in a statement
available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled lending rate reduction is the result of reduced
inflation and inflationary expectations, the statement
said. However, it added, that there is still the need for great
care to ensure a continuation of the drop in inflation seen in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Israel's inflation stood at 7 percent last year, the lowest
level in 29 years. The government has set the same rate for 1998.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the central bank's interest-rate reduction,
Manufactures Association said that it hopes this is only the first
step in the right direction, pointing out that in real terms
interest rates are far lower in leading industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
The success in lowering inflation rate underlined the
importance of the current monetary policy, particularly in light
of the ongoing economic slowdown and rise in joblessness, the
bank's statement said.

JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The growing importance of
Asia to South Africa, despite the current financial setback in
the region, was reaffirmed at a week-long meeting of heads of

<P>
The heads of mission, based in 13 countries and accredited to

JOHANNESBURG, January 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's arms
manufacturer Denel has exported remotely piloted aircraft to
Algeria government troops, South African Press Association
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the 20-million Rand (four million U.S. Dollars)
arms deal with Algeria, Denel said earlier that the remotely
piloted aircraft was a non-lethal reconnaissance drone.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed the Seeker, the surveillance device provided target
location and artillery fire support at distances of up to 200 km
from base, Denel said.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has been confronted with criticism of South
Africa's weapon sales guidelines, the Cease-fire Campaign.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the ongoing civil war in Algeria had
claimed tens of thousands of lives, saying that there could be no
doubt the intended targets of the Algerian army were Islamites.

The organization urged South Africa's Conventional Arms
Control Committee to reconsider its approval of the contract.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar authorities
have ordered people who have set up fishing camps at prohibited

The newspaper quoted Khamis as saying that the fishing camps
have been banned in a number of spots for health and security
reasons. The official mentioned the prohibited areas as Kwale,
Tungume, Chukwani Mtoni and Mazizini.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the establishment of such fishing camps may
lead to the outbreak of cholera and illicit fishing using
explosives in Zanzibar, an archipelago consisted of two big

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Supreme Court Annuls Amended Press Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Supreme Court of
Justice late Monday evening declared to "provoke the temporary
Press and Publication Law", which was established last May to
crack down on tabloids.
</P>
<P>
The temporary press law was "unconstitutional" and therefore
the court decided to stop its enforcement, according to the
decision by the 10-member court headed by Acting Chief of the
Supreme Court Abdallah Addad.
</P>
<P>
The amendments to the 1993 Press and Publication Law were
introduced by the government as a temporary law on May 17 when the
Parliament was not in session.
</P>
<P>
Such a move is only allowed in a state of urgency, according to
Jordan's constitution. But a state of urgency was not "detected"
last May, the court decision said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir Mutawi told
reporters late Monday evening that Jordan, as a democratic
country, respected the judicial authority's decisions.
</P>
<P>
"We are a democratic country. We respect the law and we
respect whatever is decided by our courts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The amendments to the Press and Publications Law are now
before our new Parliament and we hope that they will be debated in
the very near future and we shall abide by everything that is
decided by the Parliament," he added.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration erupted in Amman and a number of professional
association presidents resigned in May in protest against the
amended law.
</P>
<P>
The controversial law has forced more than a dozen weekly
newspapers to close down as most of them failed to meet the high
financial obligations the amended law imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
The law asked each newspaper to raise its minimum capital from
about 21,000 U.S. dollars to about 424,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government introduced the amendments to crack down on
tabloids' "yellow reporting" -- slinging mud at the royal family,
leaking military secrets and intruding citizens' privacy.
</P>
<P>
The Press and Publication Law was unveiled in 1993, freeing
up the journalists at state-controlled press and allowing for
publication of independent newspapers and magazines, which then
published moderate criticism of the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The holiday atmosphere prevails
in Chinese cities in advance of the Spring Festival which begins
on January 28.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Decorated With Red Lanterns
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of red lanterns adorn major avenues in the
southwest China city of Chongqing, China's fourth municipality
established last spring.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 high-rises are decorated with laser and neon
lighting, or strings of smaller colored lights; 36 streets are
decorated with lanterns; and 34 streets feature illuminated
advertising billboards.
</P>
<P>
Lantern exhibitions can also be found in the city's urban
districts, with the downtown area featuring a tower of colored
lights reaching a height of 20 meters, the tallest of its kind in
China.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing Sends Holiday Greetings via Internet
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing city government will send New Year's greetings to
more than 200 domestic departments and friends in 20 countries and
regions via the Internet. The messages will thank recipients for
their efforts to promote cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
This will mark the first time that Nanjing, capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province, has employed Internet to convey New
Year's greeting to foreign organizations.
</P>
<P>
More Nanjing residents are also using Internet to convey
festival greetings to family members and friends abroad.
</P>

Guangzhou, Wuhan Citizens Travel Abroad
</P>
<P>
Traveling abroad for the week-long Spring Festival is the vogue
in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, and in Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou travel agencies report that the number of local
residents travelling to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand doubles
last year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Trips to Southeast Asia were completely booked 10 days
prior to the festival.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies have booked trips to Southeast Asia for some
1,000 Wuhan residents, double the number for 1996. Business people
account for the bulk of the travellers.
</P>
<P>
One private enterprise rewards more than 200 of its outstanding
employees with trips to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed to the cheaper price for the increasing
number of travelers abroad in these cities.
</P>
<P>
Hohhot Reports Brisk Flower Sales
</P>
<P>
Some 30 flower shops in Hohhot, capital city of northwest
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, report brisk sales in
advance of the Spring Festival. The new trend represents the fact
that people living in grasslands areas have altered their approach
to Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
People formerly presented cakes when visiting relatives or
friends. Now, however, they present gifts of fresh flowers.
</P>
<P>
People pay little attention to the fact that a flower basket
costs 350 yuan (42 US dollars) and a single flower costs around 14
yuan. High prices seem to make no difference on the most important
holiday for Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 varieties of fresh flowers were flown to Hohhot from
Guangzhou and Kunming, capital of south China's Yunnan Province.

<HEADLINE> Increased Minimum Income Tax Threshold Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Association of
Manufacturers (ZAM) and the Civil Servants Union of Zambia have
called on the government to increase the minimum income tax
threshold, Financial Mail reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies suggested that all workers earinging 200,000
Kwacha (about 143 U.S. Dollars) or less per month should be
exempted from paying tax and the tax base widened by including
the informal sector.
</P>
<P>
The current threshold is 50,000 Kwacha (about 36 Dollars) per
month while the informal sector has not been taxed despite the
huge potential existing therein.
</P>
<P>
The local weekly newspaper quoted Mark O'donnell and Japhet
Moonde, leaders of the two organizations, as saying in separate
interviews that the government should consider this in the 1998
budget to be presented this week.
</P>
<P>
Moonde urged the government to stop taxing those getting less
than or about 200,000 Kwacha to lessen their burden.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia most workers are informal ones and in 1996 only
469,000 workers worked in the formal sector of the country with a
nine-million population.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand ZAM has also asked the government to scrap
all import duties on imported raw materials if the manufacturing
sector is to help Zambia rejuvenate its industrial base and
increase job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt to Boost Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
planning to undertake several projects to boost national power
production in the next five years, Energy Minister Chrisanthus
Okemo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The projects would range from hydro-power to fossil fuels and
geothermal power generation, he said when opening a feasibility
study workshop for the proposed Mutonga-Grand Falls hydro
electric power project on the Tana River.
</P>
<P>
Among projects are a 30 megawatt rehabilitation gas-turbine
plant at Kipevu (implementation period 1998/99), a 75 megawatt
medium speed power plant at Kipevu (1999-2000) and a second 75
megawatt medium speed power plant also at Kipevu (1999-2000).
</P>
<P>
The government is also planning to construct a 64 megawatt
geothermal power plant at Olkaria North East by 2001-2002 and a
60 megawatt hydro power plant on river Sondu-Miriu by 2003-2004.
</P>
<P>
All the projects are part of the current 20-year Power
Development Plan to be implemented before 2002 and will produce
550.5 megawatts in total, said Okemo.
</P>
<P>
The whole plan projects the demand for energy at 5.3 billion
kilowatt hours, and at 912 megawatts for peak power in 2000-2001,
rising to 13.8 billion units and to 2,400 megawatts respectively
at the expiry of the plan period in 2016-2017.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that several high energy power transmission
lines will be constructed in the next five years to ensure
efficient delivery of electric power from these power stations to
various demand centers within the eastern African country.

<HEADLINE> Manila Denies Unhealthy Practices by Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine banking system is
"stronger and healthier" as compared to its counterparts in
Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea, and there is no unhealthy
practice by foreign banks in the country, a senior official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Philippine Press Secretary Hector
Villanueva stressed that contrary to rumors, foreign banks
operating in the country have not resorted to unhealthy practices
at the expense of local commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
"Rumors that tend to undermine the operations of local and
foreign banks are simply not true," Villanueva said.
</P>
<P>
But in a statement released by the Presidential Palace last
Saturday, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was cited as
telling President Fidel Ramos that "gossips about the supposed
shaky status of some big local banks have been largely due to the
unfair tactics adopted by some foreign banks wishing to attract
deposits from Filipino citizens into foreign banks."
</P>
<P>
He said the recent rumor that the country's biggest commercial
and universal bank was experiencing massive withdrawals is
"apparently triggered by the attempt of some foreign banks to win
over the depositors of this bank.
</P>
<P>
Singson's statement has aroused strong reactions from both
local and foreign banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said that the central bank is keeping a day-to-day
monitoring of the performance of all banks in the country,
including their actual resources, earnings and withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
He said the necessary safeguards have been instituted to
promptly check any wrong doing by any local or foreign bank in
order to protect the integrity of the banking system.

<HEADLINE> Speaker Appeals for Peace in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Philippine
Congress Jose de Venecia has appealed for calm, and sobriety among
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and government troops in
Maguindanao, Mindanao, the Southern Philippines, following renewed
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Speaker de Venecia, the front-running presidential candidate of
the ruling party, said the two sides should exercise "maximum
tolerance" and help ease the tension in the area in preparation
for the scheduled peace meetings on February 4-6.
</P>
<P>
"Let us prepare for peace, not war. If we have to work an extra
mile to achieve lasting peace in Mindanao, let's do it, said de
Venecia, who was the highest-ranking government officials allowed
by the MILF to enter its heavily-fortified Camp Abubakar in
Maguindanao last November.
</P>
<P>
"We should not allow provocation from either side to negate the
achievements already made by both parties in pursuit of peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaker de Venecia made the appeal here Tuesday after the MILF
rebels and government troops clashed anew in Buldon, Maguindanao,
on Monday night and last week. Their fighting left 10 rebels and a
government army officer dead in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The renewed hostilities have prompted the MILF and the
government troops to file formal protests with the peace panel as
both sides accused each other of violating a July 1997 ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Also, the MILF leaders threatened to pull out of the peace
negotiations if government troops refuse to withdraw from areas
near Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
But Speaker de Venecia asked the rebels not to boycott the
scheduled peace meetings and leave it to the negotiating panel to
discuss the formal protests lodged by both sides.

<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China's financial and economic situation remains
stable, despite the fact that various other countries have been
adversely affected by the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Li, speaking at a ceremony on the eve of Spring Festival, said
that China recorded new achievements in reform and opening, as
well as in various other endeavors, during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li, a member of the standing committee of the Political Bureau
of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed
to the fact that the national economy witnessed steady and rapid
growth accompanied by a low inflation rate, with major economic
indices maintaining promising development trends.
</P>

He also pointed to successive good harvests, and noted that the
country has recorded major progress in efforts to reform state
enterprises, as well as in economic restructuring, the
construction of key projects and expanding foreign economic and
technological exchanges.

<P>
The premier said China will continue to introduce basic changes
to its economic system and patterns of economic growth, while at
the same time strengthening agriculture as the foundation of the
national economy and accelerating various reforms to the state
enterprise system.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Improve Esophagus Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese doctors have greatly
increased the success rate of replacing the morbid esophagus with a
segment of colon, doctors in a hospital in Central China's Hubei
Province said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The complication rate of the 268 patients of morbid esophagus
treated by the No. 1 Hospital affiliated to Hubei Medical
University is 21.26 percent and the mortality rate stands at 2.23
percent. Internationally, the rates are 43.73 percent and 11.41
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Although doctors usually choose part of the stomach to
substitute the morbid esophagus, experts regard the colon as a
better substitute for medical reasons. However, the complicated
operation and high complication rate impede doctors'
continuous endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Hubei's medical workers have improved the operation technique
to prevent the partly excised colon from being necrotic.

establish a center for the experts who will learn about dolphin
behaviors under strict medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
The project has won support from the Commission for Natural
Resources in Zanzibar.
</P>

CANBERRA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Petr Korda came from behind to
down Jonas Bjorkman to enter the Australian Open semi-finals held
in Melbourne on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Czech veteran beat the Swedish fourth seed 3-6, 5-7, 6-3,
6-4, 6-2 in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, women's second seed Lindsay Davenport also
had to come back to beat brash teenager Venus Williams in
all-American battle for a semi-final spot.
</P>
<P>
Korda and Bjorkman also played in the quarter-finals of the US
Open in New York last September. Korda pulled out in the third set
because of sickness.
</P>
<P>
His semi-final could also be a US Open repeat as the opponent
will be world number one Pete Sampras or the unseeded Slovak,
Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player beat Sampras in the fourth round and caught a
bad cold going into a cold television studio interview after the
victory. He said he regretted ever starting the New York match
against Bjorkman.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's victory over rising teenager Venus Williams got her
into only her second Grand Slam semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
The American came back for a 1-6, 7-5, 6-3 after Williams
played what she called "practically perfect" tennis in the first
set.
</P>
<P>
Williams tore apart the Davenport serve in the first set, but
the 21-year-old Davenport battled back in the second after being
0-3 down at one point in the 100 minute match.
</P>
<P>
American defending champion Sampras was to play Kucera and
Conchita Martinez of Spain to meet Sandrine Testud of France in
quarter-finals later Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng expressed hope
today that Taiwan authorities will proffer a timely response to
mainland appeals for cross-Straits talks under the one China
principle.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a reception to celebrate the Spring Festival, Li, a
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said realizing
the reunification of China and national invigoration is the common
desire of the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"We will, as always, try to develop cross-Straits extensive
cooperation and exchanges in accordance with the principle of
"peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems," said Li.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sincere hope that Taiwan authorities will adopt
concrete measures to achieve the early resumption of direct
cross-Straits postal, commercial and transportation links, and
will respond quickly to appeals for talks under the one China
principle.
</P>
<P>
The leader referred to the international situation by noting
that peace and development remain as the themes in contemporary
times.
</P>
<P>
Relations between major countries are being adjusted, the
overall strength of developing countries as a whole is increasing,
international economic ties are becoming increasingly closer, and
progress in science and technology is being made day by day.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan to Increase Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has been trying to
increase oil production to meet the domestic needs and reduce the
import of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics available, the present oil
production can meet only one sixth of the country's requirement
and the rest is met through import.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Pakistan's local oil production was 70,000
barrels per day, but now it has dropped to 50,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in the production is due to natural depletion of
oil fields in the northern region of the country, according to
official sources from the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral
Development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lack of capital resources and non-economic hurdles
especially in tribal areas of the southwestern province of
Baluchistan, which comprises most of sedimentary area, have
resulted in low exploration activities.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has a considerably large sedimentary basin. In the
country, wells have been drilled on an average of 5.1 wells per
10,000 square kilometers, and well's successful strike ratio
stands at 1:3 as compared to 1:10 elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Both the density and the success rate show that Pakistan has
significant untapped potential for oil and gas. However, the South
Asian country drilled only 450 wells in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1961 for petroleum exploration and development,
the Oil and Gas Development Corporation of Pakistan is the largest
explorer and producer of indigenous oil. But its output, which is
now about 21,000 barrels per day, has been declining because no
new wells have been drilled.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the necessity to improve local oil production, the
Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been
trying to increase oil exploration activities in the country,
which is facing a trade deficit of 3.3 billion U.S. dollars and
has planned to reduce it by about one billion dollars in the
current fiscal year starting from July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced a new petroleum policy last
October which gives much more incentives than before to foreign
companies already engaged or interested in oil exploration in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The country's private sector has also been encouraged to invest
in this field.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, relevant laws have been amended by the
government to provide legal protection to investors, which is
aimed at creating confidence among potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Another major step taken by the government is to lay more
emphasis on the off-shore exploration by extending the sea limits
for exploration purpose from 200 kilometers to 2,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government has decided to launch extensive oil
and gas exploration in Baluchistan.

<P>
NANJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province
now ranks second in the country in export volume, following
Guangdong province in south China.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the province, for the first time,
exported more than 15.2 billion US dollars worth of products in
1997, up 16 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The province's import and export volume was valued at 23.87
billion US dollars last year, up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu witnessed a 30-percent increase in export volume in the
past six years. Its position was raised to the third in 1996 from
the fifth in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The local government attributed the achievement to the
supporting policies adopted for export firms. So far, the province
has had more than 500 foreign trading firms and 700 manufacturing
firms with rights to export directly.
</P>
<P>
The stable prices and the dropping of interest rates in China
also provide an easy environment for the firms, said local
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The foreign-funded firms had the lions' share in the
export. The province's state-owned firms completed 10.3 percent of
the 1997 total export while the foreign-funded ones contributed 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
Industrial products now account for 92 percent of the total
export of the province.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Supreme Head of
State Tuanku Ja'afar Tuesday called for further enhancing goodwill
and unity among the various races in the country.
</P>
<P>
Extending Chinese New Year greetings to the Chinese community
in the country, Tuanku Ja'afar hoped that the celebrations of the
Chinese New Year which begins Wednesday, to be followed a few days
later by Muslims' Aidil Fitri (Festival of Fast-breaking), would
further enhance goodwill and unity among the various races.
</P>
<P>
It is vital to further promote unity and solidarity as racial
harmony is the nation's strength especially during the current
economic crisis, the Malaysian King said in his Chinese New Year
message.
</P>
<P>
He said the double celebrations served as an excellent time for
the various races to forge closer ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The King also called on the people to exercise tolerance and
patience during the economic crisis facing the country.
</P>
<P>
"They should also cooperate and support the government to
restore the economic situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has been seriously affected by the regional financial
crisis since July last year which resulted in the collapse of the
country's currency and stock market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad also
wished the Chinese community in the country Happy Chinese New Year
in his separate greeting message.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the government had initiated measures to
revive the nation's economy but it would take some time to
materialize and require the cooperation of the people especially
the business community.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do anything that could cause the country to suffer
losses just to reap instant benefits for ourselves, economic
recovery will be achieved in a short period of time," he said,
adding that everyone would gain from the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir expressed his confidence that with the people's full
cooperation and support for the government and their undivided
loyalty to the country, the economic crisis could be overcome.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that although the country was facing economic
problems, the Chinese community could still enjoy the Chinese New
Year celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"This year's celebrations may not be as lavish as the previous
years but the spirit of the auspicious occasion is still very much
alive," he said.

<HEADLINE> Year of Tiger, Year of Testing for Singaporeans: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said on the Chinese Lunar New Year's eve on Tuesday that
the year of Tiger will be a testing year for Singaporeans and
called on them to take this turbulence in their stride.
</P>
<P>
In his message to mark the Chinese New Year and Hari Raya
Aidilfitri, the Festival of Fast-Breaking, the prime minister
noted that the regional financial crisis had hit Singapore hard,
as the stock market was down; businessmen were apprehensive; fewer
tourists were arriving in Singapore, and exports to the region
were slowing down.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that the financial sector will see little
growth in the new year because few projects will seek financing,
little investment money will flow from the developed countries
into Southeast Asia, and there will be less funds to manage out of
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
In the country's key manufacturing sector, investment
commitments will be affected, because some Multi-National
Corporations (MNCs) are re-evaluating planned capital investments,
and may defer or stretch out the projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singaporeans, he said, are already feeling the effects, as
their bonuses will be smaller, more workers will be retrenched and
finding new jobs will be more difficult for them. The government
revenues, on the other hand, will be stagnant, which means smaller
budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Given the testing year ahead, the prime minister called on the
fellow Singaporeans, "We must take this turbulence in our stride"
and "we must rise to the challenge together". "This is a somber
message for all Singaporeans," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the year of Tiger, the government will focus
its spending on items which underpin Singapore's long-term
competitiveness and security, namely, education, economic
infrastructure, and defense, and will trim or defer less essential
projects.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said Singaporeans will have to keep costs of doing
business down and will have to increase their productivity and
reduce business costs.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also emphasized the importance of continued
training of the workers, as training gives the workers here the
best chance of staying competitive and so keep their jobs, or find
new ones should they be retrenched.
</P>
<P>
Noting that in the lunar calendar, the Tiger personality is
brave, active and enthusiastic, Goh said, "these qualities will
serve us well as we tackle the region's economic crisis and the
ensuing economic and social difficulties."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Rehabilitate Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Tuesday announced a comprehensive program to rehabilitate its
banking system aimed at restoring the confidence of depositors and
creditors and re-establishing the soundness of the system.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, attended by several cabinet ministers and
representatives from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said, "from today the government
will stand behind the commercial banks of the country and
guarantee that obligations to depositors and creditors will be
met."
</P>
<P>
Should any bank encounter difficulty in making payment, he
said, Bank Indonesia, the central bank, acting on behalf of the
government, will immediately step in to make sure that these
payment can be made.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Governor of Bank Indonesia Sudradjat Djiwandono said
the government is guaranteeing that the claims of depositors and
creditors of locally incorporated banks, both rupiah and foreign
currency, will be met.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that most depositors and creditors will wish to
keep their funds in the Indonesian banks by rolling over maturing
claims, while they will receive payment if they do choose to
withdraw those funds," Sudradjat stressed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the waves of economic
difficulties have been taking a heavy toll on the baking system in
Indonesia. And as this has occurred, confidence in Indonesia's
banks has begun to wane. The public has been withdrawing their
deposits from the banking system, reducing the amounts that banks
can lend to corporations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, foreign banks have become increasingly
reluctant to accept Indonesia letters of credit, making it
difficult to the country to obtain vital imports. Even domestic
banks have become reluctant to lend each other.
</P>
<P>
Sudradjat disclosed that Bank Indonesia, in consultation with
the IMF and the World Bank, is developing a comprehensive set of
prudential requirements of a banking system operating with the
guarantee.
</P>
<P>
To implement the program, Finance Minister Mar'ie also
announced the establishment of a new government institution, the
Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (IBRA).
</P>
<P>
The IBRA will be charged with the task of bringing commercial
banks back to financial health, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Whenever Bank Indonesia discovers that a commercial bank is in
financial distress, it will be transferred to the umbrella of the
INRA. The IBRA will then ask the bank's shareholders to prepare
and implement an immediate rehabilitation plan.
</P>
<P>
"If they are not in a position to do so, then IBRA will take
over the task itself, either by restructuring the bank's
operations and finances, or by merging it with other banks," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
In this way, Mar'ie held that bank by bank, IBRA will build
stronger, healthier and more competitive banking system.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks' Situation to Improve in 4th Quarter: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The first six months of 1998
will be difficult for all Thai banks because of rising
non-performing loans, according to Bangkok Bank ltd (BBL)
Executive Chairman Chatri Sophonpanich.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview on Monday with the Nation newspaper
that he believed "the situation will be better in the fourth
quarter" of this year.
</P>
<P>
He added that whether the banks can survive would depend on
their capital fund level.
</P>
<P>
Chatri said that BBL, Thailand's largest commercial bank, has
set aside provisions of 58 billion baht (1.05 billion US dollars)
against non-performing loans, 40 billion baht (727 million
dollars) more than it needed.
</P>
<P>
BBL estimated non-performing loans accounted for around 18-19
percent of its total credit as of last month. Its total credit was
1,010 billion baht last year (21.36 billion dollars at the
exchange rate of the last day of last year).
</P>
<P>
Chatri revealed that his bank will raise its foreign
sharefolding limit from 25 percent to between 40 and 45 percent as
it must seek overseas investors to participate in recapitalization
in line with the government's request for all banks to raise fresh
capital in order to create additional liquidity in the
cash-strapped economy.
</P>
<P>
He said, "we will definitely raise new capital shortly, of
which the first phase will be 20-25 billion baht (363.7 million to
454.5 million dollars) from an estimated total of 30-50 billion
(545.4 million to 909 million dollars). But there is no money at
home now, and we will have to take in foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
Chatri's statement ended speculation in the financial market
about the intention of the country's largest bank to deal with the
country's gravest financial and economic crisis since World War
II.
</P>
<P>
He said the capital increase will make the bank "more
comfortable" and able to increase credit extension to customers
during the tight liquidity environment.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Formulates New Economic Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian province,
the native home of many overseas Chinese, has formulated a new
plan to reach an economic growth rate of over 11 percent within
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will reach 370 billion
yuan (44.58 billion US dollars) by the year 2000, according to
Governor He Guoqiang.
</P>
<P>
The province currently ranks 12th in the nation in terms of
overall economic strength, and holds a seventh place ranking for
per capita GDP.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong
Kong will provide more opportunities for Fujian to cooperate with
both the new administrative region and Taiwan. New opportunities
for cooperation will be conducive to promoting an economic upsurge.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will fulfill the plan by accelerating the development of
pillar industries, including the high-tech, petrochemical,
electronics, building materials and forestry sectors.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for the value-added output of related sectors
to contribute 40 percent to the province's 2000 GDP.
</P>
<P>
Governor He said that the opening policy is a key driving force
for economic development, and he noted that the province will open
still wider to the outside world. Priority will be placed on
drawing foreign investment for the agriculture, basic industry and
high-tech sectors, as well as various other pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Fujian will extend the greatest possible effort to become a
national window for attracting foreign investment, the provincial
governor said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Attracts 5.3 Billion US Dollar Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore attracted a total
of 8.5 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.3 billion US dollars) in
new investments last year, up some five percent, local newspapers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the investment figures, the government Economic
Development Board (EDB) said it was cautiously optimistic about
1998. But it warned that some investments could be affected if
multinational corporations re-evaluate their projects here and
defer their commitments.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, EDB Chief Philip Yeo said that the
full impact of the financial crisis on investments would only be
known by the second half of this year, when companies had
recalculated their figures.
</P>
<P>
He was also quoted as saying that as some of the international
banks were "pulling back", the EDB would try to secure the support
of local banks and "if necessary, the EDB would share the risk in
providing the working capital over the short term, where the banks
fell short".
</P>
<P>
He said he was holding talks with 33 banks to persuade them to
continue providing funds for the working capital needs of
promising local enterprises facing a credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said local companies were the largest investors last
year, accounting for some 30 percent of the total commitments,
while the largest foreign investor was the United States, followed
by Japan and European countries.
</P>
<P>
As for the EDB's target of attracting ten billion dollars worth
of new investments by 2000, the EDB leader said that given the
current scenario, it was likely to be delayed by two to three
years.
</P>
<P>
Of the total new investments attracted last year, 45 percent
went to the electronics sector, 35 percent for the chemicals
industry, 16 percent for the engineering sector, while the
remaining four percent for general industries.

<P>
ROME, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The economic gap between northern
and southern Italy will widen in 1998, the Svimez Research
Institute said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This year, the gross domestic product in the less developed
south is predicted to grow by 1.6 percent, while the rest of Italy
will increase 2.4 percent, the institute said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth was one percent in the south in 1997, when
other places in the country grew by 1.2 percent. At the same time,
consumer spending was up 0.9 percent in the south, but one percent
in the central and northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
The institute said lower inflation and interest rates,
continuous improvement of state accounts and the rise of exports
will help the economic growth in the central and northern regions
in Italy in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the south fell 0.1 percent last year, while the
other parts of Italy remained stable, the research institute
said.

<P>
The region has also adopted policies to make balance between
water and soil. It has made it clear that no wasteland can
be developed where there is no water sources, and that investors
should plant trees on one-tenth of the reclaimed land in three
years, said an official with the regional land administration.
</P>
<P>
Jiashi and Cele counties in southern Xinjiang have recovered
some farmland eroded by sand, and they were awarded by the UN
Environment Program for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
And in the Taklamakan Desert, known as the "sea of death" in
the Tarim Basin, scientists and oil workers have succeeded in
opening up 40 ha of farmland with lush greenery.
</P>
<P>
Wasteland-turned farmland has made it possible for Xinjiang to
become the country's largest cotton producer and a major grain
production base. Statistics show that the 400,000 ha of reclaimed
farmland provide 500,000 tons of cotton annually, accounting for
about one-fifth of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the reclaimed farmland lies in the watershed
of the Tarim River, which runs more than 2,000 km in the region.
Now, the once denudated diversified-leaved poplar trees have
regained vitality, the pace of desertification has slowed down,
and wild camels, swans and black storks have come back to the
river valleys.

<HEADLINE> Financial Crisis Dampens New Year Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese new year celebrations,
once lavish and full of enjoyment, are lackluster this year due to
the on-going financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the run-up to the festive holidays, many Chinese-Thais
carefully work out their budgets, canceling faraway trips and
scaling down celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Shops which were once crowded with Chinese-Thais are now filled
with close-fisted customers bargaining for delicacies at knowdown
prices.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's popular China town appears quiet when in previous
years it heaved with crowds. Many vendors seem bored while waiting
for customers.
</P>
<P>
As usual, celebrations are planned on the eve of the Chinese
new year on January 27, but this year's festivities will not be as
splendid as before.
</P>
<P>
"We celebrate the new year with less money but it does not mean
we are in a gloomy mood," said a businessman who runs a shop in
China town.
</P>
<P>
Due to their meager budgets, many Chinese-Thais prefer to stay
at home during the holidays, unlike the past when they usually
traveled faraway with their families.
</P>
<P>
"It is better to take a rest at home when we lack money in our
pockets," said a watch owner Vasana.
</P>
<P>
Laddawal Horboonchin, 48, owner of a Chinese new year
decorations shop, said she used to travel abroad twice a year in
the past, but this year she would only travel to Chiang Mai,
northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"It is a small trip compared with those I had in the past," she
said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year the shop was so crowded that we did not have time to
talk, but it's quiet this year," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said this year her income has dropped to half that of last
year. Many items are still in store and some of her big customers,
such as Robinson department stores have canceled orders.
</P>
<P>
Several dozen customers were wandering around in the shop. Some
were carefully selecting commodities. Several people were just
"window-shopping" outside.
</P>
<P>
A customer said he was buying smaller and less decorations
"because of the sluggish economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been hard hit by a financial crisis since last
Summer when the government floated baht's exchange rate with the
dollar. The Chinese-Thai communities were among those that bore
the brunt of the crisis.

CHANGSHA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The introduction of loans from
foreign governments has added impetus to improved infrastructure
development, industrial technology, and the urban environment in
central-south China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has used over one billion US dollars in government loans
from 13 countries, including Canada, Japan, Austria and the

</P>
<P>
Loans totalling 580 million US dollars were used to build five
power plants with a total installed capacity of over two million
kw. The power stations generate more than 10 billion kwh of
electricity annually and have greatly eased local power shortages.
</P>
<P>
Total loans of 147 million US dollars have been allocated for

<HEADLINE> Oases Emerging Around Deserts in Xinjiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The northwesternmost region of
China was no more than a great tract of barren land when Sven
Hedin, a Swedish explorer, was touring it early this century.
</P>
<P>
But now, things are another story. Many man-made oases have
appeared around the deserts in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region of China.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang covers an area of 1.6 million square kilometers,
approximately half of which is deserts. At the beginning of the
century, Xinjiang was dotted with 500 small oases with a total
area of seven million hectares.
</P>
<P>
During the mid-century, local farmers launched a campaign to
reclaim wasteland to grow crops.
</P>
<P>
However, this random reclamation led to disastrous results, as
it greatly harmed the ecological system. Wind and sand came pretty
often, encroaching upon vast tracts of land.
</P>
<P>
Another round of wasteland reclamation started in the region at
the beginning of the 1990s, when the central government started to
shift its economic development strategy to the central and western
parts of the country. The resources-rich region was therefore put
high on the agenda as a major agricultural base.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, Xinjiang has spent a huge amount of
money on the control of sand. Windbreak shelters have been built
on 700,000 hectares of barren land around the deserts, thus creating
400,000 hectares of farmland.

NEW YORK, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan had the most
votes with 1,028,235 for a starting berth on the East team guard
in the 48th NBA All-Star Game slated for February 8 here.
</P>
<P>
This was the 12th All-Star selection for the Chicago
supterstar, who was joined in the East backcourt by Orlando's
Anfernee Hardaway, who underwent knee surgery in December and is
doubtful for the game.
</P>
<P>
Dikembe Mutombo of Atlanta edged injured New York Patrick Ewing
for a starting spot on the East team center.
</P>
<P>
The African-born center received 476,432 votes compared to
441,347 for Ewing in the tighest race, likely meaning an end to a
10-year streak of All-Star berths for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
Detroit's Grant Hill and Cleveland's Shawn Kemp will start at
forwards.
</P>
<P>
Indiana coach Larry Bird, Jordan's teammate on the 1992
Barcelona Olympics "Dream Team" gold medalists, will guide the
East. Seattle coach George Karl will coach the West team.
</P>
<P>
Bird has said he might not show up to coach the All-Stars
because he has other plans. Jordan said he would not mind.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant, who is not even a starter
for his team, will become the youngest starter in All-Star history
at 19 years and five months old, one year younger than former
mark-holder Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Playing behind Eddie Jones and Nick Van Exel, Bryant leads all
NBA reserves with 17.3 points per game. He was second in votes to
Seattle's Gary Payton among Western Conference backcourt players.
</P>
<P>
Center Shaquille O'Neal, who received 565,184 votes, is the

points and 11.4 rebounds but missed 21 games this season with an
abdominal strain.
</P>
<P>
Utah's Karl Malone and Minnesota's Kevin Garnett will start at
forwards for the West.
</P>
<P>
This was 11th All-Star selection for Malone, sixth for Kemp and
O'Neal, fifth for Mutombo and Payton, fourth for Hill and
Hardaway, second for Garnett and first for Bryant.
</P>
<P>
The 29 NBA coaches will vote for the remaining seven members of

<HEADLINE> OPEC Ministers Meet to Handle Oil Price Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Some OPEC ministers met here
Monday at an emergency session to seek ways of curbing the plunge
of crude oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC said Monday it was getting 13.56 U.S. dollars per barrel
for its crude Friday, compared with 18.81 dollars in November and
16.84 dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
The factors for the price fall include quota-busting production
of some OPEC members, the drop of demand in Asia resulting from
the economic crisis and in European market due to the increase of
oil stocks and unusual warm winter, and Iraq's resumption of oil
export.
</P>
<P>
The group meeting Monday includes the ministers from Iran,
Kuwait and Nigeria, who along with the secretary-general, make up
a committee that monitors OPEC's compliance with its agreed
production levels.
</P>
<P>
The committee can make recommendations but lacks the power to
decide on any production cuts.

<HEADLINE> Deep Waterway Project Begins Construction in Yangtze River Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China officially begins the
waterway project at the estuary of the Yangtze River Monday in a
bid to turn Shanghai into an international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
The project, co-launched by the Ministry of Communications, the
Shanghai Municipality and Jiangsu Province, aims to provide a
12.5-meter deep channel for Shanghai and other cities along the
Yangtze River, "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
"With such a waterway, big container ships can enter the
estuary and go far into Nanjing," Zhang Hualin, General manager of
the Yangtze Estuary Waterway Construction Co. Ltd, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The company is set up to oversee the project and manage the
waterway. The project is expected to cost 15.5 billion yuan and
take 10 years to complete.
</P>
<P>
The first phase will spend 3.27 billion yuan, which will come
from the ministry, Shanghai and Jiangsu. When completed in the
year 2000, the waterway will be 8.5 meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The current channel is only seven meters deep and unable to
accommodate 50,000-tonnage container ships. The estuary allows
only 10,000-tonnage ships fully loaded at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Experts said ships carrying 3,000 to 4,000 TEUs need a
12.5-meter-deep channel. So the project is considered important
to the development of the Yangtze River Delta, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
Currently, containers, grain and ores are first unloaded at
Beilun Port in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, and then are transported
into Shanghai, and to the cities in Jiangsu by smaller ships.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has 50 shipping companies and 100 container routes
to Europe, America and other East Asian countries. And there are
110 berths of 10,000 tonnages along the Yangtze section from
Nanjing to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"But the shallow waterway is an obstacle to the port
development," Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
China now has three coastal economic zones around the Bohai
Bay, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. The
zones, except the Yangtze River Delta, have deep-water ports.
</P>
<P>
Embankments will be built along the waterway and the project
will not change the ecology, Zhang said.

<P>
Songjiang county received national recognition as a clean
county in 1997, with Fengxian and Nanhui counties basically
reaching national standards.
</P>

Some 54 towns and townships joined 161 villages in fulfilling
sanitary standards set by the municipal government, with said
figures representing 26 percent and 5.5 percent of the respective
totals, according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The local government allocated 349 million yuan (42 million US
dollars) for related projects during 1997, a four-fold increase on
the previous year. The funds went for the construction of trash
receptacles, sewage disposal systems and the plantation of flower
gardens in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Rural authorities also provided training classes to improve the
hygiene level of farmers, and a number of villages formed
sanitation teams.
</P>
<P>
An additional 130 villages are expected to join the municipal
list of clean villages in 1998.

<P>
CHANGSHA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- A project in Xiangxi in
western Hunan province, central China, supported by the United
Nations World Food Program (WFP), has been recently completed.
</P>
<P>
The Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture is one of
China's poorest areas. It has been suffering from grain shortages
for many years.
</P>
<P>
The project, which lasted six years, has increased the local
per-capita grain output by 500 kilograms and the per-capita income
from 250 yuan in 1991 to 950 yuan last year, according to an
official of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Wiangxi project is one of the 57 grain-aid projects
started by the WFP since 1979 to help the poor Chinese to increase
their grain output.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has by now offered 750 million U.S. dollars worth of
grain to 20 million poor Chinese in 81 counties, according to
Maurizio Gnocchia, an official of the WFP.
</P>
<P>
A survey in 16 WFP project areas shows that the grain output in
the areas has increased by 150 percent and over 80 percent of
local people have shaken off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The projects have also brought about great improvements of the
local environment, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Gnocchia said that it is promising to cooperate with the
Chinese government in helping more poor people improve their
living conditions.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Recalls 207 Envoys to Cut Cost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
recall 207 diplomats and 1,000 overseas employees this year as
part of its austerity program to overcome the current financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to the Manila Times, the Department of Foreign
Affairs made the announcement Monday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats will be coming home by the end of March, and the
other employees, who make up 40 percent of the total number of the
country's foreign-based staff, would be returning to the home
office within the year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon as explaining
that the cutback in the number of diplomats and employees was all
part of the department's austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot pay them unless you reduce the number of people who
are paid in dollars. Where will I get the money?" he said.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos issued a directive earlier this month,
ordering a 25-percent budget cut this year to enable the
government to cope with the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said that he has asked the president to exempt his
department from the mandatory cost-reduction scheme.
</P>
<P>
But he said that even if the department would be exempted from
the mandatory cutback, it will still need about 800 million pesos
(20 million U.S. dollars) to finance its operations as the
original budget for the department is inadequate.

<HEADLINE> IMF Demand for Budget Surplus Impossible: Thai PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will not be able to
meet the demand by the IMF for a budget surplus equivalent to one
percent of gross domestic product, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
has said.
</P>
<P>
A budget surplus for the year to September is a major condition
set by the International Monetary Fund for a rescue package
approved last August to salvage the Thai economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the IMF demand, Thailand should have a budget surplus of
about 69 billion baht (1.3 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Chuan as saying that the Thai
government finds it impossible to achieve the target as a revenue
shortfall of more than 100 billion baht (1.85 billion dollars) is
expected.
</P>
<P>
Chuan declined to disclose whether IMF officials had agreed to
ease the requirement in talks last week with Thai Finance Minister
Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda during his visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The IMF repeatedly stressed the need for Thailand to adhere to
the condition. So far no relaxation of the tough austerity
condition has been announced.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has already slashed about 182 billion baht (3.4
billion dollars) from its budget but remains about 120 billion
baht (2.2 billion dollars) short of the target, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said Thailand needs a few more weeks to come up with
measures to raise additional revenue for the government.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sends Envoy to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
decided on Monday to send his Deputy Foreign Minister, Victor
Posuvalyuk, as his envoy to Iraq, in attempt to negotiate an end
to Iraq's standoff with United Nations weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during Yeltsin's meeting with Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is "worried by the development of the situation around
Iraq," Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Russia's stance on a political solution to
Iraq's standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors had not changed, and
noted that any use of force should be approved by the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Posuvalyuk, who has been busily involved in shuttle diplomacy
over the past four years, was scheduled to leave for Iraq later on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have not ruled out the use of
force against Iraq since Baghdad ousted American weapons
inspectors three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
This far, two U.S. and one British aircraft carriers have been
sent to the Gulf, further intensifying the situation in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long-standing ties with Iraq and consistently
opposed the use of force against the Arab nation.
</P>
<P>
It is also an easing of the United Nations economic sanctions
against Iraq imposed in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children In SOS Village Celebrate Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- An SOS village in the city of
Yantai in east China's Shandong Province held a little festive
get-together to celebrate the Spring Festival which falls on
Tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
SOS villages have been set up in China to provide a home for
orphaned children. This one has 15 young women who serve as
mothers, living with the children in a family to care for them and
share daily events.
</P>
<P>
According to the village head, Zhu Mingji, the orphans do not
feel lonely here because they receive special and tender care from
these women.
</P>
<P>
Jia Jing, a nine-year-old, contributed a performance of Chinese
traditional music for the party, for which he was awarded with the
applause of the 150 children who were listening attentively.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and five orphans from 48 counties in five provinces
across the country have been brought up in Yantai's SOS Children's
village since it was founded more than 10 years ago. Of these, 50
have moved away from the village, some even going on to become
university students, and others finding jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Li Hua, has gone as far as Cambridge University
for his studies.
</P>
<P>
Another, Yu Lan said, "The SOS Children's village is my home
forever. I love it and the love my mother gives to me is
invaluable." She is now a student in the music department of
Yantai Teachers College, so she contributed a performance. Her
"mother", Sun Aili, who is one of ten model citizens in Yantai,
was moved to tears by Yu Lan's lovely singing.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 27 (Xinhua) -- China has established an
anti-dumping and anti-subsidy office under the State Economic and
Trade Commission(SETC) in a bid to perfect its anti dumping
campaign, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The office, in conjunction with related ministries, is
responsible for investigating damages incurred by alleged
dumping. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation(Moftec) and the General Administration of Customs(GAC)
are trying to determine the extent of alleged dumping activities.
</P>
<P>
Moftec and SETC, based on the investigations' results, will
make primary and final recommendations in accordance with related
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the office is in response to China's
increasing need to fight foreign dumping, which has become
inevitable with the country's opening up to the outside world, the
English-language newspaper points out.
</P>
<P>
On October 16, 1997, nine Chinese newsprint producers submitted
complaints to Moftec on newsprint exporters from the United
States, Canada and the Republic of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
China's first anti-dumping cases, involving newsprint, were
officially initiated on December 10.
</P>
<P>
SETC began its initiative on January 15, issuing anti-dumping
investigation questionnaires to Chinese newsprint producers.
</P>
<P>
Any party related with the anti-dumping case--including
producers of similar products and domestic newsprint
importers--can contact the newly established office for
information, the Daily quoted a SETC release.

<HEADLINE> American Businessmen Press ASEAN to Cut Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) should not use as an excuse the current
crisis to renege on its commitments to bring down tariffs to zero
percent from five percent before 2003, said the head of an
American delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine newspaper Malaya Tuesday quoted Ernest Bower,
president of the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, as warning that
ASEAN's delay in meeting the deadline will curtail investment
inflow to the region.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan for an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) before 2003,
members of the group will cut gradually tariff from five percent
to zero by that time.
</P>
<P>
Bower, who is leading a 15-member mission on a week-long visit
to the Philippines, said here Monday that Americans continue to be
bullish about the region and they want the AFTA in place.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council still sees ASEAN as an
important market given its potential, Bower said, tariff reduction
is crucial for ASEAN in attracting new investments into its member
countries.
</P>
<P>
"If you delay, it will only be for short-term, narrow
interests. If you delay, dollar will not fall and (ASEAN) will
fall behind. If you delay, you will not create new investments,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Bower said that the council has received reports that some
ASEAN countries are removing an average of 20 to 30 tariff lines
from the inclusion list of products for reduction to the temporary
exclusion list.
</P>
<P>
Bower's delegation is composed of delegates from American
multi-nationals General Motors, For Motors, Federal Express, and
United Parcel Services as part of an ASEAN tour seeking to monitor
the progress of the AFTA.

<HEADLINE> "Blue Seal" Population Up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 27 (Xinhua) -- The "blue seal" population in
Shanghai had reached 1,523 people in 500 families by the end of
1997, as a result of a local policy to attract trained personnel
from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government decided in 1994 that
non-Shanghai natives can apply for "blue seal" residence and
years later they can apply for permanent residence, if they have a
certain amount of investment in Shanghai's Pudong New Area and
bought apartments with a floor space of over 100 sq. m. or have
worked in Shanghai for over three years.
</P>
<P>
The "blue seal" residents can enjoy equal treatment as
the Shanghai natives do in sending children to kindergartens
and schools.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, 222 families coming from other provinces were
granted with "blue seal" residence.
</P>
<P>
To attract more trained personnel, a "blue seal company" has
been set up in Pudong in a bid to provide related services for
"blue seal" residents.
</P>
<P>
Local economists said that China's household registration
system has, to some extent, fettered the flow of trained
personnel, and Shanghai's "blue seal" policy will continue to help
the city attract more trained personnel and play an active role
in promoting the local economy.

<HEADLINE> US Concerned About Militarization of Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States State
Department expressed today its concern about the increasing
militarization of Cyprus on both sides of the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
"We urge all parties to avoid taking actions or making
statements that result in increased tensions in the region and
that detract from efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace on
the island," said State Department spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks when asked about a newly constructed
military base on the divided island to which Turkey has objected.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday Cyprus said that the newly constructed military base
would only be used in the event of a Turkish attack.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has repeatedly urged the reunification of
Cyprus and the withdrawal of some 30,000 Turkish troops deployed
on the island.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Turkey said that it would complain to the U.N.
Security Council over the construction of the military base.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of Turkish statements about putting before the
U.N. Security Council concerns about the completion of this base,"
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the U.N., Turkey has a right to raise issues of
concern before the United Nations. It's premature for us to
comment, not having seen all the particulars," Rubin added.

</P>
<P>
A trip by Albright would be an important signal that the United
States was moving toward a military option, political analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Russia sending a special envoy to Iraq in an
effort to try to end the current standoff over the weapons
inspections, Rubin said the United States did not object to the
Russian move, but he said the important thing was not a messenger
but a message.
</P>
<P>
"the issue is not who the messenger is. The issue is the
message: compliance, compliance, compliance and no more excuses,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The White House also said President Clinton was determined to
press for a strong stand against Iraq for its refusal of allowing
weapons inspectors to enter wherever they deem necessary to find
out any weapons of mass destruction program.
</P>
<P>
"We will be discussing with our allies the correct next steps
to take... We have not ruled out military options in this matter,"
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
He said "all options" remained open to deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
McCurry stressed that despite a raging sex scandal on the
president, which many fear could seriously weaken his power and
prestige here and abroad, Clinton was still focusing on the Iraq
issue.

<P>
AMMAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Minister of Foreign
Affairs Fayez Tarawneh said here Monday that his 13-day visit to
the United States was aimed mainly to back up the Palestinians in
their pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from the visit, he told reporters that he was
instructed by King Hussein to stay in Washington to coordinate
with the Palestinians in their talks with U.S. officials, said
Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister's trip coincided with Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat's visit to Washington which focused on
ways to revive peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. "for the first time" presented "new ideas" to both the
Palestinians and Israel, said Tarawneh, without giving details of
the "new ideas."
</P>
<P>
"We can not fully assess the situation now because the
concerned parties have agreed to hold meetings on pushing forward
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
So far there has been no positive response from Israel, but
due time should be given and the U.S. should continue its
mediation to strike a compromise between the two sides, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh was accompanied to the U.S. by Minister of Planning
Rima Khalaf, Governor of Central Bank of Jordan Zeyad Fareez and
other senior government officials.

The Jordanian delegation also discussed other issues with
U.S. officials, including the U.S. aid for the kingdom, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Wage Increases Slow Down to 40-year Low in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Employees in western Germany saw
their wages increase at the lowest rate for the past 40 years in
1997, mainly due to high competition pressure from abroad and a
record high unemployment at home, official data released Monday
showed.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wiesbaden-based German Federal Statistics
Office, the average pay of western Germany's 6.6 million
industrial workers increased by only 1.4 percent on average in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the monthly income of the country's more than 3.9
million white-collar employees rose just 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the inflation rate of 1.8 percent for 1997,
Germany's employees earned even less than 1996 on real terms, the

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Seek Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Japanese Defense Agency First Deputy Director-General
Masahiro Akiyama held talks on bilateral military cooperation here
today, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Their discussion reportedly focused on the implementation of
agreements on the development of Russian-Japanese military
contacts reached by Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in Krasnoyarsk, the Siberia city
of Russia, in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev confirmed his invitation to the chairman of Japan's
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Kazui Natsukawa, to visit Russia in
May this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the security in Northeastern Asia
and confidence-building measures, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Akiyama held meetings with the Russian Navy
commander, Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, and the head of the Russian
Defense Ministry's Main Department of International Military
Cooperation, Leonid Ivashov.
</P>
<P>
Expressing willingness to develop military ties with Japan,
Kuroyedov said, "Russia and Japan favor full-fledged relations in
the military field."
</P>
<P>
He noted that ties between the two countries' navies are
developing well, but could develop better as "both sides are
prepared for that and have enough experience to make more decisive
steps in this area."
</P>
<P>
Focusing on relations of the Russian and Japanese navies, they
agreed that working groups of the two countries' navy headquarters
will meet in March to coordinate and specify contacts between the
two countries' fleets in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kuroyedov and Akiyama also discussed military security measures
in the Asia-Pacific region including Northeastern Asia. They said
these measures include "a whole set of events which have been
approved by the Main Navy Command."
</P>
<P>
Akiyama arrived in Moscow on a working visit Saturday and will
leave for Khabarovsk to return home on January 29.

Karamanlis, leader of the main opposition party, New
Democracy(ND), also fell in the popularity by obtaining 43.2

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries to Increase Quotas in IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) board of governors will within days vote on a bill to
increase the fund's capital by 45 percent to 212 billion special
drawing rights (SDRs), or 287 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
IMF sources here said the international financial institution's
current funding stands at 146 billion SDRs (about 197 billion
U.S. dollars), the Middle East News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Over 10 Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, had asked for increasing their
quotas in the fund's capital in a bid to stave off any negative
impact on their marketing power.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, Egypt's share, pending the fund's
approval, would rise from 678 million to 943 million SDRs.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's share of 5.130 billion SDRs would also be
increased to 6.985 billion SDRs, bringing the kingdom to the sixth
largest SDR beneficiary in the world.
</P>
<P>
A fattened IMF capital is conducive to the fund's ability to
maintain its role in helping solve urgent economic and financial
problems across the globe.

<HEADLINE> Full Ban on Handguns Comes Into Effect in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- A full ban on handguns came into
force in Britain today and anyone caught to have pistol with him
could have maximum 10-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Junior Home Office Minister Alun Michael said today Britain now
"has some of the toughest gun laws in the world."
</P>
<P>
The firearms legislation was introduced after the 1996 Dunblane
massacre when crazed Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 schoolchildren
and their teacher before killing himself.
</P>
<P>
Owners of handguns of 0.22 caliber or less now have until the
end of February to hand in their weapons in return for
compensation or face draconian punishment. All guns over 0.22
caliber were supposed to have been surrendered last year.
</P>
<P>
"Following the successful removal last year of large-caliber
handguns, this second hand-in will fulfill the government's
commitment to improving public safety by removing the remaining
small-caliber handguns," Michael said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Around 116,000 large-caliber and 26,000 small-caliber weapons
have already been handed in. Officials expect another 10,000
small-caliber weapons to be surrendered by the end of February.

<HEADLINE> Military Action Against Israel Not Allowed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 26 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan Monday
told visiting Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai that the
kingdom will not allow anyone to stage military actions against
Israel on its soil, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will not allow any Palestinian military movement,
including the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), to launch
anti-Israeli actions on the kingdom's land, Hussein said during a
meeting with Mordechai, who arrived here Monday evening at the
invitation of the king.
</P>
<P>
Jordan only recognizes the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) as the legal organization of the Palestinians, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense minister paid his visit to Jordan after
Washington failed to bridge the gap between the Palestinians and
the Israelis in.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai was scheduled to return home after a three-hour meeting
with the Jordanian king.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which was attended by Jordanian Crown
Prince Hassan, the king told Mordechai that Israel and the
Palestinians should not be against each other, but instead should
work together to build peace for the future.
</P>
<P>
If peace is not established, there will be more killings and
destruction, Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
He added that new efforts should be pursued to put the peace
process back on track and push it towards the attainment of a
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Mordechai asked Hussein to help Israel put an end
to the activities of Hamas, especially those against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai is considered to be the only remaining moderate in
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline cabinet after
last month's resignation of Foreign Minister David Levy in protest
against the government's tough budget and peace policies.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has officially rejected the Israeli attempts to involve
the kingdom in outlining Israel's security maps and in final
status negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but
it is closely following Israeli-Palestinian developments and wants
to ensure that any final status resolutions take into
consideration of Jordan's national and security interests.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations have been at a
standstill since Israel began to expand Jewish settlements in
Arab East Jerusalem in March of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming the
second and last Arab nation that conceived peace with the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Clinton Lawyer Wants Jones Trial Moved up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's attorney Monday asked a federal judge in Little Rock,
Arkansas, to move up the trial in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit, so the public can judge its merit.
</P>
<P>
Robert Bennett filed a five-page motion asking U.S. District
Judge Susan Webber Wright to bring forward the May 27 trial date,
according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Jones claims in her lawsuit that when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas in 1991 he propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel room.
She said she rejected his advances, and she was denied promotion
as a state clerk.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has denied the allegations, claiming he does not recall
ever meeting Jones
</P>
<P>
Bennett said, "It is important not only to the president but to
the institution of the presidency."
</P>
<P>
Bennett criticized news coverage of the new allegations against
Clinton involving a former White House intern, referring to an
U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year to allow the Jones suit to
proceed while Clinton was in office, although Clinton's lawyers
wanted to delay the trial until the president left office.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The events of the last few days have shown that the
highest court's confidence that this case could proceed without
undue distraction to the nation's business was unfounded."
</P>
<P>
"The president is being tarred in the media; gossip, innuendo,
and hearsay are being passed off as fact. Allegations by unnamed
sources are claimed to be credible," Bennett was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bennett accused the broadcast media of abandoning "normal
journalistic restraint" in an effort to be first on the air "with
titillating allegations."
</P>
<P>
The public has no way to evaluate the credibility of the
reports, he said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, WHO, SB Launch Elephantiasis Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 26 (Xinhua) -- To counter the scourge of
lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), the World Bank, the
health care company SmithKline Beecham (SB) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) have jointly launched a new program for
elephantiasis elimination.
</P>
<P>
According to a World Bank announcement here today, under the
program, SB will donate its drug albendazole free of charge to
governments and other collaborating organizations working for the
global elimination of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Over 1 billion people in 73 countries are at risk of
contracting elephantiasis, and there are over 120 million people
already affected worldwide. SB will continue donating the drug
until the disease is eliminated and will also contribute program
assistance and health education. The World Bank will support the
partnership on the country-level by incorporating it in specific
components in all HNP projects over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
"This will be one of the largest global disease-elimination
programs ever undertaken," said Mr. James D. Wolfensohn, president
of the World Bank, who is currently on a visit to Africa.
"Lymphatic filariasis not only disables millions, but also causes
massive socio-economic burdens."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that, because nearly one-fifth of the world's
population across the world is at risk of infection, it will take
some 20 years to eliminate the disease.
</P>
<P>
New research has determined that albendazole, an SB's drug
which has already become a standard treatment worldwide to combat
intestinal parasites, is 99 percent effective against the parasite
that causes lymphatic filariasis when simultaneously administered
with other antiparasitic drugs.
</P>
<P>
The disease, carried by mosquitoes, often leads to
elephantiasis, the disfiguring enlargement of the arms, legs and
genital organs.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hopes Clinton Scandal Not Sap Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Monday expressed the hope that the present circumstances
surrounding U.S. President Bill Clinton do not cast shadow on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The issue has captivated the interest of the media and
political circles, but we do hope that it does not undermine the
peace process," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has been embroiled in a sex scandal with a former White
House intern. Last week he failed to bridge the gaps between the
Palestinians and Israelis during his separate talks with Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli rejection still stands firm, disappointment continues
and our rejection of the Israeli rejection stands," he added.
</P>
<P>
The stumbling block on the road to peace has been there for
some time due to Israel's policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the American administration will continue to play its
role as an honest broker and to deal with both parties
even-handedly without exercising pressure on one of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described last week's meetings that Clinton held with
the Palestinian and Israeli leaders in Washington as "very useful."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. under Clinton administration has placed the matter
into right perspective by talking to both parties on the same
level and in the same manner and by making proposals," he added.
</P>
<P>
"However, until this moment, there are no substantial results,"
said Moussa, warning that the peace process and the roles of peace
partners are rapidly losing its credibility.
</P>
<P>
"Consecutive meetings as an option to the peace process itself
or handshakes and smiles as an alternative to real progress on the
road to peace can not be accepted by world public opinion," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not go on meeting without reaching just solutions but
mere petty results, as Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have deadlocked since last March
when Israel began to build a new settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem.
