<HEADLINE> Editorial Stresses Importance of Unemployment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A "People's Daily" editorial
to be published tomorrow calls on all government officials to
implement tasks set out at the national conference on
guaranteeing the minimum living standards of laid-off workers and
the unemployment scheme which ended here today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first national conference held by the State
Council this year. So, the conference is of vital importance, the
editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments all levels should implement
the central government policy to the letter and closely cooperate
with labor departments. Laid-off workers should take into
consideration difficulties of the state, change their concept of
employment and rely on themselves with the help of government
preferential policies, it says.
</P>
<P>
It is an arduous task for this year to ensure the basic living
standards of laid-off workers in state-owned enterprises and
undertake re-employment projects.
</P>
<P>
All localities must implement tasks set out by the central
economic work conference held last year, provide retired people
with a full amount of monthly pension in time, create more job
opportunities for the laid-off workers and introduce a social
insurance system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Open Case Against Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors of the U.S.
House of Representatives told senators in a rebuttal brief
Thursday that they need witnesses to make their case that
President Bill Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a trial memorandum submitted to the Senate by
Clinton's defense lawyers on Wednesday, the House prosecutors used
the president's arguments to bolster their own case for calling
witnesses at the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that President Clinton's Trial Memorandum raises
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live
testimony subject to cross examination," the House prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice, in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The House rebuttal to the White House memorandum was submitted
to the Senate just hours before the impeachment trial was to
resume on the Senate floor with House prosecutors poised to make
their opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Clinton's argument that he did not lie in his
testimony before a federal grand jury investigating his
relationships with Monica Lewinsky, the House prosecutors
reiterated their argument that "a complete and impartial review of
the evidence reveals that the president did in fact commit perjury
before the grand jury."
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton discounts substantial evidence as well as
common sense when he maintains he testified truthfully," the House
prosecutors wrote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators
must vote to convict him to oust him from office.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Probe into Congo(K) Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Wednesday night expressed its outrage at the reported
massacres of hundreds of civilians in the eastern part of Congo
(K), and called for an international investigation of the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, the president of the 15-nation Security
Council, Celso Amorim of Brazil, said the Council members demanded
cooperation from all sides in the proposed investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged the warring parties in Congo (K) to
attend the forthcoming meeting in Lusaka, capital of Zambia, at
the highest political level in the spirit of compromise to agree
on a ceasefire to be promptly implemented, he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Security Council insisted on the need for early
progress towards a political solution to the conflict in the
African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will continue with its involvement in
seeking a peaceful solution and support the regional mediation
efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 500 civilians were reportedly killed in Makobola, eastern
Congo (K) during the New Year holidays. Andre Kabanga, the
permanent representative of Congo (K) to the United Nations, has
asked the Security Council to call a probe into the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Farmers Criticize Fertilizer Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Farmers Union (ZFU)
Thursday said fertilizer price increases were becoming too
frequent and that this needed national solutions.
</P>
<P>
"The latest move brings the total increases since the start of
the season to nine. I have no recollection of any product on the
market which has been going up at that rate," ZFU director
Emmerson Zhou told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Urgent solutions were required as the increments were eroding
the viability of the farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The increases total about 90 percent across the range
depending on the type of fertilizer. The scenario is of serious
concern to farmers and a national solution is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The increases come barely four months after another 70 percent
price hike by manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Fertilizer manufacturers increased their selling prices by 3.2
percent last Friday citing escalating costs of imported raw
materials and other related overheads as the reasons for the hike
in prices.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy Patriot Missiles from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
spokesman Necati Utkan confirmed Thursday that Turkey is to buy
U.S.-made Patriot missiles to beef up its defense.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman attributed the decision to buy Patriot missiles
to the "developments" in northern Iraq, but did not specify
whether the Iraqis or Turkey's Kurdish rebels are a threat that
necessitated the purchase.
</P>
<P>
"The Turkish government considers it useful to take all
appropriate measures to remain cautious to developments in
northern Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said under such circumstances, the Patriot missiles would
play a useful role and Turkey has asked the U.S. whether the
missiles could be brought to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The response from U.S. has been "positive," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to say how many Patriot missiles Turkey
would buy and where the missiles would be deployed.
</P>
<P>
Weeks ago, Turkey's rival, Cyprus, decided to deploy
Russian-made SS-300 missiles on the Greece's Crete island, in an
attempt to balance Turkey's superior air power.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
has said that Turkey would not allow the U.S. to use the Incirlik
air base in Adana, southern Turkey, to bombard northern Iraq,
reported the Turkish daily "Turkiye" Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. used the Incirlik air base to strike northern Iraq
during the Gulf War in 1991 and still uses it to enforce a no-fly
zone north of the 36 parallel.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit opposed the U.S. military attacks against Iraq, said the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Inflation at Lowest Levels in Three Decades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January (Xinhua) -- U.S. inflation rose just 1.6
percent in 1998 because of the low cost of energy products, the
Labor Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the Consumer Price Index edged up just
0.1 percent in December, capping a year in which inflation was
better behaved than the small 1.7 percent rise recorded in
1997, and it is the lowest level since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
The small December increases reflected a record 18.3 percent
surge in tobacco costs, reflecting a drive by tobacco companies to
recoup the costs of their huge state liability settlements.
</P>
<P>
It reported the modest increases in inflation over the past two
years reflected the best two-year price performance in 34 years,
since gains of just 1 percent in 1964 and 1.9 percent in 1965. The
1.6 percent rise last year was the best one-year showing since a
1.1 percent rise in 1986, a year in which energy prices plummeted
by 19.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The recent good news on inflation in large part reflects the
economic crises that began in Asia in 1997. Plunging currency
values and deep recessions have sharply cut demand for many
commodities, including oil products.
</P>
<P>
This has been a boon for U.S. consumers, although the country's
manufacturers are suffering a profit squeeze from the loss of
export markets and the inability to raise prices domestically.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs were down 8.8 percent for all of 1998, the biggest
one-year decline since 1986. Energy prices had fallen 3.4 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The absence of price pressures in the United States gave the
Federal Reserve,the central bank, the maneuvering room to cut
interest rates three times in the fall in a so-far successful
campaign to keep world financial problems from triggering a
recession in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that inflation pressures will be slightly
higher this year as Asian economies begin to recover and worldwide
demand for energy products and other commodities will rise.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Stock Market Performs Badly in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zambia News Agency ZANA Thursday quoted a December review of
the stock market as saying that the volume of shares traded at
LuSE dropped from 162. 62 million in 1997 to 157.89 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the volume of shares traded was attributed to
weaker institutional investment in 1998, both domestic and
international.
</P>
<P>
The review also showed that the market closed at 301 million in
1998 compared to 705 million in 1997, indicating a decline of 57.3
percent in Kwacha terms.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ZANA, LuSE general manager Charles Mate
said the complete privatization of the Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) is the key to unlocking the potential of the Zambian
stock market.
</P>
<P>
He said the privatization of ZCCM, one of the largest mining
conglomerates in the world, would result in several companies
being listed on the LuSE, therefore accelerating the growth of the
Zambian stock market.
</P>
<P>
The key factors for the success of the Zambia stock Market
remain establishing exchange rate stability of Kwacha, which
devalued by nearly 100 percent in the past year, and maintaining
investor confidence, said the general manager.

<P>
GENEVA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and the United States of America (USA) will begin
talks on the former's nuclear program this weekend in Geneva,
Swiss department of foreign affairs said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the DPRK and the USA, scheduled on Saturday
and Sunday, will focus on the on-site inspection to an underground
site in Kumchangni, where the United States suspects that there
are nuclear installations hidden.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral talks will be followed by the fourth session of
the four-party talks joined by China and the Republic of Korea
besides the DPRK and the USA.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks aiming to reach a lasting peace settlement
on the Korean Peninsula were launched in December 1997 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
A preparatory meeting at deputy head level will take place on
January 18. Apart from the plenary meeting, the two subcommittees,
established in the third session last October, will discuss
respectively the establishment of a peace regime on the peninsula
and tension reduction there.

GENEVA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The remaining five delegates of
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have evacuated
from the capital of the Sierra Leone for security reasons,
the Geneva-based organization here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that the evacuation followed accusations by a
Sierra Leonean government minister that the ICRC had provided
communication equipment to rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC vehicle equipped with a radio was stolen in the ICRC
compound in Freetown on Sunday. It was then reportedly used in
rebels' fighting against government forces in the capital.
</P>
<P>
"The ICRC regrets this development because it obliges its
delegates to leave Freetown at a time when the humanitarian
situation is still giving cause for the gravest concern, most
civilians being trapped in their homes by the incessant fighting,"
the ICRC said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Nenzies, Lufthansa Joint Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European commission has
approved the creation of a joint venture, Sigma Aviation (UK) Ltd,
between Lufthansa Airport and Ground Services GmbH (LAGS) and
Menzies Transport Services Ltd (MTS).
</P>
<P>
Sigma, so far a 100 percent LAGS subsidiary, already provides
third-party aircraft and passenger ground handling services at
Manchester Airport. Through the acquisition of a 49 percent stake,
MTS will have joint control of Sigma. Given Sigma's limited market
share and intense competition at Manchester Airport, the operation
dose not create or strengthen a dominant position, the commission
said.
</P>
<P>
LAGS, a full owned subsidiary of Deutsche Lufthansa AG, is
mainly active in the provision of passenger and cargo handling
services as well as in the air transport related business. MTS is
a wholly owned subsidiary of John Menzies plc whose main
businesses are the distribution of books, magazines, music and
video articles as well as cargo ground handling and freight
forwarding, while its Concorde express subsidiary provides
landside/airside cargo trucking services. LAGS and MTS already
control a joint venture to provide cargo-handling services at
London Airport System's airports (i.e. Heathrow, Gatwick and
Stansted), which the commission authorized last year.
</P>
<P>
The relevant market on which Sigma operates is aircraft and
passenger ground handling at Manchester Airport. The parties'
combined market share dose not exceed 15 percent in either aircraft
or passenger handling. Other operators on the market include
self-handlers like British Airways and British Midland as well as
third party handlers like Servisair and GHl, whose market shares
are higher than Sigma's. Therefore, the transaction dose not raise
competition concerns under the EU merger regulation, the
commission, the EU's executive branch, concluded.

WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors of the U.S.
House of Representatives told senators in a rebuttal brief
Thursday that they need witnesses to make their case that
President Bill Clinton should be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a trial memorandum submitted to the Senate by
Clinton's defense lawyers on Wednesday, the House prosecutors used
the president's arguments to bolster their own case for calling
witnesses at the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that President Clinton's Trial Memorandum raises
issues of credibility, those issues are best resolved by live
testimony subject to cross examination," the House prosecutors
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice, in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The House rebuttal to the White House memorandum was submitted
to the Senate just hours before the impeachment trial was to
resume on the Senate floor with House prosecutors poised to make
their opening arguments.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Clinton's argument that he did not lie in his
testimony before a federal grand jury investigating his
relationships with Lewinsky, the House prosecutors reiterated
their argument that "a complete and impartial review of the
evidence reveals that the president did in fact commit perjury
before the grand jury."
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton discounts substantial evidence as well as
common sense when he maintains he testified truthfully," the House
prosecutors wrote.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, the lead prosecutor, and the rest of the House
prosecutors have discussed calling Clinton and Lewinsky but have
made no final decisions, according to prosecution officials. Under
Senate rules, Clinton is the only witness who could not be
subpoenaed to appear.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's lawyers rejected a House request to interview her,
according to sources here.
</P>
<P>
James Sensenbrenner, a Republican lawmaker, said his opening
statement on behalf of the prosecution team would focus on "laying
out the case and showing very clearly that the president committed
an impeachable offense."
</P>
<P>
The House case will continue Friday and possibly Saturday.
Clinton's lawyers will follow next week with their defense
contending that he is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of
justice and that the charges, even if proved, do not rise to the
level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
The White House lawyers and the House prosecutors each can make
arguments for 24 hours spread over three days, if all the allotted
time is used.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators
must vote to convict him to oust him from office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Strong in December and 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Commerce Department
said on Thursday that the strong retail sales in 1998 helped keep
the U.S. economy growing robustly in the face of world economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
It said retail goods, particularly cars and building materials,
sold strongly during the crucial holiday shopping season, pushing
sales up 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted 231 billion U.S.
dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
For the year of 1998, sales rose 5.1 percent to 2.7 trillion
dollars following a gain of 4.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
That's quite good, considering that consumer prices rose just
1.6 percent last year, restrained by a big 8.8 percent drop in
energy costs. Prices rose 1.7 percent in 1997 and, together, the
two years represented the nation's best back-to-back inflation
performance since 1964-65.
</P>
<P>
Automotive sales jumped 2.5 percent in December and, for the
year, they were 5.7 percent higher, despite strikes that halted
General Motors production in June and July.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, auto companies said they sold 15.6 million
cars and light trucks last year, the most in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, which represents about two-thirds of
economic activity, kept the U.S. economy growing robustly in 1998,
despite a plunge in export sales to Asian and other troubled
economies that destroyed more than 200,000 jobs in manufacturing.
Laid-off factory workers apparently found other jobs and the
nation's unemployment rate last year, 4.5 percent, was the lowest
in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
A side effect of the Asian crisis, the lowest mortgage rates
since the 1960s, helped power record home sales. And that in turn
propelled big gains in sales at furniture stores and hardware and
building-supply centers.
</P>
<P>
Sales at building-supply and hardware stores rose 1.3 percent
in December and 10.3 percent for the year. They rose 0.6 percent
at furniture stores last month and 8.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported sales at department stores and
other general merchandisers slipped 0.2 percent in December after
posting a 1.4 percent increase in November, the strongest in nine
months. For the year, their sales were up 6.7 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks extended losses
into the fourth consecutive day on Thursday, following the
devaluation of Brazilian real and a less-than-expected corporate
earnings report by a major index component.
</P>
<P>
At about 11:30 am EST, the Dow Jones industrial average fell
130.02 to 9214.54. The blue-chip index lost a total of 293 points
since Monday.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laced Nasdaq composite index fell 5.16 to
2311.70, following a 3.94 point loss at Wednesday's session.
</P>
<P>
Eastman Kodak, the number 1 U.S. film maker, reported on
Thursday that despite a 39 percent growth in its fourth quarter
earnings, it still fell short of expectations. In the third
quarter, it did not meet expectations either.
</P>
<P>
The dip of the price of Kodak, a component of the Dow, led the
index's plunge.
</P>
<P>
U.S. financial stocks continued to weaken for the second day on
Thursday as investors feared about the fortune of U.S. financial
institutions which have an estimated 65 billion U.S. dollar in
investments at risk in Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Urges for End of Double-Standard Approach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said here on Thursday that any practice of double-standard should
be abandoned in dealing with the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the remark when meeting with senior Iraqi
officials to review the U.S.-British air strike and the latest
developments in the conflict, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched a four-day air strike
agains Iraq on December 16-19, in retaliation for what they called
Iraq's non-cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Saddam was quoted by INA as urging for avoiding the
double-standard policy concerning not only the Iraqi issue, but
all previous and following issues, with no exception.
</P>
<P>
He called for tackling the Iraqi issue and other issues on the
basis of international law and norms without any prejudice or
being away from justice and equity.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that measures applied to Iraq should also be taken
against Israel, especially regarding its usurpation of Arab rights
in Palestine and occupation of Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
INA said the Iraqi leadership demanded the U.N. embargo on Iraq
be lifted, and that Israel's weapons of mass destruction be
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said that sufficient achievements had already been
made regarding the scrapping of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
and that Iraq has met the requirement of the U.N. resolutions
adopted since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
As many states in the region possess such weapons, including
Israel, which is believed to have its nuclear arsenal, "what Iraq
had been prohibited to do should also be prohibited on others and
with no exception," the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership demanded that the integrity, security and
independence of the country should be respected "seriously."
</P>
<P>
They called for the cancellation of the two no-fly zones
imposed by the U.S. and its Western allies in northern and
southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. Baghdad denounced them as
unauthorized by the U.N. and illegal.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, the Revolutionary
Command Council member General Ali Hassan al-Mejeed and Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Keen on Keeping Sudan's Integrity: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister
Youssef Wali said on Thursday that safeguarding the integrity of
Sudan is the "main concern" of Egypt's policy towards its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on securing the "real interests of the people of
Sudan," said Wali while meeting with visiting Sudanese rebel
leader John Garang, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA),
stressed his group's "unwavering stance on preserving the unity of
Sudan and honest endeavor to make real a unified Nile valley."
</P>
<P>
Garang, also a leading member of the opposition Sudanese
National Democratic Alliance (NDA), arrived here Wednesday for
meeting with members of the alliance, which includes Sudan's rebel
groups and Muslim opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to meet other Egyptian officials to review the
situation in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
SPLA, the major rebel faction in southern Sudan, has been
fighting since 1983 to press for greater autonomy for the
country's southern third, which is mainly African, Christian and
animist, from the Muslim government in the north.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan have long been trading accusations of harboring
each other's Islamic militants and opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
Cairo hosted a Sudanese opposition meeting last year, a move
Khartoum denounced as fostering the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Egypt argued that by hosting the meeting, it aimed at keeping
Sudan unified. Cairo fears that a possible disintegration of Sudan
could endanger the Nile, its main source of water.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Rebels fighting to topple
President Laurent Kabila's government in the Democrats Republic of
Congo (DRC) will not be involved in the direct talks during the
forthcoming peace summit in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The summit was scheduled for this weekend but was postponed to
allow more time for consultations among stake-holders.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Lusaka international airport shortly before
departure to Kinshasa, the capital of Congo (K) Thursday, Zambian
President Frederick Chiluba said the heads of state summit will be
preceded by the foreign affairs and defence ministers meeting
Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the peace summit was postponed in order to give
more time to the foreign and defense ministers to make wider
consultations whose results will culminate into a solid agenda for
the final summit to take place on a date yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
Rebels will not be allowed in the summit but the position of
the rebels in the talks will be more clearer after broader
consultations had been made, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba has flown to Kinshasa for consultative talks with
Kabila ahead of the summit and he is expected to fly back into the
country Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was mandated by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) to spearhead the peace initiative over the
conflicts in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Strike Paralyzes Nigerian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Activities at the Lagos ports
have been paralyzed as the strike embarked upon by customs agents
entered the third day today, the News Agency of Nigeria said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The customs agents have been on strike in protest against the
continued stay of some members of security agencies at the ports,
despite a recent order from the Nigerian government for them to
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Those affected by the strike include the Apapa Port, the
Tin-Can Island Port, Roro Port and the container terminal at
Ijora, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In its 1999 budget, the government said some security agents,
including the State Security Service, the National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency, the Defense Military Intelligence and many
others would hence be withdrawn from various sea and air outlets
and would be called in only when necessity arises.
</P>
<P>
These agents have been widely accused of extortion and other
corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Peter Okocha, President of the Nigerian
Licensed Customs Agents, as saying that the customs agents would
not go back to work "unless the undesired agencies leave the
ports".
</P>
<P>
An importer who pleaded anonymity said the reduction of the
number of security agencies at the ports would remove the
bottlenecks experienced in the past and turn Nigerian ports into
"a haven for importers".
</P>
<P>
"The earlier the federal government issues the agencies with
the relevant papers to vacate the ports, the better, since most of
these agencies have insisted that they would not leave without
being served with the relevant papers of redeployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another importer, however, expressed concern that the current
impasse might result in a problem of accumulated demurrage on
cargoes.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Trade Deficit Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon registered a trade
deficit of 6.344 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, slightly down from
6.815 billion dollars in 1997, a central bank's report said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports volume amounted to 716 million dollars, up 11 percent
from that of 1997, while imports suffered a 5 percent fall to 7.06
billion dollars, compared to 7.46 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Elie Yashoui, a leading economist, said that the year 1998 saw
a recession in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The rise in exports was not based on structural improvements to
the productive sectors, but to circumstantial developments," he
noted, citing trade deals negotiated with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraqi oil-for-food deal with the United Nations,
Lebanon signed a 50-million-dollar contract with Iraq last year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues generating from chemical products exports reached 87
million dollars, accounting for 12.11 percent of the exports
volume, followed by 82 million dollars from cut gems and jewelry
exporting, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Machinery, textiles and processed food were other main
exporting products of the country.
</P>
<P>
Italy retained the top spot and took an 11.51 percent share of
imports, followed by France, the United States, Germany,
Switzerlands, Britain, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
Exports were mainly destined to Saudi Arabia, with 12.1
percent of the total, followed by the United Arab Emirates,
France, the United States, Syria, Kuwait, Jordan and Switzerland,
the report added.

TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated here on Thursday Tehran's call for a speedy
determination of the legal regime governing the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi made the appeal in his meeting with visiting Turkmen

The five Caspian states, namely Iran, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan,
Russia and Azerbaijan, have differences on their shares in the
sea's resources. Iran prefers a common ownership of the Caspian by
the littoral states while some others demand to divide the sea
among them.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is in normal health, "sounds cheerful and is fit and active," his
press secretary Dmitry Yakushkin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks, made on a live program of the Ekho Moskvy radio
station, came after Yeltsin abruptly canceled what was to be his
first working day in the Kremlin so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin, who had a telephone conversation with the president
earlier Thursday, said Yeltsin "works every day and physicians
obviously check on his health."
</P>
<P>
This is taken for granted in any country, Yakushkin said,
adding that doctors have lifted restrictions on Yeltsin's travels,
including air travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
"The president is having plenty of meetings which the press
service does not report about, his work schedule is normal,"
Yakushkin said, urging journalists to "stop dogging every step of
the president."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, has suffered several illnesses in recent months,
and has been appearing at the Kremlin infrequently, spending much
of his time at his country house.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin said Yeltsin continues to prepare for a trip to
France later this month and has been keeping up with paperwork at
his country residence since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's France visit, scheduled for January 28, would be his
first trip abroad since early October, when he had to cut short a
visit to Central Asia because of illness.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows to Retaliate EU in Banana Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Thursday
formally notified the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) of its intention to impose sanctions to the
European Union (EU) on products worth about 520 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The value of the proposed suspension represents an estimate of
the annual harm done to the U.S. economy resulting from the EU's
banana regime, according to a statement by the office of the U.S.
Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
"We take this step because of the EU's failure to comply with
WTO rulings," said U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
in the statement reaching here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Following the WTO ruling in September 1997 that the EU's old
banana regime violated trade rules, the EU modified the policy and
implemented it on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Ecuador, together with Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,
Panama, and the United States, complained that the modified EU
policy was still against the WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the WTO's DSB set up a panel to arbitrate within 90
days if the new banana import policy of the European Union (EU) is
in conformity with a previous WTO ruling.
</P>
<P>
Both the EU and Ecuador requested setting up of a panel to
settle the dispute. As a compromise, the three-man panel
established Tuesday is supposed to deal with issues raised by both
the EU and Ecuador: two topics under one panel.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Famine and diseases have been
claiming human lives and cattle in the central and southern
regions of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports reaching here from the region of Bakol
indicate that a new wave of famine and lack of potable water are
devastating the people of Huddor and its surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
Acording to Adan Saransoor, the chairman of a committee
coordinating local humanitarian efforts, 10 people including
seven children have died of famine and other related diseases in
the town of Huddor on Wednesday alone.
</P>
<P>
An average of four to five people are dying daily in the
villages of Bur Dhuhunleh, Morgabey and Garasweyne, while the
towns of Wajid, Tieglow and El-Barde are also experiencing their
worst famine since 1992 when people died in hundreds per day
because of famine.
</P>
<P>
Apart from famine and lack of potable water, measles and severe
diarrhea are also killing the children in Bay and Bakol regions.
Seven children have died of diarrhea in the town of Wajid for in
the past two days where water is also scarce. And far to the
south in the port town Kismayu, an outbreak of cholera is being
reported.
</P>
<P>
Local health authorities have reported that over 70 people
suffering from cholera are now being treated in a new quarantine
facility in the main hospital of the town.
</P>
<P>
Kismayu hospital is already floating with wounded people from
the recent fighting for the control of Kismayu.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, in the central region of Nugal, four people are
reported to have died of severe diarrhea in the villages near the
town of Garowe. Over 20 people are now in critical condition in
the village of Hallin, 80 km north of Garowe town, the capital of
the recently established regional administration of Puntland.
</P>
<P>
Despite these humanitarian difficulties, the aid agencies
seemed to be reluctant to intervene into the situation due to
insecurity in many places in southern Somalia.

<HEADLINE> E. African Passports in The Offing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The much-awaited East
African passports are finally available as each of the member
countries has got 100,000 copies of the passports at their
respective immigration authorities.
</P>
<P>
An official at the East African Co-operation (EAC) secretariat
in Arusha, north Tanzania, said Thursday that the passports will
be officially launched during the third meeting of Kenyan,
Tanzanian and Ugandan presidents on Friday, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The launching marks another milestone in the evolution of
regional integration and reinforcement of a common east African
identity, he said.
</P>
<P>
The passport was introduced during the last east African summit
on April 29, 1997. It will facilitate movement of east Africans
across their common borders, said the official, who declined to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
The passport is priced at an equivalent of 10 U.S. Dollars in
all the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Preferential handling at the border points would be provided,
including special fast lane counters for holders of the east
African passports, he said.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the east African passports will be valid only within
the three countries, the official said, adding it is projected
that in the long run, they will replace the national passports as
an international travel document.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the Friday
meeting. Technical experts from the three countries were holding
a series of meetings on Thursday to finalize preparations of the
summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be preceded in the preparatory stage by the
11th meeting of the Permanent Tripartite Commission which
comprises the ministries responsible for regional integration of
the three member states.
</P>
<P>
The meeting had been planned to take place last November but
was postponed due to insufficient preparations. It will be a
run-up to the ratification of a treaty for the establishment of
the East African Community.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state are also expected to review cooperation
matters, the progress in the treaty-making process launched at the
first summit and discuss an application by Rwanda to join the
regional grouping, he said.

<P>
Lead prosecutor Henry Hyde, a Republican lawmaker, began
opening arguments for the 13-member prosecution team, which will
use up to 24 hours over the next three days to argue that Clinton
should be convicted and removed from office for allegations
stemming from his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, stands
accused of two articles of impeachment -- perjury and obstruction
of justice -- in connection with his effort to conceal a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"You are seated in this historic chamber not to embark on some
great legislative debate... but to listen to the evidence as those
who must sit in judgment," said Hyde, who is also House Judiciary
Committee chairman,
</P>
<P>
Hyde said his team would show how "egregious and criminal"
Clinton's conduct was in concealing his affair with Lewinsky and
that Clinton had violated his oath to tell the truth in court.
</P>
<P>
"In many way the case you will consider is about those two
words _ I do," Hyde added.
</P>
<P>
The House case will continue Friday and possibly Saturday.
Clinton's lawyers will follow next week with their defense
contending that he is not guilty of perjury or obstruction of
justice and that the charges, even if proved, do not rise to the
level of ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
The White House lawyers and the House prosecutors each can make
arguments for 24 hours spread over three days, if all the allotted
time is used.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. Sixty-seven senators
must vote to convict him to oust him from office.

<HEADLINE> German GDP up 2.8 p.c. in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy showed its
strongest growth since its 1990 reunification last year, with the
gross domestic product rising 2.8 per cent, but 1999 may be more
difficult, officials said Thursday in Wiesbaden.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Statistics Office said that this year could be more
difficult amid the decline in such export markets as Southeast
Asia, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The decisive question for this year is whether capital
equipment investments will suffer as a result of problems foreseen
in the export sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, capital equipment spending surged by 8.6 per cent,
from 3.9 per cent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Economists' forecasts for German economic growth this year
range between 1.4 and 2.2 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, by surpassing the 1997 GDP rise of 2.2 per cent,
Germany was in a comparatively favorable position worldwide,
behind the U.S. growth of 3.5 per cent but far ahead of Japan,
whose economy shrank by 2.6 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The Statistics Office report showed that in a breakdown by
regions, growth in western Germany was up by 2.9 per cent,
compared with 2.3 per cent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the region comprising former East Germany, however, GDP was
up 2.1 per cent, compared with 1.7 per cent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose by 5.9 per cent, a slowdown when compared with
11.1 per cent export growth in 1997, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption meanwhile became a stronger factor in the
economy, rising by 1.7 per cent last year, compared with only 0.5
per cent in 1997. Disposable income of private households improved
by a nominal 2.6 per cent, up from 1.8 per cent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Putting a drag on the economy was the construction sector,
where investments slumped by 4.2 per cent, the strongest downturn
since 1995, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The report showed a continued shift in the distribution of
wealth to the detriment of wage earners. While employees' incomes
increased by 1.5 per cent, corporate and capital asset earnings
increased by 9.0 per cent.
</P>
<P>
Out of national income of almost 2.84 trillion marks(1.7
trillion dollars ), up 3.8 per cent, wage earners accounted for
under 1.94 trillion marks(1.1 trillion dollars). This was a 68.2
per cent share of the total - down from 69.7 per cent in 1997 and
the lowest level since 1970, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Using European Union accounting methods, Germany's deficit last
year was 79.5 billion marks (46.8 billion dollars), or 2.1 per
cent of GDP. In 1997, the deficit was 96.2 billion marks(56.6
billion dollars), or 2.7 per cent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament to Have Report of Missing Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The report of a parliamentary
committee' s probe into the missing fund in Uganda's valley dam
projects will be presented to parliament and the public at the end
of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Anthony Kanyike, Chairman of the
Parliamentary Select Committee on Agriculture, here Thursday
evening, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
This is to support the observations which confirm that the
valley dam water project has been poorly executed at high costs
with financial loss to the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that whereas the committee does not intend to
engage in alteration with Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe on the
valley dam water, it is crucial that information given to the
public is factual.
</P>
<P>
The committee will continue its probe into the Ministry of
Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries as a whole until a
final report of the inquires is put before the legislature for
debate and appropriate action.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3.4 million U.S. Dollars was reportedly lost in the
valley dam project. Kazibwe, who is also the Minister of
Agriculture, said Tuesday that she accepted political
responsibility in the missing fund, but denied having embezzled
the fund.

<HEADLINE> Germany Welcomes European Parliament Rejection to  Censure against EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder expressed cautious satisfaction Thursday that the
European Parliament rejected a motion of censure against the
European Commission, which runs the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told reporters in Berlin he backed a strong
Commission, given upcoming tasks of reforming European Union
(E.U.) finances - know as Agenda 2000 - and preparing for
enlargement into Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission - the E.U. executive body - has been
accused of mismanagement of funds and corruption.
</P>
<P>
But a majority of members in the European Parliament in
Strasbourg voted Thursday against the proposed censure motion. A
two-thirds majority would have been required to dismiss the
Commission.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also welcomed the vote.
</P>
<P>
"The voting result assures that there is a Commission capable
of doing business... during the final phase of negotiations for
the Agenda 2000, which is crucial for the E.U.," said Fischer in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed there would have to be rigorous investigation
of the accusations levelled at the European Commission. "Germany,
in close cooperation with fellow members states, will make an
active contribution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the vote went beyond the corruption
accusations, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue between the European Parliament and the
Commission; the intense reporting in the media; and the big public
interest all underscore the birth of a European democratic culture
and a European public extending over borders," concluded Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Germany holds the rotating E.U. presidency for the first half
of 1999.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Expected to Be Peak of Infrastructure Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The year 1999 is expected to
be a peak year in terms of investments in public works and
physical planning in Romania, with at least 600 million U.S.
dollars funded in this respect, the national Rompres news agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An investment project worth 340 million U.S. dollars will start
in the domain of village water supply and welfare housing.
Contracts were already signed last December with two associations
of firms that won the international tender - Sol el Boneh and
Tahal of Israel and Mivan and Kier of Britain for the
implementation of the ambitious project.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, some 1,500 villages of the country will be
equipped with running water facilities and some 1,800 flats of
welfare housing will be provided in 12 counties and in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The credit, provided by Leumi Bank, ING Bank, Deutsche Bank is
six times bigger than the previous year's budget of the Ministry
of Public Works and Territorial Development, and is also the
largest foreign credit guaranteed by Romania's Government.
</P>
<P>
Next spring too, works will start on the water and sewerage
system in ten towns - Arad, Bacau, Botosani, Bistrita, Braila,
Cluj, Constanta, Focsani, Oradea and Targoviste. The program of
municipal utilities rehabilitation totals 200 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tenders will be completed in the early half of this year also
for another program meant for the conservation of thermal energy,
worth 80 million dollars, in the towns of Pascani, Buzau, Fagaras,
Oltenita and Ploiesti. An agreement will be signed in 1999 with
the Spanish Government on the 300,000-dollar free funding of
feasibility surveys and technical projects for village running
water supply and sewerage.
</P>
<P>
Adding to these projects, that will be completed in 2001, will
be the projects of the newly established National Housing Agency,
which will give credits for house building, buying,
rehabilitation, consolidation and extension.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in recent years, 30 billion lei (about 2.7
million U.S. dollars) will be alloted in 1999 for the
consolidation of the buildings prone to seismic risk.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Returns from Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Thursday returned from the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) where he had consultative talks with President Laurent
Kabila, describing the meeting as " extremely good."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press on arrival at the Lusaka international
airport, Chiluba said the meeting with Kabila over the conflict in
that country went on well and expressed hope that the peace
precess would be on course.
</P>
<P>
He said there was need to give more time to the foreign
affairs and defense ministers from the region who are meeting in
Lusaka for consultations to exhaust all thorny issues surrounding
the peace initiative before the heads of state could convene a
final summit.
</P>
<P>
The two days are inadequate for the ministers to complete the
consultations and come up with a complete document, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the rebels fighting to topple Kabila's
government will be allowed in the meeting for foreign affairs and
defense ministers which started on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he said that it was too early to say whether or not the
rebels will be allowed in the meeting of heads of state which has
been scheduled for January 16 and 17.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba was mandated by the Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) to spearhead the peace process over the DRC
conflict.

<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will
establish a regional office in Nicosia which will offer its
expertise on aviation safety both locally and to clients in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The CAA will also establish a full time presence on the island
of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, increasing the total number of
CAA overseas offices to eight.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The number of tourists to Israel declined by 4
percent in 1998 compared with that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 2,198,800 tourists visited the country and 1.9
million of them stayed at least one night.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Brazilian government officially notified the
Israeli Supercom company early this week that it won a 130 million

<HEADLINE> Agency: Curb on Russian Space Launches to Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. actions aimed at
restricting Russia's launches of foreign satellites will harm
several U.S. companies, Russian Space Agency Deputy Director Yuri
Milov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The comment came after the U.S. State Department's suggestions
Wednesday that cooperation with Russia in commercial satellite
launches may be frozen unless Moscow gives up its aid to Iran in
the development of missiles.
</P>
<P>
Milov said U.S. companies willingly use the tested and reliable
Proton booster-rockets, different versions of which have been in
use since 1965. The cost of a Proton-assisted satellite launch is
significantly lower than with U.S. rockets, the Atlas-2 in
particular, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The estimated world need for launching satellites to
geostationary orbits exceeds 30 a year. It will be difficult to
meet that demand without the Protons, Milov said.
</P>
<P>
He said leading U.S. satellite manufacturers Hughes, Lockheed
Martin and Loral had in the past asked the U.S. Congress to
increase the quota of American satellite launches by Russia to
more rapidly establish the geostationary network that meets U.S.
national interests.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin said that
the launch quota of 16 American satellites given to Russia will
run out this year. If progress in missile nonproliferation is not
reached, the U.S. will be unable to increase the quota, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
Milov denied any ties between Iran and the Russian companies
controlled by the Space Agency, adding that the companies are in
no way connected with the production of long- or short-range
missiles.
</P>
<P>
"There are appropriate instructions in the industry and all
companies strictly follow them. Space Agency Director Yuri Koptev
sees to it carefully," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has risen in recent days between Washington and Moscow
over the latter's alleged provision of nuclear and missile
technologies to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. announced Tuesday the imposition of sanctions against
Russia's Research Institute of Energy Technology, the Moscow
Aviation Institute and the Mendeleyev Chemical Technology
University for allegedly helping Iran's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry lambasted the sanctions, saying
Washington's move may "complicate" bilateral ties and will "not go
unanswered."

ADDIS ABABA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Thursday strongly condemned the latest attempt to overthrow the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone and reiterated
its full support for President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and his

<HEADLINE> German Banks Prepared for Brazil Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- German banks said Thursday they
had not been caught unprepared for the financial turbulence in
Brazil. In a survey by Deutsche Presse Agentur (dpa), the banks
said they had been keeping Brazil on their "watch list" for
months.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that while other foreign investment
houses had been pulling capital out of Brazil, the German banks
said they were not making any fundamental changes in their
business policy in the region.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, leads with exposure in
Latin America with a loan portfolio amounting to 4.4 billion marks
(2.6 billion U.S. dollars). Of that amount, 2.3 billion marks(1.4
billion dollars) are in short-term loans. Brazil is by far the
biggest recipient.
</P>
<P>
"The risk has become clearer with each passing month," said
Elke Speidel-Walz, Latin American expert at Deutsche Bank. She
admitted that the bank had not been expecting the Brazilian crunch
until the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank spokesman Ronald Weichert said that the bank's
lending portfolio in Brazil, via a subsidiary bank, was mainly to
multinational companies, whose quality was regarded as "good".
</P>
<P>
Commerzbank said it has an exposure of 1.8 billion marks(1.1
billion dollars ) in the region.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Peter Pietsch blasted what he called the "hysteria
beyond measure" in the reaction of European exchanges to the
stocks plunge in Brazil. He said the Americans, though more
greatly affected by the crisis, had reacted with much greater
calm.
</P>
<P>
Pietsch said he was "cautiously optimistic" about Brazil's
long- term prospects, noting that the country is rich in raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
"The potential is there. If the prices on the raw materials
market rise again, then the region will recover," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Hails Senegal's Decision to Ban Female Genital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Thursday applauded the Parliament of
Senegal for its approval late on Wednesday of legislation to ban
female genital mutilation (FGM).
</P>
<P>
FGM is a painful, traumatic and dangerous procedure which
partially or totally removes female genitals.
</P>
<P>
"Senegal's action is of great significance, because it reflects
the resolve of African women to end a cruel and unacceptable
practice which violates the right of all girls to free, safe and
healthy lives," UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 130 million
women and girls -- the bulk of them in 28 African countries --
have been subjected to female genital mutilation. More than two
million, ranging age from infants a few days old to mature women,
are genitally mutilated every year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan account for
75 percent of all cases. In Djibouti and Somalia, 98 percent of
girls are mutilated.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, together with WHO and the United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA), have actively supported the global movement to
sharply reduce FGM in the next decade and eliminate it completely
within three generations.
</P>
<P>
In Senegal, UNICEF provided financial and communication support
to local non-governmental organizations which helped spark the
movement against genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the legislation is a testament to the courage of
the Senegalese women of the village of Malicounda who began the
movement to overturn FGM, a custom profoundly entrenched in many
traditional societies.
</P>
<P>
Senegal's legislation, which provides stiff fines and jail
terms for offenders, was passed after hearings in which village
women lobbied the Parliament for support to abolish the practice.
To date, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Djibouti, Ghana,
Guinea and Togo have outlawed FGM.
</P>
<P>
"Women around the world who have the courage to take a stand on
female genital mutilation need sustained international support in
order to convince their societies to move away from this
horrendous practice," Bellamy said.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Hails Planned Return of EU Ambassadors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Belarus on Thursday hailed the
planned return of European Union countries' ambassadors who left
Belarus after being evicted from their residences several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors' return, scheduled for Sunday, is "evidence of
a constructive approach by both sides to overcoming temporary
difficulties existing in the relations between the republic and
the European Union," Interfax quoted the Belarussian Foreign
Ministry as saying in a press release.
</P>

The ambassadors of EU countries and the United States left
Minsk last summer the Belarussian government decided to move them
from lodgings on a presidential compound, claiming the buildings
needed renovation.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued last month by Belarus and the

as possible while the EU stated its acceptance of the diplomats'
vacation of their former lodgings but said EU officials would
inspect the compound within a month after the ambassadors are
back, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
There are plans to have the International Monetary Fund
involved in the deal as well because an IMF envoy is living on the
same compound, Interfax said in the dispatch from Minsk.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes 6 Bln Dlrs for Hiring Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday proposed a five-year, over 6 billion U.S. dollar package
to raise the ante on his nearly fulfilled pledge to put 100,000
new officers on the beat nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"It'll be the best investment we can make in a safe future for
our children, and I hope we can pass it with your help," Clinton
said during a ceremony at a police station in Alexandria of
Virginia State.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals have the best technology. Police should, too,"
Clinton said. "For too long, we have seen criminals go free
because the method to gather evidence is not up to date.... Police
carry a heavy burden, but we know they can't carry it alone."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's new budget will ask Congress for 1.3 billion dollars
in fiscal 2000 -- and a total of 6.4 billion dollars over the next
five years -- to extend the COPS program, said Jose Cerda, a crime
specialist on the White House Domestic Policy Council. New hires
under the program are expected to meet that goal by mid-year. As
of October last year, the Justice Department reported the total
had reached 88,500 and was climbing.
</P>
<P>
The balanced-budget agreement reached by Clinton and
congressional Republicans in 1996 planned to phase out COPS,
allotting 300 million dollars for fiscal 2000 and then shutting it
down the following year.
</P>
<P>
In the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics
mid-year report, due for release Thursday, the total number of
violent crimes in the U.S. for 1998 -- both incidents reported to
police and those unreported -- is expected to fall below 3 million
for the first time since 1973, when the bureau started its annual
interviews with crime victims.

BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Thursday
appealed to the warring parties in southern Sudan to prolong the
cease-fire due to expire Friday and extend it to other parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Old Man Saved Seven Lives in Southern Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- In an act of bravery, an old man
saved the lives of seven people who had been marooned on an island
on Nyanyadzi River in southern Zimbabwe after Air Force
helicopters failed to reach the area to rescue the people due to
bad weather Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Francis Mubvuta told the Zimbabwe News Agency
Thursday that six school children, who were marooned on the island
for more than 12 hours, were saved by the old man from Nyanhanda
village.
</P>
<P>
According to Mubvuta, the old man who refused to give his name,
dived into the flooded Nyanyadzi River as the children's parents
and police officers looked helplessly from the river banks, and
brought the children and a 39-year  old woman to safety one by
one. The woman had been escorting the children to school when
they were caught in the middle of the island.
</P>
<P>
The children had successfully crossed the river but a gush of
water suddenly came from the upper stream resulting in them being
marooned on the island.
</P>
<P>
Fears were that they could have been swept away if they had
spent the night on the island waiting for the Air Force
helicopters to come the following morning as the rains continued
pounding the area.
</P>
<P>
Three of the children were aged 13, one was 10 and the other 16
years with one adult man managing to swim to safety after the
water had subsided for some time.
</P>
<P>
"The old man was real brave and he managed to save the
remaining six people from the island as villagers and police
officers could only watch and see as they had given up hope as it
was so late," said Mubvuta.

<HEADLINE> IFC Offers Grants for Kenya's Small Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) has approved to issue a loan worth 30 million
U.S. Dollars to Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) in a project aimed at
boosting the country's small business.
</P>
<P>
The project will channel foreign exchange to the private sector
in the east African country, according to a report reaching here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The project involves lending by KCB to export-oriented small
and medium enterprises (SMEs), which use the funding to
rehabilitate, restructure and expand investments in the
agro-business, manufacturing and tourism sectors, " said the
report quoting an IFC statement issued in Washington late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, IFC's involvement is expected to strengthen KCB's
 management information systems as well as its operating policies
and procedures by promoting best practices and good governance in
the banking sector,'' the IFC said, but offered no details on
interest or loan repayment.
</P>
<P>
KCB is the east African region's largest retail bank and one of
the leading long-term finance providers to SMEs. It is mainly
owned by the public through the Nairobi Stock Exchange while the
government holds a minority 35 percent stake.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Solar Eclipse Offers Chance to Romania's Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Romania could relaunch its
tourism by taking full advantage of the total solar eclipse of
this August 11, the last in this millennium, the national Rompres
news agency said in a Thursday report.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon is extremely rare, happening once in about 350
years. Of the 10 European countries traveled by the eclipse,
Romania is a privileged one since the point of most visibility of
the eclipse will be in the vicinity of Ramnicu Valcea town of
southern Romania.
</P>
<P>
Bucharest will be the only European capital city to be right in
the center of the totality path and also has the only solar
telescope in Europe that can be used during the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
All the information also reached the Internet and represents,
at present, the most efficient promotion a Romanian tourism area
could ever have, the report said. It stressed that the eclipse is
an extraordinary chance offered to Romanian tourism this year, the
more so as thousands of curious people are to travel from distant
places in order to see the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Ramnicu Valcea town is already considered the capital of the
eclipse, and most of the tourists are to meet here according to
the tourist program's offers. The most attractive offers are those
having as the eclipse's seeing point Ramnicu Valcea town, a
reference one for Romanian tourism, with considerable lodging
capacities, in spas like Calimanesti-Caciulata, Govora, Olanesti,
Ocnele Mari, and Voineasa.
</P>
<P>
The list of the places wherefrom the eclipse can be seen also
includes places like Mangalia town on the Black Sea coast,
Romania's capital city Bucharest and Timisoara city of western
Romania where a telescope was fixed, that can be used by the
tourists.
</P>
<P>
One of the places that will take very much advantage of the
eclipse is Mangalia, having the biggest benefit as it lies on the
Black Sea shore and the eclipse occurs in full summer holiday. For
the time on August 8-15, as much as 80 percent of the lodging
capacities were reserved by contracts.
</P>
<P>
Romanian tourism officials expect a flow of about 500,000
tourists during the total solar eclipse time.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Proposes Iraq Sells More Oil for Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday proposed to the United Nations to allow Iraq to sell as
much oil as it wants to purchase food and medicine for its people,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be talking with our allies in the Security Council
about eliminating the ceiling on funds from oil exports which
can be used for food and medicine," said one of the
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
The proposal comes when France proposed on Tuesday to lift
the oil embargo on Iraq out of concern that it has become the
"wrong tool" to achieve U.N. goals in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said the U.S. proposal was made to other
members of the Security Council at U.N. headquarters in New York
during closed-door consultations.
</P>
<P>
They said Washington was making the proposal to take away
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's ability "to use the welfare of
his own people to gain sympathy."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman David Leavy declined to discuss the
specifics of the U.S. proposals.
</P>
<P>
But he said: "The United States is determined to work with our
friends and allies in th region and on the Security Council to
assist the Iraqi people. Our problem is with Saddam Hussein's
regime, the same regime that has neglected the needs of the
Iraqi population for many years."
</P>
<P>
Iraq now is allowed to sell $5.25 billion every six months to
buy food, medicine and other supplies under a tightly controlled
program.
</P>
<P>
But it is only able to sell about $3 billion in that time
frame because of its dilapidated oil industry and low oil
prices.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM: U.S. Sanctions Counterproductive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday that U.S. threats of sanctions against Russia
in the past few days are counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
"The standard of our bilateral relations, political dialogue
and cooperation is such today that it provides the possibility of
discussing any questions at a professional level," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Any threats or allusions of sanctions are outdated instruments
contradicting the current standard of our bilateral relations,"
Interfax quoted the foreign minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These are instruments of the old times which we are trying to
discard together," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the United States announced sanctions against three
Russian scientific institutes, accusing them of helping Iran's
nuclear and missile programs.
</P>
<P>
A day later, Washington said cooperation with Russia in
commercial satellite launches may be frozen unless Moscow gives up
its aid to Iran in the development of missiles.
</P>
<P>
Russia has vehemently denied the charges as groundless and said
they would hurt bilateral ties and it would not "commit suicide"
in making neighboring Iran a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
"Certain information (which the United States regards as
evidence of the institutes' cooperation with Iran) has been
submitted and is currently being analyzed by appropriate Russian
institutions," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Later we will discuss the information with American experts,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not mutual threats and charges but a calm, serious discussion
of all the existing issues is needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed several channels to discuss any disputed
matters -- questions related to Iran, weapons of mass destruction,
missile technologies," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is not a question of putting up the problem for public
discussion. Every problem should be regarded concretely, at expert
level instead of engaging in mutual reprimands and threats,"
Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"These questions will evidently be a subject of discussion with
First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov who is currently
staying in the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the issue will also top the agenda when U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visits Moscow later this
month.
</P>
<P>
"The consideration of such delicate matters should not be over
politicized or dramatized," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
"Such questions have arisen in the past too and we have always
found solutions which on the one hand removed the possible
concerns and on the other did not hinder the normal development of
bilateral relations," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Talks on G8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Thursday it was time to debate setting currency
exchange rate corridors.
</P>
<P>
"There are different shadings -- such as over the question of
exchange rate fluctuation margins -- but the principle that
laissez faire is not an appropriate policy for these markets has
won over," said Schroeder at a Berlin news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the idea of laissez faire non-intervention in
world finance markets was finished.
</P>
<P>
The question of whether to set corridors, within which
currencies could fluctuate, would be on the agenda at the next
Group of Eight (G8) summit of wealthy industrial nations plus
Russia in Cologne this June, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say if it will come to currency exchange rate
corridors -- to integrate Bretton Woods in the new system -- there
are a few questions which need to be cleared up," said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
"The central question is: if one does this -- and I won't give
an opinion -- what does defense (of a currency) cost. This is the
decisive point and we have to invest some work in this question,"
said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
G8 finance minister would meet in February to begin debate on
possible new measures which would then be on the agenda at the
June 18-20 Cologne summit.
</P>
<P>
A triad of agreements would need to be made at the G8 summit,
he said.
</P>
<P>
These included:
</P>
<P>
-- Moves to allow more transparency in financial markets;
</P>
<P>
-- More government coordination of markets;
</P>
<P>
-- Better incorporation of the private sector than in the past
in both of the above areas.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder also said his government would insist on looking
beyond mere economic criteria at the summit.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no reasonable development of the poorer regions
of the world if one believes that only economic questions can be
accommodated. Without including social and environmental questions
we will have crashes again and again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Likely to Be Realized in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A ceasefire in the week-long
fighting in the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown is likely to be
realized after the rebels made a ceasefire proposal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffigoh, his Cote d'Ivoire
counterpart Amara Essy and the U.N. special representative in
Sierra Leone, Francis Okelo, are waiting Thursday for a response
from Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, reports reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
After rebel leader Foday Sankoh spoke Wednesday with the top
rebel military commander Sam Bockarie by telephone, the rebels are
demanding the release of Sankoh as a condition for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh has agreed to sign a ceasefire if he is released from
prison and sent to a neutral country and his rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) is recognized as a political party.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting with Kabbah, U.N. mediator Okelo said he
was optimistic about sealing a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I am very hopeful we will make a breakthrough in ceasefire
negotiations, " the senior U.N. official stated.
</P>
<P>
An aide to field commander Bockarie was quoted as saying that
he believed Sankoh might be freed and taken to a neutral country
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
RUF spokesman Omrie Golley confirmed that Sankoh and Bockarie
had had two phone conversations which were described as "quite
positive".
</P>
<P>
"We remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to get a
ceasefire, " said the spokesman, adding that he was flying later
on Thursday to Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, where the
rebels want Sankoh to be taken to once he is released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG has
summoned a crack Nigerian regiment to help flush rebels out of
the hills around Freetown, an ECOMOG source said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's 72nd Airborne Regiment was scheduled to arrive in
Sierra Leone capital on Thursday afternoon, the source added.
</P>
<P>
"Last time we made the mistake of not going all the way, this
time we're going to finish the job," the source noted.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the eviction of Sierra Leone's former
military junta from Freetown in February 1998 by ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and rebels allied to the junta retreated to the north
and east of Sierra Leone and continued their fight against the
government before launching an attack on the capital on January 6.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Control Flow of Shoddy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will soon adopt
regulations to control flow of shoddy products into the country,
Daimon Mwakyembe, the director of Tanzania Bureau of Standards
(TBS), said in Dar es Salaam Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which is to endorse the
regulations, will empower TBS to take actions against unscrupulous
importers, Mwakyembe said.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of liberalized trade and free market
policies in the country, some businessmen have tended to import
low quality products which almost turned the country into a
dumping ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shoddy products are endangering people's safety and
health, said the director of TBS, whose role is to check the
quality of products.
</P>
<P>
"After TBS gets the certification right, no sub-standard
products will be allowed into the country," Mwakyembe said.
</P>
<P>
Mwakyembe said low quality safety matches are flooding the
Tanzanian market, adding that Tanzania has declared compulsory
standards for safety matches which should be observed by both
local and imported products.
</P>
<P>
TBS has so far certified Kibo Match Group Ltd's three products
-- Kangaroo, Lucky and Leopard, which bear TBS standard mark of
quality, said Mwakyembe, who advised the public to abstain from
buying matches without his bureau's certification mark.

<HEADLINE> German Chemical Industry Output Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's chemical sector, a key
pillar of the economy, saw a 0.5 percent production drop in 1998,
the Chemical Industry Association (VCI) said Thursday in
Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
The VCI said turnover in the sector came to 187 billion marks
(110 billion U.S. dollars), down one percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot was exports, which increased 4.5 percent

WASHINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. researchers at Montana
University has developed a new AIDS vaccine and laboratory tests
suggest it can attack HIV at a vulnerable moment of the virus'
infection cycle.
</P>
<P>
They developed antibodies in mice that attack HIV just as the
virus was in the process of fusing with target cells, U.S. Science
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fusion process exposed HIV molecules that are not open to
attack at other times in the infection cycle. Researchers injected
this exposed molecules into mice, and the mice that had been
genetically manipulated to respond to HIV made antibodies against
the fusion molecules.
</P>
<P>
The tests in laboratory suggest that the antibodies were able
to neutralize 23 of 24 strains of the virus.

<HEADLINE> Smuggling Causes 2.2 Billion Dollar Loss to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Increasing smuggling of
imported goods in Pakistan causes a colossal loss of 100 billion
rupees (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) per annum to the national
exchequer.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling has almost adopted the shape of a parallel economy in
Pakistan which is eating up big chunk of the national resources
every year and the mushroom growth of the markets flooded with
smuggled goods are spreading in every nook and corner of the
country, especially in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP).
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said in a report Friday
that every successive government in Pakistan take stock of the
matter and expressed its concern over the menace of smuggling, but
they have failed to curb this disease from its roots.
</P>
<P>
Local traders contribute a big sum annually in the national
exchequre in the shape of various taxes while those markets which
contain smuggled goods worth millions of dollars not pay a single
penny in the national development, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The tax free business in these illegal markets have enabled the
people to establish their empires on sound footings at the cost of
the national economy, it added.
</P>
<P>
The present government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made
certain changes soon after coming to power in February 1997 in the
top hierarchy of the Central Board of Revenue in a bid to enhance
revenue collection and to curb the smuggling hazard.
</P>
<P>
The government is now devising various policies to review the
Afghan Transit Trade (ATT) Agreement. It has put 17 items of ATT
on negative list and prohibited its import in order to discourage
smuggling and to give boost to the indigenous products, the
government put 17 items of ATT on negative list and prohibited its
import.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the increasing smuggling, President of the Sarhad
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ghulam Sarwar Khan said, it only
required will and determination of the government to get rid of
this menace.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should give three-month time
to the shopkeepers in those markets flooded with smuggled goods to
wind up their business and after the expiry of the period, the
government should launch a full fledge operation against them and
seized the smuggled goods.
</P>
<P>
In the present circumstances, he said, the traders of NWFP
could not compete with other parts of the country unless smuggling
is totally eliminated or the markets of smuggled goods are brought
under the tax net.
</P>
<P>
Leading industrialist and former state minister for industries
Muhammad Unis Elahi said that the government should appoint a
committee for checking this menace.
</P>
<P>
However, the long-running problem could not be cleared
overnight and it would take time to change the habit of the
people, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- As recommended by Prime
Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepali King Birendra Friday
dissolved the Lower House of Parliament for fresh polls on May 3,
the King's Principal Press Secretariat said in a notice.
</P>
<P>
The present tri-partite government, which was formed in late
December to conduct elections, will continue its function, and the
king hoped that it will hold the elections in a free, fair and
impartial manner, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's parliament is composed of the Lower House, the Upper
House and the king. The Upper House will continue its six-year
term.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat Lower House which was constituted after the
mid-term polls in November 1994 was dissolved one day after its
15th session passed the vote of confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
As no single party held a majority in the house, the Himalayan
kingdom has witnessed six governments since November 1994.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Koirala said that elections were the only way
out and the present government would not make any other major
decisions as its main objective was to conduct elections.
</P>
<P>
He is still expecting more parties to join the coalition of the
Nepali Congress (NC), the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party to form
a national government for the polls.
</P>
<P>
The faction of the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by
former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand has expressed its
desire to enter.
</P>
<P>
The present government was formed following the collapse on
December 10 of the three-and-half-a-month coalition between the NC
and the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML).

Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
In the reforms and the socialist market economy, whether the
People's Liberation Army retains its original nature and remains
invincible is an important matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the anti-corruption drive this year, emphasis should be
placed on stopping business operations and paid services and
combating extravagance and unhealthy tendencies in promoting
officers.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Finance Minister's Meeting Kicks Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers from 10 Asian
nations and the 15 European Union member states are meeting on
Friday in Frankfurt for talks on currency exchange rate
corridors, the Asian crisis, and the currency devaluation in
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
"We all have a strong interest in stabilizing currencies,"
said Yves Thibault de Silguy, the European Commissioner
responsible for Europe's single currency, the euro, at a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to bolster exchange rate stability, Germany and Japan
have called for setting currency exchange rate corridors, a move
that is opposed by the European Central Bank and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"In a world of free capital movements exchange rates cannot be
set by decree," said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
He said the key to greater currency stability should instead
be reached through cooperation aimed at reducing economic
divergence.
</P>
<P>
On the growing Brazil crisis, de Silguy termed the situation
"worrying," but stressed that it did not reflect the
vulnerability of the international system as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Europe, he said, is better placed to deal with any spill-over
from Brazil than it would have been just six months ago due to
the euro.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Asia-Europe Finance Minister Meeting (ASEM) will
concentrate on European economic and monetary union issues Friday
and deal with developments in Asia Saturday.

SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The share prices on the Seoul

<HEADLINE> All SAARC Members to Participate in Dhaka Commerce Ministers' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- All the seven member countries of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have
confirmed their participation in the third SAARC Commerce
Ministers' Meeting scheduled for early February, the Foreign
Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce ministers from India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, the Maldives and Bangladesh will review SAARC's efforts in
strengthening regional economic cooperation at the two-day meeting
on February 2-3, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be preceded by the 10th meeting of Committee
on Economic Cooperation at the secretary-level from January 21 to
February 1.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the Commerce Ministers' Meeting is to
increase economic cooperation, particularly in trade and commerce
among SAARC countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite high hopes, the South Asian Preferential Trade
Arrangement (SAPTA), which was adopted in 1993 to enhance trade
and business among the member countries, has failed to achieve the
expectations of its members, the BSS quoted a ministry source as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Instead of an increase, the intra-SAARC trade has fallen in the
post-SAPTA era, the source said, adding that trade volume within
the group is only about 4 percent of the combined two-way trade of
all the seven member states amounting to over 100 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The second SAARC commerce ministers' meeting was held in
Islamabad in April last year, and the first was held in New Delhi
in 1996.

<P>
"It is not with a marginal improvement of the existing
mechanism that one can answer in a lasting manner the new
situation (in Iraq)," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman
Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
But she said the French government welcomes all proposals
aimed at alleviating the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"All that gives attention to the humanitarian problems of the
Iraqi people goes in the good direction," she said. "The regime
of sanctions has shown that it is inefficient."
</P>
<P>
France has proposed lifting the oil embargo on Iraq and the
establishment of a new monitoring system to ensure that Baghdad
does not re-arm itself.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that Iraq does not become a threat to its
neighbors again. This is why some sanctions should remain," said
the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She was referring to the embargo on weapons and technologies
that can be used for both civilian and military purposes and for
freezing Iraqi assets abroad.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Offers Incentives in Anti-Drug Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
offering cash prizes to the regional law enforcement units that
will be able to catch the biggest number of drug pushers and
recover the most quantity of drugs, government official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Panfilo Lacson, director of the Presidential Anti-Organized
Crime Task Force, said in an interview that his force and the
Philippine National Police have agreed on the cash incentives to
boost the government's anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the provision of the incentives is part of Philippine
President Joseph Estrada's program aimed at making the country
virtually drug-free by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said his force and the police agreed to release funds to
mobilize law enforcers against drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Aside from his force, other agencies tapped to counter the drug
trade include the police, the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and
the Bureau of Immigration, Lacson said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the law enforcement community took part in a
two-day workshop to give flesh to Estrada's order to mount an
all-out war against drug trafficking.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A leading official of the
Hong Kong Sports Development Board (SDB) assured here Friday that
athletes from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
will get full support to pursue sporting excellence.
</P>
<P>
Billy Kong, SDB's acting chairman, said it was one of the top
priorities of the Board to provide a comprehensive support system
to athletes.
</P>
<P>
When officiating the 1998 Asian Games Athlete Incentive Awards
Scheme presentation ceremony here Friday evening, Kong said: "The
SDB is firmly committed to meeting the needs of athletes by
offering a comprehensive system in the area of technical,
academic, career and personal development support. When it comes
to big sporting occasions, athletes can draw inspiration from the
incentive awards schemes, such as the one for the Bangkok Asian
Games."
</P>
<P>
The Sports Aid Foundation, administered by the SDB, handed out
a cash incentive of 5.15 million HK dollars to medal winners at
Asian Games in Bangkok last month, together with three corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong SAR collected five gold, six silver and six bronze
medals in Bangkok with golds from cycling, snooker, windsurfing,

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's Son Sann Party Merges With FUNCINPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Son Sann Party
officially merged with FUNCINPEC party Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, president of FUNCINPEC and the
chairman of the National Assembly, told the reporters that "the
merger does not mean to have a confrontation with others, the sole
purpose we did it is to rebuild our country in the interests of
the national unity."
</P>
<P>
In 1979, Son Sann, one of Cambodia's oldest politicians,
founded the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, a resistance
movement considered to be the fore-runner to the Son Sann Party.
</P>
<P>
"If we merged earlier, our party will be stronger than it is
now," Ranariddh said. The good relations between Son Sann and
FUNCINPEC supporters can date back to the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Son Sann Party's predecessor, the Buddhist Liberal
Democratic Party founded in 1992, won 10 Assembly seats in 1993.
But since then, the party's power has been declined. A faction led
by deputy leader Ieng Mouly broke away in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The party's problems were compounded by the retirement of
long-time leader Son Sann last March and the ascension of his son
and political heir Son Soubert to the Constitutional Council last
August.
</P>
<P>
Although the merger will not pose a direct threat to the
Cambodian People's Party (CPP), the move will provide nearly
100,000 additional supporters to FUNCINPEC, which may have an
effect on the upcoming commune elections, analysts here believed.

<HEADLINE> Israel Accused of Planning to Transfer Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said Friday that Israel wants to carry out a plan to
transfer 3 million Palestinian refugees to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the remarks at the Friday prayers congregation
on the campus of Tehran University following a massive rally to
mark the International Al-Qods (Jerusalem) Day.
</P>
<P>
"I am in possession of some documents concerning a scheme to
transfer 3 million Palestinian refugees to Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel intends to move the Palestinians to western Iraq, near
borders with Jordan and Syria, where there is a vast tract of
desert, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the possible Israeli move is to create a new
problem in Iraq, which has already plagued by the woes on Kurds
and Turks.
</P>
<P>
However, Rafsanjani, who is now head of Iran's State Expediency
Council, did not give more details about the issue, but further
accused Israel of continuing to pursue its expansionist policies
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
The council serves as a powerful advisory body to the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and a arbitrary organization
to solve differences between the three branches of the government.
</P>
<P>
Before the prayers congregation, tens of thousands marched to
Tehran University, shouting slogans condemning Israeli for its
expansionist and aggressive policies.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also burnt several U.S. and Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen years ago, late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Musavi Khomeini announced the last Friday of the Islamic fasting
month of Ramadan as the International Al-Qods Day to show the
support of the Muslim world for the Palestinian struggle against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an eight-point resolution read out at the end of the rally,
the demonstrators called for continued resistance and struggle
"until elimination of the aggressor Zionist (Israeli) regime" and
campaign against the arrogant powers, led by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
It urged unity and solidarity among Muslim states and called
for mobilization of Muslims' facilities to support the Palestinian
nation until liberation of the holy city of Jerusalem from the
control of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rapping any compromise and talks with Israel, the resolution
stressed that such moves will have no result but to undermine the
trend for liberation of the holy Al-Qods and throw obstacles on
the way of the Palestinian people's struggle against the Israel.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges OPEC to Cut Oil Output to Raise Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani Friday called on the members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut their
oil output to shore up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the call at the Friday prayers congregation on
the campus of Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
He proposed the OPEC cut its current production ceiling of 27
million barrels per day (bpd) to 16 million bpd for a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps our revenues will reduce temporarily, but in this way
we would be able to control the market," he said, adding that the
drop in oil prices was certainly a plot and its continuation is a
"dangerous game."
</P>
<P>
Oil price plunged to a historical low point in 1998 due to the
widespread financial crisis and oversupply and there have no
signs of recovery so far, which delt a heavy blow on the
oil-dependent Iranian economy.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC, the 11-member oil cartel, produces about 40 percent
of world's crude and the bulk of it is exported onto the global
markets. It production, undoubtedly, can influence the world oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that Iran's oil revenues in the current Iranian
calendar year ending March 20 will be no more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The former Iranian president underlined that all OPEC member
countries need a "serious resolve" to make up their minds to cut
output.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC members and other oil producers should not fear a
temporary drop in production and must realize that it will be in
their interests, said Rafsanjani, who is now head of Iran's State
Expediency Council, a powerful advisory body for the Iranian
supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that if the OPEC decides to accept his
proposal, it should also try to seek the cooperation of non-OPEC
producers so that they will not fill the market with extra oil.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested a monitoring committee set oil price in
conformity with the market demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea said it will propose
establishing a military hot line with the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) to ease tensions at next week's
four-party talks on the Korean Peninsula in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Park Kun-woo, chief South Korean delegate to the talks, said
Friday that a hot line between South Korean and DPRK military
authorities will be a first step in building mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
"The military hot line between the two Koreas is one of the
issues to be discussed at the tension-reduction subcommittee,"
Park said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks, which involves South Korea, the DPRK,
the United States and China, and are aimed at establishing
enduring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, will open i
n Geneva January 19-22.
</P>
<P>
In the past three rounds of talks, the four parties reached an
agreement to establish two subcommittees. One is in charge of a
new peace accord while the other will attempt to manage military
tension on the Korean Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Former President Urges End to Factional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Former President
Hashemi Rafsanjani Friday urged all rival political factions in
Iran to stop their propaganda campaigns and accusations against
each other over the recent killings of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
Such kind of clash will only please the enemies who are after
every opportunity to condemn the Islamic system and bring the
Islamic revolutionary values under question, Rafsanjani said at
the Friday prayers congregation in Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the continuation of these futile debates will
also disappoint the people.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani made the appeal after the powerful conservatives
blamed supporters of moderate President Mohammad Khatami for
being behind the mysterious murders of an opposition leader, his
wife and three dissident writers late last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the admission by the conservative-dominated
Intelligence Ministry that some of its agents were involved in the
killings, a senior conservative official Monday openly blamed the
murders on Khatami's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Rowhollah Husseinian, head of the Islamic Revolution Documents
Center and former Deputy Intelligence Minister, said that those
involved in the killings were from the left-wing faction and
convinced supporters of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
He said that the killings were part of the attempt of the
pro-Khatami left-wing faction to seize the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Husseinian's words shocked the Iranian nation and reports said
that Khatami will sue the conservative-dominated TV station,
Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB), for broadcasting the
speech.
</P>
<P>
The president's office has decided to lodge a complaint
against the IRIB, an informed source told local daily Tehran Times
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another daily Khordad reported Thursday that the
cabinet Wednesday night decided to deprive IRIB Chairman Ali
Larijani of the right to attend cabinet meetings.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani,who is now head of the State Expediency Council, an
advisory body for the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said
that what has happened has badly tarnished Iran's international
image, apparently referring to the killings.
</P>
<P>
The perpetrators will be punished for what they have done, he
assured the crowd.

<HEADLINE> China to Construct Qinhuangdao-Shenyang Railway Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China will soon build an
electrified passenger railway line from Qinhuangdao, a port city
in north China's Hebei Province, to Shenyang, capital of the
northeast China province of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Shenyang Railway Administration said that the
new railway line will be double tracked with a total length of
404.47 kilometers, and can accommodate speeds up to 200
kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
Listed as one of the country's key projects for the 1996-2000
period, the new railway line will cost 15 billion yuan, which
will be fully covered by the government, and will be completed
and commissioned in 2003.
</P>
<P>
By then, train speed on the new line will be faster than on
the Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Harbin, Beijing-Guangzhou and
Shenyang-Dalian railway lines, and it will take only two hours
for a trip from Qinhuangdao to Shenyang as against the present
four and a half hours.
</P>
<P>
The building of the new railway will alleviate the serious
congestion for freight transport in northeast China, and will
help double the region's railway freight volume, said an expert
with the Shenyang Railways Administration.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Washington Ask for Full Access to Suspected DPRK Nuke Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and the United
States Friday demanded full access to the suspected underground
nuclear facilities in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and urged the country to abandon its long-range missile
development program.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the construction at Kumchang-ri, north of
Pyongyang, would be clarified as soon as possible and the DPRK
must abide by the October 1994 Agreed Framework and dismantle its
nuclear facilities, said a joint statement issued after a meeting
between South Korean Defense Minister Chun Yong-taek and visiting
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen here.
</P>
<P>
"We are not suggesting there is conclusive evidence, but we
believe there is sufficient evidence for us to be suspicious, and
the suspicions must be addressed," said Cohen at a joint news
conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Chun said Seoul and Washington will take joint measures after
obtaining concrete and conclusive evidence on the suspected
underground nuclear weapons facilities.
</P>
<P>
Since last year after media reports of the suspected nuclear
facilities, Washington has demanded an access to the suspected
nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the underground facility is non-nuclear, the
DPRK said that it will allow a one-time inspection of the site if
the United States pays 300 million. U.S. dollars for compensation.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington rejected Pyongyang's demand.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the United States and South Korea
urged the DPRK to cease its testfire, development and export of
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Last August, Pyongyang testfired a missile, demonstrating its
capability to launch weapons of mass destruction over long
distance.
</P>
<P>
"Such a capability will pose a threat to peace and stability
in Northeast Asia," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also appealed to the DPRK to accede to the
Chemical Weapons Convention, saying "the use of weapons of mass
destruction such as chemical and biological weapons would not be
tolerated in any situation."
</P>
<P>
At Friday's meeting, Chun and Cohen discussed practical
steps, including the early deployment of U.S. reinforcements in
an emergency or for deterrence against a possible DPRK attack by
chemical and biological weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cohen reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to render pr
ompt and effective assistance to South Korea against any armed
attack and to provide a nuclear umbrella for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Seoul Thursday and met with South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung Friday, is to leave for home late Friday.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Statistics-Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to step up reform
of its statistics-gathering system in order to guarantee quality
statistics, and over the next three years a sample survey of
statistics among enterprises in one-third of the country's provin
ces will be conducted.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, director of the National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS), told a working conference on statistics which ended
today.  Liu said this survey will include
small-scale industrial firms with annual sales under five million
yuan, and privately owned wholesale and catering businesses.
</P>
<P>
To prevent irregularities in data collecting, the NBS will
allow large industrial firms to report their monthly economic
operations directly to the NBS, and 5,000 key enterprises are
expected to link their computers with the NBS.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the NBS plans to create an assessment policy on
both the national and provincial level for major statistical
figures such as gross domestic products and industrial
value-added amounts, industrial growth rate, and population
growth.
</P>
<P>
Those who are found guilty of providing fraudulent statistics
will be severely punished. To hasten construction of its
information network, the NBS will open the China Statistics
Information Network by the beginning of March.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Vegetables Become Presents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing residents are turning
away from traditional gifts for family and friends and many now
buy fresh vegetables to wrap up and give as presents on special
occasions.
</P>
<P>
Even though it is winter there is still a wide range of fresh
vegetables available in the capital's markets and many which have
been gift-wrapped have been selling like the proverbial
hot-cakes, especially during holidays.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, to cater to the needs of Beijing residents who have
developed a taste for unusual vegetables, apart from the locally
grown products there are over one hundred different foreign
vegetables on sale, which have been grown from seed by newly
established growing centers which then send their products to the
50 wholesale centers in the city. The volume of sales for these
new products is estimated at 100 million kilograms a year.
</P>
<P>
Shop assistants in the Chongwen District Vegetable Market said
that quite rare vegetables including cherry-sized tomatoes and
Israeli green pepper are popular as presents.
</P>
<P>
Many of these foreign vegetables are now common in Beijing but
there are still rare products to be found such as French
coriander and yellow peppers which can cost from three or four
yuan to tens of yuan per kilo.
</P>
<P>
Xu, a professor living in Beijing University, receives many
beautifully-packaged rare vegetables from his students every
year, but ruefully admits he does not know how to cook them.
</P>
<P>
A number of companies marketing such vegetables have now
printed cooking and preparing directions on the packages to solve
the problem, and shop assistants are also explaining what to do
with the unusual ones.
</P>
<P>
The manager of China's Green Food Company explained that
vegetables sold at the wholesale centers must have passed a
series of tests, including checks on pesticide pollution,
freshness, and on the plastic packaging. Even though they cost
several yuan more per kilogram than ordinary vegetables, the
volume of sales has risen from several hundred kilograms to 3 or
4 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baohai, an agricultural and farming researcher, said
that vegetable growers have taken great interest recently in
planting unusual vegetables and this has enriched the meals of
Beijing residents.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Emphasizes Party Discipline In Modernization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin, the
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said today that CPC members must follow Party
discipline strictly because the Party now faces some of the most
serious challenges in history.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told the 3rd plenary session of the CPC Central
Commission for Discipline Inspection that the Party has many
advantages in reforms and development and that its organization
and strict discipline have always given it an important edge in
achieving victory.
</P>
<P>
This edge is important in the Party's unifying members in will
and action and in making use of advantages, he said, pointing to
how the Party has adopted a number of important measures in
discipline enforcement since the 3rd plenary session of the 11th
CPC Central Committee in 1978, and Party discipline has improved
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, some Party members and officials have become
indifferent to Party discipline in these new circumstances and
the slack off in discipline has become a problem for some Party
organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Party committees and discipline inspection
departments at all levels need to be fully aware of the danger of
violating or easing off in Party discipline and need to take
steps to correct this.

<HEADLINE> Special Court In Southwestern China To Handle Drug Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Higher People's Court of
southwest China's Yunnan Province today established a special
court to deal with the growing number of drug-related cases.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time a higher people's court at the
provincial level has set up a court to study the trends and new
characteristics of drug-related crimes .
</P>
<P>
In spite of the government's crackdown on drug trafficking and
drug abuse here, the number of crimes has been increasing
steadily in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Higher People's Court handles at least 600
drug-related cases on average each year, accounting for a third
of the criminal convictions of the court. Forty percent of the
people who receive life-sentences or the death penalty are drug
traffickers or dealers.
</P>
<P>
The People's Court faces challenges as more people use more
advanced means and join a global network of drug traffickers, the
sources say.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Higher People's Court is the first to be given the
right by the Supreme People's Court in Beijing to give the death
penalty to drug traffickers and dealers.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Japan's Strikes Military Pose (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This has sounded alarm bells in most East and Southeast Asian
countries, especially taking into consideration the horrific
historical examples of Japan's colonial ambitions in the first
half of this century.
</P>
<P>
Strategists here believe that Japan's involvement in the TMD
program is entirely unnecessary for the purpose of merely
defending itself. In fact, its plans to take part in the program
and launch satellites have made neighboring countries very
nervous.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the newly formed Japanese-U.S. coalition has
attracted even closer attention as it essentially expands and
re-aligns the military pacts for "communal defense" between them.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-U.S. Treaty Joint Declaration on Security --
Alliance for the 21st Century and the New U.S.-Japan Defense
Cooperation guidelines, signed in 1996 and 1997, declared that
the two countries should enhance their security cooperation just
in case something happens in the "neighboring region" which might
affect either country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Japanese government has never offered a clear
definition of what it classifies as "the neighboring region".
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these latest Japan-U.S. pacts differ considerably
from earlier ones signed in the 1950's in their terms of
reference about how Japan might render military assistance to the
United States in times of conflict.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman last week expressed
concern over the "political and military content" of Japan's
recent actions, as well as "deep concern" over the possible
influence on regional and even global security.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Japan will continue to follow its
constitutional policy of maintaining peace, he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Japan's Strikes Military Pose (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- When United States Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Tokyo on Monday, he had talks
with the Japanese government about sharing resources and research
for the Theater Missile Defense system (TMD), which observers h
ere believe marks the start of a revival of Japan's military
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, last week, Hosei Norota, the Japanese Defense Agency's
director-general, visited the Republic of Korea, at which time it
is believed he signed an agreement for Japan to participate in an
alliedwar games"program. And no long ago, Japan also
announced it would launch four reconnaissance satellites by the
year 2002, ostensibly it claims for defense purposes.
</P>
<P>
However, despite Japan's insistence that it is merely taking th
ese actions to prepare itself for any potential future threat of
attack by other hostile nations, public opinion in general, and
certainly throughout Asia, is that this is merely an excuse to
boost its military power.
</P>
<P>
Last autumn, Japan claimed that it "felt obliged" to join the
American-led TMD program to "fend off possible military attacks".
However, it appears its Science and Technology Agency was seeking
to participate in TMD research several years ago, and that a
Defense Agency draft budget for 1999 included the costs of taking
part in the program even before Japan raised the issue of
defending itself against outside threats.
</P>
<P>
Observers here point out that Japan has been making strenuous
efforts to play what it believes is its rightful part on the
world stage, consummate with its still vast economic power.
</P>
<P>
In fact there have been calls in the country's Diet
(Parliament) to reverse the rule that forbids Japan to have an
army, regarding it as a huge impediment to its ambitions to
develop a military arm.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Administration in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, seized 60 barrels of contaminated lard weighing 20 tons
on January 12, according to today's Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that laboratory tests revealed that the
lard was contaminated and inedible. However, the packaging
indicated the lard was a high quality product produced by a
respected butter company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Industrial and commercial inspectors acted on tips and located
the tainted products stored in a small hotel compound.
Individuals responsible for producing the lard, including
businessmen from east China's Zhejiang Province, are under
detention, according to the report.

An outbreak of poisoning in east China's Jiangxi Province at
the end of last month claimed two lives and hospitalized more

<HEADLINE> Hainan Province Introduces Jury System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The jury system has been
introduced into court trials in Haikou, capital of South China's
island province of Hainan, the Workers' Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Supreme People's Court (SPC) said in a
telephone interview that the this new practice in Haikou is part
of the nation's efforts to institute a new system to curb
judicial corruption by opening court trials to the public and
better ensure justice.
</P>
<P>
Shao Wenhong, director of the SPC research institute,
declined, however, to comment on the details of the new
procedures in Haikou, noting that this is only a pilot project
for the local courts, and that a formal introduction of this
system requires legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Workers' Daily said that 31 jurors have been selected by
the Intermediate People's Court of Haikou City since January 1 to
participate in court hearings of all kinds including economic,
criminal, civil and administrative cases.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Western jury system, in each case two jurors will
sit together with a chief judge, and the verdict will be based on
a vote among the three, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The jurors, or "people's assessors," are composed of 10
deputies to the local people's congress, 9 members of the local
people's political consultative conference, five representative
from the trade unions and women's right groups, and 15 experts
from various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Worker's Daily did not say how these jurors were selected.
</P>
<P>
According to SPC official Shao, the Supreme Court, under the
instructions of its president Xiao Yang, has set up a judicial
reform research group to study the issue of introducing a jury
system into China, and the SPC is contacting the National
People's Congress for possible legislation.
</P>
<P>
Another SPC official said that quiet a few local courts have
begun this experiment under the encouragement of the SPC. But
officials would not comment on details of their practices.

<HEADLINE> France to Seek More Non-Nuclear Energy Sources: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- France will look for more
non-nuclear and "cleaner" energy sources which could gradually
cut down its powerful nuclear energy structure, said the Minister
of Education and Science Research Claude Allegre on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Europe 1 radio, Allegre also said that
this does not mean that France is changing its energy policy,
under which 75 percent of electric power of the country is
generated by nuclear stations.
</P>
<P>
"France will quicken the pace for looking for both cleaner
nuclear energy and, secondly, for sources of energy other than
nuclear," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change of the energy policy of France. We are
simply taking into account the fact that nuclear wastes are a
problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the announcement after Germany announced on
Wednesday that it would no longer send its nuclear wastes abroad
for reprocessing.
</P>
<P>
The French state-owned company Cogema said that the German
decision would result in a loss of some 6 billion U.S. dollars
for the company, which used to retreat German nuclear wastes in a
plant in La Hague in northern France near the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
German Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said on Friday
that the nuclear energy in France is also Germany's concern and B
onn wishes that France will abandon it too.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear energy in France worries me too. As a member of
the German government, I will not however talk about the subject
for respecting the sovereign decisions of France," he said in an
interview with the French daily Liberation.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would encourage France to abandon its nuclear
stations, he said, "Of course."

disappearing with the nearing of the new millennium, warning that
Africans should avoid the danger of becoming victims of
colonialism again.

rule had helped South African in their struggle against the racial
segregation, adding that Africans today have the responsibility to
carry on the unity spirit for the economic and social development.

the past, they should shift the focus of their struggles onto

<HEADLINE> Pak Forex Reserves Falls Below 1 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign exchange
reserves dropped to 895 million U.S. dollars on January 9 from
1.06 billion dollars early this month, showed the weekly statement
of the State Bank of Pakistan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said that the government permission to allow the Hub
Power Company to remit 54.8 million dollars to its creditors
contributed much to the fall in the week.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an almost same amount was paid for debt servicing and
stuck-up arrears of foreign shipping companies.
</P>
<P>
State Bank Governor Muhammad Yaqub had indicated last month
that the foreign exchange reserves would reach 1.5-2 billion
dollars by the end of current fiscal year (July 1-June 30). But
some bankers said that it would not be an easy task.
</P>
<P>
As good news, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Thursday
approved a three-year package loan of 1.56 billion dollars to
Pakistan, and a total amount of 575 million dollars will be
disbursed in January this year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the timely IMF loan will save the Pakistani
government from being forced to declare the moratorium debt
servicing.

<HEADLINE> Two S. Leone Ministers Killed in Freetown Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The rebels in Sierra Leone have
killed two ministers and a senior officer of the West African
peace-keeping force of ECOMOG, diplomatic sources in Abidjan were
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
One of the dead, Mohammed Sesay, Minister of State for the
Presidency, was considered to be one of President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah's close advisors while the other victim Y.P. Koroma was
resident minister in Sierra Leone's Northern Region, The Guardian
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The identity of the ECOMOG officer has not been disclosed and
another officer was reportedly injured during an ambush taking
place on Sunday or Monday in a neighborhood that ECOMOG had
claimed was cleared of rebels.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is now in control of "broad sectors of the capital, but
groups of rebels were operating from under-cover and mounting
ambushes", according to Nigeria's Defense Ministry spokesman Lt.
Col. Sam Tella.
</P>
<P>
Rebel field commander Sam Bockarie confirmed Thursday in
Freetown that his men had agreed to a temporary cease-fire, but
the deal would not take effect until Monday, so that word could
get to all the fighters.
</P>
<P>
After "lengthy discussions" with Liberian President Charles
Taylor, the rebels agreed to a week-long cease-fire in Sierra
Leone, rebel spokesman Eldred Collins said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that it would take a few days to implement the
cease-fire as "it will take some time to inform our fighting
forces in the jungle."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sierra Leonean Information Minister Julius Spencer
asked five expatriate staff of the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) to leave, giving no clear explanation of the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has previously accused the ICRC
of delivering arms to the rebels, a charge the organization
vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
The five were the last expatiate humanitarian workers to leave
the embattled capital, whose residents have been deprived of
water, food, electricity and telephone for more than a week.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Crosstalk Goes Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Kun, a famous Chinese
crosstalk performer, today initiated a new crosstalk website on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
China Crosstalk Net will allow people to listen to, watch,
learn, discuss and write about crosstalk on line, said Jiang, who
has been performing this specialty for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Since the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), performers of
crosstalk, a Chinese version of two-man stand-up comedy, have
brought laughter to the Chinese people. Its humor always comes
from discussions of everyday-life topics like love and romance,
cultures and customs, and all sorts of trivia.
</P>
<P>
The website includes the history and development of
crosstalk, as well as current news about the genre.
</P>
<P>
Jiang and his colleagues plan to provide 100 crosstalk
routines along with dozens of comments on this unique art form.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has brought a fresh opportunity to inject a new
life into crosstalk, and allows Chinese all around the world to
join in and let the whole world laugh together," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Listening to crosstalk is also an important part of Chinese
New Year celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Carter to Monitor Transition Program in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Former United States President
Jimmy Carter is scheduled to arrive in Nigeria next Tuesday to
monitor the on- going transition program in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, he
said his center and the U.S. National Democratic Institute for
International Affairs would send a 40-to-50-member team to observe
the February 27 presidential polls which would draw the curtain on
the transfer of power from the military to civilians on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations are monitoring all phases of the local,
state and national elections in the west African country, The Post
Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Carter said the observation of the transit
program was designed "to support and call international attention
to Nigeria's courageous steps to form a democratic society."
</P>
<P>
While in the country, he will meet Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar, leaders of the three political
parties, the Independent National Electoral Commission and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said Thursday that
his organization was satisfied with the progress of the on-going
transition program in Nigeria, according to local newspaper The
Guardian.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku who is on a working holiday in the country said
"Nigeria will definitely return (to Commonwealth) on May 29 as
long as the nation continues to show respect for fundamental
values such as democracy, human rights, the rule of law and
independence of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the 53-nation Commonwealth in 1995
following the hanging of nine Ogoni minority rights activists by
the military government of late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth chief said "the people of Nigeria demonstrated
keenness and eagerness to have democracy and the election is a
reflection of the will of the electorate."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Favor Health Over Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent national survey
revealed that most Chinese citizens hope to live a healthy rather
than a wealthy life.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of respondents cited health as one of three
most important aspects of life, with happiness listed as another
major factor. Only 30 percent of respondents listed prosperity in
the top three.
</P>
<P>
Fifty percent of respondents indicated that happiness largely
depended on the health and well-being of family members, rather
than on income levels, job status or performance of children.
</P>
<P>
The poll covered 1,500 people living in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenyang and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The fact that respondents in the higher income brackets
attached more importance to health "indicated that many Chinese
have achieved successful careers at the cost of their health, and
that the country has a vast potential market for health care
products and services," according to an analyst with the Horizon
Market Survey Company, the pollster.
</P>
<P>
A separate investigation suggested that most Chinese
considered exercise to be an important factor for improving
health, as well as a balanced diet and combining work with rest
and recreation.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Pakistan Drops Dramatically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in
Pakistan dropped dramatically last year due to what is believed to
a row between the government and independent power producers and
restrictions to prevent a capital flight after last May's nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investment in the first five months (July to
November) of the current fiscal year declined to 155.5 million
U.S. dollars from 470.5 million dollars in the same period the
previous year, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1998-99 fiscal year, foreign direct
investment declined to 155.2 million dollars from 285.5 million
dollars over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year,
registering a drop of 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, portfolio investment almost disappeared, falling
from 185 million dollars to 300,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the major decline in foreign investment
came as the result of a bitter tussle between the government of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the independent power producers
(IPPs) over power purchase rates.
</P>
<P>
The IPPs, mostly foreign-owned, consider the government has
violated the original accords on power tariff rates.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investor confidence was also shattered as Pakistan
froze foreign currency accounts worth 11 billion dollars after its
nuclear tests, fearing a run on funds amid international
sanctions.

<P>
CAIRO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has urged the Muslims to adopt the principles of tolerance and
reject extremism and fanaticism, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Muslim nations in a ceremony Thursday night to
mark Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Holy Koran Revelation), Mubarak
said that Muslims should set tolerance an example in their
inter-relations.
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect these principles (of tolerance) and set an
example for the world," he told the religious gathering.
</P>
<P>
"Our deeds should reflect our beliefs and principles. We have
to tower over differences and shortsightedness," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will be the first to apply the rules, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Muslims to "effectively participate in
shaping the principles and rules that control the movement of the
world community," warning the Muslim nations against entering the
21st century unprepared to meet the huge changes in the world.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak further recommended the Islamic countries advocate new
international rules to narrow the gap between the industrialized
nations and the developing countries which are racing with time to
join the march of development and progress.
</P>
<P>
The key aspect of the Islamic nations' progress was science, he
said, adding that Islam urges its followers to do their best to
obtain knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Increase Foreign Exchange Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The people of Shanghai,
China's financial center, have increased their foreign exchange
savings by 15-20 percent annually in recent years, with total
savings outstanding topping six billion U.S. dollars by early
this month.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Bank of China Shanghai Branch said that
some 900,000 families in Shanghai have opened foreign exchange
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Individuals who receive remittances from overseas and
employees of overseas-funded enterprises account for the bulk of
foreign exchange savings accounts holders. Most settlements and
rentals of luxury housing units are completed in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local residents prefer foreign exchange savings accounts due
to the six interest rate reductions in yuan accounts over the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
The increase of foreign exchange savings has kept pace with
the growth of yuan deposits in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that the fact that individuals prefer keeping
foreign exchange indicates the current stable financial situation
in China.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that Shanghai people also have savings
accounts totaling 250 billion yuan in addition to foreign
exchange accounts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researchers Pitch High Voltage Against Fruit Flies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. government
researchers have found that high-voltage electrical currents are
effective to kill fruit flies and stop the destructive insects
from entering into the country.
</P>
<P>
The researchers with the Department of Agriculture said
Thursday that Mediterranean, Mexican, Olive and Oriental fruit
flies were found on California farmland this growing season,
threatening the state's agricultural economy.
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to spraying methyl bromide, a fumigant to be
phased out by 2005 due to concerns that it weakens the Earth's
protective ozone layer, the researchers tested successfully the
electrical method on citrus imports.
</P>
<P>
"It's imperative we examine a host of novel approaches," said
Guy Hallman, an entomologist with the federal government
department, adding that "no single technology is expected to
completely replace methyl bromide."
</P>
<P>
The researchers are also reportedly looking for a commercial
partner to test how the electrical method would work on a broad
scale and how much it would cost.

LANZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Gansu, an economically
less-advantaged province in northwest China, has put together
several groups of large enterprises to lead its economic
expansion, according to Deputy Governor Han Xiuguo.

KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will implement a
number of projects, including building new hospitals, to improve
the health status in Sabah, known as the most backward state in

<HEADLINE> Study: Higher Speed Limit Kills More People on U.S. Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Insurance
Institute of Highway Safety said Thursday highway deaths have
been up roughly 15 percent in states that have increased their
speed limits since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The institute studied 24 out of the 43 states that have
changed their speed limits to 65 miles (104 kilometers) per hour
since Congress abolished the national limit of 55 miles (about 88
kilometers) per hour.
</P>
<P>
As a comparison group, seven other states that have not
changed their speed limits were also probed.
</P>
<P>
Using a complex statistical formula, the institute found that
highway deaths were up 15 percent in the 24 states with limit
changes, and the numbers were steady in the states that did not
change.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen other states were excluded from the study because
they had too few miles of highway or because their speed limit
changes were restricted to certain sections of interstate.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report by the institute found highway deaths were
up about 12 percent in the first 12 states that raised speed
limits.
</P>
<P>
The National Motorists Association, an organization that
fought for the speed limit increase, conceded that highway deaths
might be up, but maintained that deaths have not increased in
proportion to increased driving spurred by low gasoline prices
and the booming economy.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Sharply Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget deficit
registered a sharp fall of 16 percent in 1998 as compared that of
1997.
</P>
<P>
It downed to 43 percent in 1998 from 59 percent in 1997, the
Daily Star Friday quoted a finance ministry's report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Total government spending last year was 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars against 6.1 billion dollars in 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The revenues in 1998 reached 2.9 billion billion dollars
compared with 2.6 billion dollars in 1997, an improvement of 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure, which was just above the deficit target
for the year of 42 percent, did not include up to 600 million
dollars in bills unpaid by the former government headed by Rafik
Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri left the office at the end of last year after former
President Elias Hrawi's nine-year tenure expired.
</P>
<P>
His former Finance Minister Fuad Sinyoura explained that he
refused to pay those bills as the former ministries of defense,
health and interior exceeded their allocated budgets in
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
George Korom, current finance minister, said that he may issue
special bonds to cover the outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
He hoped to have a 1999 budget ready by the end of February
that would hold this year's deficit to the same 43 percent level
as last year.
</P>
<P>
The minister, an economist who returned from Paris to join
the new government, said reduction of waste, better tax collection
and tighter control on spending would trim the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Joe Sarrouh, a leading economist, described the 43 percent
figure as a positive indicator but said that the government must
improve the practice of taxes collection and at the same time
carry out real austerity measures.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Plenary Session of
the Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) opened today in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the State Council, Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen announced the basic principles and policies for handling
relations between Macao and Taiwan following China's resumption
of sovereignty over Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Qian, chairman of the Preparatory Committee, said Macao and
Taiwan exchanges involving state sovereignty and cross-Straits
relations must be conducted by the central government or handled
by the Macao SAR government under the guidance of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the interests of the compatriots in Macao and
Taiwan engaged in unofficial exchanges must be safeguarded in
order to promote the common development of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The agenda for the two-day meeting calls for participants to
discuss documents related to the method for electing the chief
executive of the Macao SAR, the nationality issue concerning
certain Macao residents and the region's flag and emblem.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the documents, especially the method of electing the
chief executive, are extremely important for ensuring the smooth
transition of Macao and he voiced hope for a successful meeting.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that flexible measures China has
adopted in terms of the nationality law will increase the
confidence Portuguese descendants have in a smooth transition and
long-term stability and prosperity of Macao.

<HEADLINE> Restraint, Patience Essential for Resolving Korean Peninsula Issue News Analysis By Correspondent Yang Guojun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The four-party talks, which
concern the whole world, on the somewhat tricky issue of the
Korean peninsula are scheduled to start Monday in Geneva. It is
widely hoped that they will create favorable conditions for the
full implementation of the 1994 nuclear framework agreement,
which will have beneficial effects on peace and stability in the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
For almost half a century North and South Korea have been in a
confrontational state, each neither believing in the other's
intentions nor having any mutual confidence or trust. Now,
however, it seems that there is a certain detente emerging and
there are signs of a general improvement in relations, although
there is still a fractious element. China naturally welcomes
measures taken by both the North and the South to enhance their
mutual understanding through increasing bi-lateral exchanges in
cultural, political and economic ways.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the situation is still sensitive. It actually
calls for all the parties involved, and not just the two Koreas
but countries with an interest in solving this dilemma,to show
patience and restraint with a view to pushing ahead the peace
process and maintaining stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The accord reached between North Korea and the United States
in 1994, under which the U.S. agreed to build two light-water
nuclear reactors and supply alternative energy supplies for North
Korea to freeze its nuclear program while alleviating North Kor
ea's energy shortage, was welcomed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But differences still exist about the implementation of the
accord. For example, North Korea has accused the U.S. of failing
to carry out its promises and has thus demanded some 300 million
U.S. dollars to compensate for the economic losses it has
suffered as a result. On its part the United States has expressed
its dismay at North Korea's refusal to allow the inspection of a
suspected underground nuclear facility, believing it capable of
making nuclear weapons. And so it goes on.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems rather unjustified and ridiculous that the
U.S. should demand that it can monitor another country's
activities simply because it merely suspects that country is up
to no good. And to crown it all, according to the logic, the
United States seems to be the only country in the world allowed
to launch rockets and satellites. Using the American example and
justification, Japan grabbed the chance of joining in the
research project for the Theater Missile Defense system (TMD)
with the United States. It is clear to any right-thinking
nations that sensitive issues should be handled with caution and
concern. If, as in the case of the two Koreas, they are handled
rashly, this can only lead to the peace process either being held
up or collapsing; and as it turns out both North Korea and the
United States have warned that this may just happen with the
earlier 1994 accord. Putting it bluntly, this is not what the
international community wants to see.
</P>
<P>
It is understandable that North Korea should be so sensitive
about the way the wind is blowing and if it feels a "cold wind"
it is natural that it will wrap itself up tighter, becoming more
inwardly focused, so to speak, rather than opening up to the
outside world, especially as North Korea has been beset with
economic problems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The obvious key to the settlement of this issue lies in the
improvement of the relations between the North and the South. The
correct way to effect such reconciliation, which is the common
wish of the entire Korean people, is to proceed through peaceful
means. Only in that way can genuine peace and harmony be
realized. During this process, it is also important that both
North and South Korea should improve their relations with other
countries. It is hoped that the U.S., Japan and other Western
countries will take effective measures to improve their relations
with the North instead of still adopting the much outmoded
cold-war mentality which they should have long abandoned by now.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, contribute positive and constructive
efforts to benefit a resolution of the issue about the
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tour Inspires Flood-control Ideas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua)-- China will be able to draw on
experience from the United States to improve its flood-control
efforts, said an official with the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters (SFCDRH) here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhitong, deputy director of the SFCDRH General Office,
took a month-long investigation tour of the United States as head
of a 27-member delegation last month.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told Xinhua that the tour enabled the delegation members
to broaden their outlook and inspired them with new flood-control
ideas.
</P>
<P>
The members of the delegation were from various departments
engaged in fighting the catastrophic flooding last year. "We went
to the U.S. with questions about flood control and we found some
of the answers there," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation visited the U.S. Army's Engineer Command, the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the State Meteorological
Bureau, and listened to lectures presented by 20 American experts
and scholars.
</P>
<P>
Zhang found that China can learn to adopt detailed
flood-control laws from the United States, raise the national
consciousness about improving basic flood-control work, and take
needed precautions against natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China should focus on the following priorities
in its flood-control effort:
</P>
<P>
-- Reinforce the laws related to flood control. China has
enacted a series of laws and decrees in this regard since the
1980s, but practice shows some of these laws and decrees are not
practical. It is urgent that China have detailed regulations for
the implementation of its flood-control laws.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Sector Profitable in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC) pumped nearly 16.3 million tons of crude oil
and made a profit of 700 million yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior CNOOC official, CNOOC has made strenuous
efforts to maintain stable offshore oil production amid declining
oil prices and production both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that China gave priority to offshore oil
exploration last year, and has invited wide-ranging foreign
cooperation in oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea,
East China Sea, and Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, CNOOC had signed over 130 oil contracts
and agreements with over 70 oil companies from 18 countries and
regions, with total foreign investments of 6.4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said that CNOOC recorded an astonishing 80
percent success ratio for offshore wildcat drilling last year,
and expects to verify additional oil and gas reserves of 130
million tons and 10 billion cubic meters, respectively, by the
end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Sales Start on Positive Note in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Wool sales for 1999 started
positively in Australia with prices increasing by one percent on
average at the first auctions of the year in Sydney, Melbourne and
Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) said in its
weekly report that the eastern markets indicator rose five cents
to close the week at 520 Australian cents (100 Australian cents =
62.87 U.S. cents) per kg clean, reflecting increases of six and
five cents in the northern and southern markets.
</P>
<P>
This resulted in their corresponding regional indicators
finishing at 535 and 507 Australian cents per kg clean
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The western region indicator gained five cents to end at 471
Australian cents per kg clean.
</P>
<P>
A total of 99,231 bales was offered for sale with 12 percent
passed in, comprising 9.1 percent in Sydney, 8.7 percent in
Melbourne and 18.7 percent in Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
"With the relatively large quantity on offer, this was a solid
start to the second half of the season, despite the market falling
away on the last day of selling," AWIS said.
</P>
<P>
"Competition remains widespread, although most buyers and
processors are operating on a hand to mouth basis, only buying to
fill firm orders," it noted.
</P>
<P>
AWIS said there had been a noticeable increase in activity
amongst buyers for China in advance of the Chinese New Year in
mid-February which should see good support for the sale in south
Australia's port city of Adelaide next week.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 61,153 bales are rostered for sale in Sydney and
Adelaide.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Restraint, Patience Essential for Resolving Korean Peninsula Issue By Correspondent Yang Guojun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The four-party talks, which
concern the whole world, on the somewhat tricky issue of the
Korean peninsula are scheduled to start Monday in Geneva. It is
widely hoped that they will create favorable conditions for the
full implementation of the 1994 nuclear framework agreement,
which will have beneficial effects on peace and stability in the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
For almost half a century North and South Korea have been in a
confrontational state, each neither believing in the other's
intentions nor having any mutual confidence or trust. Now,
however, it seems that there is a certain detente emerging and
there are signs of a general improvement in relations, although
there is still a fractious element. China naturally welcomes
measures taken by both the North and the South to enhance their
mutual understanding through increasing bi-lateral exchanges in
cultural, political and economic ways.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the situation is still sensitive. It actually
calls for all the parties involved, and not just the two Koreas
but countries with an interest in solving this dilemma,to show
patience and restraint with a view to pushing ahead the peace
process and maintaining stability on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The accord reached between North Korea and the United States
in 1994, under which the U.S. agreed to build two light-water
nuclear reactors and supply alternative energy supplies for North
Korea to freeze its nuclear program while alleviating North
Korea's energy shortage, was welcomed worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But differences still exist about the implementation of the
accord. For example, North Korea has accused the U.S. of failing
to carry out its promises and has thus demanded some 300 million
U.S. dollars to compensate for the economic losses it has
suffered as a result. On its part the United States has expressed
its dismay at North Korea's refusal to allow the inspection of a
suspected underground nuclear facility, believing it capable of
making nuclear weapons. And so it goes on.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawyer Warns of Y2K-Problem Legal Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese lawyer recently
suggested that the country's legal-service institutions get ready
to handle various legal disputes that may be arise because of the
Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jihong, who is responsible for studying Year-2000 legal
issues at the Beijing Gaopeng Law Firm, said demands for
compensation and lawsuits may occur when hardware and software
products labeled "Year 2000 Ready," which are presumably safe to
use, are found to be defective.
</P>
<P>
And in cases of hardware and software developed in earlier
years and not equipped to deal with the Y2K problem, suppliers
will have to refer to relevant legal documents to define their
responsibilities, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Y2K problem has the potential to provoke all
sorts of legal disputes.
</P>
<P>
For example, lawsuits over product quality could occur between
manufacturers and consumers, and medical mishaps caused by
Y2K-vulnerable instruments are also likely to find their way into
a courtroom, he explained.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chen pointed out that some accidents caused by
the Y2K problem could become the responsibility of insurance
companies which would then be subject to offering compensation.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the resolution of the Y2K problem will require the
participation of lawyers in many such cases.
</P>
<P>
At present, they should set out to learn all they can about
the relevant law, and create an overall plan for possible
lawsuits, he added.

<HEADLINE> Investors Flock Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has recorded the highest
figure of investment pledges close to one billion U.S. Dollars
this year, a record figure in four years.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Mwanakatwe, acting director-general of Zambia
Investment Center (ZIC), said in an interview with Financial Times
that between 1993 and 1997, the country had investment pledges
totalling 1.4 billion Dollars while this year alone, the amount of
pledges is 965 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said that out of these pledges, at least 50 percent would
translate into actual investment, the paper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mwanakatwe said, "the sale of Nchanga and Nkana mines will
attract a lot of other investors into Zambia. "we should not
underestimate the importance of the mining industry to our
economy."
</P>
<P>
According to the director-general, several investors are still
making pledges to invest in Zambia, especially in the field of
agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Recently, a forum for Zimbabwean farmers was held in Lusaka and
has brought positive results. Some farmers have come back to make
serious enquiries about investing in Zambia, some are already in
the process of purchasing land, Mwanakatwe said.
</P>
<P>
The investment mission to South Africa in March last year was
also beginning to bear fruit. A major South African Oil Company,
Engen, is to invest five million Dollars in Zambia. Another
company, Bokomo, is to invest in agriculture and poultry.
</P>
<P>
During the same month, the investment in the manufacturing
sector was leading with total pledged investment of five million
Dollars for two projects, while tourism investment was equally
significant, four projects were approved with 3.3 million Dollars,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Mwanakatwe attributed the interest by investors to come to
Zambia to a result of the vigorous campaign that the center has
embarked on in order to attract investment into the country.
</P>
<P>
She however cautioned, "this campaign would not have happened
if Zambia did not have political stability and liberalized economy
which were the major contributing factors to investor confidence."

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President to Attend Lusaka Meeting on DRC Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni is likely to attend the Lusaka summit next week to
discuss with regional leaders about the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press Secretary Hope Kivengere told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Friday morning that the president is likely to
go there next week, refuting a press report that Museveni will
leave Saturday for the summit.
</P>
<P>
"I doubt the president will go tomorrow. It is likely that he
goes to Lusaka next week or something," Hope said.
</P>
<P>
She also refuted press reports that Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba will come to visit Uganda this week, saying that some
newspapers publish stories before getting the final word.
</P>
<P>
Friday's New Vision daily quoted Amama Mbabazi, state minister
of regional cooperation, as saying Thursday evening that Museveni
will attend the summit.
</P>
<P>
The minister flew to Lusaka Thursday evening to attend a
meeting of foreign ministers before the summit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An official in the Office of State Minister of Defense Steven
Kavuma told Xinhua Friday morning that Kavuma is attending a
meeting of defense ministers at Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka summit is one of several aimed at bringing DRC
President Laurent Kabila and his rebel opponents to a negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Kabila in the Congolese city of Lubumbashi,
southern DRC, Chiluba returned home Thursday. He is one of the few
African leaders keen to secure direct talks between Tutsi rebels
and Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports said that war planes of the allied forces bombed
the rebel headquarters in Kisangani in northeastern DRC, but a
rebel spokesman denied the headquarters were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Launch Satellites for S. Africa, Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is scheduled to
launch two experimental satellites for South Africa and Denmark
on Friday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The satellites, together with another of the U.S. Air Force,
would be lifted off by a Delta II rocket at 2:39 a.m. local time
from Vandenberg Air Force Base, about 200 kilometers northwest of
this second largest U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
Weighing 63 kilograms and carrying remote-sensing experiments,
the South African satellite, named Sunsat, was designed and built
at the University of Stellenbosch in the Western Cape province,
as the first out from the country.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a spectacular celebration of South Africa's return
to the international science and engineering community," said
Garth Milne, the project leader.
</P>
<P>
Once in orbit between 500 and 850 kilometers above the Earth,
the satellite would help "develop skills in micro-satellite
development and operation," and produce images from space at
lower costs, a senior South African official said earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The Danish satellite, known as Orsted, would study the Earth's
magnetic fields and electrical properties, said Jens
Langeland-Knudsen of the Danish project, adding that it would
mark "a giant step for Danish space research."
</P>
<P>
Information beamed down from the Danish satellite would help
scientists better understand the interaction between the Earth
and the Sun.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Complaints Changing in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Chinese consumers are becoming
more aware of ways to use the laws that protect their interests,
and the number of complaints have been rising, aimed mostly at
monopoly industries, the service sector and the agricultural m
aterial sector, according to today's Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
The China Consumer Association (CCA) handled 667,000
complaints in 1998, an increase of more than 250,000 from the
figure in 1994 when the Law on Protecting the Rights and
Interests of Consumers took effect in China.
</P>
<P>
A total of 40 types of goods and services were mentioned in
complaints last year, a variety greatly exceeding the number of
goods and services covered before the enforcement of the law.
Furthermore, consumers received compensations totaling 15.74
million yuan from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, consumers complained mostly about the quality
of household appliances, shoes, and food and drink. But now the
focus has shifted to the service sector, including the beauty
industry, and tourism, finance and insurance, medical care,
postal and communications services, and water and electricity
companies.
</P>
<P>
Another change is the increasing number of complaints that are
handled expeditiously, as consumers become more conscious of
their rights in all transactions, great or small.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Complaints Changing in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For example, one consumer in Beijing saw an advertisement for
a color TV in a local newspaper which indicated that the price
was much lower than the market price. But when he went to buy
one, he found the price was actually "several thousand yuan" highe
r than the advertised price. Instead of purchasing the TV, he
went to the CCA to report this fraudulent activity.
</P>
<P>
Such cases abound. Statistics from the CCA show that
complaints about the service sector hit 70,303 last year, a big
jump from the 15,404 figure of 1993. This surge indicates that
Chinese consumer groups are moving towards maturity, one expert
noted.
</P>
<P>
As special provisions for farmer's purchases are clearly
defined by law, the farmers too are becoming more aware of their
rights as consumers. In 1998, the CCA carried out surveys and
consultations among farmers in China's rural areas, and so far
has established 23,891 branches of the CCA nationwide, 21.06
percent more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a total of 40,000 complaints concerning the purc
hasing of agricultural materials were handled, significantly
curbing an increase of poor-quality agricultural machinery,
chemicals, and seeds and fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that most cases of fraud involve more than one
household, and sometimes the case may affect the interests of
thousands of farmers and involve millions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
To crack down on these illegal activities, legal measures have
also been adopted by CCA branches to back up the protection of
the rights and interests of Chinese consumers.

<HEADLINE> China to Gradually Open Insurance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China plans to open its
insurance sector to overseas insurers in a gradual and prudent
manner, according to a senior trade official.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, China's chief negotiator in talks regarding the
country's membership in the World Trade Organization, stressed
China will continue to supervise and open the insurance sector to
foreign competition in order to improve the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has felt the pressure of increased
competition of worldwide insurance services, Long said Thursday,
quoted by the China Economic Times today.
</P>
<P>
He called on Chinese insurers to improve services and sharp
their competitive edge in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China's financial sector has essentially
escaped the brunt of the Asian financial turmoil due to the
nation's strong control and regulation over the financial and
insurance sectors.
</P>
<P>
Long made the comments during ceremonies marking the
establishment of the Gerling Insurance Research Center at the
University of International Business and Economics.
</P>
<P>
The center was jointly founded by the Gerling Group, Germany's
second largest insurance group, and the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Some 181 foreign insurance companies had opened representative
offices in China by the end of 1997.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 337 billion Kwacha
(about 140 million U.S. Dollars) will be spent on the road sector
in Zambia this year, Times of Zambia reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted National Road Board chairman Raymond
Jhala as saying here Thursday that the bulk of the money for the
sector will come from donor funding totalling 66.16 million
Dollars while the World Bank will disburse 43.988 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government will provide 18.564 million Dollars and
an additional 12 million Dollars will be sourced from the road
user fees fund, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With the funds pledged, the board will prioritize roads that
are in worse state of dilapidation.
</P>
<P>
He said the road network in his country is currently not in a
good state because some of the roads have never been maintained
for the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and other donors have been approached for
assistance because of the huge expense in the investment program.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Inflation Rate Up 5.3 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's consumer price
index (CPI), a parameter for inflation, for 1998 rose by 5.3
percent compared with 1997, the Statistics Department reported
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 5.3 percent increase in the CPI for 1998 from 1997 was due
to increases observed in the indices of all main groups except
that of transport and communication which decreased by 0.1
percent, the department said in its CPI figures released here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's CPI, based on Laspeyres formula, measures the
average rate change in prices of a fixed basket of goods and
services which represents the expenditure pattern of all
households in Malaysia with 1994 as the base year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of about 430 items are used in the computation and these
are obtained from about 16,000 retail outlets in 88 collection
centers in Peninsular Malaysia, 1,800 outlets in 15 collection
centers and 1,600 outlets in 13 collection centers in Sabah and
Sarawak, the two states in East Malaysia, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate in the country stood at 2.7 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> China's Traditional Cartoon Books Facing Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The shelves and drawers of
book peddlers' little stands are filling up with foreign comic
books, which have been rapidly taking the place of traditional
Chinese story-picture books over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In a primary school in Shanghai, when pupils were asked if
they had any Chinese cartoon books, many of them said they don't
see many in the markets. But almost all of them had 30 to 50
foreign comic books, and some had as many as 200 to 300.
</P>
<P>
One middle school student said he has been purchasing foreign
comic books by the dozens since he fell in love with them some
time ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the reason traditional Chinese cartoon books are
losing readers is that they are still mostly cartoon versions of
novels and plays, and words usually outweigh the pictures. They
apparently are not adjusted to meet the tastes of modern young
readers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the traditional Chinese books have not made full
use of their advantages.
</P>
<P>
"Many foreign comic books are manufactured in a crude and
slipshod way," said one Shanghai middle school teacher.
</P>
<P>
"China's cartoon books should try to win back their place in
market, which is becoming occupied by foreign products," the
teacher said, adding that the key to the solution is to develop
the advantages of Chinese cartoons and bring them into full
play.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Horticulture earned Kenya a
record 50 billion Shillings (833.3 million U.S. Dollars) last
year, Agricultural Minister Musalia Mudavadi said at a two-day
National Horticultural Seminar to end Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said Thursday that earnings from the export market
alone topped 14 billion Shillings in 1998, while the remaining 36
billion Shillings was realized from the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The trend gave an indication that the sector will in the future
play a key role in the east African country's industrialization
process, the minister was quoted by Friday's East African
Standard newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although horticulture ranked the fourth in terms of export
earnings after tea, coffee, and tourism, the sector could become
Kenya's most important industry in the near future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, titled "the way forward for horticulture toward
Kenya's industrialization," is being attended by 100
participants who include producers, scientists, researchers,
consumers, economists, policy-makers and lecturers.
</P>
<P>
The workshop will also tackle issues related to capacity
building needs in the sector, sustainable and environment-friendly
technologies in horticulture, and research needs in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Horticulture occupied a total of 11.2 percent of the country's
arable land ranking third after dairy, maize and beans farming.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign exchange earnings, the sector accounts for
13 percent of Kenya's total exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide promotion for
the 1999 International Horticultural Exposition ended as
scheduled today, with organizers in the capital of southwest
China's Yunnan Province announcing that gardening gala will host
a record number of participants.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed contracts with 66 nations, as well as 22
international organizations, a record in the 100-odd year history
of the world exposition," according to Du Yong, deputy director
of the Yunnan Exposition Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The horticultural exposition will be held in Kunming from May
to October. China has never before hosted a world exposition of
its kind, but has participated in eight previous events since
1982.
</P>
<P>
The success of it will mainly depend on how many nations and
organizations offer outdoor exhibition venues with unique
characteristics, according to Du.
</P>
<P>
"Time was limited when I was assigned the job and was somewhat
uncertain about the chances for recruiting expo participants,"
said Du.
</P>
<P>
While hosts usually have 5-7 years to prepare, China won the
right to host the event in mid-1996 and thus had only three years
to complete preparations.

However, Du said his doubts were soon dispelled by the great
enthusiasm displayed by foreign governments and international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"I visited a dozen foreign countries and was deeply impressed
by the popularity China enjoys in the international community,
and the keen interest in the country's vast potential derived
from its large population and sustained rapid economic growth,"
said Du.
</P>
<P>
A Zurich vice-mayor described China as one of the most
prestigious and influential nations in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained an annual economic growth rate of around
10 percent over the past two decades, some 6.5 percentage points
higher than the world average.
</P>
<P>
China's firm stance in protecting the value of its currency in
spite of the Asian financial crisis which forced most governments
in the region to depreciate their currencies has won worldwide
respect and praise.
</P>
<P>
"All neighboring countries will attend the expo despite the
severe economic impact of the financial crisis," according to
Du.

He Xuan, a research fellow with the Economic Research Center
under the Yunnan provincial government, said foreign governments
regard the horticultural exposition as a golden opportunity to
introduce their culture and customs to Chinese citizens and in t
urn expand economic and technological cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that international giants in gardening
and fresh flower production, including France, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Israel, lead the list of participants.
</P>
<P>
France is currently building a venue covering over 3,000 sq.m.
and plans to host four grand shows during the six-month
exposition. The shows will feature French horticulture, wine,
perfume and cuisine.
</P>
<P>
The French government also plans to invite French enterprises
with investments in China to visit Kunming and participate in a
joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to increase French investments in China's key sectors
such as agriculture and environmental protection," according to a
French official visiting Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said the Finnish venue
will provide his nation with "a window" for displaying itself to
the world and will highlight the vast potential for Sino-Finnish
trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Finland-based Nokia Corp., one of the
major mobile phone suppliers in China, has over 170,000 customers
in Yunnan alone.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli representative pointed the vast market demand for
fresh flowers a country with 1.2 billion people can generate.
</P>
<P>
"Local flower growers have introduced advanced technology and
equipment from Israel," said the representative, adding that
"plans are in place to expand cooperation and send experts for
training programs."
</P>
<P>
Fresh flower consumption is rising sharply in China. Yunnan,
which enjoys a mild climate the year round, produces over 500
million flowers annually, or close to a third of the annual
national total.
</P>
<P>
Du read a congratulatory message from the Paris-based
International Bureau of Expositions and praised the
ogranization's decision in allowing China to host to the
horticultural expo. "The world has high expectations for China,"
said Du.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China has announced the names
of the first 10 chief scientists for 10 major state research
programs.
</P>
<P>
It is the first step in introducing a chief-scientist system
for major scientific research programs.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology told
Xinhua today that China will invest 2.5 billion yuan (300 million
U.S. dollars) over the next five years in major state basic
scientific research programs, and the first 15 of these programs
have already been decided upon.
</P>
<P>
He said these 15 programs will each be led by a chief
scientist, and that chiefs for the five other five programs will
be chosen by the ministry in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The official said the already-named 10 chief scientists, with
an average age of 51, include academicians of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, university professors and scholars at major
scientific research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Four of the newly selected chief scientists are under 45 years
of age, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the chief scientists will be entrusted with
putting forward candidates for the program's expert committee,
can choose any researchers they wish, and will have a say in the
purchasing of facilities valued under 300,000 yuan (36,000
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first group of basic scientific research programs
announced at the end of last year include programs related to
agriculture, energy, information, resources and the environment,
population and health as well as new materials.

KAMPALA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is ranked the sixth in
the world' s 20 fastest growing economies, an Economist
Intelligence Unit Report has said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 edition of World Outlook, a highly respected annual
forecasting guide, published by the Economist Intelligence Unit
based in Britain, published the results, the New Vision reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Uganda's Gross Domestic Product growth

percent), China (6.7 percent), India (6.5 percent), Ireland (6.1
percent) and Mauritius (six percent).
</P>
<P>
Tanzania in east Africa is 13th on the list with five percent.
Of the 13 countries forecast to grow by five percent and more in
1999, seven are in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the good economic performance in some
African countries to their insulation from contagion effects from

WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic Committee
said Thursday it had accepted the resignation of Alfredo La Mont,
the organization's senior director of international relations.
</P>
<P>
La Mont is the first victim of the Olympic bribery scandal in
the USOC. In a statement, the USOC called La Mont will take an
"administrative leave." He was the USOC's main contact offical
with international sports federations and other Olympic
committees as well as with the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The USOC staement said:"Mr. La Mont provided us with
information concerning a previously undisclosed business
relationship with the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee
through the office of former SLOC President Tom Welch.
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that Mr. La Mont's activities, which he
indicated he pursued independent of his USOC responsibilities,
nonetheless constituted a conflict of interest."

Nine IOC members face possible expulsion for "serious"
offenses in the Salt Lake City bribery scandal and four others
face minor charges, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch said

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Use Less Ozone Depletion Substances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- About 17.5 percent of the land of
southern Bangladesh would go under water if the use of ozone
depletion substances (ODS) went unrestricted, an Environment and
Forest Ministry official warned.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh added little ODS in the global environment, but
suffered adversely due to ozone layer depletion caused mainly by
industrially-developed nations, A.R. Khan, director general of the
Department of Environment, said Thursday at a workshop on
promotion of ozone layer protection in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper Friday quoted Khan as saying that the
country was frequently facing natural disasters like flood,
drought and storm due to the depletion of ozone layers. The
workshop was arranged as part of the government's commitment to
controlling the import and use of ODS and to eliminating them
gradually.
</P>
<P>
Although Bangladesh is responsible for only 0.3 percent of the
ozone layer depletion in the global context, the country is trying
to reduce the use of ODS rapidly to make it easier "to bargain in
realizing our many demands in international forums," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading aerosol-producing company, the Advance
Chemical Industries, alone could eliminate 75 percent of the ODS
hazards in the country, according to Khan.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the one-day seminar, Environment Minister Syeda
Sajeda Chowdhury said the ministry has taken initiatives to
formulate special projects to reduce the use of ODS, which would
be placed before the Montreal Protocol Multilateral Fund for
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
She said Bangladesh has signed many agreements on the
environment launched by the United Nations, such as the Montreal
Protocol for preserving ozone layers and the U.N. Frame Work
Convention of resisting climate changes.
</P>
<P>
The government is taking steps to protect the environment, but
"only the government's efforts are not enough," she said, urging
all sections of the society to join in environment protection
activities.

<HEADLINE> Zambia GDP Growth Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Gross Domestic
Product's (GDP) growth rate at the close of last year is estimated
at negative two percent, Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the Barclays Bank Treasury Market Review
of the economy for 1998 as saying the GDP was affected by a
combination of factors, key of which included the poor performance
by the export sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate depreciated from 1421.90 Kwacha to a U.S.
Dollar to 2300 Kwacha during the year. This fuelled inflation
which increased to 30.6 percent at the end of December 1998, up
from 18.6 at the end of December 1997."
</P>
<P>
"GDP is estimated at a negative two percent as a result of a
diminishing local market, a reduction on activities in the mining
and manufacturing sectors, a smaller than usual maize crop and
continuing lack of activity in the construction sector," the
publication says.
</P>
<P>
The review adds that the foreign exchange earings decreased
because of a continued slide in cooper production and a dramatic
reduction of the copper and cobalt prices.
</P>
<P>
The publication cited factors combined with the withholding of
donor support led to the continued slide in the value of the
Kwacha.

<HEADLINE> Cold Spell Sweeps Northern, Central Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A cold snap is winding its way
through northern Vietnam, marking for the coldest weather so far
this winter.
</P>
<P>
The cold spell, averaging 15 degrees Celsius, swept across the
Chinese border to the northern part of Vietnam, causing a sharp
drop in temperatures and rain showers.
</P>
<P>
It is forecast to continue for the next few days strengthened
by powerful winds.
</P>
<P>
The town of Sapa in the northern province of Lao Cai has
suffered the greatest drop as the temperature there has plunged to
2.2 degrees and keeps falling.
</P>
<P>
The province of Lao Cai boasts the highest mountainous area in
Southeast Asia, which brings with it very cold and long winters.
</P>
<P>
Heading south, temperatures have dropped to as low as 10
degrees in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The cold spell, which stated Sunday, has also affected some
central provinces, causing the coldest weather in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures dropped to 10 degrees in the Central Highlands and
12 degrees on the plains.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 buffaloes have died because of the cold weather
in the central provinces of Quang Binh to Thua Thien-Hue.
</P>
<P>
The cold has also affected the southern provinces, cooling
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
The national center for hydro-meteorological forecasting
predicts another two or three cold spells will chill the country
next month.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Stock Market Index Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- For the second day running, the
Nairobi Stock Exchange's market index fell sparking speculation
that the market's month-long rally could have been a flash in the
pan.
</P>
<P>
The bourse's 20-share index Thursday went down by 1.06 points
to settle at 3087, the Daily Nation newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, turnover increased to 28.3 million Shillings from 16
million Shillings boosted by a deal involving a special lot of
298,000 ICDC Investment shares. The volume of shares was also up
from 679,000 to 723,000.
</P>
<P>
In the money market, there was little activity as international
markets tumbled in the wake of the Brazilian financial crisis, the
paper said, adding the Kenyan Shilling made marginal gains
against the U.S. Dollar as export inflows exceeded import
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Reports said major corporate players on both sides of the
counter were largely absent, an indication that the Shilling is
likely to remain strong in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
In the stock market, the financial and investment sector was
the most active with 523,000 shares accounting for 72 percent of
the day's trading sold. ICDC Investment was the main feature with
306,000 shares traded at between 40.75 Shillings and 42.50
Shillings.

<HEADLINE> China Appoints 594 Anti-Corruption Bureau Chiefs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China appointed 594 new chiefs
and deputy chiefs of anti-corruption bureaus nationwide at the
country and prefecture levels in the second half of 1998 as part
of its effort to curb judiciary corruption.
</P>
<P>
The appointments were made to replace former chiefs who had
failed to pass a nationwide examination and assessment survey,
and to fill existing vacancies, Han Zhubin, procurator general of
the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), said here today.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, which was jointly launched by the
Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China
and the SPP, 1,332 new presidents and vice-presidents of county-
and prefecture-level procuratorates were installed to fill the
vacancies left by those who had been demoted, Han said.
</P>
<P>
"Through the unprecedented scale of examinations and
appraisals, the leadership of local procuratorates and
anti-corruption bureaus have been further strengthened and a new
group of young cadres with both ability and political integrity
has been promoted," Han said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The examination drive, initiated last June, focused on all
20,830 presidents and vice-presidents of procuratorates, and
chiefs and deputy chiefs of anti-corruption bureaus at more than
3,700 county and prefecture-level procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
They were inspected for their political and ideological
quality, work style, self-discipline and honesty, law-enforcement
proficiency level, and procedures by which they were elected and
appointed, as well as the situations in the departments under
their charge.
</P>
<P>
The officials were asked to report on their own work, and were
examined by their subordinates, deputies to local people's
congresses, and Party committees.

<HEADLINE> China Appoints 594 Anti-Corruption Bureau Chiefs (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the internal shake-up of prosecutors last year, a total of
827 people who were deemed "no longer suited to be prosecutors"
were dismissed, including Luo Ji and Huang Lizhi, former chief
and deputy chief of the General Bureau of Anti-Corruption under
the SPP.
</P>
<P>
According to Han, another 1,221 prosecutors who were appointed
without complying with legal procedures were removed from their
positions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the top legislator, Li Peng pointed out late last year that
"we cannot afford to waste any time in addressing the problem of
judicial corruption," and Han has mapped out even tougher
sanctions for procuratorate officials this year.
</P>
<P>
Any head of a procuratorate shall be forced to resign if any
serious crime, either of corruption or in the enforcement of the
law, is committed by anyone under his charge, Han said.
</P>
<P>
The SPP also plans to train all the presidents of grassroots
level procuratorates beginning this year in order to further
improve their proficiency level and political consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, prosecutors have been asked to inform criminal
suspects of all their legitimate rights before interrogation or
taking actions against them.
</P>
<P>
"Consolidating the political and proficiency level of
prosecutors, and safeguarding justice and the correct
implementation of the law shall be the long-term theme of the
procuratorates of China," Han said.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's top two women
tennis players, American Lindsay Davenport and Martina Hingis of
Switzerland, will meet in the final of the adidas International
Tennis Tournament in Sydney on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Davenport progressed to the final by beating former world
No.1, Germany's Steffi Graf, 6-2, 7-5 on Friday after Hingis had
edged past unheralded Austrian Barbara Schett 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
Hingis trailled 5-3 in the final set tie-breaker but a string
of backhand errors from Schett allowed her to sneak into the
final.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of Friday's result, Davenport will remain No.1 on
the WTA rankings.
</P>
<P>
Graf said she felt physically weak on Friday.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Unseeded Italian Rita Grande
will meet American Chanda Rubin in the final of the Tasmanian
International women's tennis tournament in Hobart, capital
Australia's island state of Tasmania, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Grande reached her first WTA final when she beat American Amy
Frazier 6-3, 7-5 on Friday, while Rubin had a walkover into
Saturday's final when top seed Julie Halard-Decugis of France
withdrew because of a strained stomach muscle.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Italian's greater aggression was the key in
her tight match against the experienced Frazier.
</P>
<P>
She served 11 aces and frequently had Frazier on the defensive
with her powerful forehand drives.
</P>
<P>
The match between the fifth-seeded Rubin, a former top ten
player, and Halard-Decugis had been expected to produce the
tournament winner.
</P>
<P>
But Halard-Decugis fell victim to her punishing schedule which
included wins in the last two WTA events in Pattaya, Thailand,
and Auckland.
</P>
<P>
She played six tight sets on Thursday, three in singles and
then three in doubles.
</P>
<P>
She said she found on Friday morning she could not serve
freely and was anxious to protect herself for the Australian
Open.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Get Grant from ADB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Friday approved a grant of 2.25 million U.S. dollars to help
Malaysia prepare a financial sector reform strategy, according to
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The grant is in response to Malaysia's request for technical
assistance in developing a diversified financial sector that
promotes economic growth and caters to different types of
investors and users of capital.
</P>
<P>
It also sought to reduce the costs of financial intermediation
and foster a well-regulated, supervised and
internationally-accepted sound practice in the market.
</P>
<P>
According to Bernama, ADB said in a statement that its
technical assistance will help Malaysia identify policies to
enhance competition and consolidation of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
"It will also focus on broadening and deepening the equity and
bond markets and enhancing the role of the contractual savings
industry," it said, adding the technical assistance will further
support the formulation of a sound supervisory, regulatory and
legal framework for all segments of the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
ADB noted that Malaysia's financial sector is relatively modern
and well developed with a diverse range of products and players.
</P>
<P>
But, the Asian currency crisis has underscored a number of
fundamental weaknesses in Malaysia's financial sector, ADB said.
</P>
<P>
ADB said the technical assistance is in line with the Malaysian
government's National Economic Recovery Plan (NERP) launched last
August, which aims to stabilize the ringgit, restore market
confidence and financial market stability and strengthen economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The grant will likewise deal with Malaysia's current short-run
problems related to the financial crisis, capital controls and
other strategic issues, it said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Financial Crisis Under New Zealand Scrutiny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand, an
export-oriented
economy, is following closely the development of Brazil's
financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although New Zealand's financial markets took Brazil's crisis
mostly in their stride Thursday, local analysts remain wary of the

threat to world growth and New Zealand's own economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the world's eighth biggest economy, shocked financial
markets in the world Thursday when it abruptly devalued its
currency,
raising the prospect of a recession in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"Commodity prices were hit as fears grew that cheap Brazilian
exports would flood world markets, undermining the currencies of
commodity-exporting countries such as New Zealand and Australia,"
a
Wellington-based newspaper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted a local economist as saying, "If things
escalate and it becomes a global problem then it is going to
affect
us. But in the meantime, taking a short-term approach, a lot of
the
companies here don't have a lot of exposure to that region."
</P>
<P>
Bernard Hodgetts, chief economist of New Zealand Limited of the

Australia-New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), was quoted as saying
the
biggest risk to New Zealand's recovery is the damage Brazil's
crisis
might do to confidence in international markets.
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that additional volatility starts to undermine
growth in our trading partners, it doesn't augur well for a
recovery.
That's the danger. But we're still optimistic that we can mount a
recovery in this environment, albeit a somewhat slower one than
might
otherwise be the case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neville Martin, spokesman of the New Zealand Dairy Board, said
that though Brazil is not one of New Zealand's biggest export
markets,
it is an important one. Board exports to Brazil worth 140 million
NZ
dollars (76 million U.S. dollars) would be cut by 10 to 15
percent,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Martin noted that the board is concerned that the situation
could
worsen and it is monitoring events.
</P>
<P>
But many local economists are confident that New Zealand can
escape Brazil's financial crisis relatively unscathed, despite
renewed fears of a big slowdown in world economic growth,
according
to the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangkok Police Tighten Security After Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A wave of bomb threat calls
have flooded police stations in Thailand's capital Bangkok in the
past few days, prompting police to tighten security measures.
</P>
<P>
Police recorded an unusual number of calls about bomb threats
on Thursday, including three at major department stores, although
all were hoaxes, police sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai convened a high-level meeting on
the day to deal with the bomb scares, which he said had adversely
affected the country in the middle of a campaign to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chuan summoned Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart, Police Commissioner-General Pracha Phromnok and
Metropolitan Police
Commissioner Wannarat Kocharak to map out measures to solve the
surge of bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
Chuan said after the meeting that he had been kept fully
informed about alleged bomb threats and police were investigating
the cause behind the scares.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the authorities will step up security measures,
including an increase in the number of police checkpoints, to
ensure safety and preempt any tragic fallout.
</P>
<P>
Chuan declined to speculate if the threats had political
motives, saying he preferred to wait for the probe result.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister has been assured by Supreme Commander
Mongkol Ampornpisit that the military will cooperate with police
in probing since the explosives used in recent cases could not
have been accessed by ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Police have revealed that the TNT explosive found on Wednesday
in a parking lot of a shopping mall was the work of a "real
professional" who assembled the bomb from materials available
either in the police or the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sanan said police were investigating if the
bomb planted in the parking lot was related to the other hoaxes
and if the scares were the outcome of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
He speculated that the bomb scares might die down after the
censure debate in the parliament, which was launched by the
opposition earlier in the week against several ministers for
alleged corruption, nepotism and poor management.
</P>
<P>
The spate of bomb threats has sent police scurrying in search
for explosives. In the latest bomb threat on Thursday, a caller
claimed that an unidentified man wearing a jacket had just put a
bomb in a paper box and left it on the fourth floor of a parking
lot on Sri Nakharin Road.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, another caller said an unidentified man wearing
sunglasses and a plaid shirt had offered him a sum of money to
take a black case over to a public place.
</P>
<P>
Soon after that, police received another call claiming that a
bomb was planted in a shopping plaza in Downtown Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Police rushed to the scenes with sniffer dogs but found
nothing.
</P>
<P>
Amornrat Hirankuea, a policeman working with a sniffer dog,
said the bomb threats had kept him and the animal working
overtime. But he said they were always ready to react to any
troublemakers threatening social security.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Announces Schedule for City Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
has announced the election schedule of 143 municipalities across
the country against the backdrop of a threat of the opposition to
boycott the poll.
</P>
<P>
Election will be held in 143 out of the country's 182
municipalities in phases on February 23, 24 and 25, according to
the election schedule announced on Thursday, press reports here
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, it will not take place in the rest 39 municipalities
because of legal disputes in 22, boundary disputes in 10 and
non-completion of the tenure of elected bodies in seven others.
</P>
<P>
The date for the submission of nomination paper is January 26
and for scrutiny January 27 and the last day for the withdrawal of
the candidature is February 3. The specific dates for polling in
the municipalities would be fixed by the deputy commissioners who
would act as election commissioners in their respective districts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Local Government, Rural Development and
Cooperatives Ministry announced an 11-point code of conduct for
the municipal polls, barring candidates from using the name of any
political party during the campaign. This would be the first time
that municipal elections in Bangladesh would be held under a code
of conduct.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has reacted strongly to the announcement of the
schedule, The Bangladesh Observer daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP), renewed its threat to boycott the elections if their
four-point demand, including the resignation of the chief election
commissioner, release of jailed political leaders and workers and
an end to arrest and repression of political leaders and workers,
is not accepted.
</P>
<P>
BNP Secretary General Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said they would
resist "unilateral" elections and start a movement to dislodge the
government unless the demand is accepted immediately.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief Election Commissioner Abu Hena said he is
ready to quit in the greater interest of the nation but not under
any "undue and unreasonable pressure," reports said.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to leave my office..., but I'll not bow to any
illogical and undue demand," he said after announcing the election
schedule on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Yangon Division Reclaims Land for Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
granted thousands of hectares of reclaimed vacant, fallow and
virgin land as well as wetlands in the country's Yangon division
to local private entrepreneurs to cultivate crops.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 16,602 hectares of such land reclaimed in the
division, 11,575 hectares were granted to the entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The move followed permission given earlier this month to nine
enterprises to engage more than 80,352 hectares of such land in
the northwestern Magway division.
</P>
<P>
More than 8.9 million hectares of vacant, fallow and virgin
land as well as wetlands in the country remain to be reclaimed,
said Friday's The New Light of Myanmar newspaper, quoting
Lieutenant-General Tin Oo.
</P>
<P>
At a permit presentation ceremony in Yangon division Wednesday,
Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, pointed out that if economic turmoil in Asian
nations is analyzed, it can be seen that nations, which could not
strengthen the agricultural sector, faced more food and clothing
hardships and various difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for Myanmar to produce sufficient amount
of food and clothing for its growing population and at least to
ensure rice and cooking oil sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is encouraging domestic private
entrepreneurs to invest more in agriculture, which is the mainstay
of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar has formed a special group under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to assist private
enterprises in undertaking large-scale farming.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
fallow land in Myanmar came to 1.1 million hectares and cultivable
wasteland 7.89 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
The country expanded cultivated land to 12.51 million hectares
in the year, 185,540 hectares more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production fell from 19 million tons in 1995-96
to 17.66 million tons in 1996-97 and then to 17.3 million tons in
1997-98 with its rice exports reducing from 354,000 tons to 93,100
tons and then to 28,300 tons correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's population is estimated to
have reached 46.4 million in 1997-98, growing by 1.84 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
In view of these facts, Myanmar is reclaiming more land for
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of export value, grew by 2.9
percent in output value in the fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Wants Talks With Thailand on Naval Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has tabled a request
for a meeting of the Thai-Myanmar local border committee to settle
the two countries' outstanding maritime disputes after the latest
naval clash in the Andaman Sea on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made in an aide memoir submitted on Thursday to
Thai Ambassador to Myanmar Pensak Chalarak by Nyunt Maung Sein,
chief of Myanmar's Department of Political Affairs, The Bangkok
Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Thai Navy patrol boat clashed with two Myanmar frigates after
it fired on a Myanmar vessel chasing two Thai trawlers in the
Andaman Sea Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the incident, the second in a month, stemmed from
the maritime border dispute between the two countries using two
different maps. Myanmar, citing a British map, claims the islands
of Ko Khi Nok, Ko Lam and Ko Khan while Thailand says the islands
are inside its maritime boundary.

<HEADLINE> India Inc. Loses Much Money on Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Corporates in India are
fighting a growing menace of frauds, a recent survey by Peat
Marwick said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the survey, 57 percent of the respondents said they had
encountered frauds in their organizations and their total losses
amounted to 2.307 billion rupees (55.46 million U.S. dollars).
Altogether 52 percent of them felt fraud was a major problem in
business today.
</P>
<P>
Though weakening of social values was cited as the main reason
(71 percent) for the increasing corporate frauds, 50 percent of
the respondents felt that inadequate punishment for those who were
caught was a major incentive, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Peat Marwick has been carrying out fraud surveys since 1995.
For the latest survey, 800 companies sent in their answers.
</P>
<P>
Companies experiencing deceit typically carried out an
investigation and concluded it with termination of employment.
Only 37 percent of the companies reported the matter to the police
while 36 percent permitted the employee to resign.
</P>
<P>
The typical fraud is male, within the age group of 26-40 years
and has an income in the range of 100,000-250,000 rupees
(2,403.85-6,009.62 dollars) per annum. An overwhelming 61 percent
said the cheats too were getting sophisticated, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Drafts Law on Foreign Exchange Transfers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government plans
to strictly monitor the flow of foreign exchange by requiring all
transfers of capital in and out of the country to be reported,
according to a new draft law.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Exchange Traffic and Exchange Rate System Bill will
be submitted by the government to the House of Representatives for
deliberation early next month, The Jakarta Post reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates that every "person or legal body within the
region of Indonesia is required to inform banks or other parties
appointed by Bank Indonesia about the transfer or moving of a
certain amount of foreign currency or rupiah to or from the
country."
</P>
<P>
The bill does not give a figure for the minimum amount of money
transferred that should be reported to the government.
</P>
<P>
The "moving" of capital means the act of bringing either the
foreign currency or rupiah, in cash, into or out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Each report should cite the amount of the transfer, the type of
foreign currency, the purpose of the transfer and the source of
the revenue, names of receiving and sending parties and the
countries of origin and destination of the money.
</P>
<P>
The appointed banks or related parties must report to the
central bank immediately.
</P>
<P>
The bill also stipulates that the government will determine the
system of exchange rate to be applied after consulting with Bank
Indonesia, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The government will choose between the fixed, free or managed
floating exchange rate systems, according to an explanation of the
draft law.
</P>
<P>
If passed, the bill would replace the current 1964 foreign
exchange law.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, Indonesia has been applying a free foreign exchange
system, which allows every person or legal body to freely own,
transfer or use foreign currency in transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Shortly after her retirement
from competitive tennis at this month's Australian Open, Yayuk
Basuki will embark on a new career as a coach of Indonesian
women's national team.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general of the Indonesian Tennis Association
(Pelti) Sugent Sarjadi told reporters that Yayuk was expected to
make her international coaching debut at the Fed Cup Asia Oceania
qualifying tournament in Bangkok next month.
</P>
<P>
The world number 55, fresh from her Asian Games victory last
December, was also named the team's playing captain, although
Sugent said her appearance on the court would depend on the
situation in the squad.
</P>
<P>
"She is not expected to form the backbone of the team, but
rather serve as a stand-in for the doubles match," Sugent was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk last played in the Fed Cup two years ago at the Asia
Oceania qualifying tournament in Wellington, New Zealand, which
Indonesia won.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk said she was looking forward to training juniors who
would one day fill her shoes.
</P>
<P>
"I won't hang up my racket altogether because there are new
challenges in tennis still waiting for me. I hope I will enjoy
them," Yayuk said.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Opportunities for China-EU Relations (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin is to
make what promises to be a spectacular visit to Britain as a
guest of Queen Elizabeth II later this year, the first visit to
the UK by a Chinese head of state since the two countries forged
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
This will herald a whole raft of new opportunities for the
development of relations between China, Britain and the European
Union per se, which will be underlined by a number of planned
exchange visits by high level officials and ministers.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Sino-British ties have become much closer since the
smooth return of Hong Kong to China in 1997. Taking into
consideration Britain's important role in the European Union,
President Jiang's historic visit will have a far-reaching and
beneficial effect on future relations between the two countries
and with Europe in general.
</P>
<P>
When the British Prime Minister Tony Blair was in China last
October he commented that the Chinese president's trip to Britain
would be a "milestone" in bilateral relations and that the
British Queen and her people are looking forward with huge
enthusiasm to welcoming him.
</P>
<P>
And the German government, another senior EU member, has
stressed the importance of its ongoing positive attitude towards
China following the electoral success of the Social Democratic
Party last year. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will visit
China early this year when he will officiate as president of the
EU at the second China-EU Conference in Beijing, which Chinese
pundits believe will strengthen the already well established
ties.
</P>
<P>
Last year both China and the EU declared that they were keen
to set up a long-term and stable partnership, which would benefit
both into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Information Sharing Among Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of more than
120 libraries and information centers met in Beijing Thursday to
discuss ways to improve information sharing, China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
If implemented, steps taken would improve the state's
knowledge-based economic development, the representatives said.
</P>
<P>
Libraries and information centers have a key role to play in
propelling the state's scientific and technological development,
and in improving society, Sun Jiazheng, minister of culture, said
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a response to President Jiang Zemin's recent call at the
National Library of China to fuel a book-loving trend nationwide,
the meeting's participants agreed to set up national document and
information networks to encourage the sharing of resources that
are inaccessible at this time or otherwise inconvenient for
readers to obtain, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The national networks would provide quality and highly
efficient services to the public by converting more traditional
library resources into digitally based resources and by
developing more databases, while making on-line lending and
reference services available, it said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a set of unified rules and technical
standards for digitizing the resources and transmitting them to
networks," Sun said.

<HEADLINE> Overseas-Funded Firms Become New Factor in Shaanxi's Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The import and export value of
the overseas-funded enterprises in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province reached 324.56 million U.S. dollars in 1998, an increase
of 13.5 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that this segment of the local economy
accounted for 14.6 percent of the province's total in 1998, with
the import volume increasing by 14.7 percent compared with 1997.
At the same time, foreign exchange earned by these enterprises
registered a 12 percent rise over 1997.
</P>
<P>
An official of the provincial department for foreign trade and
economic cooperation said that nearly half of the 2,600
foreign-funded enterprises approved by the province have achieved
good economic results.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Johnson Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., the Shaanxi Weihe
Electricity-Generating Co. Ltd., and the Shaanxi Konka
Electronics Co. Ltd. were all listed among the country's top 500
foreign-funded enterprises in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis, the foreign trade volume
of the province did not decline last year due to the timely
readjustment of market strategy by these foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an Aian Optical and Electronic Co. Ltd., for example,
mainly exported its products to Japan and southeast Asian
countries in the past. Last year, it shifted its focus to
expanding market in Europe and the United State. As a result, the
company's export sales income reached 5.56 million U.S. dollars
by the end of November last year, a 59 percent rise over the same
1997 period.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar to Step Up Narcotics Suppression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
agreed to step up narcotics suppression cooperation along their
common border.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a two-day meeting of Thai and
Myanmar anti-narcotics authorities which ended on Wednesday in
Tachilek, Myanmar, The Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major General Hla Tun, deputy director-general of the Myanmar
national police, was quoted as saying Myanmar has realized the
problem of the spread of amphetamines across the border with
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Last year the Myanmar authorities seized more than 16 million
amphetamine pills, 9,396 kilograms of opium and 4,404 kilograms of
heroin with cooperation from Thailand and the U.N. Drugs Control
Program. Myanmar will raid narcotics production plants once their
locations are known, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Myanmar is carrying out a 15-year narcotics suppression
program which began in 1992. He admitted that the country lacks
financial support from other countries, but said Myanmar's leaders
and low-level authorities have paid full attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Sorasit Saengprasert, deputy secretary-general of the Office of
the Narcotics Control Board of Thailand, said the Thai side had
obtained clearer information on locations of villages believed to
be sources of narcotics as well as identities of some traders.

GUANGZHOU, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Guangdong provincial
frontier bureau has cracked several dozens of smuggling cases in
the first week of the new year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has decided to focus its efforts on small smuggling
cases this year which it says is a developing criminal trend.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Oilfield Exploits New Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shengli Oilfield, China's
second largest, pumped 1.81 million tons of crude oil last year
from the Bohai Sea, making the area the largest offshore oilfield
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts call this a major breakthrough in the national effort
to use offshore oil reserves to offset a fall in continental
production.
</P>
<P>
Shengli was set up in 1964 at the mouth of the Yellow River
and has since produced 640 million tons of crude oil, or more
than a fourth of the country's total since 1949. In recent years,
its annual output has been dropping because of shrinking oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield began offshore operations in the Bohai Sea ten
years ago and has built more than 40 drilling platforms,
including a mobile one.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield is expected to raise its yearly output of marine
crude oil to five million tons in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dianchi Lake Gets Big Clean Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- China has speeded up pollution
control in the Dianchi Lake, the sixth largest of China's fresh
water lakes in southwestern Yunnan Province, to welcome the
coming World Horticulture Exposition which takes place on May 1 th
is year.
</P>
<P>
The famous lake, on a high plateau which covers 307 square
kilometers, plays a key role in balancing the ecological
environment in Kunming, the provincial capital and venue of the
exposition.
</P>
<P>
However, the lake's water has become murky through the amount
of industrial and domestic waste discharged into it over the last
20 years, and fast-increasing algae, whose growth is encouraged
by the chemicals and warm waters from sewage and factories, is
also clogging it up.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed the Dianchi Lake as one
of the key projects to be tackled in the "three rivers and three
lakes" (Liaohe, Huaihe and Haihe rivers and Taihu, Chaohu and
Dianchi lakes) project.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the provincial environment protection bureau said
that the pollution control project will cost three billion yuan
(361 million U.S. dollars), with 150 million U.S. dollars of
loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Xu Haiping, deputy researcher of the Yunnan Environment
Science Research Institute, disclosed that the state has launched
19 projects over the past two years, including five sewage
treatment plants, two waterworks and improvement of the water
supply system in Kunming. The projects also include the setting
up of 18 garbage distribution and disposal centers and
improvement in the monitoring of Dianchi's environment.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition is scheduled to
be held from May 1 to October 31. More than 10 million visitors
from home and abroad are expected to visit the city over the
period.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kunming city government banned the sales and
use of detergent which contains phosphorus which was then
discharged into the Dianchi Lake valley. It also closed down more
than 20 enterprises found to be responsible for pollution.
</P>
<P>
A project to dredge the bottom of the lake is also going on
smoothly and should be completed by April this year.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts estimate that upon completion, these
projects will help raise Kunming's waste water treatment
facilities to over 80 percent, and the major pollutants of the
Dianchi Lake -- such as phosphorus and nitrogen -- will be
reduced by 80 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, reported a
year-on-year industrial output growth of 12.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Recent figures from the provincial statistics bureau show the
combined industrial output of major enterprises was more than
881.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local experts consider this a good foundation for the
province's continuing economic growth in the new year.
</P>
<P>
They attribute this to the increase of investment in infrastruc
ture and basic industries, as well as the province's shift of
focus to new and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the output of major basic products,
such as iron and steel and glass, grew by 11 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
High-tech products like computers and telecommunications
equipment scored even higher growths of between 68.3 to 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
Efficiency in the sector as a whole also improved, with
pre-tax profits for the first 11 months of 1998 topping 43.2
billion yuan, equal to the total for all of 1997.

world's top 500 companies have been cooperating through various
forms with enterprises based in Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The increased inflow of overseas investment is welcomed as an
increasing number of the enterprises in the province, which has
one tenth of China's large and medium-sized enterprises, are
attempting to put an end to losses and find ways out of financial
difficulties.

BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- A man in China's largest
commercial city of Shanghai was permanently crippled by a
sub-standard steel plate which had been implanted in his leg.
</P>
<P>
With his right leg now two centimeters shorter than the left,
the man, surnamed Qu, sued the hospital and demanded compensation
of 154,263 yuan (about 18,000 U.S. dollars), according to the
Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News.
</P>
<P>
After discovering that Qu's disability was caused by the
defective steel plate, as well as his original bone problem, the
court ruled that the hospital must pay Qu 66,580 yuan in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
On January 8, 1997, Qu fell from his bicycle and severed his
shin bone. He underwent surgery at the Shanghai No.1 Textile
Industrial Hospital, and the steel plate was implanted to heal
the bone.
</P>
<P>
Seven months later, however, he was having pain in the injured
area and an X-ray revealed that the steel plate had cracked.
</P>
<P>
He received a second operation to remove the plate, and was

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans to Expand Consumer Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The commercial sector of
Beijing must take steps to invigorate the market this year,
Deputy Mayor Meng Xuenong, who is in charge of the capital's
commercial affairs, said at a recent municipal work conference.
</P>
<P>
He urged to increase sales of decorative items, furniture and
cars by satisfying the needs and demands of consumers, said the
deputy mayor, while calling on the sector to seize the
opportunities created by upgrading infrastructure in urban
districts and improving the marketing of domestic appliances.
</P>
<P>
According to Meng, consumer credit facilities will be applied
at more stores, with the priority placed in those engaged in
large durable consumer commodities and home decoration.
</P>
<P>
Chain-store operators, with a sound financial base, will be
encouraged to bring about overall prosperity by reorganizing
their assets, transforming share-holding policies and franchises,
added the deputy mayor, who also called for the construction of
more large stores with special features, exclusive dealerships
and convenience shops.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, efforts should be made to expand the cheap,
take-away meals business, develop more best-selling brands,
increase the marketing of tourist souvenirs, and establish
districts that combine shopping, catering, entertainment and
accommodation. New ways will be introduced to expand the leasing
business, he announced.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that retail sale volume of consumer
commodities in Beijing was 116.5 billion yuan in 1998. Due to the
adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis, China has had a
slow economic growth last year. The market in the country has

<HEADLINE> Biennial World Cup Plans to Be Discussed at FIFA Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter's
controversial proposal to stage a World Cup finals every two
years is to be discussed at a high-level meeting in Zurich on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The general secretaries of all six continental federations are
expected to voice mix opinions about Blatter's plan at the first
summit meeting on the most contentious issue to hit the sport in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Blatter's proposal has to go through a number of FIFA
committees and get the nod of the majority of the executive
before it could be introduced.
</P>
<P>
Europe, as well as their South American counterparts, have
been the most vocal opponent of the biennial World Cup plan.
</P>
<P>
But Issa Hayatou, the president of Confederation of African
Football (CAF), said he is in favour because Blatter's idea to
use the continental championship as a World Cup qualifying
competition would make things easier for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa has a biennial regional championship, the African
Nations Cup, and would have their calendar eased if sending the
qualifiers of the Nations Cup to the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Jack Walker, head on the CONCACAF region that covers north and
central America and the Caribbean, said he also supported the
idea.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the only area whose championship holds every four
years.

<HEADLINE> UEFA General Secretary Threatens Breakaway: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- General secretary of European
football's governing body UEFA Gerhard Aigner threatened a
breakaway from FIFA should its president Sepp Blatter continue
with his new World Cup ideas, according to a German newspaper on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Blatter is advocating a World Cup every two years, instead of
four, to try and elevate the status of international football
over the club game.
</P>
<P>
"If this continues, we could eventually have a breakaway from
FIFA," said Aigner in Thursday's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
"Although we would never choose this path.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying we want to boycott the World Cup but, on the
other hand, nothing can force our federations to play in a World
Cup every two years."
</P>
<P>
Aigner said Blatter should have consulted the confederations
before announcing his proposals.

<HEADLINE> China's Listed Companies Warn of Possible Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Another seven companies listed
on China's stock exchanges warned investors today of possible
losses for 1998, bringing the total number of listed companies
anticipating losses to 30.
</P>
<P>
The fact that companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges have announced the possibility of losses prior to
the publication of annual reports is seen as a positive step for
reducing market risk.
</P>
<P>
Related regulations require listed companies to publish annual
financial reports within four months after the end of their
fiscal year. However, the fact that listed companies with bad
results or losses previously delayed the issuance of reports
until as late as April had a negative impact on the markets.
</P>
<P>
Securities experts said that the advance warning of possible
losses will help alleviate pressure on the markets resulting from
the mass publication of reports by loss-making companies, as well
as reduce or prevent risk and promote rational investments.
</P>
<P>
They added that warnings will provide investors with a clear
understanding of the results of listed companies and will in turn
promote healthy development of the market.
</P>
<P>
Most of the aforementioned companies attributed losses to the
sluggish markets, intense competition, lingering liabilities and
effort to upgrade production lines.
</P>
<P>
Some 810 enterprises are listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen
stock exchanges, the only two in the country at present.
Forty-one listed companies reported losses for the 1997 fiscal
year, with the number rising to 71 companies by mid-1998.

CANBERRA, January 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Unemployment in Australia has tumbled to 7.5 percent in
December last year, the lowest level in more than eight years,
putting the timing of another interest rate cut in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Successive governments of Australia's premier state New
South Wales, whose capital is Sydney, have been "unnecessarily"

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>

reform of the armed services.

The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund has scrambled to calm
markets and pressure Brazil to meet its fiscal reform promises in

Brazilian currency.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Punish EU With 520 Mln Dlrs in Trade Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Thursday
formally told the World Trade Organization (WTO) of its plans to
slap 520 million U.S. dollars in punitive import duties on
European Union goods in a trade dispute over bananas.
</P>
<P>
The notification was the first step in the WTO process to
impose the sanctions, senior U.S. Trade Representative negotiator
Peter Scher said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions could go into effect as early as February 1. But
they could be delayed until March 3 if the EU challenges the
amount, Scher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs would hit only a tiny part of the 300 billion U.S.
dollar flow of goods between the United States and Europe, but the
dispute over bananas has contributed to growing trade tensions
between the two economic powers.
</P>
<P>
Scher said the United States was also seeking formal
consultations with the EU to try to settle the dispute through
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We have tried unsuccessfully to get the EU to negotiate with
us over the last 18 months," Scher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It would be our hope that they would view the WTO
consultations as an appropriate venue to work with us to negotiate
a solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The WTO agreed this week to a request by Ecuador to reconvene
an expert panel to review the new EU banana import system to
decide whether it complied with trade rules.
</P>
<P>
Scher said the United States intends to press ahead with
sanctions despite the review in an effort to prompt a quick
resolution of the long-standing dispute.
</P>
<P>
"It will be our hope that the EU would see that the price of
having to pay these tariffs is worse than the price of having to
come into compliance with their obligations," Scher said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking sanctions because it says the EU
has failed to comply with a 1997 WTO ruling that found its banana
import policies discriminated against U.S. companies and Latin
American producers.
</P>
<P>
The EU says its new import rules that took effect on January 1
comply with WTO rules and the United States is violating
international trade rules by unilaterally imposing trade sanctions
in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The United States says the new rules do not comply with WTO
rulings and that it is within its rights to seek compensation for
the loss of banana trade.
</P>
<P>
The 100 percent tariffs would hit goods including cheese,
cookies, candles, handbags, paper, greeting cards, sweaters,
linen, batteries, coffee and tea makers and chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
The United States says the EU import rules favor bananas from
former European colonies, mostly in the Caribbean, that are often
marketed by European-based firms.
</P>
<P>
Scher said pork imports were added to the list after reviewing
a request by U.S. pork producers that their product be included in
the proposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Imports from Denmark and the Netherlands were exempted because
those two countries opposed the new import rules.

<HEADLINE> Euro Transition Period Should Be Kept: EVA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Vending
Association (EVA) said Thursday that any change of the euro
transition period should be opposed because much of preparatory
work will not be done until the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of vending machine operators and builders in Europe,
the EVA said in a statement that January 1, 2002 should remain the
E-day.
</P>
<P>
Referring to some politicians' expression about shortening of
the euro transitional period and early introduction of euro coins,
the EVA said it strongly rejects any such proposal as the industry
will not be ready before that date and will require three full
years to change over 3.5 million machines in the euroland.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the European Commission also is anxious to keep the
transition period for the euro, saying the delay can be justified
on several grounds: sufficient time must be left to allow for the
production and distribution of notes and coins; business and
public administrations must be left sufficient time to plan for
the changeover to the euro; and public awareness of the new scale
of values represented by the single currency must also be
awakened.
</P>
<P>
Legally, the three-year transition period was endorsed on the
adoption of the scenario for the changeover to the single currency
at the Madrid European Council in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the European Commission, the European Union's
executive branch, has also confirmed that its services are
currently conducting an inquiry into banking charges for
transboundary transfer in the euroland.

</P>

The EU has seen the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry greet the

Russia from a more dynamic EU financial market, and to the

<HEADLINE> IOC Rules out Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee has ruled out further punishment of the Salt Lake
Olympics effort, according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
A federal grand jury in Salt Lake City will begin evidence of
tax fraud and bribery as early as next week, the Salt Lake
Tribune said in a story today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jacques Rogge, a member of the IOC panel probing
into allegations, announced: "The commission will not recommend
any action against Salt Lake City. There is no action to be
taken."
</P>
<P>
Rogge confirmed that up to 12 IOC members have implicated in
the inquiry, but rejected calls for IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch's resignation as "ridiculous."
</P>
<P>
He said the panel had considered sanctions against Salt Lake
officials but the action was ruled out when the organizing
committee's two top officials resigned last week.
</P>
<P>
"The people who were in the bid are no more," Rogge said in a
telephone interview. "They took the actions they thought were
needed."

<HEADLINE> U.S Considering to Supply Patriot Missiles to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to supply Patriot anti-missile missiles at Turkey's
request amid confrontations between the United States and Iraq
over the northern no-fly zone in Iraq, the Pentagon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at their request and will reach a decision on
that very soon," spokesman Navy Capt. Mike Doubleday told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in being as supportive as we can to any of
our coalition partners who are involved in this operation,"
Doubleday added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes fly regular flights out of Incirlik Air Force
Base in southern Turkey to enforce the northern no-fly zone in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As Iraq does not recognize both northern and southern no-fly
zones, imposed by the United States and its allies, its air
defense systems repeatedly clashed with U.S. and British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
There have been eight confrontations between U.S. patrolling
planes and Iraqi radar sites and Iraqi planes since the United
States and Britain airstruck Iraqi military and security targets
in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
In Ankara, an official statement said, "It is felt that Patriot
missiles could have a useful role to play and the United States
has been asked whether such missiles could be brought to Turkey.
The U.S. response has been positive."
</P>
<P>
Doubleday did not explain why Turkey felt it needed the
Patriots, which were used in Israel during the Gulf War in 1991 to
shoot down incoming Iraqi Scud missiles.

an IOC member and people acting as agents on behalf of members
solicited cash payments and "incentives" from him during the bid
process.

<HEADLINE> Venables Verdict on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Former England manager Terry
Venables will continue talks with Crystal Palace owner Mark
Goldberg on Friday over his future as manager of the south London
side.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Palace said the two had had a "long and constr
uctive meeting".
</P>
<P>
Venables added: "We are sorting out the problem, we have gone
a long way but it will go into tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Goldberg had to cut short the talks to attend a
hastily-organised board meeting where the club's mounting
financial problems were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Reports have suggested for several days that Venables, one of
the most colourful characters in British football, is poised to
leave the club.
</P>
<P>
But he has said he wants to stay at Selhurst Park, although he
claimed a rethink of approach was needed by Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he will get there in the end, and Mark still has the
five-year plan he had when he first took over the club," said
Venables.
</P>
<P>
"But it may be that he has to change it along the way.
</P>
<P>
"We all have to change our tactics in the short term, and he
might have to change," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ex-Tottenham and Barcelona boss is adamant his
relationship with Goldberg will not be affected by developments
at Palace.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem between us and whatever happens I believe
we will remain friends," Venables said.
</P>
<P>
"It could be that I stay at the club in some capacity, it
could be that I go."
</P>
<P>
If Venables does indeed leave, Dave Bassett could take over at
the club he managed between 1996 and 1997, after being sacked by
Nottingham Forest last week.
</P>
<P>
Bassett was axed as Forest boss after a sorry run of results
and the former Wimbledon manager did not rule out a return to
Selhurst: "I haven't got a clue what's going on with Palace," he
said. "What can I do if speculation links me?
</P>
<P>
"I'll return when I think the right offer comes along. I'll
play it by ear. I'm open-minded about it."
</P>
<P>
Venables took over at Selhurst Park in June but has failed to
deliver a push for promotion back to the Premiership following
last year's relegation.
</P>
<P>
They currently languish in the bottom half of the First
Division, and are poised to sell star striker Matt Jansen to ease
mounting financial problems.
</P>
<P>
Venables was appointed by Goldberg in one of the owner's first
acts after taking control of the club.
</P>
<P>
But he is thought to be unhappy with the Jansen's imminent
departure, as well as the recent sale of Paul Warhurst to
Bolton.

<HEADLINE> Merson Future in Doubt Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Paul Merson's remarkable season
could be set for yet another twist, after he hinted he might be
ready to leave Aston Villa just five months after arriving.
</P>
<P>
The England midfielder, who joined the Midlands side in controv
ersial circumstances, has accused the club of failing to deal
with his well-publicised alcohol and drugs problems.
</P>
<P>
Merson left Middlesbrough for 6.75 million pounds in
September, citing the drinking and gambling habits of the
players, which he feared could halt his rehabilitation programme.
</P>
<P>
But after an initial period of success at Villa, it has turned
sour for the former Arsenal star.
</P>
<P>
Merson has become embroiled in a row with manager John Gregory
over reports criticising his weekend flight by Concorde to the
United States - and he claims he has been cold shouldered by
Gregory since returning on Monday.
</P>
<P>
And his message to the man who signed him was: "If Villa don't
understand my addiction, then there is going to be a problem."
</P>
<P>
Merson, who returned to reserve team action on Wednesday after
a back injury, defended his decision to fly to the US last week
instead of travelling with the team to play Boro in the
Premiership.
</P>
<P>
"I was injured and was never going to travel to last
Saturday's match at Middlesbrough because I would have been shot
if I had gone back there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I had the weekend off and had been feeling depressed and down
so I thought I would get away for a pick-me-up. That's what the
trip was for me.
</P>
<P>
"It's four years now since I faced up to my addictions and
everyone should know by now about that situation, how hard it is
for me every now and then. The trip to America was intended to
give me a lift.
</P>
<P>
"I know Villa paid a lot of money for me but my addiction is
part of the package. That's the way I am and everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
"If I am down I need to get away and the weekend experience
definitely worked for me - but then I come back to find flak
about me in the papers and all the negative stuff coming out is
frightening."
</P>
<P>
"Bryan Robson knew my addiction was part of the package when
he bought me from Arsenal. If the boss here at Villa doesn't
understand then there is going to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
"It said in the papers that a source close to the club said
the manager wasn't happy about me flying away. I was quite
disappointed by that.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather the boss had come out and said to me, 'you
were out of order for going,' but all I read is the stuff in the
papers.
</P>
<P>
"It would have been nice if Villa had come out and said, 'Pau
l's gone away for a break and will come back buzzing' and it's a
fact that if I am alright in myself, then I'll play alright. If
I'm not, I won't.
</P>
<P>
"But that's not happened. All I read is about me being on a
plane for three hours - and I don't like that."
</P>
<P>
Now Merson fears his place in the Villa team could be affected
by his row with Gregory.
</P>
<P>
"Since I returned the boss has not talked to me," he added. "I
find that at odd - and as a 30-year-old I don't need that.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he agrees with what I did at the weekend. I
think it will be held against me and at the moment I don't see
myself being picked for the Everton game.
</P>
<P>
"As for the future, I don't know. I'll have to take it one day
at a time but I am not happy with all the negative stuff that has
come out," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Create Coldest Thing in The Universe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A sample of gas inside a glass
cell in a physics laboratory at the University of Sussex, southern
England, has become the coldest place in the known Universe, the
BBC reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gas in the cell has been cooled so that its temperature is
only a few hundred billionths of a degree above so-called absolute
zero, the coldest possible temperature.
</P>
<P>
Dr Malcolm Boshier and colleagues achieved the record low
temperature while investigating a theory of Albert Einstein's,
developed with Satyendra Bose, that atoms cooled close to absolute
zero would conglomerate into a 'superatom.'
</P>
<P>
This state of matter, first produced in 1995, is known as a
Bose-Einstein Condensate and can be used for precise measurements
of previously unknown quantities.
</P>
<P>
The researchers first pre-cooled a cloud rubidium atoms by
bouncing lasers off them.
</P>
<P>
The atoms, which are held in a high quality vacuum, are then
trapped in a strong magnetic field so that only the hottest atoms
can escape. Those that remain are cold enough to form a
Bose-Einstein Condensate.

<HEADLINE> Overheated Blood May Cause Cot Death, Study Suggests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cot death may be caused by a
failure of the body's blood vessels and airways to cool down blood
before it enters the brain, British scientists have claimed.
</P>
<P>
The blood vessels and airways in the head may be arranged to
act as a heat exchanger that cools blood before it enters the
brain, said researchers from the Institute of Neurology in London.
</P>
<P>
The failure of this system to prevent the brain overheating
might be a cause of sudden infant death syndrome, they reported in
the New Scientist magazine.
</P>
<P>
Professor George du Boulay and his colleagues threaded a tiny
thermometer called a thermocouple up through the internal carotid
artery of a macaque monkey.
</P>
<P>
After comparing the temperature of blood in this artery with
other tissues, they found that blood in the artery was
consistently about 1.5 Celsius below rectal or brain tissue
temperatures before it even reached the cavernous sinus.
</P>
<P>
"We were very surprised to find such a large temperature
difference," Professor du Boulay said. "It is very, very likely
that the arterial blood is being cooled by the airway and that
further cooling comes from the cavernous sinus."
</P>
<P>
He said that if the cooling system fails to lower brain
temperature in an infant, it might even explain some cot deaths.
</P>
<P>
Cool air may not reach the nose or face of a baby lying face
down, which might be enough to make the brain's heat exchanger
fail and trigger cot death, he suggested.

</P>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks fell deeply
Thursday in response to the financial troubles in Brazil and the
impeachment trial against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average was closed at 9,120.93,
down 228.63. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite was down
39.99 at 2,276.82.
</P>
<P>
The consecutive market fall in the past two days was triggered
by Brazil's financial turmoil. In the Brazilian commercial city
of Sao Paulo, stock exchange was suspended 30 minutes after a
10 percent of drop this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Brazil run into the financial troubles after it announced
an 8 percent currency devaluation yesterday, causing the Dow to
suffer its first loss of 125.12 points on that day.
</P>
<P>
The impeachment trial against Clinton, which opened in
Washington today, accelerated the New York stock market decline.
Clinton stands accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in
the first presidential impeachment trial since Andrew Johnson
was acquited in 1868.
</P>
<P>
The lower earnings for Eastman Kodak drove its stock
down more than 10 percent, also making a damage to the Dow.
The film maker, one of the 30 stocks in Wall Street's
most-watched market indicator, announced its fourth quarter
earnings are well below the expectations.
</P>
<P>
Broad indexes also got sufferings. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 22.21 at 1,212.19, while NYSE was dow 9.65 at

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Calcium May Help Prevent Colon Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. New England Journal
of Medicine Thursday advised people to drink milk because it could
keep your colon healthy.
</P>
<P>
A study, conducted by the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in
Lebanon, N.H., suggests that adding calcium to your diet can keep
you from getting tumors in your large intestine. The effect was
moderate but significant, the study says.
</P>
<P>
The Medical Center followed 832 people who had surgery for
colorectal adenomas-benign tumors at six hospitals around the
country. Half were then prescribed calcium supplements and half
got placebos. They were checked for new adenomas for four years.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent in the first group were taking their pills
at least 90 percent of the time during the fourth year. In the
second through fourth years of the study, 127 of the 409 people
taking calcium had developed at least one adenoma, compared with
159 of the 423 taking placebos. Moreover, there were more tumors
per patient in the placebo group: 0.73 compared with 0.55.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Slip on Growing Inventories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices ended lower Thursday,
shedding early modest technical gains amid a continued abundance
of supply in heating oil and the prospect of warmer weather in key
consuming centers.
</P>
<P>
International benchmark Brent crude's March contract ended
Thursday trade 12 cents lower at 10.83 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Oil markets, which have suffered chronic weakness for months,
continue to miss out on the fundamental strength which winter in
the northern hemisphere normally provides.
</P>
<P>
Industry data Wednesday highlighted an unseasonable crude oil
stockbuild of over 3 million barrels in the United States last
week. Distillate stocks, comprised of heating oil and diesel, were
up by over half a million barrels.
</P>
<P>
"The concern is that even when the weather is cold, there is
still more than enough heating oil to supply the market," Reuters
quoted Leslie Nicholas at GNI London as saying in his daily
report.
</P>
<P>
In another development, an announcement by the United States
that it planned to propose to the U.N. Security Council that Iraq
be allowed to sell as much oil as it wants to purchase food and
medicine for its people initially depressed markets.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq's Ambassador to the United Nations Nizar Hamdoon
described the proposal as "meaningless," causing New York and
London prices to regain some of the losses.
</P>
<P>
The United States knows that Iraq cannot reach the current
sales ceiling of 5.26 billion dollars of oil sales every six
months because of limited export capacity and low oil prices,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move came after France Wednesday gave the U.N.
Security Council a three-point plan on Iraq that calls for lifting
the oil embargo and a looser system to monitor Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The timing of the lifting of sanctions on Iraq is probably the
most important long-term issue facing the oil market today," a
report by Mehdi Varzi of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson bank was quoted
by Reuters as saying. "Indeed Iraq's production is likely to be
one of the key determinants of oil prices in the coming decade."

<HEADLINE> Germany Welcomes European Parliament's Rejection of Censure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder expressed cautious satisfaction Thursday that the
European Parliament rejected a motion of censure against the
European Commission, which runs the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder told reporters in Berlin that he backed a strong
commission, given upcoming tasks of reforming European Union
(EU) finances -- known as Agenda 2000 -- and preparing for
enlargement into Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission -- the EU's executive body -- has been
accused of mismanagement of funds and corruption.
</P>
<P>
But a majority of members in the European Parliament in
Strasbourg voted Thursday against the proposed censure motion. A
two-thirds majority would have been required to dismiss the
commission.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer also welcomed the vote.
</P>
<P>
"The voting result assures that there is a commission capable
of doing business... during the final phase of negotiations for
Agenda 2000, which is crucial for the EU," said Fischer in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed there would have to be rigorous investigation
of the accusations leveled at the European Commission. "Germany,
in close cooperation with fellow members states, will make an
active contribution," he said.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the vote went beyond the corruption
accusations, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue between the European Parliament and the
commission, the intense reporting in the media, and the big public
interest -- all underscore the birth of a European democratic
culture and a European public extending over borders," said
Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Germany holds the rotating EU presidency for the first half of
1999.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Venezuela's Chavez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet Venezuela's president-elect Hugo Chavez, a former
paratrooper who was denied a U.S. visa in 1998 for leading a
bloody coup attempt in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"We offered him a meeting at the White House and he accepted,"
a spokesman for Clinton said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will meet with White House National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger and Clinton will join the meeting later, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Chavez will take office on February 2. His country is the
United States' main oil supplier along with Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Chavez's nationalist electoral platform worried foreign
investors and the United States. But after his landslide victory
in December, the U.S. government said it would welcome a visit by
Chavez to Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs
Peter Romero flew to Caracas two weeks ago and met Chavez. The
official said Washington would support Chavez as long as he stuck
to Venezuela's constitution.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims in U.S. Drop Again Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. new applications for
jobless benefits dropped by 4,000 last week, the second straight
weekly decline after an unexpected pick-up during Christmas week,
the Labor Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The decline pushed the number of unemployment down to 352,000
for the week ending January 9.
</P>
<P>
Claims had fallen by an even larger 16,000 the week before. But
both of those declines followed a surge of 83,000 in the week
ending December 26.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims rose to 342,250, an
increase of 13,000 from the previous week. That marked the highest
level for the four-week average since mid-July when layoffs were
boosted by the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
Economists said despite the small upward trend in jobless
claims, the country's job market remains exceptionally tight.
</P>
<P>
The Department reported last week that the unemployment rate
for December fell to a low of 4.3 percent, capping a year in which
the jobless rate averaged just 4.5 percent, the best performance
since 1969.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the strength in labor markets reflected
the strong economy, which has so far been able to withstand a big
drop in export earnings caused by world economic crises.

<HEADLINE> No Indefinite Postponement in Signing Arm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
that he cannot postpone indefinitely the signing of certain arms
purchase agreement and the implementation of other agreements.
</P>
<P>
In his letter dated January 7, which was published in
Thursday's Simerini daily, Clerides informed the U.N. chief of his
decision not to deploy the Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus contracted for the missiles in 1997 in a bid to boost
its defense, a move rejected by Turkey, which threatened to launch
preemptive strikes if the missiles were deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides decided late last December to cancel the deployment
of the missiles in Cyprus after consultations with Greece and is
negotiating with Russia to install them on the Greek island of
Crete.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Turkish Cypriot side will also comply with a
United Nations resolution on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council approved Resolution 1218 on December
22, 1998, requesting Annan to work intensively with the two sides
for reducing troops and armaments on the island.
</P>
<P>
Clerides called in the letter for the implementation of a
U.N. package measures aimed at reducing tensions along the
cease-fire line established in 1974 after Turkish troops landed on
the northern part of the island following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
He said he is willing to negotiate with the Turkish Cypriot
side for a settlement in Cyprus based on U.N. resolutions and two
high level agreements reached in 1977 and 1979 stipulating for a
bizonal, bicommunal federation.

<HEADLINE> Summers Postpones Asia Trip for Brazil's Financial Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's financial turmoil
has forced U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers to
postpone a scheduled trip to Japan, China and other Asian
countries, a Treasury spokeswoman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As Brazil's devaluation of its real currency Wednesday shook
world financial markets, Summers, who has to concentrate on the
fallout of the unexpected devaluation, also canceled a scheduled
New York address Wednesday, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has a vital interest in saving Brazil from economic
collapse. The U.S. Treasury last November pulled the strings in a
41.5 billion dollar rescue deal for Brazil, officially led by the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Summers had been expected to urge Japan to stimulate its
economy to help the rest of Asia struggle out of crisis and to
encourage China to maintain a policy of keeping its yuan currency
stable.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had not yet finalized details of which other Asian
countries Summers might visit besides Japan and China. Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea each also received IMF-led bailout
packages in 1997 to try to help them regain economic stability.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Newell, Rubbermaid Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
here Thursday that it had cleared the merger of U.S. consumer
goods manufacturers Newell Co. and Rubbermaid Incorporated.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which is responsible for proposing and
implementing European Union (EU) laws and regulations, said the
operation will not give the new entity a significant market
position regarding any one product line.
</P>
<P>
"Neither will their merger yield anti-competitive portfolio
power, i.e. the ability to abuse negotiating power stemming from
offer of large portfolio of products to engage in tying or other
anti-competitive sales strategies," the commission said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Newell is a manufacturer of high-volume consumer products,
ranging from hardware and home furnishings to office storage and
organization products and houseware, which it markets through
various retailers, wholesalers, discount stores, home centers,
hardware stores, office superstores and department and speciality
stores.
</P>
<P>
Rubbermaid is a multinational manufacturer and marketer of
primarily plastic products, in particular of home products,
juvenile products and infant products. And it sells its products
through mass-retailers and wholesalers, including discount stores
and warehouse clubs, toy stores, home centers and hardware stores,
supermarkets and catalogue showrooms.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the merger dose not risk creating or
enhancing a dominant position.
