<HEADLINE> Britain not to Accept U.S. Libya-Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The British government said here
today that it could not accept any U.S. moves to penalize its
companies with business links with Iran and Libya and would
urgently contact its European Union (EU) partners for further
actions.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.S. legislation, the American government would
penalize those non-U.S. companies which invest in oil and gas
projects in Iran and Libya and U.S. President Bill Clinton is
expected to decide later today whether to sign the bill into law.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at press briefing earlier today, a British Foreign
Office spokesman said, the British government has "vigorously
lobbied against this legislation both bilaterally and with our EU
partners.
</P>
<P>
"We agree that there should be a common Western policy on Iran
and Libya, but we cannot accept U.S. pressure on its allies to
impose sanctions under the threat of mandatory penalties on our
companies carrying out trade with these countries in the oil and
gas sectors," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he pointed out that "the way forward must be through
bilateral and multilateral consultations."
</P>
<P>
Commenting the possible retaliatory measures if the legislation
is passed into law, the spokesman said: " we shall now be urgently
consulting with our EU partners."

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Army in Anti-Aids Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA)
today began a three-day campaign to sensitise senior health
personnel in the southern region on global HIV/AIDS trends.
</P>
<P>
Medical Services Director Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Musoko
said the workshop was part of efforts by the army to fight the
spread of the incurable disease.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe had an estimated 10 percent HIV infection
rate with 300 AIDS-related deaths a week, one of the highest in
sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's population is now estimated at 10.5 million.
</P>
<P>
''Aids has disrupted family and societal units, suicides have
increased, budgetary allocations for the health sector no longer
suffice. The pandemic has seriously affected humanity and we are
all in it and we need to work together,'' said Musoko.
</P>
<P>
He added that a survey carried out recently within the army
showed there was widespread awareness of the impact and
implications of the disease among service members and their
families.
</P>
<P>
''But despite this knowledge, there is no positive change in
behaviors both within the army or other sectors of the zimbabwean
society,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The ZNA had also trained peer educators, who were apparently
not receiving enough support from senior personnel, hence the
workshop was aimed at impressing upon the high ranks the
seriousness of the disease and the need to cooperate with lower
ranks. enditem

<HEADLINE> Cheap Computers Dumped in Africa, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A Commonwealth computer expert
has advised organisations in Africa to consult industry
specialists before ordering new computer equipment to avoid
buying sub-standard commodities from developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Rogers Wo Okot-Uma, a specialist at the Commonwealth
Secretariat in London, said today in Bulawayo, the country's
second largest city, many organisations in Africa were lured into
buying cheap or fake models because of insufficiednt knowledge.
</P>
<P>
''They must consult information systems professionals able to
analyse whether the system is right rather than just be coerced
into buying because of sweet language by the sales people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Okot-Uma was in Bulawayo to attend a five-day
Commonwealth-sponsored course for information analysts drawn from
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He said sometimes cheap computer equipment was dumped in
Africa because organisations did not have expertise to
distinguish between real and fake models.  enditem

<HEADLINE> French Oil Company Reacts with Caution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The French oil group Total, which
has invested three billion francs (600 million U.S. dollars) in an
offshore oil field in Iran, has reacted with caution to the
signing by U.S. President Bill Clinton of the d'Amato Act today.
</P>
<P>
The act authorizes economic and financial sanctions against all
foreign oil companies which invest more than 40 million U.S.
dollars in oil and gas projects of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Total said that the act will not jeopardize its
investments and contracts with Iran, because it is not retroactive
and therefore is not entitled to striking contracts signed before
it was enacted.
</P>
<P>
Total and the National Iranian Oil Company signed a contract in
July 1995 after the departure of U.S. oil group of Conoco and the
Dutch oil group of Shell from the Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Total also have two existing contracts with Libya signed in
1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said recently that if
U.S. sanctions brings any damage to French companies, they will
not stay without reprisals by France.
</P>
<P>
Another French oil group Elf-Aquitaine is negotiating with Iran
on the development of another offshore oil field in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Elf has been exploring oil in Libya for 20 years and it
discovered a small oil field near the Libyan-Tunisian border in
the 1980s, which remains undeveloped due to disagreement with
Libyan government over the conditions for its development.
</P>
<P>
The German oil company Wintershall is cooperating with Elf in
negotiating with Tripoli.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Crocodiles Crawl into Export Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's crocodile industry
last year netted export earnings of four million US Dollars and
said Chris Foot, Executive Manager of the Crocodile Farmers
Association of Zimbabwe (CFA) here today.
</P>
<P>
Foot said, ''meat exports have undergone huge increases in the
last few years as local abattoirs have been built to cater for
export demand, and the skin numbers exported are increasing
gradually, at about five percent per annum.''
</P>
<P>
Although local sales, mostly through tourist outlets, were
very small, Foot said, Zimbabwse last year exported 40,000 skins
and 64 tonnes of meat worth four million US dollars to the
European market and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Most crocodiles are reared in the Zambezi Valley, foot said.
</P>
<P>
The association's mission, he said, was to promote crocodile
farming in Zimbabwe to high standards of quality and volume of
production.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, the association intended to support
management programs that would maximise production while
sustaining the level of the wild population of crocodiles in
Zimbabwe, promote quality products, participate in research
projects aimed at promoting growth and quality and reducing
disease and mortality in crocodile populations in Zimbabwe, he
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister: No Date for Hebron Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordehai said today that, to his best knowledge, no date
has been set for the redeployment of the Israeli army in the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the Bakum military base in central
Israel, Mordehai said when the government consolidates its plan
for the redeployment, it will present it to the Palestinians, and
the process will then be moved forward.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister's remarks came after recent reports
suggested that the government had already decided to go ahead
with the redeployment at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Mordehai noted that he had already visited Hebron three times
since taking office in July, and that he intended to do so again
before the defense establishment makes its decision on the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, the Israeli army was
supposed to pullback from about 85 percent of Hebron by
March 28, however, following a series of suicide bombing
attacks, former Prime Minister Shimon Peres delayed the
redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In May, the former Israeli government announced that the
army's withdrawal from Hebron would be carried out after the
May 29 general elections, due to security reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres, defeated by new Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said after the elections that he would leave the
decision of the redeployment to the new prime minister and his
government.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, some 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem, is a
place of pilgrimage for Christians, Jews and Moslems alike.
</P>
<P>
There are some 400 Jewish settlers now living in the
center of Hebron, who moved back to the city's old Jewish
neighborhood after the 1967 War, during which Israel took over
the town from the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, surrounding the Jewish community, there are more
than 200,000 Palestinian residents living in most other parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
So far, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that he has been studying
the issue of the redeployment in Hebron, but giving no date when
he would make the final decision.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Orders Inquiry Into Alleged Phone Tapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve
Gowda today ordered a Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) inquiry
into allegations that intelligence agencies had tapped the phones
of senior Congress party leaders including party President P.V.
Narasimha Rao, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said the prime minister has written a letter
to CBI Director Joginder Singh directing the agency to find out
the truth to clear any possible doubt on the issue.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Gowda said though he had never issued any
instructions regarding telephone tapping at any point of time
against any political leader in the country, yet he was taking
this step to ask the CBI to find out the truth.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the prime minister has asked the CBI chief to
submit reports on the issue within a month.
</P>
<P>
Reports which appeared in local publications said that the
personal telephones of Congress party President Rao and other
party leaders considered close to him were being tapped by the
intelligence agencies on the orders of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with senior Congress party leaders on Sunday,
Gowda stoutly denied the reports, saying that there was no element
of truth in the reports.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that any mishandling of the sensitive
issue could snowball into a major confrontation between the ruling
United Front and the Congress party which is supporting the
coalition government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the major opposition
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today also claimed that phones of
three of its leaders were tapped and demanded an "end to this
nefarious practice of telephone tapping."
</P>
<P>
Condemning the tapping, BJP spokesman Yashwant Sinha said "we
cannot let an unrestrained and highly prejudiced" practice to
continue.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Councillor Defies Order to Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Councillor Hattem
Abdel Khader today defied Israeli police's ultimatum to close his
office in east Jerusalem by this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
issued another ban forbidding any Palestinian official activity
in Jerusalem after holding consultation with legal advisers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are expected to block Palestinians from
entering Khader's office, which is in his private home in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Kahalani handed over an order by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to Khader, asking him to close the office
within 24 hours, or by 1 p.m. this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, Khader defied the order by receiving guests and
journalists even after the deadline expired. This morning, he
met with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny in his
home, and held a telephone conversation with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Khader said both Bassiouny and Moussa expressed support to him
to continue operating the office in his home, which just opened
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has accused Khader of breaking Israeli Law and
violating a ban on Palestinian official activity in the
self-claimed Jewish capital under Israeli-Palestinian peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
But Khader insisted that he acted within the law, saying that
he is not a member of the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA). He said the office provides him an opportunity to serve the
Palestinian voters who supported him.
</P>
<P>
"Any order to close my office is illegal, because this is my
house. There hasn't any security reason to close my house. I think
it is a diplomatic reason, not a security reason," khader told
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police are apparently facing a dilemma over how to
close Khader's office as it is located in his private
home. Kahalani tried to avoid the embarrassing scenario of
preventing Khader from entering his own home.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Khader's office is the latest of the disputes
over the status of Jerusalem between Israel and the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared Jerusalem as the only eternal and
indivisible capital of the Jewish state, denying any compromise
on its self-claimed sovereignty over the holy city.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNA has insisted that east Jerusalem should be the
capital of the future independent Palestinian state and urged
Israel to resolve the issue through the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel, under the previous Labor-led government, started the
final-status talks with the PNA in early May, but the talks soon
hit a snag mainly due to the May 29 Israeli elections.

PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- France said today that if the
d'Amato Act signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton brings damages
to French companies, they will not stay without "retort".
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry vice-spokesman Yves Doutriaux said that
France again makes it clear in advance that no French interests
should be affected by such a U.S. law aimed at punishing foreign
companies investing more than 40 million U.S. dollars in oil
projects of Iran and libya.
</P>
<P>
"We are working actively with our partners in the European
Union in order to prepare for appropriate responses to the actual
application of this law," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We have on several occasions had the chance to indicate that
the contents of the law contradict the principles of the World
Trade Organization and rules of the OECD (Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that reason will prevail, and that the American
authorities would abstain from creating, through unilateral
measures with multilateral reach, a particularly dangerous
precedent for the security and development of world trade," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Europe has large investments in oil businesses of Iran and
Libya with 20 percent of its oil consumption coming from the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Receiving "Lebanon First" Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz denied here this afternoon that his country has received
the so-called "Lebanon First" proposal on an unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"Until this moment we have not received a clear and definite
project related to the 'Lebanon First,'" the foreign minister told
a press conference in his office.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the issue was "still an ambiguous theme and a
kind of general suggestion to which we can not respond before
knowing what is put forward."
</P>
<P>
The proposal, currently predominating the public media in
Beirut and Tel Aviv, provides for a pullout of the Israeli troops
from southern Lebanon in exchange for a disarmament of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerillas and a mechanism of guaranteeing
security on the border.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz attributed the circulation of the suggestion to a
desire to break the current deadlock of the Arab-Israeli peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the suggestion would be overruled if it was
aimed at pulling Lebanon into negotiations on a separate peace
agreement with Israel or into a peace process different from what
its Arab brothers especially Syria was committed.
</P>
<P>
"If it is aimed at an implementation of Resolution 425,
we welcome it since the resolution does not entail political
negotiations and does not impose an peace accord on Lebanon,"
the Lebanese minister said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425 calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He specified Lebanon's two purposes in the peace process,
first of which is to restore the part of its lands from under the
Israeli occupation through Resolution 425, and the second deals
with other regional issues in accordance with Resolution 242.
</P>
<P>
"It will be refused by Lebanon to go beyond these two
mechanisms or purposes, since it only means an attempt to
separate the Arab teams and to isolate Lebanon or Syria, and
this is unacceptable for Lebanon," the foreign minister
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> USAir Moves to Cut Links with British Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- USAir, the American carrier, is
seeking for court approval to sever its three-year-old link with
British Airways (BA) as BA and American Airlines are planning to
merge their international operations.
</P>
<P>
The move comes as part of the recent anti-trust lawsuit filed
by the USAir over BA's merging plan with American Airlines and the
USAir has claimed that the merging plans breached its agreement
with BA and broke competition law, according to a report carried
in today's Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
USAir has asked the US court to order BA to divest its 24.6
percent share in USAir and withdrew it two nominee directors from
the US airline's board, the report said.
</P>
<P>
BA, which considered all its actions are consistent with its
obligations with USAir, is expected to step up pressure later
this week on the US carrier to drop its legal action or face a
countersuit from BA.
</P>
<P>
A BA spokesman is quoted as saying "nothing is ruled in and
nothing is ruled out. But British Airways has no intention of
divesting its stake in USAir or of asking its two directors to
resign from the USAir board."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the USAir's decision to cut links with BA,
directors of the British carrier are said to feel particularly let
down because BA has stood by USAir through some difficult times
over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
BA lent USAir four million dollars to shore up its balance
sheet and supported it in its marketing battle with Continental
Lite, a subsidiary of Continental Airlines of the US, they added.

The youngsters' growth co-incides with the 10 years of economic
renovation and reform carried out in the country and, says the
report, is heartening news for a nation long consigned to the
bottom of the height league among southeast Asian countries due to
continual war and associated poverty.
</P>
<P>
This 10-year period is the first time growth in average height
among Vietnamese children has been recorded since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Nutrition, which carried out the
report, said the findings are encouraging for the Ministry of
Education and Training which has set a national adult average
height target of 165 cm for men and 160 cm for women, an increase
over the current averages of 160 cm for men and 152 cm for women.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the spurt in children's height include an
improved diet, at least in many urban areas, and most
significantly an eradication of xerophthalmia, a condition caused
by vitamin A deficiency and which can stunt growth.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time in history, Vietnam has become
xerophthalmia free," said a doctor from the National Institute of
Nutrition. "The desire to be tall, strong and healthy is not only
an official concern, but also the people's wish," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined that Vietnamese should be taller
after years of war and associated poverty, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Death Demanded for Former South Korean President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A South Korean prosecutor today
demanded the death penalty and a 278 million U.S. dollar fine for
former President Chun Doo-hwan charged with mutiny, treason and
bribery.
</P>
<P>
In the 27th trial session held at the Seoul District Court for
Chun, another former president, Roh Tae-woo, and their followers
for their roles in the military revolt on December 12, 1979 and
the brutal suppression of the uprising on May 18, 1980, senior
public prosecutor Kim Sang-hee also demanded that Roh be sentenced
to life in prison and fined 355 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Life in prison was also asked for former First Army Corps
commander, Hwang Young-si, and former Special Warfare Forces
commander, Chung Ho-yong. Fifteen year prison terms were sought
for eight other defendants including former defense minister, Choo
Young-bock.
</P>
<P>
It was demanded that a former commander of the 30th Security
Group, Chang Se-dong, receive 12 years in prison, while a 10-year
prison term was sought for three other former officers including a
commander of the Army's 20th Division, Park Jun-byung.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the court, the prosecution asked the bench to hand
down severe punishment to the defendants as provided by law.
</P>
<P>
The 16 former South Korean officers including Chun and Roh have
been indicted for mutiny or treason, or both. The mutiny and
treason charges stem from their roles in the 1979 military revolt
and the 1980 suppression of the uprising in Kwangju, capital of
South Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh who stepped down in
February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two former presidents, who were arrested last year, have
also been indicted for graft. They allegedly received huge illegal
funds from businessmen while in office.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Backs German Initiative on Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today voiced its
support for a German initiative on banning production and using of
anti-personnel mines and eliminating all planted mines scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah declared that "Kuwait fully backs
the German initiative" and described it as "positive and effective
and can take part in eliminating the dangerous problem of mines,"
according to the official Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was put forward by German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel on July 18, who called for a diplomatic campaign to
restrict producing, exporting and planting anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah stressed on the necessity of an international support
for the German initiative.
</P>
<P>
According to international statistics, mines kill and deform
over 20,000 people in some 65 countries annually, including
Kuwait. At present, a total of 60 countries have joined the
U.N. May 3 Protocol over banning the production and exporting of
mines.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah attacked Iraqi troops which left "hundred of thousands
of different types of mines" when they withdrew from Kuwait on
February 26, 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti people were still suffering from the
human, psychological and environmental impact of the mines which
were planted by the Iraqi forces during the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti government, neighboring and friendly countries
have been working to eliminate them," he said.

imperative necessity to end the illegality and restore
constitutional order in that country.
</P>
<P>
This was contained in a statement issued today by the
Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation after the talks between Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki who is on a
one-day visit here.
</P>

junta in Burundi to unban all political parties in Burundi and to
undertake immediate and unconditional negotiations with all the
parties to the conflict.

<P>
The two leaders called upon the regime in Bujumbura to abide
by the Arusha summit conclusions and to facilitate their
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa briefed the South African Deputy President on the
current situation in Burundi and the decision taken at the Arusha

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Bill Punishing firms investing in Iran, Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Monday signed a bill into a new law that will punish those
foreign companies and individuals who do business with Iran and
Libya.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been alleging that Iran and Libya are two
of "the most dangerous supporters of terrorism", and Clinton said
the Iran and Libya sanctions bill he signed will "help to deny
those countries the money they need to finance international
terrorism".
</P>
<P>
Iran has denounced the "terrorism" charges imposed by the
United States, dismissing them as "defamatory and irresponsible"
</P>
<P>
"Iran's strength lies not in training both hegemony and
hegemonization," said Iran's U.N. mission in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions bill was met with vehement objections from The
U.S. allies when passing in the Congress. They have said that
the bill was "unacceptable" and would reserve the right to
retaliate against U.S. companies if their firms were punished by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday that the
United States had not yet provided any evidence to support its
claim that Iran is involved in anti-American terrorist attacks,
and he said the European Union would retaliate if the U.S.
administration implemented the sanctions law.
</P>
<P>
Clinton responded when signing the bill: "Of course that's
their decision to make. "the United States has to act," he said.
</P>
<P>
"You can't do business with people by day who are killing your
people by night,"he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has showed its staunchness to stand the pressure imposed
by the fresh U.S. sanctions and expressed its confidence to
weather the U.S move.
</P>
<P>
"Islamic Iran will not surrender to bullying, and will stand
up to the United States with all its might," said Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
The new law requires the president to impose two from six
sanctions on foreign companies that export petroleum-related
goods and technology to Iran or Libya or invest more than $40
million a year in their energy sections.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Children's Fund Reaches 20-Million-Rand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela today announced that more than 20 million Rand (about 4.65
million U.S.Dollars) had been donated to the Nelson Mandela Children's
Fund in the first year of its existence.
</P>
<P>
Accepting the first annual report of the fund at his official
Pretoria residence, Mandela expressed his surprise at the backing the
initiative enjoyed from the people.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected that we would receive such overwhelming support
from all communities, including those we regard as the most
insensitive in the application of a policy which had been condemned
by the world as a crime against humanity," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela Children's Fund, founded and chaired by Mandela,
was set up last year to help disadvantaged young people in South
Africa. Mandela at the time committed 150000 Rand (about 34880 U.S.
Dollars) a year (one-third of his annual salary) for five years to
establish and perpetuate the fund.
</P>
<P>
Mandela stressed that the support it enjoyed from all sectors of
the community demonstrated that one should not be dogmatic about
people.
</P>
<P>
A large share of donations to the fund come from members of the
Fund President's Club. Membership is for individuals, corporates,
foundations and governments who match or better mandela's annual
contribution.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela's office today dismissed speculation that Foreign
Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, Presidential spokesman
Parks Mankahlana said: "The office of the president wants to
refute as unfounded and irresponsible suggestions that there may
have been a decision by the president to replace the minister of
foreign affairs at any point."
</P>
<P>
"The president has absolute confidence and faith in the
ability of the minister to carry out the responsibilities he has
assigned to him," said the statement.

<P>
Nzo, 71, was currently with Deputy President Thabo Mbeki on an
African tour for talks on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the South African Broadcasting
Corporation's radio quoted senior government sources as saying
that the president had been looking for a replacement for Nzo.

The sources said the foreign affairs portfolio was offered to
Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal.

WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Investigators believe children
started a fire that heavily damaged the temporary home of a small
black Baptist church in Yazoo City, Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think this was racial. They are thinking school-age

<HEADLINE> Anti-Asian Violence Up Slightly, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A private research survey
released Monday reports physical and verbal assaults against
Americans of Asian and Pacific heritage increased slightly in
1995.
</P>
<P>
But the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium said
as many states don't track such data, and many crimes go
unreported, the situation was probably worse.
</P>
<P>
The consortium documented at least 458 incidents last year,
compared with 452 in 1994. It recorded at least 335 incidents in
1993, when it began compiling statistics.
</P>
<P>
"That there was even a slight increase when the FBI is
reporting that all other serious crimes are falling is an
important indication that there is a problem," said the
consortium's executive director, Karen Narasaki.
</P>
<P>
The FBI reported in May that violent crime dropped overall by 4
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The consortium report said race was the motive in about 90
percent of the 1995 cases, with the remainder categorized as
suspected prejudice cases.
</P>
<P>
Assaults increased by almost 11 percent. Aggravated assaults
climbed by 14 percent, including two murders and one firebombing,
the 48-page report said.
</P>
<P>
The report found a dramatic increase in southern California,
where cases jumped by more than 80 percent -- from 63 in 1994 to
113 incidents in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Increases also were found in New York and northern California.
</P>
<P>
Eleven states don't collect hate-crime statistics, and 1995
reports for 13 states won't be ready until later this year, the
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based consortium promotes legal and civil rights
issues on behalf of Asian-Americans. Its information came from law
enforcement and state crime reports, the media and community and
professional organizations.

<HEADLINE> French Divers Start New Divings on Titanic's Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- French divers today began a new
series of divings on the wreck of the giant liner "Titanic" off
the coast of Canada, the French Institute for Exploitation of Sea
(IFREMER) announced.
</P>
<P>
The diving team, dubbed Nautilus, and its support ship "Nadir"
was hired for the third time by the American company RMS Titanic,
which is collecting the wreck of the ship which sank on its maiden
voyage from Britain to North America on April 16, 1912.
</P>
<P>
The ship bumped into an iceberg 95 miles south of the Great
Bank of New Land, Canada, and of its 2,224 passengers and crew,
1,513 died and the rest were saved by ships nearby.
</P>
<P>
IFREMER said that the Nautilus will use a deposit penetrator to
have a comprehensive view of the wreck 3,800 meters under water,
and will use a lateral sonar to make a complete cartography of it.
</P>
<P>
The Nautilus will also try to obtain a piece of the bottom of
Titanic for exhibition by RMS Titanic.
</P>
<P>
The first diving missin on Titanic began in 1984 with a joint
Franco-American operation launched by the Nautilus and its
American companion team the Alvin. Two other diving missions were
made in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Two video production companies -- the Ellipse program of
France and Discovery Channel of the United States -- have sent
crews to the site on the vessel "Aquaplus" and with two small
sub-marines which can go as deep as a few hundred meters.
</P>
<P>
The two companies will also take advantage of Nautilus's
videographical equipments and a robot owned by IFREMER, Robin.
</P>
<P>
The divings are expected to take about two months.

<HEADLINE> Dole Proposes Sweeping Tax-cuts to Spur Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) - U.S. Republican presidential
challenger Bob Dole today unveiled his across-the-board income
tax cut proposals in an effort to re-energize his campaign.
</P>
<P>
Heading into next week's Republican National Convention and
trailing President Bill Clinton in the recent polls, Dole hopes
that the dramatic package of tax cut and other proposals will spur
his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited economic program calls for a 15 percent cut
in income tax rates and a halving of capital gains taxes,
according to a Republican campaign document.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include a $500-per-child tax credit, repeal
of Clinton's 1993 tax increase on Social Security pension
benefits, and a balanced federal budget by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We are the party of change," Dole told reporters. "We're going
to downsize the IRS (U.S. Internal Revenue Service) and the
amount of money Americans can keep in their pockets...In short, my
administration will free the American people from tax tyranny."
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton wasted little time in attacking the proposals.
He told reporters that Dole's bold tax cut package would "balloon
the deficit, raise interest rates and weaken the economy."
</P>
<P>
"I am unalterably opposed to going back to the mistake we
made before and having big tax cuts that are not paid for,"
Clinton said when asked about the Dole plan.
</P>
<P>
But Dole, who will officially become his party's nominee next
week at the Republican National Convention, claims he can both
balance the budget and cut taxes by $548 billion in six years.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Boss on Investigation into Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth Secretary
General Chief Emeka Anyaoku said today Commonwealth was still
working with the Tanzanian and Zanzibar governments concerning
the reports of Zanzibar Elections last October.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference at Zanzibar Airport before
leaving there for Dar es Salaam, Anyaoku said that they had not
made their stand on the reports submitted to them by the
Communwealth observers assigned to Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He strongly denied claims that they had taken too long to
react on the Zanzibar election report.
</P>
<P>
He said during his three-day stay in Unguja and Pemba islands,
he held discussions with top Zanzibar government leaders and the
leader of the opposition Civil United Front (CUF) to get
first-hand information on Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku refused to comment on Zanzibar's political
crisis, saying "I valued the views from both parties but I cannot
comment on now," he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it was not a "normal thing" for CUF
legislators to boycott the sessions of the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"I have learnt that CUF members are not participating the
sessions of the House but this is not a normal thing," said Chief
Anyaoku.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that there was any plan to consider admitting
Zanzibar to the Commonwealth saying constitutionally Zanzibar was
part of Tanzania and it did not stand alone as a country.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku said the Commonwealth was not ready to interfere
in constitutional arrangements of Tanzania. Therefore Zanzibar
would remain a member of the Commonwealth through Tanzania as a
whole, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he advised Zanzibar to continue puting impetus on
tourism policy saying the Isles stood great chances to benefit
from the tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
Chief Anyaoku arrived here last Thursday for a six-day tour of
Tanzania. enditem

people, 23 others were acquitted for their alleged role in the
1972 assassination of the then Zanzibar President, Sheikh Abeid

<HEADLINE> Protesting African Refugees Vacate Public Park on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 5 (Xinhua) -- About 80 African refugees
occupying a public park in central Pretoria on Monday afternoon
left the park after having given an ultimatum to vacate the area
by 6 pm.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, including 30 children, were part of about 300
African refugees staging a protest outside the Pretoria Office of
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees last Monday,
demanding that their deportation from South Africa be forestalled
until they could be resettled in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The refugees then marched on the union buildings to present a
memorandum listing their grievances to a government official
there.
</P>
<P>
After being ordered to leave the union buildings, where they
had been camping since tuesday, the refugees occupied a church in
city centre, where they spent the Aaturday night.
</P>
<P>
They moved to the park on Sunday after the priest of the
church laid charges of trespassing against the group.
</P>
<P>
Charges of trespassing were also laid against them by the
department of public work, which is responsible for public
buildings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police said they had received several
complaints from residents in the vicinity of the park.
</P>
<P>
"When it rains they seek cover in blocks of flats and the
residents feel threatened," said local police commissioner Dir
Marietjie louw.
</P>
<P>
While referring to 82 suspected alliens arrested at the union
buildings on Tuesday, Department of Home Affairs spokesman Hennie
Meyer said on Monday that 25 were indeed illegal aliens and would
be repatriated to their countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
Six had been released from custody and the rest decided to
apply for refugee status, said meyer.
</P>
<P>
However, the rest of the protesting refugees, about 200, had
gone back to Johannesburg, where most of them came from, said the
police, adding they were still monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
Among those protesters were refugees from Angola, Ethiopia,
Zaire, Burundi, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon and Liberia. enditem

<HEADLINE> US Farms Grow Bigger, Number Less: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The size of the American farm
is increasing, but the numbers of farms is decreasing, according
to a new report made public by the U.S. Census Bureau here today.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that farms with sales of 100,000
dollars or more increased sixfold over the past 24 years, from
51,995 in 1969 to 333,865 in 1992.
</P>
<P>
But, the total number of farms dropped from 2.7 million to 1.9
million during the past two decades of competition. Only tobacco
farms and other labor-intensive crops can survive small, the
report indicated. According to data, about 48 percent of tobacco
farms took sales of less than 100,000 dollars, followed by grain
growers with 25 percent small farms.
</P>
<P>
While large farms made up under 18 percent of all farms in
1992, they farmed 54 percent of the land involved in agriculture
and produced 83 percent of farm products, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Large farms had the biggest edge in commercial poultry
production, accounting for 98 percent of the product. Big
operators also produced 93 percent of vegetables and melons, 92
percent of cotton and 91 percent of nursery and greenhouse
products.
</P>
<P>
Farms with sales of 100,000 dollars or more averaged 1,542
acres, the report said, compared to only 271 acres for farms with
sales below that level.

<P>
LONDON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Royal Mail's monopoly
over letters sent for under one pound (1.54 US dollars) will be
suspended at midnight for a month after the Communication Workers
Union (CWU) called five new strikes, the British government
announced today.
</P>
<P>
Ian Lang, the trade and industry secretary, said in a statement
that it was "wholly unacceptable" for a group of extremists within
the CWU to hold the country to economic ransom.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the strikes continued, the suspension of the
letter monopoly, which had been enjoyed by the Royal Mail since it
issued the world's first postage stamp in 1840, would be extended
for a further three months.
</P>
<P>
The government's announcement followed the decision by CWU
leaders to continue with their 24-hour national strike, which was
first held on June 21, in their long-run dispute over conditions
and pay.
</P>
<P>
The five more national strikes are set for Tuesday, August 14,
22, 30 and September 2.
</P>
<P>
"Today's announcement by the union that it intends to resume
strike action leaves me with no alternative but to seek as far as
possible to protect the interests of the business and domestic
customers throughout the country," Lang said.
</P>
<P>
CWU General Secretary Alan Johnson said he was prepared to
reopen talks at any time.

<HEADLINE> China's Nonferrous Metals Industry Begins To Show Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China's nonferrous metals
industry suffered greatly this year from price rises in raw
materials and electricity and a drop in nonferrous metals,
especially copper and aluminum, but began to show a profit in May
after the January-April loss.
</P>
<P>
During the first half, the country refined nearly 850,000 tons
of copper, lead, zinc, tin, nickel, and molybdenum, an increase of
11 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The national output of copper, lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum,
magnesium, titanium, antimony, tin, and mercury during the
six-month period was reported to surpass two million tons, an
increase of 4.13 percent over 1995, 9.5 percentage points lower
than the growth rate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.2 million tons of the ten nonferrous metals produced
were from enterprises directly under the China National Nonferrous
Metals Industry Corp.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a price rise in raw materials, fuel, and electricity,
the corporation lost 905 million yuan in profits during the
six-month period.
</P>
<P>
During the second half of the year, the corporation will exert
a greater effort to reduce losses, and is expected to have one
billion yuan in profits this year.

<HEADLINE> More Ecologically-Sound Painting Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have called for
the use of more "green" paint to stop pollution caused by house
painting.
</P>
<P>
As China develops economically and the living standards of its
people improves, pollution caused by house painting has become a
major concern, according to a recent symposium.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the symposium here Saturday said that more
luxurious decorations have increased the amount of pollution of
rooms.
</P>
<P>
"People are calling not only for curbing industrial pollution,
but also for an improvement in their living environment," they
said.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demands for "green" paint, China needs to develop
its clean paint industry and technology faster and produce more
"green" products, they said.
</P>
<P>
One of the major painting companies in North China's Shanxi
Province has produced at least 40 different kinds of better
quality clean paint that meets the country's standards for
non-polluting products, according to the symposium, which was
attended by the vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, Wang Guangying, and other leading
officials.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Minimum Cost-Of-Living System Helping Urban Poor (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The minimum monthly amount in Shanghai for an urban resident
has climbed from 120 to 185 yuan (22 US dollars), and those whose
income falls below that are eligible for government relief funds
and food. Each person can receive 20 yuan worth of grain, sugar,
and edible oil and 40 yuan in subsidies every month.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Shanghai gave 15 million yuan in relief funds to
80,000 residents with no regular incomes and another 23 million
yuan as economic aid to 80,000 retirees with financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Government funds to be used for this purpose will rise to 200
million yuan this year, said Shi Derong, director of the municipal
bureau of civil affairs.
</P>
<P>
The municipal bureaus of labor and social security have
distributed regular allowances to laid-off workers, pensioners,
and low-income families.
</P>
<P>
Local trade unions, women's federations and other organizations
have set up 'Aid-the-Poor' foundations, and charitable
organizations provided 770 poor students with 840,000 yuan in
stipends over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
All this is aimed to assist poor urbanites in making a basic
living and narrowing the disparity between the rich and poor, said
an official with the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that more than 12 million people in
3.7 million urban families across China live in relatively poor
conditions while the country's most affluent one percent of
families earned more than 100,000 yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> EU Opposes U.S. Oil Sanctions Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- A newly-signed United States
bill providing for sanctions against new investments in the oil
industries of Iran and Libya is not going " in the right
direction", an official of the European Union (EU) said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, vice-president of the European Commission (EC),
made the statement in Brussels on Monday, following the signing by
U.S. President Bill Clinton of the d'Amato Bill.
</P>
<P>
Brittan explained that the bill would establish the principle
that one country could dictate the foreign policy of others and
would disturb the indispensable unity of purpose between allies to
successfully stamp out terrorism.
</P>
<P>
According to Brittan, the EU has said it "will act to defend
its rights and interests if they are jeopardised by the
legislation."
</P>
<P>
However, the EC vice-president added that the EU fully
supported the determination of the U.S. to combat terrorism in its
different forms.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato law is aimed at revenging recent incidents which,
Brittan said, "have undermined the sense of security of innocent
people within America and outside."
</P>
<P>
But it will "create big and serious problems for the European
oil industry" when implemented, said EU Energy Commissioner
Christos Papoutsis Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the dependency of the EU on imported oil has amounted
to 80 percent, of which Iran and Libya provided 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Papoutsis said a disruption in the oil supply from these two
countries to the world oil markets would have an impact on both
volumes and prices.

<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has agreed to return
the remains of two citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), and is demanding that Pyongyang return its novelist,
Kim Ha-ki, as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The return, under telephone agreement reached today by red
cross officials of the two sides, will take place tomorrow at the
truce village of Panmunjom, according to the (South) Korean
National Red Cross (KNRC).
</P>
<P>
The KNRC said that Seoul would like to return the two bodies,
which were found drifting in the Yellow Sea by South Korea during
heavy rains late last month,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it asked Pyongyang to quickly return Kim Ha-ki, who
is now being detained and investigated by the DPRK for allegedly
violating the country's northern frontier.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement resulted from sustained contacts between
South Korea and DPRK red cross officials going back to March, and
involving repatriation of seamen and a freight vessel to the

<HEADLINE> Italian Federation Chief to Step down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Antonio Matarrese said on Tuesday he
would resign as head of the Italian soccer federation for losing
support of leading club chairmen.
</P>
<P>
After Italians met their Waterloo in the European championship
in June, league bosses hit out at Matarrese, who is also
vice-president of both FIFA and UEFA.
</P>
<P>
Matarrese told a federation meeting that he would prefer to
stand aside rather than face a re-election battle for the job
which he has held for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Serie A and B clubs last month nominated Luciano Nizzola,
president of the Lega Calcio (Football League), to stand against
Matarrese. Serie C president Giancarlo Abete announced he was
also running as a candidate with the unanimous backing of his
minor league clubs.
</P>
<P>
The league chiefs want national coach Arrigo Sacchi, confirmed
in his job by Matarrese until his contract expires in 1998,
replaced.
</P>
<P>
Italy, one of the pre-tournament favourites, failed to advance
beyond the first round after suffering a shock defeat at the hands
of the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
It was not certain if Matarrese's replacement would be chosen
on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Minimum Cost-Of-Living System Helping Urban Poor  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- None of Fan Zhiming's family
members could afford to buy even a single piece of clothing during
the past two years, although they live right in the downtown area
of China's "City of Fashion", Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I have had to support five people, including my
80-year-old mother, a daughter attending secondary school, and a
niece who has no source of income, with a monthly living allowance
of 200 yuan since my wife and I lost our jobs a couple of years ago,"
Fan explained.
</P>
<P>
"When we were extremely poor, neighbourhood committee officials
came to our house with grain coupons and government subsidies," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in tears, Fan said, "It was like sending charcoal in
snowy weather. We can never say enough about the gratitude we feel
for the government."
</P>
<P>
Not long after he made those remarks, Fan was employed as a
security guard in a fruit company and his wife got a job at a shop
through neighbourhood committee help, increasing their monthly
income five-fold.
</P>
<P>
Fan was one of the 450,000 beneficiaries of a minimum
cost-of-living system implemented in Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center.
</P>
<P>
The majority of these poor people were working in factories
that went bankrupt, were closed, or were partly closed, or who
were laid off, disabled, or pensioners, and who now make up a new
class of urban poor.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai was the first city in China to establish a bottom line
for living expenses for its 450,000 low-income beneficiaries,
which account for 3.5 percent of the total population in urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
Twelve other large cities, including Guangzhou, Fuzhou,
Qingdao, and Wuxi soon followed suit, and the system has been or
will soon be introduced in more than 100 Chinese cities.

<P>
SEOUL, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam will pay a 12-day visit to five Latin American countries
-- Guatemala, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru -- from September
3 to 14.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Guatemala between September 3 and 5,
President Kim will hold a summit meeting with President Alvaro
Arzu Irigoyen. They will exchange views on the promotion of
economic cooperation between the two countries, said South Korean
Presidential spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon.
</P>
<P>
He will also hold a multilateral summit with leaders of
Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and President
Irigoyen. The summit will discuss enhancing diplomatic and
economic cooperation with these countries in international forums
and forming a multilateral cooperation body composed of South
Korea and the five Central American nations.
</P>
<P>
While touring the four South American countries, Kim will hold
summit meetings with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem,
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Chilean President
Eduardo Frei Ruiz - Tagle and Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori. They will discuss ways of increasing economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Kim's tour will be his first visit to Latin America since he
assumed office in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
With many Latin American countries developing as newly emerging
economies, President Kim's visit would contribute to increasing
South Korea's trade with and investment in them, Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 South Korean industrial leaders are expected to
accompany Kim during his tours of the Latin American countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns US for Its Tougher Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned
U.S. President Bill Clinton for signing a bill to punish
non-American companies which invest annually 40 million U.S.
dollars or more in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed a bill Monday to punish foreign firms that
invest in energy projects in Iran or Libya.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi stated
Monday night that the American actions are against international
norms and laws on free global trade, terming it as a kind of
confrontation with the present global realities.
</P>
<P>
"Such decisions and actions will be followed by isolation of
America itself," he added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the world community is well aware of Clinton's
intention to monopolize and dominate the world's energy sources
and untapped markets.
</P>
<P>
Editorials, by two English-language dailies and a Persian one
on the signing of the bill by Clinton, claimed that the bill is
another desperate attempt on the part of Washington to beef up
what the articles called "its sagging image" abroad as a loser in
its fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times indicated in its editorial the World Trade
Organization (WTO) was born out of a common international desire
to foster free trade and to isolate countries that impose
unilateral restrictions and thus impede this objective.
</P>
<P>
Iran News called the bill signed by Clinton "one of the most
illogical and irresponsible actions ever taken by a
U.S. president."
</P>
<P>
The daily, apparently lauding European reaction to the American
sanctions against Iran, added, "Iran now expects more and speedy
constructive dialogue with Europe to promote further healthy
political and economic ties with all the members of the European
Union."
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times noted that the United States has again deceived
itself by thinking that it can still convince its international
partners to rally behind its unilateral moves. The fact is that
America's reputation as a "bully" is already so notorious as to
render its credibility gap beyond repair, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"While the United States used to be the only country capable of
acting on its own without being held accountable for its actions
in the international arena, it is now a pariah even amongst its
western allies," added the editorial.

<HEADLINE> Krajina Refugees in FRY Face Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Krajina refugees in the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) are in difficult situation
with Croatia signalling that they are not welcome to return, the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 170,000 refugees who fled the Krajina region of Croatia
a year ago and took refuge in FRY, only a handful have returned
home. Others have been relocated in the Kosovo area, the UNHCR
spokesperson Ron Redmond told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the delay in the refugee return on lack of
cooperation on the Croatian side and mass destruction in Krajina.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees feared to go back because they had been
intimidated and harassed.
</P>
<P>
About a week ago, a man taking his family back to visit the
relatives in Krajina was arrested. Redmond said was a clear sign
to refugees in the FRY not to go back.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 1,100 of the refugees remaining in FRY had
asked the UNHCR office in Belgrade to arrange their return to
Krajina.
</P>
<P>
Redmond added that although Croatia reported the return of
7,000 to 8,000 refugees, his agency had no information about their
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the refugees in FRY had been living in
collective centers and said that they felt like second-class
citizens there, with a very bleak future.

ROME, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of Romans gathered
at a grand rally on Monday evening to commemorate their fellow
patriots gassed down by German fascists in 1944 and protest the
release of a former SS captain who admitted taking part in the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, Justice Minister Giovanni
Maria Flick, Mayor of Rome Francesco Rutelli were among the
dignitaries at the solemn gathering in the city center.
</P>
<P>
The political leaders expressed their deep sympathy with and
resolute support to the relatives of the victims, saying they are
on their side.
</P>
<P>
On the rally, Mayor Rutelli condemned last Thursday's military
court verdict which found 83-year-old Erich Priebke guilty of
involvement in the massacre, but ordered him released under a
30-year statute of limitations, citing mitigating circumstances
which reduced the gravity of the crime.
</P>
<P>
The verdict triggered nation-wide anger over the case among the
public instantly. Many people, including civilians and state
officials, said it was "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Priebke was re-arrested shortly after the verdict was issued.
Meanwhile, Germany said it wanted the former Nazi officer
extradited on war crimes charges and to face trial there.
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly believe the judicial body, which is supposed to
safeguard justice, should make such a shameful and irritating
verdict," an old man told Xinhua at the rally.
</P>
<P>
Priebke, who was extradited from Argentina last November, is
now being held in a Rome jail to wait for civilian court
proceedings in 40 days.

At sunset, flocks of egrets fly from a reservoir near the plant
to the 12-ha woods of Chinese scholartrees. The birds are also
attracted by the green lawn, colorful flowers, and straight
evergreen trees outside the plant.
</P>
<P>
The workers can see egrets flying and hear them singing in the
trees.
</P>
<P>
Since he was a young man, Hao Guanglu, a 50-year-old driver who
works at the plant, has collected stacks of reference materials
and photographs about the birds and how to protect them. To teach
fellow employees more about the birds, he often presents weekend
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
The first flock of egrets appeared in the factory woods five
years ago. More egrets came later, attracted by the environment
and the workers who protected them, Hao said.
</P>
<P>
Egrets are migratory birds. They build nets and breed here in
the spring, and take their nestlings away at the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of egrets currently regard the plant home.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a safe and attractive environment for the birds,
employees at the plant have made great efforts to control water
and noise pollution, and also have planted more trees and grass
around the factory.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the egrets, many other species of birds,
including thrushes, turtledoves, owls and even the crested ibis,
live in the woods.

LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will order mobile logging
and sawmilling equipment worth 800 million Kawacha (640,000 US
Dollars) from Finland for lease to small-scale merchants to
support the local industry.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper today quoted Managing Director

that the small-scale timber merchants lack proper machinery to
tap the timber potential of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Mobile logging and sawmilling equipment is durable, reliable
and very cheap to operate and maintain, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sopper said, "the tapping of local timber potential should start
with the small-scale sector which can be strengthened to contribute
to the national economy."
</P>
<P>
There are hundreds of small-scale merchants who have the ability
but do not have enough resources to tap the abundant timber potential
in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> UN to Reduce Military Observers in Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of the military
observers of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Border Observers
Mission (UNIKOM) will be cut by 20 percent by April 1997 because
of financial difficulties faced by the United Nations, according
to UNIKOM Force Commander Major General Gean Santillo.
</P>
<P>
The commander said the number of military observers will be
reduced from 245 to 195 in a gradual process and will be done
during the rotation of each country's deployment here.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking from Camp Khor inside the Demilitarized Zone
between Kuwait and Iraq Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. has been forced to streamline its
overall organization as a whole due to financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
However, the effectiveness of the mission will in no way be
compromised, but rather "resources are being used more
efficiently," Santillo said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "I am obliging my military observers to work
much stronger and longer, which means the mission's efficiency is
not being and will not be reduced."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait bears two thirds of the UNIKOM's total annual budget of
60 million U.S. dollars while the remaining third is paid by
U.N. member states.
</P>
<P>
The commander pointed out that the Bangladeshi Infantry
Mechanized Battalion which consists of 775 military personnel
will remain as it is.
</P>
<P>
The Demilitarized Zone stretches for 3,600 square kilometers of
land, including 40 kilometers of waterway.
</P>
<P>
The UNIKOM has been monitoring the law and order situation in
the area since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denounces Perry's Statement as "Lie" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian press today published
a statement by the Iranian Embassy in Riyadh, terming U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry's statement on Thursday a "lie."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Embassy condemned the U.S. government accusations
regarding the Iranian involvement in the June 25 bombing of a
U.S. military housing complex in Dhahran, eastern Saudi Arabia
that killed 19 American servicemen and injured scores of others.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement said the outcome of investigation into
the bombing incident would exonerate Iran soon and demonstrate
the falsehood of Washington's charges against Iran.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary Perry spoke Thursday of an
"international connection" -- possibly involving Iran -- in the
massive explosion in Saudi Arabia. But later he took his words
back.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian statement said that the absence of support for
Perry's claim and repeated unfounded claims against Iran by
U.S. officials are the reason why Perry retracted his statement.
</P>
<P>
It noted that Perry made the statement "in complete neglect and
disregard for facts and it was contrary to the demands by the
peoples and the governments of the Persian Gulf in an attempt to
create tension between Iran and its neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the friendly and brotherly ties between the
peoples and governments of the two countries would continue
despite attempts to break them apart.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses 700 Million Dollars Yearly in Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria may have been losing about
700 million US Dollars a year in oil royalties, according to the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by the World Bank identified the newly
discovered source of leakage as "the value of the revenues that
should have been collected from the foreign partners in the joint
venture companies and those which were actually recorded by the
CBN (Central Bank of Nigeria)".
</P>
<P>
This is besides an estimated 954 million Dollars being lost
annually in the process of converting foreign exchange oil
receipts into local currency for deposit into the federaion
account by CBN, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum export royalties and profit taxes accruing to the
federation account are derived from sales less costs, less profit
for the six foreign partners in the joint venture companies --
Shell Petroleum, Mobpl Producing, Chevron Nigeria, Nigerian Egip,
Elf Petroleqm and Texaco (overseas).
</P>
<P>
But the report, entitled "Nigeria -- federal public
expenditure review", claimed: "Not all oil revenues find their
way into the federation account even though most federally
collected revenues are to be deposited into the federation
account for distribution."
</P>
<P>
Some of the revenue, according to the bank, has been diverted
into oil dedicated accounts which were earmarked for priority
projects.
</P>
<P>
The 700 million Dollars shortfall is based on actual oil
prices, production and revenue agreements with the joint venture
companies and the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).
</P>
<P>
The international financial institution said the loss may be
due to NNPC drawings from its account with the CBN to fund its
operational losses and other shortfalls.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Inflation Rate Slightly Down in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy's inflation rate in July
dropped slightly to 3.6 percent, the lowest in the past two years,
the Central Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) said today.
</P>
<P>
In the past eight months, Italy's inflation rate has dropped
2.4 percent points, compared with that last November.
</P>
<P>
The drop, to a certain extent, was due to the macro-control
economic policies of the government, which has made great efforts
to meet the criteria set in the Maastricht Treaty for joining the
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1991, stipulates that all
European Union members should meet the economic standards on
inflation, budgetary deficits, public-sector debts and interest
and exchange rates before 1997 for their European Monetary Union
membership.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last month, prices of some raw materials
as well as some products have also dropped, the first in 28
years.

RIO DE JANEIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Sao Paulo, the largest
city in Brazil as well as South America, enforced a law on Monday
to reduce traffic in order to fight pollution and improve the air
conditions there, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-smog measure rules that private cars keep away from
streets one day a week from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. according to digits
on their license plates. Violators face a 100 U.S. dollars fine.
</P>
<P>
Sao Paulo, which is inhabited by over 10 percent of Brazil's
entire population, and nine surrounding cities of the industrial
heartland of Brazil are under this restriction.
</P>
<P>
Smog, produced by rapidly developing industry and increasing
traffic, have polluted the air there completely.
</P>
<P>
However, not all citizens appreciate this rule for their own
benefit. Opposers, up to 10 percent of all motorists, complain of
interference of personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
Two other smog-burdened Latin American cities, Mexico City,
capital of Mexico, and Santiago, Chile, have taken the same

<HEADLINE> Argentines Protest Italy's Failure to Punish Nazi Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Argentine people
rallied Monday outside Italy's embassy to protest an Italian
court's failure to punish former Nazi officer Erich Priebke for
his massacring 335 civilians in Rome in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's Jewish leaders, who led the protest in heavy rain,
said the Rome military court's ruling would encourage neo-Nazi
groups.
</P>
<P>
Argentina extradited Priebke to Italy last year to stand trial
for taking part in the massacre in the Ardeatine Caves. The
83-year-old German admitted killing two people and keeping a list
of the victims, but argued he was only following orders.
</P>
<P>
The Italian military court found Priebke guilty of homicide,
but said his actions fell short of cruelty and premeditation.
</P>
<P>
Hours later, however, Italy's justice minister ordered Priebke
arrested again.
</P>
<P>
Germany says it will seek Priebke's extradition.
</P>
<P>
However, Argentina, whose 250,000-member Jewish community is
the largest in South America, has said it will not allow Priebke
to return.

DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi parliament plunged
into an uproar last night when opposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia
snubbed the Treasury bench members, calling them discourteous, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the MPs of the ruling Awami League (AL) sprang to
their feet in a noisy protest as soon as Khaleda, chairperson of
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the country's former
prime minister, said loudly: "Don't behave like be-adab
(discourteous)."
</P>
<P>
She was apparently reacting to noises from the Treasury bench
during her speech.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury, after a vain effort to keep
the house in order, left his seat amid a deafening uproar.
</P>
<P>
He returned to his chair in 10 minutes only to find the house
still rough with the Treasury bench MPs shouting protests against
what they called Khaleda's unseemly comment.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament is not a place for quarrelling. Utterance like
be-adab was unexpected to me," said the speaker, who ordered that
Khaleda's word be expunged from the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy to Afghanistan on Elements in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Norbert Holl, the new UN envoy
to Afghanistan, said today that the peace dialogue should be
participated by Afghan nationals as more as possible.
</P>
<P>
Holl, a German diplomat who replaced Mehmud Mestiri as the UN
envoy to Afghanistan in June this year, made the remarks at a
press conference here this afternoon after ending his trip to
Afghanistan from July 27 to August 5.
</P>
<P>
He said he would hold talks not only with Afghan military and
political figures, but also with social groups, such as women
groups and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"I will also visit some refugee camps to study the interests of
the refugees," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the UN should provide better
accommodation and coordination for its peace mission in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The UN should attach more importance to the political situation
instead of the human right situation in Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
"To my point of view, there is no obvious link between the
political issue and the human right issue in the war-torn
country," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Holl said that he did not put forward any
peace plan during his talks with the Afghan leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The main purpose of my first trip to Afghanistan is to
introduce myself and let them talk," he added.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he will return to the UN headquarters and
discuss with officials concerned about the prevailing Afghan
situation.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Blackout Causes Heavy Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's manufacturing
sector alone has suffered a loss of 123 million ringgit (49.2
million U.S. dollars) in output caused by last Saturday's blackout
affecting the whole peninsula Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The loss was calculated on a per day basis, taking into account
the sector's 45 billion ringgit (18 billion dollars) contribution
to the total estimated 1996 gross domestic product of 130 billion
ringgit (52 billion dollars), according to a senior official of
the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers (FMM) today.
</P>
<P>
FMM energy and utility working committee Chairman G. Krishnan
said at a press briefing here that the projection was not a
precise one as there were other factors to be considered and the
actual loss of FMM's 1,800 members could not be quantified yet.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only loss in production but there is damage to
sophisticated industries using sensitive equipment. To
reestablish these machines takes time, effort and money," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's peninsula-wide massive power failure lasted
more than 12 hours and was said to be the worst one since 1992
when a similar blackout took place in the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Chairman of the National Energy
Corporation Ani Arope said at a news conference here today that
consumers can sue the corporation for compensation over the
inconvenience and losses caused the blackout.
</P>
<P>
But it is up to the court to decide on the merit of any claims,
he added.

people were wounded in another two bomb attacks at trolley buses
last month.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Set New Prices for Dairy Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said here Monday that it
will announce the new prices of fresh milk, yoghurt and other
commodities "within 48 hours" after concluding consultations with
various parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply Munir Sobar made the announcement at a
meeting with representatives of cattle and livestock breeders and
dairies to discuss the impact of price increases on their products
as declared by the the ministry last week, according to
English-language daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said after the meeting that he does not expect
milk prices to increase by more than 10 to 15 percent over the
present rates.
</P>
<P>
However, dairy producers raised the price of milk by about 30
percent to 300 fils (about 42 U.S. cents) per kilogram last
Thursday immediately after the government lifted subsidies on
animal fodder.
</P>
<P>
The minister said poultry prices have been increased by 16.7
percent and table eggs by 10 to 12 percent due to the lifting of
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Deiri, president of the Jordanian Union of Cattle
Breeders, which groups 13 societies, said the new animal feed
prices increased 60 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
He said the breeders have requested the ministry to hike milk
prices to 300 fils (about 42 U.S. cents) per kilogram as the
dairy producers have done so as to secure a reasonable profit.
</P>
<P>
He added that agreement was reached with the government on
announcing the new prices formally in the coming two days.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the dairy companies sent the minister a
memorandum demanding that the increases in the prices of milk
and its products be increased in view of the increases in
other production inputs like electricity and water as well as
spare parts of their machinery and the workers wages and the
packaging costs.
</P>
<P>
The minister of supply told the representatives that the
government plans to liberalize trade and float the prices of all
commodities that have been priced by the ministry within a year.
</P>
<P>
But the government will first secure the endorsement of a law
on preventing monopoly, which will be presented to the Lower House
of Parliament in its next ordinary session, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Supply has opened the door for merchants to
import rice, wheat and sugar.
</P>
<P>
It previously had a monopoly over importing these basic
commodities.

<HEADLINE> Sense of Compromise Key to Afghan Peace: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- UN envoy to Afghanistan Norbert
Holl said here today that lack of sense of compromise is a major
hurdle in the ongoing Afghan peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here, Holl said that every Afghan
factional leader sticks to his own "principle" and lacks the sense
of compromise.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the unfavorable situation to the 16-year-old war
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Sense of compromise is the key to solve all the problems, he
stressed, adding that the "principle of clash" in some Afghan
leaders' mind must be changed.
</P>
<P>
He said he will try hard to "develop the sense of compromise"
during his peace mission in the future.
</P>
<P>
Holl paid his first visit to Afghanistan from July 27 to August
5 while holding talks with almost all the influential Afghan
factional leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Baby fish in Cambodia have
been better protected thanks to the effective measures taken by
the government to stop catching of the fish, local press reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The illegal fishing has been reduced by 70 percent this year
compared to the previous year, said May Sam Oeun, undersecretary
of state for the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The capturing of baby fish is prohibited between May and
October in the Tonle Sap, Tonle Bassac and Mekong rivers,
according to a law for fishing. Illegal trafficking of baby fish
is draining away one of Cambodia's principal natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Oeun said that most of the young fish captured are fattened
up for a year and then used in paste and soups. He alleged that
some members of the military had made catching baby fish "a
business," so his department needed adequate funds to protect his
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Researchers Develop New Anti-Herpes Cream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Ben-Gourion University
researchers have developed a new anti-viral ointment based on
extracts from micro-algae, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
This new drug, created by a team headed by Professor Shoshana
Arad, director of the university's Institute for Applied Life
Sciences Research, has been shown to be highly effective in lab
tests against various types of herpes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of people around the world suffer from herpes. In its
herpes simplex virus (HSV) form, it attacks the skin and nervous
system and produces small, short-lasting, irritating, and
sometimes painful fluid-filled blisters on the skin and mucous
membranes.
</P>
<P>
Another type of the virus, usually transmitted by sexual

<HEADLINE> Man Smiles After Surgery Resolve Facial Nerve Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Surgery has enabled an elderly
Chinese man to smile, after more than a decade of frowning caused
by a facial nerve failure.
</P>
<P>
The man, surnamed Yan, experienced pain on the right side of
his face when he smiled, because his facial trigeminal nerve has
been constricted by cerebral arteries for some 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In a recent operation, neurosurgeons at Hangzhou No.1 People's
Hospital bore a hole in the back of Yan's skull, and relieved the
painful pressure in his face by separating the facial nerve and
the cerebral arteries.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the surgery, Yan's facial nerve and muscles
worked normally. Now, he can smile and even laugh with a sense of
relief and satisfaction.

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Capital Inflows Continue to ASEAN: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Long-term capital inflows are
likely to continue to the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and
Thailand due to the sound economic performance in the four ASEAN
countries, according to an International Monetary Fund (IMF)
working paper released here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, prepared by IMF consultant Linda Roenig, said that
long-term capital was attracted to the four ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries by a track record of sound
macro-economic performance and structural reforms that were
carried out immediately prior to the inflow period between the
late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
There was also an important short-term capital component linked
in part to positive interest rate differentials with industrial
countries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the continued high productivity of capital in the
region, and assuming maintenance of sound policies, these
long-term inflows are likely to continue," it said.
</P>
<P>
For the Philippines, the paper said, the capital account,
previously negative, turned positive in 1989 and there is evidence
of a slow but steady increase in net inflows since that date.
</P>
<P>
In the four countries, macro-economic stabilization was
accompanied by policies to open the economy to foreign trade and
reform the finance sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The groundwork, thus, was laid for improved competitiveness
and a tangible rise in investor confidence," the IMF paper said.

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed by Lebanese Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- One Israeli soldier was killed
and two others were wounded by pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas
in an attack at an Israeli position inside the Israeli
self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, announced that its fighters launched the attack at
Barashit on the edge of the buffer zone at 10:00 a.m. (07:00 GMT),
coincidently with the Israeli forces reinforcing the position.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the guerrilla group stressed that a number of
Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded and black smokes were
witnessed rising highly into the sky.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters rushed to the venue to lift the killed and
wounded, and the rescue work was going on even one hour after the
operation ended, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces swept the vicinities of Barashit and hills
opposite the border strip with artilleries and heavy machine-
guns, inflaming several fires.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon reported that one Israeli
soldier was killed and two others were wounded in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
This was the second assault by Hezbollah guerrillas at the
same position in 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Two Israeli soldiers were wounded, one slightly and the other
moderately, in the Monday attack, in which the guerrillas used
mortar bombs, machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
In another development, well-informed official sources said
that representatives of the five-nation committee monitoring the
limited truce between conflicting forces along the Lebanese-
Israeli border are to meet in the week.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous sources said the first meeting of diplomats and
military officers from the member states of the committee will be
held in the south Lebanese coastal town of Naqura Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz noted Monday that the
date of the cease-fire monitoring committee's meeting had not
been defined.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose that it is very possible to see such a meeting
taking place in Naqura within the coming week," the foreign
minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising the United States, France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel will deal with violations of an April 26
understanding which brought to an end to the 17-day Israeli blitz
against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S.-brokered understanding, Israeli forces and
Lebanese Moslem guerrillas are banned from firing at civilian
areas on either side of the border or launching attacks from
those areas.
</P>
<P>
It does not rule out guerrilla attacks against Israeli
occupation forces in the 850-square-kilometer buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen Israeli soldiers have been killed and dozens of others
wounded by guerrillas in south Lebanon since the cease-fire was
enforced.

<HEADLINE> Macao's 10 Percent Insurance Income Comes From Mainland Buyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- About 10 to 20 percent of the
insurance income in Macao comes from policy buyers in the
neighboring Pearl River Delta, and the proportion is still
increasing, the Macao Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many people in the neighboring region have begun to
buy policies in Macao, and the trend is continuing, the report
quoted an expert of a Macao insurance association as saying.
</P>
<P>
China's mainland now limits the entry of overseas insurance
companies, but many Macao insurance companies have started their
promotion campaign there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report says that the overall insurance business
in Macao is expected to grow by 15 percent to 20 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Although Macao's economic growth slowed down in the past
several years, Macao residents' enthusiasm in buying life
insurance policies has risen. The development potential is deemed
huge as only 10 percent of Macao residents have bought life
insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has 20 insurance companies, including five engaged in
life insurance. They made a total of 683 million Patacas (about
87.5 million US dollars) by selling insurance policies last year.

Christie, disqualified from the 100-meter final for two false

British sport was the reason why Britain was left struggling at
the bottom of the medals table.

"How can we breed future Olympic champions in such
surroundings?" he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have any chance -- there will never be

nearly all of it is going to disappear."

<HEADLINE> Elephant Poaching On Rise In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
warned on Monday that there were signs that poaching of elephants
in the country was increasing.
</P>
<P>
The practice was curbed by the anti-poaching campaign,
Operation Uhai (Life), in 1989 and the internaional ban on sale
of tusks.
</P>
<P>
Agovernment report said recent records showed that there was a
new wave of poaching at an alarming rate, with a large amount of
trophies being impounded.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the impounded trophies included 1,103 pieces of
tusks, all weighing 2.6 tonnes and valued at about 150,000 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The impounded for now include 257 pieces of hippopotamus
teeth, 1,615 pieces of skins and other kind of trophies as well
as 4,137 live animals during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The influx of refugees from neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi is
said to be linked to the increased incidents of poaching.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Privatized Zambian companies are
urged to utilize local professionals as a pre-condition for the
interest of national development.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Charles Milupi, consulting engineer
(mechanical and electrical) of the Zambia consolidated copper
mines at function in Kitwe of Copperbelt Province last weekend,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Milupi said that Zambia would need to depend on its own
professionals in the privatization process as no nation had been
developed by foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this, Milupi noted, it needed to be a
conditionality of the privatization process that where
professionals were available within Zambia, the new owners of the
privatized companies offered employment opportunities to them
first.
</P>
<P>
Local professionals should not be discriminated as second
class to expatriates, he said, adding professionals of equal
education, experience and status in a company should be paid on
the basis of their contribution.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Extends Claim to Lake Chad: Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun has extended its claim to
the disputed Bakassi peninsula to the Lake Chad area in
northeastern Nigeria, according to the international court of
justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun extended the subject of the legal dispute between it
and Nigeria to "the question of sovereignty over a part of the
territory of Cameroun in the area of Lake Chad", the local
Guardian Newspaper quoted the international court source as
reporting today.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun is asking the court to "specify definitively" the
frontier between it and Nigeria from Lake Chad in the north to
the sea in the south, as it is disputing the entire boundary
between the two countries, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Although Cameroun's additional claim was made before the court
in June 1994, public attention has been focused almost entirely
on the dispute over the Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun instituted proceedings against Nigeria at the world
court on March 29, 1994, asking it to declare that sovereignty
over the peninsula is Camerounian by virtue of international law
and that the peninsula is an integral part of its territory.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun has accused Nigeria of "occupying several Camerounian
localities in the Bakassi peninsula,".
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has also submitted a bundle of documents in its
defence, negating the claims in Cameroun's documents.
</P>
<P>
For now, according to the report, hearing of Cameroun's
substantive claims remians frozen by the order of the court's
president made on Januray 10 in accordance with the court's
rules, pending a decision on the issue of its jurisdiction to
determine the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Receives More Visitors from Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of visitors to Jordan
from the Gulf states this summer increased by 8.65 percent over
the same period last year, with the highest number of visitors
from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
About 237,500 people from Saudi Arabia arrived in Jordan while
26,700 came from Kuwait, said Minister of Tourism Saleh
Irsheidat, quoted by the local daily Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
These numbers include Jordanians who work in these countries
and return to spend their summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said other visitors are from Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The minister contributed the increase in the number of
visitors to the improvement in relations between the kingdom and
the Gulf states and the "stability, security and abundance of
tourist attractions in the Kingdom."
</P>
<P>
The minister referred to visits to the Gulf states by King
Hussein and Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti in the past few
months, saying they were instrumental in achieving this
improvement in relations.
</P>
<P>
"The great facilities offered to visitors to Jordan have
encouraged visitors to come here," Irsheidat said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects the number of visitors to the country
this year to exceed that of last year which hit the one million
mark for the first time in the history of Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Pests Damage Vegetables in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 hectares of
vegetables grown in suburban areas of the Chinese capital are
currently endangered by the vegetable leaf miner, a kind of fly
which eats plant leaves, causing them to die.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for such a rapid, widespread outbreak of
the pests near Beijing, even though about 20 Chinese provinces
have reported finding them in the past, said a report in today's
"Beijing Daily."
</P>
<P>
In some districts and suburban counties, vegetables in plots
and greenhouses died from leaf damage caused by the flies, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
So far, pest prevention and control have proved difficult, as
local vegetable growers lack both effective methods and experience
to battle the bug, it said.
</P>
<P>
Vegetable leaf miners mainly eats leaves of vegetables,
flowers, tobacco, cotton and wheat. It was reported that the pests
caused about 1.1 billion yuan (133 million US dollars) in economic
losses last year in Shandong Province, one of China's leading
vegetable production bases.
</P>
<P>
"We're still not very clear about how the leaf miners were
carried to Beijing," Chen Xiaoyu, a plant quarantine officer of
the Beijing Plant Protection Station, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
She said the pests were found only in a few vegetable plots
around Beijing in 1994, but now the situation is serious.
</P>
<P>
"It's very likely that the pests were brought here with
vegetables and flowers which were imported or transported from
other places in the country," she said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural department of the Beijing municipal government
has warned all vegetable growers to monitor the pest
situation. Some of vegetables will have to be rooted out to
prevent the further spread of damage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Several kinds of pesticides will be used to kill the flies,
according to a plant quarantine officer with the Ministry of
Agriculture.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Huang Cuiping, an American girl
of the Chinese origin, speaks Chinese with such an offbeat accent
her classmates and teacher laugh.
</P>
<P>
But she plans to polish her pronunciation through a course in
Chinese language and culture for U.S.-born Chinese youth, held
this summer in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Huang and her 20 classmates will spend the summer learning
Chinese language, painting, martial arts and songs in the Chinese
Education College of Jinan University, in this capital city of
south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The program is sponsored by the American New China Education
Foundation and organized by Professor Zeng Zhennian, who has
taught American students of the Chinese origin three times before.
</P>
<P>
American-born Chinese who are attending universities in America
want to learn more about China and its language, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Huang Keqing, a doctorate student, visited China years ago and
took the short language and culture class. He participated in the
program again, along with his two younger brothers, who are also
interested in Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Wang Taiye from Chicago, whose daughters are learning
Chinese in the class, said that she took the girls to study
Chinese once a week in a local Chinese language school when they
were younger.
</P>
<P>
"I want my children to learn Chinese as their mother language,"
she said.

Chen Yansheng, an official of the Chinese Education College,
said Chinese education has been become well-received throughout
the world in recent years.

LHASA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- When they enlisted in the army,
Suzeng and Cezeng, two Tibetan girls, never imagined they would
realize their childhood dream: to learn to play the trumpet and
perform in front of an audience.
</P>
<P>
Now, both are members of Tibet's first female military band.
</P>
<P>
Both from Lhasa, the capital of southwest China's Tibet
Autonomous Region, the two girls are medical workers in the No.8
Hospital of the ground force of the People's Liberation Army.

The hospital, located in Xigaze prefecture, has organized the
region's first female military band. It has 150 medical workers,
of whom 60 percent are women.
</P>
<P>
"The hospital has allocated 50,000 yuan to set up the band, in
a move to enrich the lives of the enlisted," said Wu Wenhua, the
hospital's director.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to have a complete band here, because old
members retire from the army one after another," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
He added the hospital would work to train new band members, in
a move to maintain a good environment for the people living on
"the roof of the world."

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A special school has opened in
Taiyuan to help couples cope with divorce and sidestep potential
emotional damage that can affect children from broken homes.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, divorce has been on the rise in the
north China's Shanxi Province; 70 percent of the total civil cases
filed -- even 80 percent in a few districts -- end up in divorce
court.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that of 11,653 couples who applied for divorce
in 1994-1995, 7,351 actually completed divorce proceedings.
Seventy percent of them were middle-aged couples.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 9,000 children were living in shaky family situations,
according to the survey, which also revealed that 6,000 of the
kids from split families said they felt a lack of love from their
parents.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that broken families "leave an unhappy shadow on
children's hearts," and that youngsters of divorced parents may
turn to crime due to their unstable emotional lives, ignorance and
poor education.
</P>
<P>
The recent survey also revealed that 10 percent of the juvenile
delinquents in the province came from divorced families, and 20
percent of the students in the reform schools came from broken
homes.
</P>
<P>
The city's intermediate people's court and local women's
federation jointly run the courses.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean opposition Front
for Popular Democracy (FPD) said on Monday Zimbabwe's economic
structural adjustment programme (ESAP), launched in 1991, has
been a dismal failure, according to the Zimbabwe National News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conferfence in Harare, FPD President Austin
Chakaodza said ESAP had not performed the expected wonders on
Zimbabwe's economy and had instead caused untold suffering to
Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe's economic decline is symptomized by a massive
closure of firms, particularly in the textile industry, causing
massive unemployment in the country," he declared.
</P>
<P>
Despite the acclaimed advantages of free trade, the reality of
international trade relations suggested that economic reforms
benefited foreign interests at the expense of the local ones,
the FPD leader said.
</P>
<P>
On the 1996/97 annual budget, he said it lacked vision and a clear
direction.
</P>
<P>
"The budget did nothing to solve the problem of unemployment
in the country, yet economic growth can only be measured in terms
of jobs created," he added.

There is need for Zambia to start producing its own computer
systems locally as this will save the country foreign exchange,
Coker said, adding that Zambia has many local computer engineers

KUNMING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A decade ago, most tourists
vacationing in Yunnan would have complained about not being able
to find a place to spend the night in the southwest China city.
</P>
<P>
The province had only eight hotels, with a total of 300 rooms,
and the services they offered were far from satisfying to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
People never expected to enjoy star treatment from the
hospitality industry in Yunnan, well-known for its beautiful
natural scenery. But now there are 94 hotels, including five
four-star and five three-star establishments, as well as another
90 that are specially-designed for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The hotels are located in all cities in the province, including
Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, and Xishuangbanna.
</P>
<P>
Information from the China National Tourism Administration
shows that Yunnan is viewed as a traveler's must-see by foreign
tourists, as are Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In 1995, the
province played host to 600,000 overseas tourists.

<P>
HAVANA, August 5 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Castro on Monday
praised the efforts Cuban Olympians made at the Atlanta Olympic
Games, saying they carried home "the medal of dignity."
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the delegation that arrived at the Havana
International Airport here, Castro said Cuban athletes not only
kept the country's position as one of the world's sports
powerhouses, but also defended its national dignity.
</P>
<P>
He said the victory of Cuba's baseball team was "most
satisfying" but accused its main opponent United States of using
indecent methods to compete, including bribing.
</P>
<P>
With nine gold medals, eight silvers and eight bronzes, the
170-member Cuban delegation finished eight in the medals table at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
This was below the fifth place that Cuba had obtained at the
Barcelona Games in 1992 but better than any other Latin American
nation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Civil Affairs Officials Supervise Flood Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 40 senior officials
from the Ministry of Civil Affairs are directing flood-relief
efforts in southern China, which has suffered heavy losses since
late June.
</P>
<P>
Doji Cering, minister of civil affairs, and vice-ministers Fan
Baojun, Xu Ruixin and Yang Yanyin are the highest-ranking
officials among seven teams of dignitaries which headed for Hunan,
Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces as well as Guangxi
and Xinjiang autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Although local residents in the flood-stricken regions
reportedly are calm and the social order is stable, many people
still have difficulties in food, clothing, housing and medical
care.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has received 125.56 million yuan and more than 2.7
million yuan-worth of relief items for the flooded areas from
overseas donors.
</P>
<P>
Southern China has suffered severe losses since late June, when
the flooding began. The situation eased in the second half of
July, but recently has become serious again, due to another bout
of heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
The dropping water level of the Yangtze River ceased its
downward movement on August 2, and is slowly rising.
</P>
<P>
Floods recently occurred in the Yellow River and the Haihe
River, which flows through North China's Hebei Province and
Tianjin. Zhanghe, Weihe and some other tributaries of the Haihe
River have witnessed their biggest floods since 1963.

DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has suspended for ten years the construction of hotels and lodges
in the Serengeti National Park and the Ngorongoro Conservation
Area in a bid to sustain the use of the country's natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made known on Monday in the budget estimates

Minister Juma Ngasongweat.
</P>
<P>
Continued construcion of hotels and lodges in Ngorongoro and

minister warned.
</P>
<P>
The government would instead encourage investments, such as
hotels and other tourism facilities in coastal, southern and
western parts of the country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The move was in line with the integrated tourism masterplan
launched last year, under which the country's tourism foreign

<HEADLINE> Israel Drops Rabin's Assurances to US on Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has put
forward to the U.S. last week a proposal for resuming peace talks
with Syria, but dropped late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
assurance concerning a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, the
Jerusalem Post revealed today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a senior government official as saying
that that proposal excluded Rabin's verbal assurance to U.S.
President Bill Clinton that the entire Golan Heights would be
yielded, if key security concerns were met.
</P>
<P>
"The previous government's promise to the U.S. to get off the
Golan assuming Israel obtains needed security arrangements is
something we cannot agree, and we told the U.S. this last week,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, we want to meet the Syrians without preconditions,
and there is nothing else to our proposal," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Rabin, assassinated by a right-wing Jewish
extremist on November 4 at the end of a massive peace rally, had
been careful not to call this assurance a commitment.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official, however, said that this version of
events was not accurate, but refused to elaborate, according to
the Jerusalem Post report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sounded upbeat,
during his visit to Jordan Monday, about the possibility of
resuming negotiations with Syria, after hearing King Hussein of
Jordan's assessment of his weekend trip to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In a rare compliment to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad,
Netanyahu said at a joint press conference with Hussein that from
what he heard, the Syrian leader "intends to continue the search
for peace with the present Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Netanyahu held a secret meeting with Hussein in
Britain before the latter's visit to Syria, there was speculation
that the two discussed ideas surrounding Netanyahu's "Lebanon
First" initiative.
</P>
<P>
Under the "Lebanon First" proposal, Israel would withdraw its
troops from the Israeli self-declared "security zone" in south
Lebanon for a promise of quiet on the Israeli northern border.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi said, before his trip
to Syria Monday, that Lebanon could not agree to such an approach
since this would leave Syria exposed.
</P>
<P>
Sources said they believe Syria wants assurances that the
"Lebanon First" proposal would be followed by territorial
withdrawal on the Golan and it keeps its influence in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Deepening Feud Exposed Between Netanyahu, Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- There is a total lack of
contacts between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
Foreign Minister David Levy recently, signaling a deepening feud
between the two former rivals, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Levy had not been informed of the diplomatic contacts
conducted by the prime minister who apparently tried to ignore
him, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said Netanyahu and Levy have not met
since last Friday, and the last regular Sunday meeting between
the two was canceled on Levy's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted aides close to Levy as saying that the
foreign minister would repay Netanyahu for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
The leading Hebrew-language newspapers Yediot Ahronot and
Ma'ariv also ran front-page stories on the breakdown of
communications between Netanyahu and Levy.
</P>
<P>
Levy strongly accused Netanyahu of ignoring him, considering
sending secret telegrams abroad without informing the prime
minister, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time that the rift between the two former
arch rivals within the Likud party came to spotlight.
</P>
<P>
In early July, Levy created a crisis when he publicly
threatened to resign and demanded Netanyahu bring the Likud
veteran power broker Ariel Sharon into the cabinet. Netanyahu was
strongly critical of Levy's move.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, a former defense minister who launched the notorious
aggression against Lebanon in 1982, was finally appointed on July
8 minister of a newly-created National Infrastructure Ministry.
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that Netanyahu and Levy have been at odds for
a long time, which dated back to 1993, when Netanyahu defeated
Levy and other veterans to become the leader of the then
opposition Likud party.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry between the two became increasingly shrill last
year. Netanyahu's image was tainted by reports about his
extra-marital affair, as Levy's camp threatened to provide a
video tape of his exploits to the Televisions.
</P>
<P>
Levy presumed that Netanyahu was trying to implicate him and
demanded an apology. Finally in February this year, Levy broke
away from Likud and formed the new Gesher party, citing that
internal Likud electoral procedures were biased against his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
However, under the mediation by Sharon, Netanyahu formed an
alliance with Levy and Tsomet party head Rafael Eitan in a
joint-ticket agreement, which helped ensure the election victory
for Netanyahu in May.
</P>
<P>
The Moroccan-born Levy, 58, served as the foreign minister
under the last former Likud government led by Yitzhak Shamir. He
enjoys popular support among Israelis of non-European descent.

HANGZHOU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials in Zhejiang
Province, east China, are returning to the classroom as part of a
program to provide further training for local government officials

<P>
"I sometimes find that it becomes increasingly more difficult

administration, computer science, macro economics, and
international finance.

<HEADLINE> China's Goal for Price Control Shows Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to achieve its
goal of keeping the inflation rate below 10 percent in 1996,
providing no large-scale natural disaster occurs before the end of
the year that would knock prices out of whack.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was based on progressive development in various
economic sectors, "People's Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the commodity retail price has showed a
steady decline so far this year. And the price of consumer goods
rose 9.3 percent in the first six months, 11.8 percentage points
lower than in last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
China implemented a moderately-tight fiscal and monetary
policy, and governments at all levels have placed price control
high on their agendas.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, there was an ample supply on the market, and
summer grain and vegetable production yielded a harvest.
</P>
<P>
In order to attain the anti-inflation goal, the state will
strictly control price rises, and closely supervise fluctuations
through the end of the year, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Declares Food Poisoning Outbreak Infectious Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Japanese government officials
finally responded today to the appeals of medical experts to
declare the two-month-old food poisoning outbreak an infectious
disease.
</P>
<P>
But the more than 9,200 patients who have come down with the
E. coli O-157 bacteria will not be immediately rounded up into
isolation wards, Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in 20 years for the ministry to declare an
epidemic as infectious under the country's 1897 Communicable
Disease Prevention Law, which allows authorities to isolate
patients and even set up traffic blockades if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has decided that the law will be partially invoked
and patients, including 6,500 people in the western Japanese city
of Sakai, will not be moved to isolation wards.
</P>
<P>
The series of measures to be taken under the law include
regulations concerning food-handling work by patients and O-157
bacterium carriers as well as sales and use of contaminated food
and well water.
</P>
<P>
They also include mandated inspections into facilities
suspected of being contaminated with the virulent bacillus.
</P>
<P>
Doctors now have to report to authorities when treating E. coli
O-157 patients.
</P>
<P>
To prevent secondary infection, relatives of O-157 patients
will have to undergo medical checkups as well.
</P>
<P>
Japanese medical workers have been appealing to the government
to declare the food poisoning outbreak, which has so far killed
seven people, as an infectious disease.

<HEADLINE> Paper Expects Better Industrial Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts say they will see
improvements in the country's industrial efficiency during the
second half of 1996, today's "Economic Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
They said the state arranged for the construction of 131 key
capital projects this year -- eight less than in 1995 -- but
allocated additional funds totalling eight billion yuan for the
new work, which indicates a beginning of reform in the investment
structure.
</P>
<P>
Banks also granted more loans to support the construction.
</P>
<P>
The industrial situation in the first half of this year could
be characterized by a steady increase in production, with
unsatisfactory quality offered by the industrial economic
operation, according to the nationally-distributed paper.
</P>
<P>
The industrial production grew by 13.6 percent in the first
quarter of this year in comparison with same 1995 period, 13.6
percent in April, 13.1 percent in May and 13.8 in June.
</P>
<P>
However, industrial production and marketing could not
balance: the problem in arrears with payment has not yet been
solved, and the industrial economic return dropped moderately
during this period.
</P>
<P>
The experts believed that the major causes resulted from the
country's changing gameplan for economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, China's economic expansion was driven by
investment in fixed assets, consumption and export; now it is
mainly being pushed forward by the first two factors.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the separation between industrial
speed and efficiency which began to appear late last year is now a
growing problem in the industrial economic operation.
</P>
<P>
They called for the acceleration of the structural adjustment
in the second half of this year, that would require continuing the
present moderate money-tightening macro-economic policy, expanding
the structural adjustment through credit, and increasing the input
in agriculture, export-oriented industrial enterprises and
projects with ready markets.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Control Illegal Foreign Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will take
strict measures to stop illegal migration of Nepali laborers to
foreign countries in search of employment, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Labor Bal Bahadur Rai said last weekend that the
government was committed to controlling local workers' illegal
overseas migration by formulating necessary labor laws.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying at a seminar on foreign employment
problems here that Nepali nationals were being cheated in foreign
countries due to lack of skill and education and could not get
actual payments for their labor.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering to organize special skill
training for both men and women laborers looking for overseas
jobs, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Labor Ministry had granted permissions
for over 2,000 workers for overseas employment in the 1995-96
fiscal year ending last month.
</P>
<P>
But in fact thousands of Nepali workers went abroad every year
through illegal foreign employment broker agencies after paying
huge amounts of recruitment fee and many of them often found
themselves stranded helpless in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The three-day seminar, concluding Monday, was organized by the
 International Labor Organization (ILO) Kathmandu office to
discuss about the preservation of rights and well-being of foreign
employed laborers from Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Telecom Workers End Anti-Privatization Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Telecom workers in Nepal
finally ended their strike campaign in protest of the government's
privatization move in the telecom sector after part-time and total
closure of services during the past one month.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the state-run Nepal Telecom Corporation (NTC) today
resumed their work as an agreement was signed Monday between a
telecom workers' union and the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will give full autonomy to
the NTC within two and half years while maintaining a government
share of less than 50 percent in the company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will allow the NTC to operate new
telecommunication services like wireless phone and radio paging
and any modern technology-based service to compete with the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
NTC workers began their protest two months ago after the
government decided to grant permissions to nine private companies
for new services of cellular phone and radio paging in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
They launched a nationwide strike program early last month and
totally stopped office and maintenance work two weeks ago, causing
great inconvenience to telecom customers in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Telecom Workers' Union warned the government that the
privatization of the telecom industry, which presently is
monopolized by the NTC, would jeopardize the entire structure of
the telecommunication network throughout the country where nearly
90 percent of the population lives in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Monday agreement said the government would make a mandate
for the private companies to be involved in the telecom sector to
extend their services to rural and remote areas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Tourism Industry to Sustain Modest Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's tourism industry is
expected to sustain modest growth next year with a 7.4 rise in
tourist arrivals, according to a marketing plan released by the
Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT).
</P>
<P>
The plan targets 7.84 million tourists in 1997, compared to 7.2
million expected this year.
</P>
<P>
TAT also expects revenue from the industry to reach a new high
of 240 billion baht (9.6 billion US dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, new tourism products targeted at women,
honeymooners and senior citizens will be launched.
</P>
<P>
The promotion is directed towards upgrading the country's
image, said Pannara Choocharn, deputy governor of TAT.
</P>
<P>
Indochina, which is becoming popular among western tourists,
will be featured as part of Thailand's promotion campaign. TAT is
developing travel programs which push Thailand as the tourism hub
of the region.
</P>
<P>
A new product is the tourism route along the Mekong river.
There is now cooperation among countries in the Mekong subregion -
Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam and China - to develop
tourism facilities and link routes.
</P>
<P>
Tourism routes through Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia will be
developed to raise Thailand's role in the region. These three
countries are cooperating under the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand
growth triangle.
</P>
<P>
"We will not introduce new tourist destinations after
experiencing environmental impact caused by the tourism industry.
So we will be developing existing destinations and introducing new
tourism products which are new activities and have a special
interest," Pannara said.
</P>
<P>
Eco-tourism will be incorporated into existing tourist
destinations for both nature adventure and historical tours.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Cracks Baby Trafficking Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese police arrested 10
people suspected of involving in the sale of Vietnamese babies to
foreigners, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police, who stormed a private hotel in the city where seven
babies were to be sold to foreigners, alleged that 15 infants,
aged from two months to one year, were sold mainly to France and
Switzerland since early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tran Huu Phuoc, the ring leader aged 31, was arrested at his
home in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Phuoc confessed that since early 1995, he and his wife hung
around maternity homes, buying babies from unmarried mothers.
</P>
<P>
Due to social prejudice against unmarried mothers in the
country, unmarried pregnant women are vulnerable to baby
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
The ring even went to poor farming families, encouraging
parents to sell their babies, claiming that their children would
be taken good care of by rich foreign families.
</P>
<P>
These traffickers, who paid to the parents about 500
U.S. dollars a baby, would sell the baby to foreigners for up to
5,000 dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Toy Exports Below Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's toy exports in the
first half of this year were less than one-third of the target for
the whole year and the situation has caused concern among toy
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Toy exports during the January-June period were worth 3.3
billion baht (132 million U.S. dollars), compared to a target of
11 billion (440 million dollars) for the year.
</P>
<P>
Toy exports last year were worth 8.8 billion baht (352 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although the government has lowered the target to 9 billion
baht (360 million dollars), the Toy Association of Thailand is not
sure it can reach the lowered target.
</P>
<P>
High labor costs and a shortage of expertise for product
development to meet international market demand are main factors
leading to the poor growth, association sources said.
</P>
<P>
The association has urged the government to set aside a budget
to invite experts to train local employees, or to send association
members to be trained in countries with advanced toy manufacturing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
The association has also urged government agencies to boost
Thai toy exports and speed up tax refunds and make export
procedures easier.

<HEADLINE> More Vietnamese Refugees Repatriated from Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Another 253 Vietnamese refugees
left Galang island in Indonesia's Riao province for Ho Chi Ming
city in Vietnam on Monday, according to reports reaching here from
Galang today.
</P>
<P>
The group is the ninth batch of Vietnamese refugees repatriated
from Indonesia under the United Nations' Orderly Return Program
(ORP).
</P>
<P>
Since the first batch left Galang island at the end of June, as
many as 2,181 of the remaining 4,570 refugees on the island have
been repatriated to Vietnam and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which has been sheltering refugees in Galang island
for the past 20 years, is under pressure from the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to repatriate all the Vietnamese
and Cambodian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR, which has announced that it will bear all the
repatriation expenses, stopped its aid on May 31 this year for
financing the boat people in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees in Galang reached more than 40,000 in
1989, but many have since been resettled in third countries,
including Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States and some
Western European countries.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of all the refugees is expected to be
completed at the end of this month, official sources said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Money Market Turns Calmer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Thailand
Monday continued its baht injections into the local money market
and its interventions in foreign markets although the bank said
conditions on the local market have returned normal.
</P>
<P>
The interbank rate was quoted at 13 percent on Monday, slightly
higher than that of Friday, while the baht-dollar swap premium
rate dropped slightly, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
However, liquidity in the local market was still a little tight
and the Central Bank had to inject seven to eight billion baht
(280 million to 320 million U.S. dollars) through the repurchase
market on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Central Bank continued its intervention in Hong Kong
and Singapore markets on Monday following a historic move last
week when it injected a huge sum of U.S. dollars to support the
baht in the Hong Kong and Singapore money markets.
</P>
<P>
Last week the local market was nearly in crisis as foreign
investors heavily sold off baht for dollars as they speculated
that the Thai government might devalue the baht to shore up
exports, which registered a low growth rate during the first half
of this year.

<HEADLINE> New Negotiations Fail to Break Mostar Impasse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The latest round of negotiations
today failed to find a solution to the political crisis in the
divided city of Mostar, said Dragan Gasic, spokesman for the EU
administration there.
</P>
<P>
The Muslims were ready to accept an EU-proposed compromise
aimed at ending the Croats' boycott of Mostar's newly-elected
joint city council, but Croats have refused.
</P>
<P>
"The Muslims have signed the (EU-proposed) concerted action
agreement and the Croats were a few words short of signing it,"
Gasic said.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they will do so in the next few hours, but for the
moment, their answer is no," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Croats are boycotting the new council where a Muslim
coalition won a majority in the June 30 election, in protest at
alleged irregularities.
</P>
<P>
They want to suspend the council until the Muslim-Croat
Federation court rules on their complaints. But the EU compromise
proposal would set the council in motion within two months
regardless of whether the court has published its ruling.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, which has administered the city for two
years after fierce fighting between Muslims and Croats, has
threatened to pull out of Mostar unless the Croats end their
boycott.
</P>
<P>
The EU has already postponed its deadline for Croats to end the
boycott from midnight on Saturday to Monday evening. But it's not
clear whether the EU will carry out its threat if they refuse.
</P>
<P>
The United States and other western European countries are
anxious to break the deadlock between the two sides, fearing that
failure in Mostar would set a bad example for nation-wide Bosnian
elections in September.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking Rising Among Czechs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Lenient penalties and an urge to
hit a bonanza overnight have lured some of the Czechs into the
trade of drug trafficking, something unheard of in the country in
the past.
</P>
<P>
The local press blamed the abolition of the death penalty in
the country in 1989 as one of the reasons for the increasing
number of Czechs who went to try their luck in drug dealing both
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, the Czech court dealt out its severest penalty of
13 years in jail to a Colombian national selling in the country
218 kilograms of cocaine with a street value of 17.55 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, five Czeches were caught trafficking in
23 kilograms of cocaine with a street value of 1.85 million
dollars and were sentenced to only three years and nine months in
jail.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a Czech national was sentenced to 26 years in jail
for carrying out of Britain 50 kilograms of heroin with a market
value of 15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the third Czech national caught drug trafficking in
Britain. The penalty was the severest among the three traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand may be the last place where the Czech traffickers
would go.
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old Czech was sentenced to 50 years in jail in
Thailand for smuggling four kilograms of heroin to Cambodia last
year while a compatriot of his may face even life imprisonment for
trafficking in 2.4 kilograms of heroin in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking suspects face the death penalty if found
guilty in Thailand. But the sentence is traditionally commuted to
life imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> Officials Call for Support on Coal-bed Methane Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese senior energy officials
have appealed to the central government to support the development
of coal-bed methane by giving preferential policies in investment,
taxation and prices.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials from the Ministry of Coal Industry, China
National Petroleum Corporation and the Ministry of Geology and
Mineral Resources, said that the development of coal-bed methane
will supplement energy supplies, ease pollution from the heavy
burning of coal, and reduce gas explosions in coal pits.
</P>
<P>
China has 35 trillion cubic meters of coal-bed methane,
equivalent of 45 billion tons of standard coal, which are able to
generate as much energy as the country's current supply of natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
Compared with coal, coal-bed methane is a cleaner energy
resource. The use of coal, which plays a major role in China's
energy structure, has been problematic for the transportation
industry and is a major cause of pollution in China.
</P>
<P>
Coal-bed methane is notorious as the cause of coal-pit
explosions. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China
in 1949, 15,000 such explosions have occurred in the country,
or one third of the world's total in the same period.
</P>
<P>
However, carefully planned exploitation of coal-bed methane can
greatly reduce the gas content in coal-beds, and prevent potential
explosions.
</P>
<P>
China has tried to develop coal-bed methane during the past
four decades, but is handicapped by poor technology and lack of
policy support.
</P>
<P>
To meet Premier Li Peng's demand for making breakthroughs in
China's coal-bed methane development, the officials suggested that
the country should provide both low-interest and subsidized loans,
and provide more rights to raise money from international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Exploration of and investment in coal-bed methane are huge
projects, and paybacks will be long in coming. The officials hoped
that the country can give preferential polices, such as exempt
added-value taxes, income taxes and resources taxes for these
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The officials also suggested that methane products should be
given free market prices and that the country should not put a
ceiling on methane prices.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has selected Tiefa City in Liaoning Province,
the Huaibei mining area, the Kailuan coal mine, and Jincheng in
Shanxi Province to be experimental units for coal-bed methane
development.
</P>
<P>
In the future, the country will establish two coal-bed methane
bases in Hedong Coal field and Qinyuan in Shanxi Province.

Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will approve an agreement to
reduce transport obstacles for a freer flow of goods in the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA), the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Kobsak Chutikul, director-general of the Thai
Foreign Ministry's Economic Affairs Department, ASEAN leaders are
expected to approve the agreement at their first informal summit
scheduled for early December in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the main backer of the plan to harmonize rules
relating to transport and other areas within ASEAN, sees the move
as essential if businesses are to make full use of AFTA's low duty
rates, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
The proposed framework agreement, which will cover all sectors
of goods in transit -- air, sea, road and rail -- will also
streamline procedures of customs, immigration and banking.
</P>
<P>
"We need to have this kind of agreement. Otherwise the process
of free trade would not be fully implemented," the report quoted
Kobsak as saying.
</P>
<P>
At their annual meeting in Jakarta last month, foreign
ministers from Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam agreed to recommend that the ASEAN
heads of government meeting consider measures to facilitate
movement of goods in transit.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Alan Rothenberg, president of
the U.S. Soccer Federation and chairman of Major League Soccer, on
Monday lashed on the Atlanta Olympic Games organizers, saying
transport and security problems spoiled the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Rothenberg, a key figure in staging the 1994 World Cup in the
United States, told Los Angeles Times that these problems, along
with the over-commercialization of the Games, made the Centennial
Olympics less successful than the 1984 Los Angeles Games and even
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
"Now that it is said and done, the Centennial Olympic Games
made the L.A. Olympics (in 1984) and the World Cup look even
better," he was quoted as saying in Atlanta. "The visual
recollection of the Atlanta Games is one of
over-commercialization. Too many signs, too much stuff around."
</P>
<P>
He said while most visitors enjoyed themselves at the games,
they were haunted by transportation difficulties throughout.
</P>
<P>
"By and large the spectators had a good time -- once they were
able to get to the venues," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the technological and transportation problems, you
expect an occasional breakdown or two is going to occur, but to
have things go on as long as they did, and to have them recur as
often as they did clearly indicates a breakdown somewhere in the
planning process," Rothenberg said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Stops Import of Heineken, Carlsberg Beer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has placed a ban on the
import of Heineken beer of the Netherlands and Carlsberg beer of
Denmark as a counter measure following their withdrawal of
investments in the country, the official New Light of Myanmar
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, publishing a notification of the Ministry of Finance
and Revenue dated on Monday on banning the import of the two
brands of beer, said the withdrawal of the two firms was the
outcome of various internal and external attempts to stop the
inflow of foreign capital into Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The ban became effective from Monday. The ministry urged the
public to stop patronizing Heineken or Carlsberg beer as a
national duty, warning that it will impound the brands on sale at
shops or restaurants.
</P>
<P>
"These internal and external organizations which are against
Myanmar are waging such evil attempts at a time that her economy
is gaining rapid development, establishing foundations as many
foreign entrepreneurs have brought in large sums of capital and
have set up businesses that are doing well in accord with the
market-oriented economy at present," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Heineken and Carlsberg withdrew their investments in joint
venture projects in Myanmar in July this year.

WARSAW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists are calling on
Poles to cut down on garbage by not buying goods with excess
packaging.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Environmental Protection Foundation, the sponsor of
a nationwide anti-garbage campaign, said this could cut the amount
of garbage by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local reports claim that the annual amount of garbage per
capita, currently 250 to 270 kilograms, could skyrocket to 400
kilos in 10 to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The organization is calling for several measures to be
taken: avoiding producing garbage, recycling and condensing
garbage into smaller sizes before it reaches garbage dumps and
landfill-sites.
</P>
<P>
A method popular in European countries is to sort different
kinds of garbage into different bags to facilitate processing.

SANTIAGO, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ibero-American Forum on
Agriculture opened here today to discuss the challenges facing
agriculture and the rural sector in South America, particularly
the role of government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The forum will lay the groundwork for the sixth Ibero-American
summit in November in Chile.
</P>
<P>
Farm ministers, businessmen, representatives of peasant
organizations and cooperatives from Ibero-American countries will
discuss issues such as the effects of opening up to foreign
markets, financial liberalization in the Ibero-American
agricultural sector, the outlook for investment and the
macroeconomic atmosphere for productive development.
</P>
<P>
The forum will also study the feasibility of setting up a
program for inter-ministerial cooperation on action to support
the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Chilean Agriculture Minister Emiliano

<HEADLINE> Rebels Given Ultimatum to Leave Philippine Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 200 raiders of the MORO
National Liberation Front (MNLF) were given an ultimatum on Monday
morning to leave Limaong island off Zamboanga city in southern
Philippines, or face tough action from government forces.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatum, issued by Southern Command Chief of the armed
forces Lieut. Gen. Ruperto Ambil, ordered the MNLF rebels to leave
before Monday dusk the island they occupied since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ambil said the rebels arrived on the island on July 26, two
days before a scheduled meeting between the government and MNLF
Chairman Nur Misuari, who did not show up.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the raiders looted two villages while
thousands of villagers fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
"If they will not leave Limaong, we will be constrained to take
drastic offensive action to remove them," said Ambil, who reported
the case to President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF rebels' occupation was viewed as a clear violation of
a ceasefire agreement forged by the government and the MNLF last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, the government peace panel said this incident will not
in any way jeopardize the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ruben Torres said all the contentious
issues in the Mindanao peace talks have been resolved and a final
peace agreement is now being drafted for signing in Jakarta by the
third or fourth week of this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the government and the MNLF have settled the last two
issues -- the integration of MNLF troops into the armed forces and
the Philippine National Police, and the creation of a regional
security force.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed that the government will absorb a
total of 7,500 MNLF regulars into the military and police services
and that the regional security force will not be set up in the
first phase of the three-year transition period.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Post-Election Political Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- There is no sign of any
coalition among New Zealand's major political parties for the
future government with only 10 weeks to go before the general
election scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
Election campaign does not seem to be so exciting as compared
with campaign drives in other Western countries. Even in the
newspapers, coverage on the election is limited. Prime Minister
Jim Bolger is to pay a visit to South Africa this week, which some
people think is not well timed.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls conducted by different organizations have all
indicated a lead for the ruling National Party, which commands a
stable support from about 40 percent of the voters. Under the new
MMP (Mixed Member Proportional representation) system, this
support rate translates into some 50 seats in the 120-member
parliament, not enough to govern without a coalition partner.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party, now the second largest party in parliament,
has suffered a big slip in its support rate in the past year or
so. It now enjoys backing from less than 20 percent of the
voters.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand First, now having only two members in parliament,
has seen its support rate soaring since the beginning of this
year, rising from nine to 29 percent at the peak one month ago.
The rise of its popularity comes largely from its leader Winton
Peters' anti-immigration campaign which is particularly resented
by Asian migrants.
</P>
<P>
The party's support rate rose, however, mainly at the expense
of the Labor Party. Many analysts believe that the sudden rise may
be short-lived, and opinion polls in the past few weeks have
suggested that its popularity is already waning.
</P>
<P>
But the latest polls indicate that the support for New Zealand
First, standing at around 20 percent, is still a little higher
than Labor, dimming the latter's hope to claw its way back to the
second place among the parties.
</P>
<P>
The last major party, the Alliance, sees no significant change
in its support rate, staying at a few points above 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, no major party has expressed willingness to enter
into alliance with another party, making it uncertain as to how
the next government will be formed.
</P>
<P>
The National pins its hope on teaming with some minor parties,
like the United Party, the Christian Coalition and the ACT
(Association of Consumers and Tax Payers). But the National has
found it hard for these parties to pass the threshold of winning
five percent of the votes to be represented as a party in
parliament, as stipulated by the MMP system.
</P>
<P>
However, the National can still form a minority government on
its own while the other three major parties can only defeat it by
joining hands, a possibility which many observers deem unlikely.
</P>
<P>
To the delight of the National, one latest opinion poll showed
that the Christian Coalition has registered a 5.3-percent support
rate. The small party is regarded as a natural coalition partner
for the National.
</P>
<P>
Observers say they expect horsetrading and some bargains among
the parties after the election. But for the moment, the future
lineup is but everyone's guessing.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Blasts Russian Navy Over Fleet Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, Ukraine, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian navy today
accused its Russian counterpart of not taking seriously the
division of the Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Navy chief Vladimir Beskorovainy threatened to annul his
signature on some of the documents concerning the second-phase
split of the fleet, the Ukrainian Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian admiral made the criticisms after inspecting the
54 warships due to be separated by the second-phase of the
division of the fleet agreed by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Beskorovainy was quoted as describing all 54 ships and support
vessels as in very poor condition and in need of renovation.
</P>
<P>
"It is worthless to accept such a batch of warships," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian navy also blamed the Russians for not shouldering
their share of responsibility during the second phase of the split
and for not honoring some of the promises made by the Russian
defense ministry.
</P>
<P>
Beskorovainy said Ukraine is not yet satisfied with the
completion of the first phase separation of the fleet and that he
doubts whether the separation will reach the second phase.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine and
Russia have been trying to agree on how to separate the Soviet
Black Sea Fleet based in the port of Sevastopol in the Crimea
region of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The division has been a thorny issue between the two navies and
negotiations have dragged on over the separation of the fleet and
port facilities.
</P>
<P>
But the Ukrainian and Russian defense ministries agreed to
split the Black Sea Fleet in two phases. The first phase was done
in late March this year when Ukraine got some 20 warships.
</P>
<P>
The second phase split will deal with the separation of the
remaining warships and support vessels still moored at Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
The two countries had previously set a deadline for May 31 this
year for the separation of the fleet and port facilities.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has been trying to persuade Kiev to let Russia keep a
navy base for its part of the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol,
although Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has asked the
navy to look for port facilities elsewhere at Novorossiisk,
Tuapse, Sochi and Gelendzhik along the Russian Black Sea coast.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday ordered the country's prosecutor-general to work out a
program for fighting corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Prosecutor-General Yuri Skuratov, Yeltsin
said the fight against corruption is especially important at a
time when a new government is being formed and officials being
selected, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that corruption is not only a criminal and legal
problem, but is, to some extent, closely linked to faults in the
state apparatus and lack of necessary preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also discussed with Skuratov the implementation of his
decree on the fight against fascism and other forms of political
extremism.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not reveal where the meeting took
place. Yeltsin has been working at the resort of Barvikha outside
Moscow since his reelection in early July.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is rampant is Russia. In 1995, the police registered
5,000 cases of bribery, 14,204 cases of abuse of power and 35,460
cases of misappropriation of property, according to the Interior
Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The volume of proven oil and gas
reserves in Venezuela rose to just over 91 billion barrels in
1995, the country's state-owned petroleum company PDVSA said today.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Want to Hold Elections on Time: Bosnian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb parliament speaker
Momcilo Krajisnik said today the international community was using
great pressure to mar the Bosnian elections in some way, and
perhaps even have them called off, for which Serbs would be
blamed.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik made the remarks at a meeting with Jeff Baumont, the
head of the liaison office with the special representative of the
United Nations secretary-general installed in the Serb
administrative center of Pale.
</P>
<P>
The Serb state of Republika Srpska wanted the holding of
elections and elimination of the "traditional policy of
international mediators or our enemies of blaming the Serb side,"
Krajisnik said.
</P>
<P>
He told Baumont he was concerned over the deadlines for the
voting of Bosnian refugees abroad. There were proposals that
elections in certain countries be held even 10-14 days before the
planned election date of September 14 in Bosnia, he said.
</P>
<P>
This fact made room for doubts that certain voters could travel
to Bosnia and cast their votes again on the spot, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Bosnian refugees living abroad can
either vote at the asylum country or return to Bosnia to cast
ballots. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
has drawn election rules in Bosnia which set the voting date of
the refugees abroad on August 25 to September 1, two weeks earlier
than the general elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over developments in the Muslim-Croat
federation, the other Bosnian entity, Krajisnik said the situation
there could not be settled and it would also reflect on Republika
Srpska.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Croats have rejected the election results in Mostar
on June 30 during which Muslims won the majority in the city
council, thus causing a crisis within the Muslim-Croat federation.
The European Union has threatened to withdraw from Mostar, the
divided city by the two ethnic groups, if the Croats did not
compromise.
</P>
<P>
The Serb side would not interfere in relations within the
federation, because it did not want such an atmosphere to be
created where war or conflicts and political duels could be
transferred from the federation to Republika Srpska, as they had
at one point spilled from Croatia into Bosnia-Herzegovina, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leader also said it was his country's option to be
separate from the other Bosnian entity as much as possible under
the Dayton accords.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accords view Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union of
Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat federation.

<HEADLINE> US Economic Leading Indicators Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 5 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
economic indicators increased 0.5 percent in June to an historic
high of 102.9, according to the Conference Board, a private
research institute, here today.
</P>
<P>
The index is the key for economists to foretell the trend of
the country's economic development. The conference board said that
the index also increased 0.2 percent in May and increased 0.3
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
From December 1995 to June 1996, the index increased 2.0
percent, it said. During the period through June, more than 80
percent of leading economic indicators advanced.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of coincident indicators, another major
index prepared by the Conference Board, increased 0.5 percent in
June to 121.1. All three available components -- employees on
nonagricultural payrolls, industrial production, and personal
income less transfer payments -- increased.
</P>
<P>
From December last year to June, all of the components showed
significant increases and the index rose 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The composite index of lagging indicators, one of the major
indexes of the research group, decreased 0.1 percent in June to
102.3 percent. The index increased 0.2 percent in May and
increased 0.2 percent in April.

<HEADLINE> US Corporate Profits Up 19 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 5 (Xinhua) -- Corporate profits in the U.S.
rose by 19 percent in the second quarter of this year, the best
performance since early 1995, The Wall Street Journal reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a Wall Street Journal tabulation, the net income
of 704 big U.S. companies in the second quarter reached about
79.87 billion dollars compared with about 66.92 billion in the
same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise of corporate profits resulted from leaner operations,
falling material prices and strong economic expansion in the
country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Companies in most major sectors of the U.S. economy, ranging
from consumer cyclicals to energy to conglomerates, showed earning
gains that surprised analysts in the Wall Street. Some of the best
results came from securities dealers, banks, airlines,
heavy-equipment manufacturers and energy, auto, pharmaceutical,
telecommunications and aerospace companies.
</P>
<P>
But the net income slumped on lower prices for many of the
basic material producers including steel and aluminum companies
where year-on-year industry price declines in June were 5.4
percent and 8.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The earnings would be stronger if not for the rise of the U.S.
dollar in foreign-currency markets, which cut into export sales
and made it cheaper for Americans to buy imports rather than
homemade goods.
</P>
<P>
The size of profits of U.S. companies in the second quarter of
this year was unexpected because corporate profits had already
reached record levels over the past four years, the paper said.

encouraging economic news.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.55 to 5,674.28, halting
a four-session, 245-point advance.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a slim margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with its volume reaching 303.77 million
shares, down from 442.07 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 1.06 to 352.81, and the

to fall in the bond market on the strongest in a series of signals
that the economy isn't growing at an inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
But Treasury prices fell today, as traders waited to see how
well the market absorbs the 39 billion U.S. dollars in new notes
and bonds to be auctioned by the federal government on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday.
