<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- What a reception Tiger Woods got on  
the 18th green in Thursday's first round of the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	As Woods was standing on the green talking with Ian Woosnam, a  
scantily clad young woman raced up and gave the American a hug and 
a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked up and there she was,'' Woods said. ``She ran over,  
gave me a hug and quick kiss and ran off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said he was startled but never worried for his safety.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I looked at her I could see that she didn't have anything  
in her hands because her hands were up,'' he said. ``She didn't 
have a whole lot on so I guess I assumed it was a pretty benign 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Did he get her telephone number? Woods was asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``No, she ran off.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *18-OVER AND COUNTING:* David Duval's back-to-back 75-75 --  
10-over par -- in the last two rounds of the U.S. Open looks pretty 
good in the face of what happened Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, hanging in against the wind and wheatfield rough at  
Carnoustie, was only 4-over after 11 holes, but bogeyed four of the 
last five for an 8-over-79 in the first round of the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was the harshest critic of Carnoustie on Wednesday,  
calling it ``a great course spoiled'' by knee-high rough and 
fairways as narrow as 14 yards. He was even more pointed after his 
first round as the tabloid Sun Thursday called him and fellow 
American Mark Calcavecchia ``Pampered Whiners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Royal and Ancient ... I don't know what they're trying to  
accomplish,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Open was very difficult but it was enjoyable. It  
shouldn't be stress free, but if you can't enjoy an event like 
this, then you've got to question what's going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When the guys said 300 would be the winning score, everybody  
thought they were crazy. But you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, whose score was about average, was echoed by dozens of  
slump-shouldered players coming off the course like U.S. Open 
champion Payne Stewart and Tom Watson, who won the last British 
Open played at Carnoustie in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could actually be a place where people wish they'd missed  
the cut,'' said Stewart, who had a 79. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the easy wind,'' said Watson, who had an 82. ``If it  
was blowing in the opposite direction ... it would be tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How much tougher than 1975? ``Well, I shot 69 in the first  
round, so 13 shots tougher.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROSE RETURNS:* Justin Rose, the young Englishman who tied for  
fourth in last year's British Open and then missed 21 straight cuts 
after turning pro, opened with a respectble 79. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have settled for 77,'' the 18-year-old Rose said. ``If  
you shoot 71 on this course, that's the equivalent of 5-under par 
in my book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the course was unfair but obviously on a day  
like this, it makes a very stiff test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rose's goal on Friday? ``Make the cut,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He probably has a better chance than usual.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TORRANCE, FUNK OUT:* Scotland's Sam Torrance saw his  
consecutive appearances in the British Open end at 27. He pulled 
out Thursday, saying his game wasn't up to testing Carnoustie. His 
best finish was a tie for fifth in 1981. Torrance's spot was taken 
by Neil Price, the second reserve. The first reserve, Scott Watson, 
took the place of American Bill Glasson, who withdrew on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	American Fred Funk pulled out with a shoulder injury after  
shooting a 12-over 83. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	BOGEY FEVER:@ Sandra Ross, who supervises the massive scoreboard  
in the press center, ran out of light blue cards Thursday with 
``5'' printed on them to signify a bogey. So she had to shift to an 
emergency purple ``5.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to give a call and have 50 more printed up, but they  
couldn't do them in light blue, so we got purple,'' she said. ``I 
don't think we expected that many bogeys today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe she didn't, but most of the 156-man field did.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Tom Watson won $11,700 in 1975 at Carnoustie.  
This year's winner gets $546,000). ... Zane Scotland will be 17 on 
Saturday. The young Englishman, though he's not the youngest to 
play in the British Open, would be the youngest to win it. That 
honor is held by young Tom Morris, who was 17, five months and 
eight days old when he won in 1868. 
</P>
<P>
	American Brian Watts, a little-known professional a year ago  
when he lost the British Open playoff to Mark O'Meara, had 
first-round 3-over 74. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10th hole at Carnoustie is named ``South America,'' nothing  
to do with other holes carrying names like Gulley, Brae, Whins and 
Jockie's Burn. The 10th is named after a local who gave a party on 
the golf club grounds as he prepared to emigrate the next day to 
South America. But he got so drunk he wandered to the 10th fairway, 
missed his plane and never did leave Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	The 459-yard, par-4 17th was the scene of Ben Hogan's only  
double bogey when he won in 1953.

<HEADLINE> Safeway To Pay Fine for Dumping Milk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Safeway has agreed to pay $200,000 in civil  
penalties for dumping thousands of gallons of spoiled milk into 
Northern California storm drains in 1996, federal authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty settles a civil suit, filed Thursday by the  
government, accusing the supermarket chain of numerous violations 
of the Clean Water Act, said U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller's office. 
</P>
<P>
	After an error at a milk plant in March 1996 made the milk  
unacceptable for sale, more than 10,500 gallons of milk products 
were dumped by 24 Safeway and Pak'n Save stores into drains that 
led to surface waters, government lawyers said in the suit filed in 
U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The waterways included San Francisco Bay, the Petaluma River and  
other bay tributaries, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people reported seeing ``milky'' creeks, and others saw  
store employees pouring milk into storm drains, Mueller's office 
said. It said company headquarters had ordered store managers to 
get rid of the possibly contaminated milk, but didn't tell them how 
to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Milk can harm the aquatic environment because microorganisms in  
the milk use up oxygen as they degrade, the suit said. It said 
Safeway did not have a permit to discharge pollutants and had not 
treated the products to remove their harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed at the request of the Environmental  
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials could not be reached for comment after business hours  
at Safeway headquarters in Pleasanton.

<HEADLINE> Comerica Earns $167 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Comerica Inc. said Thursday that second-quarter  
profits were up 11 percent to $167 million, due to more commercial 
lending and more profitable investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's largest bank said it earned $1.03 a share for the  
three months ending June 30, compared with $150 million, or 92 
cents a share, in the same period last year. For the first six 
months of 1999, Comerica earned $326 million, or $2.01 a share, up 
from $295 million, or $1.80 a share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The second quarter results were slightly higher than Wall Street  
expectations of $1.02 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets totaled $37 billion for the quarter, up $2 billion from  
1998. Interest income for the quarter was $352 million, up $15 
million. Noninterest income was $195 million, compared to $149 
million for last year's quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Comerica had $31.1 billion in loans, an increase of $1 billion  
in the last six months, thanks to more business and construction 
loans and commercial mortgages. By contrast, residential mortgagees 
dropped 13 percent over the same period, and consumer loans were 
down 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Comerica has banking affiliates in Michigan, Texas, California  
and Florida.

<HEADLINE> EPA Retracts Hewlett-Packard Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  
has withdrawn a settlement with Hewlett-Packard Co. over inkjet 
printer chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Corvallis Gazette-Times reported that the deal was nixed  
partly because the world's second-largest computer maker refused to 
permit an audit of its records. 
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Lowrance, an EPA enforcement adminstrator, said the order  
had to be revised because of issues raised by an agency board 
reviewing the settlement and new concerns that have come to the 
agency's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	A Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said the deal was withdrawn  
because the two sides simply failed to agree on details for a 
government audit of the company's chemical records at its U.S. 
manufacturing plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement about audits is a component of that settlement  
agreement,'' Marcy Eastham said. ``Our negotiations with EPA have 
continued to be positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The development is the latest twist in the Palo Alto,  
Calif.,-based company's dispute with federal regulators over 
alleged environmental violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint filed against Hewlett-Packard in September accused  
the company of using a chemical in its inkjet printer inks for 
years without filing the proper documents or providing health 
studies to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard has said the complaint is a paperwork mix-up and  
maintains it has continued to cooperate with federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The now-retracted settlement reached in April slashed fines  
against company from $2.5 million to $112,000, in part because the 
company admitted problems with chemical records before the 
government completed its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal investigation of Hewlett-Packard was spurred by  
information supplied by Norman Pawlowski, a former chemist at the 
Corvallis plant who at one time was in charge of making sure the 
company complied with environmental laws around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	He has sued the company, claiming he was fired because he  
complained to managers that Hewlett-Packard was skirting 
environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
	A Department of Labor administrative judge ordered the company  
to reinstate Pawlowski in April and pay him back salary from his 
firing in December 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard officials said Pawlowski was fired for  
falsifying reports to the Environmental Protection agency. The 
company has appealed the decision to reinstate him.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Ups Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	L'ALPE D'HUEZ, France (AP) -- Frenchman Richard Virenque summed  
up the mood of many Tour de France riders after watching American 
Lance Armstrong extend his already commanding lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Armstrong doesn't crack, the rest of us will simply be  
playing for podium places in Paris,'' said Virenque, who finished 
sixth in Wednesday's 10th stage in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, the 27-year-old Texan making a remarkable recovery  
from testicular cancer, has a lead of 7 minutes, 42 seconds over 
Spain's Abraham Olano. The American finished fifth Wednesday in the 
stage won by Italy's Giuseppe Guerini. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two stages in the mountains, I've got to be happy,''  
Armstrong said. ``I'm in a good position. After yesterday I was 
tired, so I just tried to control my competitors. ... The only 
objective today was to hold onto the yellow jersey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong was not happy about some of the press coverage, with  
several French newspapers hinting that he might be taking 
performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stupefying Armstrong,'' was the headline Wednesday in the  
France-Soir tabloid, referring to Armstrong's emphatic victory in 
the Alps the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports daily L'Equipe's headline, above a picture of the  
American, read: ``On Another Planet.'' Inside, another said: 
``Hallucinating Armstrong'' -- another play on words, because the 
French word also means ``great'' or ``fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a doping scandal brought the race to a temporary  
halt, and the sport's image was severely damaged. Fifty-one riders 
underwent blood tests early Wednesday, and all turned out negative. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw today's headlines. Yes, they have many questions,''  
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredible that they print this. Why do they print  
this?'' he said of unfounded reports that he has tested positive 
for drugs. ``They don't print the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his success was a result of hard work, preparation -- and  
good luck. For instance, he came to the mountains and tested out 
each stage -- something few other riders have done. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's doctor in the United States, Lawrence Einhorn, told  
The Associated Press: ``This guy is so clean-living, you wouldn't 
believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guerini recovered from a crash with an overenthusiastic fan to  
win the stage, a 137.8-mile leg full of steep climbs that started 
in Sestrieres, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Tonkov of Russia was second, 21 seconds behind Guerini.  
Spain's Fernando Escartin finished third for the second day in a 
row, and Alex Zulle of Switzerland was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	In an incredible scene, Guerini smashed into a fan who was  
trying to get a close-up photograph of the rider from the middle of 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Suddenly, I went from the most beautiful moment of my life to  
the worst,'' Guerini said. ``I thought I'd lost the race. But I saw 
I had a few seconds advantage over the others, so I went flat 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was too shocked to say anything to the spectator, and  
then had problems getting his foot back into his pedal. He said 
there should have been barriers to stop encroaching fans, many of 
whom run alongside riders, cheering them on. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain, which hampered racing the day before, stopped shortly  
before the start. Weather conditions were good, with a cool breeze 
and thick cloud cover for much of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	The race began with a tough climb to the 6,874-foot Col du  
Mont-Cenis, where the pack remained bunched. 
</P>
<P>
	But on the way down, two French riders -- Stephane Heulot and  
Thierry Bourgignon -- mounted the first breakaway of the day, and 
soon held a nine-minute lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders then climbed the Col de la Croix de Fer, or Iron  
Cross Pass, at a similar altitude, the longest climb on the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Heulot almost became a local hero -- by winning on Bastille Day --  
but he finally caved in on the 21 hairpins on the Alpe d'Huez. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's stage is a relatively flat 124-mile trip from Le  
Bourg d'Oisans to Saint Etienne.

<HEADLINE> OK, So What Would You Name a Horse? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What's in a name?  
</P>
<P>
	In the case of racehorses, there's a lot of thought, and in some  
instances a touch of mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Edward A. ``Buddy'' Bishop, there's a lot of  
work, some laughs and an occasional headache. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Smells, sired by Odor in the Court, is a name Bishop,  
registrar of The Jockey Club, appreciates. 
</P>
<P>
	He also smiles at Don't Take Any, the name of a horse by Plugged  
Nickel out of Wooden, and Your Tent or Mine, whose dame was Wigwam. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are names that make Bishop cringe, or worse. It's his  
job and that of his staff to make sure vulgar or suggestive names 
aren't accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes one slips by.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we catch them (suggestive or vulgar names) before they  
race, we can call them back,'' Bishop said. Names can also be 
changed by the Board of Stewards or The Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Mike Pegram has tried to slip several names past Bishop,  
who is on the alert. After having several names for a horse 
rejected by Bishop, Pegram finally got one accepted. It was 
Censored. In another instance, a frustrated Pegram submitted and 
had accepted Buddynamedme. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop said he and his staff has to approve the names about  
34,000 horses a year, and that 59 percent of the time the first 
name submitted is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually six names are submitted, and a horse can be named at no  
cost up to Feb. 1 of his or her 2-year-old. There is a $50 fee 
after that and a $100 fee for name changes. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent name change was that of Columbine Is Sad, named long  
before the shooting incident at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owner said if he couldn't change the name, he would retire  
the horse,'' Bishop said. ``It was changed to Dake, a family 
name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five people check name requests, making sure they are within the  
rules, and then a final check in made by Bishop, who said, ``I'm 
the dirty old man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestive or double-entendre names are not the only ones Bishop  
and crew must guard against. ``In this day and age, you've got to 
be politically correct,'' he said, noting names that are 
inoffensive to some can insult members of religious and ethnic 
groups and minorities. Names such as squaw and injun are no-no's. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes of names not eligible for use include names consisting  
of more than 18 letters (spaces and punctuations marks county as 
letters); names ending in ``filly,'' ``colt. ``stud, ``mare,'' 
``stallion'' or any similar horse-related terms; names of persons 
without their written permission; names of famous people no longer 
living, without approval of the Board of Stewards, and names of 
notorious people. The Jockey Club doesn't want to hear about Jack 
the Ripper being the Kentucky Derby favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade names and copyrighted material also cannot be used as  
horse names, and names of horses currently active in racing or 
breeding cannot be duplicated. Also unacceptable are names similar 
in spelling or pronunciation to those already in use. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Republican HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, rolling over Democrats in  
a week of party-line votes, approved a modest set of patient 
protections Thursday aimed at millions of Americans who fear 
cost-conscious HMOs may deny them needed care. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill addresses the real problems many Americans face,''  
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The final vote was 53-47, with two Republicans joining Democrats  
in opposing the plan as too little. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking toward next year's elections, Democrats promised to  
revive the politically potent issue. Polls suggest Americans 
overwhelmingly favor new rules for health maintenance organizations 
and other managed care plans, which try to save money by 
eliminating unnecessary care. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called the bill unacceptable and aides said he  
would veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress insists on passing such an empty promise to the  
American people, I will not sign the bill,'' President Clinton said 
in a statement after the vote. ``This should be about protecting 
patients, not insurance companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Republicans noted that Clinton has changed his position  
on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	That won't happen this year, Vice President Al Gore said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has zero chance of going past his desk because it's a  
fraud,'' Gore said on a visit to Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side seemed particularly interested in a bipartisan  
group's last-minute attempt to fashion a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the week, Republicans argued that the Democratic plan  
would sharply increase the cost of health insurance. Democrats 
derided the Republican bill as a sham. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of debate, Republicans defeated several  
Democratic provisions, including one that would have allowed 
patients harmed by medical decisions to sue their health plans for 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO debate has attracted heavy lobbying from all sides, with  
insurance companies and businesses backing Republicans, and doctors 
and consumer groups siding with Democrats. All ran television and 
radio ads intended to influence the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	The final GOP measure offers an array of new rights to the 48  
million Americans whose health plans are exempt from state 
regulation. They include easier access to specialists, emergency 
rooms and obstetricians-gynecologists. In most cases, the rejected 
Democratic provisions were broader and covered more people. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill also would require health plans to pay for  
overnight hospital stays when women are being treated for breast 
cancer if a doctor recommends it. It would require that health 
plans give consumers more information about their plans and the 
right to appeal denials of coverage for specific treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	It also would change the tax code to make it easier for people  
to buy health insurance and long-term care insurance, although the 
bill provides no way to pay for those changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also is working on HMO legislation, but conflict among  
Republicans on its scope has kept it tied up in committees. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats compared the Senate debate to last month's legislative  
action on gun control and predicted that rank-and-file Republicans 
would defy their leaders and support at least some of the 
Democratic provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the GOP majority held firm, never losing more than three  
members on any given vote. Without exception, Democrats stayed 
together, but they needed at least five Republicans to win on any 
given issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Voting with Democrats against the final bill were Republican  
Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	While Congress has been able to agree on other health issues,  
this week's debate was the most contentious fight over health care 
since President Clinton's plan for universal health coverage died 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defeated outright the most sweeping Democratic  
proposals, including an effort to apply the new rights to all 161 
million Americans with private health insurance and to give doctors 
final say over what care is medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	But on other issues, the GOP offered modest alternatives.  
Democrats, for instance, wanted to force insurance companies to pay 
for routine health costs when patients go into clinical trials on 
experimental treatments. On Thursday, Republicans offered their own 
version, which only included cancer trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats ridiculed the approach.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can put lipstick on a pig but it's still a pig,'' Sen.  
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defended their approach but worried Democrats would  
use the debate for political advantage. On Thursday, they said they 
were no longer worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came up with a very good package, a very defensible  
package,'' said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla. 
</P>
<P>
	At the last minute, a small group of moderate Republicans and  
Democrats tried to build support for a compromise plan, which was 
similar to the Democrats' bill but eliminated the most 
controversial elements. 
</P>
<P>
	But the parliamentary agreement governing this week's debate did  
not allow for a vote on their plan, with party leaders on both 
sides controlling which amendments would be offered. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is no plan will become law, said a frustrated Chafee,  
who was trying to convert other Republicans but had a firm 
commitment only from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	``What have we accomplished?'' Chafee asked the Senate as debate  
concluded. ``It seems to me we've let down the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither side seemed interested in a compromise that might become  
law. Many Republicans, believing this issue is best left to the 
states, would be happier with no legislation at all. And many 
Democrats are hoping to use the issue in upcoming elections. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders were working behind the scenes to keep Republicans  
from signing onto the plan, said an aide to one wavering 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting pressure from leadership, he's getting pressure  
from special interests,'' the aide said. ``He's getting pressure 
from all sides.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Unchanged in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices remained frozen in June for  
the second straight month, the best showing on inflation in 13 
years, as energy costs and airline fares dropped sharply while food 
prices held steady. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that its Consumer Price Index --  
the most closely watched gauge of inflation -- was flat in June, as 
it was in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time prices showed no increase for two straight months  
was in 1986, when for three consecutive months the CPI actually 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance was even better than economists had been  
expecting. They had been forecasting a slight rise of 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news on consumer prices, which followed Wednesday's  
report that prices at the wholesale level actually fell 0.1 
percent, was certain to calm fears about inflation that had been 
generated when prices at the retail and wholesale level spiked in 
April. The rise was caused by a sharp runup in prices for gasoline 
and other energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in prices in April put the Federal Reserve on alert  
that inflationary pressures could be building and prompted the Fed 
on June 30 to nudge up interest rates for the first time in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with inflation pressures now moderating, some  
economists believe Fed policy-makers will not increase rates when 
they meet again next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other reports, the government said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose sharply 
to 310,000 last week, and stockpiles held by businesses edged up 
0.3 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase of 11,000 in jobless claims, the nation's  
labor market was still exceptionally healthy with unemployment 
remaining near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in May, the good showing on prices in June reflected a  
big drop in energy costs. Gasoline prices fell a sharp 3.2 percent 
last month, the most in more than two years. Gasoline prices were 
down 2.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drop in gasoline prices contributed to an overall  
decline of 1.2 percent in energy costs, which followed a 1.3 
percent drop in May and helped reverse a part of April's huge, 6.1 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, were unchanged in June, after a sharp  
0.4 percent rise the month before. The moderation in food costs 
came even though beef prices shot up 1.5 percent -- the biggest 
increase in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices were held back by big declines in prices of pork and  
fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, price pressures  
remained tame as well. This ``core rate'' of inflation was up only 
0.1 percent in June, the same as May. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparel prices, meanwhile, also fell 0.4 percent last month, the  
fifth decline this year. Airline fares were down 4.8 percent, the 
largest drop in more than three years, while new-car prices edged 
down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Beukeboom Calls It Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom said  
Thursday he will be unable to resume his NHL career because of a 
series of concussions last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom, 34, originally was injured Nov. 19 at Los Angeles  
when he was hit by Matt Johnson. He was hurt again in December and 
his season ended with another concussion on Feb. 12 against 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been under the care of doctors since then.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since the latest episode, from day one I've been on notice  
that it was quite possible I might not be able to play again,'' 
said Beukeboom, who played on four Stanley Cup championship teams, 
three with Edmonton and one with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is most glaring, the thing that makes it easy  
is that the Feb. 12 knock was quite slight, something you see most 
every night in the NHL,'' Beukeboom said. ``My situation over five 
months, the symptoms have not subsided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said he suffers from headaches and loses concentration  
in conversations. He has been unable to work out or do anything 
physical since the February injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never an easy decision to walk away, but it's easier to  
walk away because of medical problems,'' he said. ``I believe 
physically I could still compete. I know medically the risk I would 
put my family in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a medical retirement. I'm not able to come back and  
compete in the NHL the way I'd love to. Everything in the game 
comes to your health. My body is healthy. My mind is not healthy 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom played in 45 games with nine assists and 60 penalty  
minutes last season. In 804 NHL games, he scored 30 goals with 129 
assists and 1,890 penalty minutes.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Two law professors from Mexico's largest  
state-run university filed a criminal complaint Thursday against 
student strike leaders who have occupied university buildings for 
almost three months, Mexican media reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignacio Burgoa and Raul Carranca, professors emeritus at the  
National Autonomous University, accused strikers of illegal 
occupation of public property and said they could face 11 years in 
prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the university have been meeting with strike  
leaders for two weeks, but no agreements have been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Students took over buildings in April after yearly tuition was  
increased from a symbolic 2 cents to $145. In June, the university 
agreed to make the tuition increase optional, but students 
continued the strike, saying other demands had not been met.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Voices U.S. Nuclear Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHANNON, Ireland (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said  
Thursday it makes little difference from a security standpoint 
whether China developed its own neutron bomb instead of stealing 
the technology from U.S. labs. The United States, he said, is more 
concerned about other nations gaining nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, returning from a European tour, said that until Congress  
completes its examination of a legislative report into losses of 
military technology to China it's premature to conclude how China 
gained its nuclear knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find it to be a particularly fruitful discussion as to  
whether they claim to have this capability internally or have 
acquired it elsewhere,'' Cohen said. ``The fact that's of concern 
to all of us is that there seems to be a proliferation of nuclear 
technology to a number of countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``China has had a nuclear capability for some time,'' he added.  
``Our concern has been that other countries not acquire it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, China declared that it had invented its own neutron  
bomb, making an unprecedented disclosure about its nuclear arsenal 
to counter U.S. accusations of atomic spying. China is known to 
have exploded a neutron bomb in 1988, but never announced it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombs are meant to produce a smaller blast than conventional  
nuclear weapons but more intense radiation, limiting physical 
damage while killing large numbers of people. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration took the news in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said, ``We have some  
sense of ... their capabilities,'' which he would not describe. 
``We have no doubt that our nuclear deterrent is strong enough to 
protect our national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On another matter, Lockhart said U.S. officials have been  
assured by Taiwanese leaders that there has been no fundamental 
change in policy despite President Lee Teng-hui's statement he 
wanted ``state-to-state'' relations with China. Lee maintains he 
still seeks Taiwan reunification with China, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing responded by threatening to act militarily against  
Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province, if Taipei makes 
any independence moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the rhetoric from both sides is not helpful,''  
Lockhart said. ``But our policy toward China and Taiwan remains 
unchanged. And we have been assured in diplomatic conversations and 
there have been some public statements that the fundamental 
position of Taiwan has also not changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Taiwan declared its official policy toward China  
would be ``one nation, two states.'' The United States maintains a 
``one China'' policy, recognizing Beijing as the official 
government since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that tensions in the region had not yet escalated to  
the point where U.S. naval forces are moving to discourage 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, when a Chinese missile exercise approached dangerously  
close to Taiwan, the United States moved two aircraft carriers to 
the area as a signal that the saber-rattling by Beijing should 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been no such request to move any ships at this time,''  
Cohen told reporters on his way home from a weeklong visit to NATO 
allies in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a shift on the part of Taiwan declaring its  
independence or its quest for independence, that could certainly 
cause a rather significant increase in tensions,'' he added. ``We 
have reiterated our own commitment to the one-China policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden new concern about Taiwan has added another  
complication to U.S.-Chinese relations, strained by possible 
Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear weapons labs in the 1980s and by 
the May 7 accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in 
Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	On another security issue, Cohen said U.S. intelligence is  
trying to determine where and when the next terrorist attack by 
exiled Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden is planned. Bin Laden is 
the suspected mastermind of the bombings last summer of U.S. 
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on information that I have been following, he remains  
dedicated to trying to conduct a terrorist operation,'' Cohen said. 
``Whether it is in the final stages or intermediate stages, we are 
satisfied that he intends to continue his campaign of terror and we 
are just as determined to try and prevent it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen visited European allies cloaked in security heightened in  
the wake of the 11-week Kosovo bombing campaign. In the middle of 
the trip, Cohen made a last-minute schedule switch, stopping in 
Tuzla, Bosnia, instead of Albania, where he intended to meet U.S. 
troops as well as several of Albania's top leaders. Cohen said he 
went to Bosnia to be able to meet with a larger number of troops, 
but did not entirely dismiss the idea that security was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever we go we anticipate and try and take into account  
that security is a concern,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries N. Ireland Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A disappointed President Clinton likened the  
breakdown in the Northern Ireland peace process Thursday to a 
childish dispute and insisted that eventually a deal would be 
sealed. ``Sooner or later, we'll get this thing back on track,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peacemaking efforts were thrown into disarray when Northern  
Ireland's major Protestant party refused to nominate ministers for 
the new provincial administration, derailing hopes for forming a 
government of Protestants and Catholics after a year of deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a difficult day for those of us who have worked for  
years'' for peace, Clinton said. He said it was ``a particularly 
difficult day for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime 
Minister Bertie Ahern, who have performed heroic service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The process broke down when Ulster Unionists refused to support  
the formation of any administration that includes the Irish 
Republican Army-linked Sinn Fein party unless the IRA starts to 
disarm, something the outlawed group has long refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the disagreement was one that most Americans would  
find difficult to believe. ``They are having a fight over who goes 
first and acting today as if the whole thing could be abandoned 
over that. That cannot be allowed to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But later, in a written statement, he suggested that too much  
had been invested in the peace process for Northern Ireland's 
leaders to abandon it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cry for a peaceful, inclusive democratic society in  
Northern Ireland has never been stronger,'' he said. ``For the 
future of all the people of Northern Ireland who want an enduring 
peace and a normal life, I call upon all those involved to find the 
way to get the peace process back on track.''

<HEADLINE> La Nina To Continue Through Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The current La Nina climate episode will  
continue through the coming winter, government researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	That means an increased chance of Atlantic hurricanes, but  
otherwise continued dry conditions along the East Coast and more 
wet weather in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its strength has declined from last winter, La Nina  
will continue to influence weather around the United States at 
least into 2000, according to scientists at the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental 
Prediction. 
</P>
<P>
	La Nina is characterized by unusually cold sea-surface  
temperatures in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific, which 
trigger atmospheric patterns that influence weather around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	While a recent weakening of the easterly trade winds in the  
eastern and central equatorial Pacific increased sea surface 
temperatures slightly, the overall upper ocean temperature still 
indicates La Nina will continue, said Dr. Louis Uccellini, director 
of NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction.

<HEADLINE> HS Shootings Spur Few New Gun Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Three months after the bloodbath at Columbine High led state  
legislators around the country to demand tighter gun laws, little 
has actually changed. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a few states -- most notably, California -- put more controls  
on guns. Most states did nothing. Some even loosened gun 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Any shift toward gun control has been ``the smallest of waves,  
barely noticeable on the legislative shore,'' said Larry Sabato, 
head of the Center for Governmental Studies at the University of 
Virginia. ``Compared to the coverage that would have suggested a 
tidal wave, it's been a tiny ripple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guns already filled legislative agendas before the massacre in  
Littleton, Colo., in which two students hurled explosives and 
blasted away with four guns, killing 13 people and themselves. 
After Columbine, statehouses paid even more attention to bills on 
school safety, concealed weapons, safe gun storage and lawsuits 
against the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states did take action:  
</P>
<P>
	-- California. The Legislature restricted gun purchases to one a  
month. It also tightened a 10-year-old ban on assault weapons by 
closing a loophole that enabled manufacturers to get around the law 
by renaming their weapons. Democratic Gov. Gray Davis plans to sign 
both on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Illinois. Now gun owners must lock weapons away from anyone  
under 14, and school officials must alert police if students bring 
firearms to school. Penalties for crimes committed with guns are 
also stiffer. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, Columbine has simply silenced gun debate.  
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, lawmakers withdrew proposals that would have made  
it easier to get permits for concealed weapons and would have 
outlawed ``straw purchases'' in which a person buys a gun for 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee legislators set aside bills that would have let  
college faculty members arm themselves on campus, dropped 
background checks for those who already hold permits for concealed 
weapons, and allowed handguns on school grounds, in parks and where 
alcohol is sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee state Rep. Ben West Jr. pulled the gun measures that  
he sponsored -- out of respect, he said, for colleagues and the 
tragedy in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Some states took actions favoring gun rights.  
</P>
<P>
	Nevada decided to allow concealed weapons in public buildings,  
though not in schools or airports. Louisiana restricted 
product-liability lawsuits against gunmakers. Maine rejected a bill 
requiring parents to lock guns from children under 16. In Texas, 
lawmakers killed a bill requiring background checks for guns 
purchased at gun shows. And Gov. George W. Bush signed a law 
barring Texas cities from suing gunmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after Columbine, an Associated Press poll found 51  
percent of those surveyed saw tougher gun laws as more effective 
than tightened enforcement. That was up 9 points from a poll taken 
pre-Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton shootings also increased voter scrutiny of  
lawmakers, said Joe Sudbay, director of state legislation at 
Handgun Control Inc. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a lot of mothers and fathers afraid to send their  
kids to school these days, and they want action from their 
legislators,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But stalemate has been the most common result.  
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, Gov. Mike Leavitt and the House speaker were unable to  
agree on a school gun ban. They may let voters decide by 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, lawmakers sidestepped a vote on overhauling a  
concealed-weapons law and recessed for the summer. ``The 
legislation is certainly sufficiently controversial and 
sufficiently misunderstood that it should be put off,'' Gov. John 
Engler said. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Jersey, the Senate passed a bill requiring sensors on new  
handguns that would allow only the owner to fire them. But that 
proposal could become law only if two manufacturers produce such 
``smart'' guns -- and only if it gets approval from an Assembly up 
for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, statehouses resemble Congress, where a gun package died  
last month despite lots of talk about control. 
</P>
<P>
	``States, like the Congress, have to respond very quickly to  
take advantage of an issue created by an event,'' said the 
University of Virginia's Sabato. ``If they don't act quickly, the 
odds are nothing will happen.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees Promote Watson From Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees, still looking for  
left-handed help in their bullpen, promoted Allen Watson from 
Triple-A Columbus on Thursday and optioned infielder Clay Bellinger 
to the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, 28, was 2-3 with one save and a 4.64 ERA in 17 games  
with the New York Mets and Seattle this season. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL East-leading Yankees signed Watson to a minor league  
contract on July 3. He was 0-0 with a 6.14 ERA in two starts for 
Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	Watson, raised just a few minutes from Shea Stadium, is 47-55  
with one save at a 5.02 ERA in a seven-year career in the majors. 
He pitched from St. Louis, San Francisco and Anaheim prior to this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Stanton has been the lone lefty in the Yankees' bullpen for  
most of the season. New York promoted left-handed rookie Ed Yarnall 
from Columbus last Sunday, the day before the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellinger, 30, batted .103 in 16 games during two stints for the  
Yankees. He was with the World Series champions on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the Yankees' moves, which came before they began a  
three-game series against NL East-leading Atlanta, pitcher Mike 
Jerzembeck was moved from the 15-day disabled list to the 60-day 
DL. He was 0-1 last year for the Yankees, and has not pitched this 
season since having arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow on 
March 30.

<HEADLINE> Texas Fans Boo Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Count Texas Rangers fans among those who  
won't miss umpires if they make good on their threat to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd at The Ballpark in Arlington gave a very clear boo to  
the umpires as they walked to the plate before Thursday night's 
game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The umpires did not react. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas fans have a history of not being very sympathetic to labor  
complaints in baseball. Attendance dipped significantly following 
the 1994-95 players' strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, umpire crew chief Dale Ford said all umpires  
want ``is fair treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we make a great contribution to baseball,'' said Ford,  
who already was planning to retire after this season, his 26th. 
``How many times have you seen a scandal involving umpires? I've 
never worked with a harder-working bunch of men, a more honest, 
sincere bunch of men. We're the first to know it when we kick one 
and we're 10 times madder at ourselves than anybody could ever be 
at us.''

	China Threatens Force Against Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Vowing to defend every inch of Chinese territory,  
China's military today threatened to use force against Taiwan if 
President Lee Teng-hui declares independence on the island. In a 
sharply worded commentary run in newspapers nationwide, the 
military's newspaper, the Liberation Army Daily, said the armed 
forces stand ready to enforce a long-standing government policy to 
attack Taiwan, if need be, to uphold China's claim to the island. 
The rhetoric is the most aggressive used by China's leaders since 
Lee suggested Saturday that China and Taiwan are separate, equal 
countries.

Minister Ehud Barak for a formula to reopen negotiations with the 
Palestinians and to affirm he will give up West Bank land to them. 
The two leaders are to make a joint statement at the White House 
later today. In Helsinki earlier today, Palestinian leader Yasser 
Arafat called for the Finnish president to help get the Mideast 
peace process back on track. It was the Finnish leader who 
co-brokered a peace plan for Kosovo.

lawmakers try to reconcile a Senate-passed juvenile justice bill 
with a House version that lacks Clinton-backed gun measures. Twelve 
students and a teacher were killed in an April shooting rampage at 
Columbine High. White House-backed gun control legislation cleared 
the Senate earlier in the year. It failed in the House when 
Democrats rejected the legislation as too weak, and Republicans 
opposed it for being too restrictive on guns.

order of a High Court judge. Doctors had gone to the London court 
seeking a ruling to compel the girl, known only as Child M, to have 
the life-saving operation. Child M's case became public today when 
the High Court justice involved, Robert Johnson, explained his

carry ``resentment about what has been done to her.'' But he said 
he had to weigh that against ``not simply the risk, but the

<HEADLINE> Approval of Infant Vaccine Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drugmakers are working to lessen the pain of  
getting life saving immunizations for infants by combining existing 
vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	British pharmaceutical firm SmithKline Beecham is seeking U.S.  
approval for a new combination vaccine for five childhood diseases 
-- diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio and hepatitis B -- 
which would reduce the number of shots babies need in their first 
year of life. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham asked the federal government Thursday for an  
expedited review for its combination vaccine, which already is 
available in Europe. An expedited review means the government would 
have six months to approve the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants now need nine shots during their first 12 months of life  
to gain protection against the five diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus are already combined in  
one vaccine, while polio and hepatitis B vaccinations are given 
separately. Each of the vaccinations is given three times in the 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
	With SmithKline's new combination vaccine, 1-year-old infants  
would only need a total of three shots to be protected against the 
five diseases. Other shots would still be necessary to protection 
children against measles, mumps and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that reduces the number of injections will be welcome  
by medical providers and parents,'' said Dr. Melinda Wharton, chief 
of child vaccines at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pharmaceutical companies are working on combination  
infant immunizations, though SmithKline is the only company seeking 
U.S. approval for a vaccine that protects against five diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	The new five-disease vaccine would include the injectable form  
of polio and the acellular form of hepatitis B, which are 
considered the safest versions of the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trauma of the shots (for parents) is one of the reasons  
people do not show up for vaccines,'' said John Jabara, a 
SmithKline Beecham vice president. ``The introduction of this 
vaccine can really have a positive impact on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline and Merck are also working on a vaccine that would  
combine the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with the shot for 
chicken pox. SmithKline is also developing a single vaccine against 
hepatitis A and hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline had more than $1 billion in vaccine sales last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Other vaccine combinations being developed by companies include  
a Hib (Haemophilus influenzae type b) and Hepatitis B combination 
and a diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio combination.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers are talking with Hideo  
Nomo about a contract extension.

	``We made a proposal to them for next year, with options for  
years beyond that,'' general manager Sal Bando said. ``We're just 
waiting for them to get back to us. It's really in their court 
right now.''

the New York Mets and Chicago Cubs. He's gone 7-2 with a 3.95 ERA 
in 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are saying that they are receptive to staying here,''  
Bando said, referring to Nomo and agent Don Nomura. ``They're

<HEADLINE> Army Mulls Retirement Pay for Hale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A retired Army general who admitted having sex  
with the wives of four subordinates could lose his high rank and 
part of his $6,250 a month in retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Maj. Gen. David Hale was reprimanded and fined after a  
court-martial in March, but he escaped a possible 11-year term in a 
military prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Secretary Louis Caldera said Wednesday he is convening a  
special panel to review Hale's case and recommend whether Hale 
should be retired as a brigadier general. Hale stands to lose up to 
$750 a month in retirement pay if he is reduced in rank. 
</P>
<P>
	``The board advises the secretary of the highest grade in which  
the officer in question served satisfactorily,'' a statement from 
the Army said. 
</P>
<P>
	The board should act quickly, Army officials said, and Caldera  
will make the final call. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale's lawyer, Frank Spinner, did not immediately return calls  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was the highest-ranking Army officer to face court-martial  
since 1952. His case led to allegations that the Pentagon had a 
double standard for dealing with sexual misconduct when it came to 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was allowed to retire with honor last year despite claims  
of improprieties he committed while he was a top NATO commander in 
southern Europe. The resulting furor led the Pentagon to change its 
rules to bar top officers from retiring while facing allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also decided to take the highly unusual step of  
court-martialing Hale even though he was already retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale was convicted of seven counts of conduct unbecoming an  
officer, and one count of lying to investigators. He was ordered to 
pay a $10,000 fine and forfeit $12,000 of his $75,744 annual 
pension for one year.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Cites Discovery, Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- As it announced a major oil discovery in the Gulf  
of Mexico, BP Amoco PLC unveiled a sweeping, 3-year reorganization 
program Thursday, including plans to shed $10 billion in poor 
performing petrochemical and refinery operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it would slash expenses by 20 percent by 2001,  
while at the same time boosting capital spending by $26 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's strategy offers a sign of what may lie ahead for  
other oil companies seeking to boost profits by merging. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like BP Amoco is stealing a bit of a march on their  
competitors,'' said Barney Gray, an analyst at the brokerage 
Williams De Broe. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco said its ``Crazy Horse'' oil prospect is located in  
6,000 feet of water, 125 miles southeast of New Orleans and has 
estimated recoverable reserves of 1 billion barrels -- a level that 
analyst Alan Sinclair of Charterhouse Securities called 
``astonishing.'' BP Amoco has a 75 percent stake in the site, with 
Mobil holding the remaining 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, the U.S. shares of BP Amoco shot up 2.5 percent,  
rising $3 to close at $121.50 Thursday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of consolidation is sweeping the oil industry, driven by  
a need to cut costs when oil prices plunged last year to levels 
last seen in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed merger between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp., which  
would create the world's largest oil company, awaits regulatory 
approval. In France, TotalFina SA launched an unsolicited $43 
billion takeover bid earlier this month for rival Elf Aquitaine SA. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco itself was formed last year when British Petroleum  
acquired Chicago-based Amoco Corp. Since then, it has reached 
agreement to acquire Atlantic Richfield Co., known as Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	BP's integration with Amoco is now effectively complete, chief  
executive John Browne said at a meeting Thursday with investors to 
announce the reorganization. He said the merger is expected to 
produce annual savings of $2 billion by end of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, BP Amoco plans to shift its emphasis increasingly  
toward exploration and production and away from less profitable 
refinery and petrochemicals operations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco aims to trim its refining operations by about a third,  
due to an increase in global capacity. The first operation it plans 
to sell is the Alliance Refinery near Belle Chasse, La., a facility 
that employs 760 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to sell off $2.5 billion in petrochemical  
operations for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced earlier this year that it planned to cut  
10,000 jobs from its combined work force of 98,000. It has 
eliminated 7,000 jobs already in 1999, most of them in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would dare say the losses will be bigger,'' analyst Gray  
said. ``That's the hardest bit for people to swallow. It's all very 
well talking about efficiency until you start cutting jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BP Amoco's agreement in April to purchase Arco is expected to  
lead to the loss of 2,000 jobs. It wasn't clear if these cuts are 
to be in addition to the 10,000 already planned for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, analyst Sinclair said BP Amoco is setting a high standard  
of efficiency for the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the others will find it tough to match,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In what was probably an unintended irony, Browne outlined BP  
Amoco's progress in improving efficiency at a time when oil prices 
are surging, due largely to cutbacks in OPEC production. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for August delivery of Brent Blend crude oil from the  
North Sea closed at $19.03 a barrel in London. On the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, August contracts of West Texas Intermediate 
crude for August delivery closed at $20.16 a barrel -- almost twice 
the 12-year low of $10.65 reached Dec. 11, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Browne said BP Amoco aims to reduce its production costs to a  
level where it can still make a robust profit if prices change 
course and fall as low as $11 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinclair noted that oil markets are fickle and that some blends  
traded at less than $10 a barrel just months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be half that again in six months. We don't know,''  
Sinclair said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current buoyancy in crude prices made Browne's announcement  
of new offshore discoveries all the more welcome for investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Crazy Horse prospect, BP Amoco announced  
three other discoveries, including a major find off the coast of 
Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	``They probably don't need to build another exploration well to  
keep the show on the road for the next 10 years,'' Sinclair said.

<HEADLINE> Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch Suit Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A federal judge has thrown out Abercrombie &AMP;  
Fitch's lawsuit against retailing rival American Eagle Outfitters, 
which alleged American Eagle copied Abercrombie's image and 
business practices to boost sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge John D. Holschuh of the U.S. District Court in Columbus,  
Ohio, dismissed the lawsuit late Wednesday, saying that forbidding 
``other clothing retailers from adopting similar methods of 
advertising would be unduly anticompetitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abercrombie chairman and chief executive Michael Jeffries said  
the company strongly disagrees with the court's decision and will 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We remain committed to vigorously defending the Abercrombie &AMP;  
Fitch brand,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was filed in June 1998, pitted two of the  
best-performing mall retailers against one another. Both chains are 
popular among teens and young adults, who are attracted to the 
trendy clothes and hip atmosphere at both stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is regrettable that this lawsuit took place at all and that  
Abercrombie chose to compete with us in the courts rather than in 
the most appropriate arena -- the marketplace,'' said George Kolber, 
vice chairman of Warrendale, Pa.-based American Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Abercrombie had alleged that American Eagle copied its image in  
clothes, advertising, catalog and store design. Abercrombie sought 
to halt American Eagle's alleged practices, recover profits and 
obtain punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge, in his ruling, said that Abercrombie uses a  
common marketing approach, which many other retailers -- including 
J. Crew, Nike, Gap and Eddie Bauer -- also employ. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that, the judge found that Abercrombie's image cannot  
be considered a ``trade dress'' -- the unique way a product is 
presented and marketed -- and is not protected under the law. 
Without any legal rights, there is no basis for the lawsuit, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A trade dress is ``only protectable under the law if it is  
inherently distinctive or has come to be associated in the 
consuming public's mind with a particular product,'' the judge 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit never went to trial. The judge based his decision on  
a motion for summary judgment, whereby American Eagle asked the 
judge to consider whether or not Abercrombie had legal rights to 
what it claimed to be its trade dress before considering whether or 
not American Eagle intentionally copied Abercrombie's marketing 
approach.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Raises Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush spent a profitable  
day in the Baltimore-Washington area, collecting about $900,000 for 
his presidential campaign and picking up the endorsement of a rival 
who abandoned his own presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush wound up his trip to Virginia and Maryland on Wednesday  
evening with a $1,000-per-person fund-raiser in heavily Democratic 
Baltimore that Maryland finance chairman Richard Hug said raised 
more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a Republican in Maryland, this is unbelievable,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier at a luncheon in Washington's northern Virginia suburbs,  
the GOP front-runner collected about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush got an enthusiastic reception from the Baltimore crowd that  
included many of the state's top Republicans. Perhaps the loudest 
applause came when, in an obvious slap at President Clinton, he 
promised if he is elected president, he will uphold the laws of the 
country and ``the integrity and honor of the office, so help me 
God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours earlier, at the nearby Baltimore Convention Center,  
Clinton mocked Bush for calling himself a compassionate 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds so good. And near as I can tell, here's what it  
means: It means, 'I like you. I do,'' Clinton said to uproarious 
laughter from Democrats attending a meeting of the Democratic 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush responded that he is ``proud to be a compassionate  
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the label, and on this ground I take my stand,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush began his day at a fund-raiser in McLean, Va., just outside  
Washington. From there, he went to Washington for a news conference 
where Rep. John Kasich of Ohio abandoned his presidential bid and 
gave his endorsement to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich continued on to Baltimore, accompanying Bush on a visit  
to a poor inner city neighborhood and then to the fund-raiser, 
where he introduced the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	At a neighborhood center for children in a mostly black area a  
few blocks from Baltimore's glittering Inner Harbor, Bush visited a 
computer lab, speaking individually to each of the children before 
answering questions from a group of mostly pre-teen youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	The children served up some softball questions: What were his  
hobbies? Where did he go to college and what kind of grades did he 
get? ``Mediocre grades,'' he said, confessing to being a ``C'' 
student. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the questions were tougher, including one from a  
little girl who wanted to know if he would support an increase in 
the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The question appeared to catch Bush off guard, and he did not  
answer directly, saying he would worry about ``pricing people out 
of work'' if the minimum wage is too high. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's visit to Virginia's booming high-tech corridor was his  
second to the state in a month. The fund-raiser attracted high-tech 
luminaries such as America Online's chairman and chief executive, 
Steve Case, as well as executives from Network Solutions and 
Oracle. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's aides said the turnout was an overwhelming show of  
support from northern Virginia's high-tech leaders, but some of 
those in attendance indicated they were there to simply meet and 
hear the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Case declined to say whether he supports Bush, and a list of  
donors did not include his name. An AOL spokesman said later that 
Case has donated $1,000 to Bush. He said he did not know whether 
Case also had contributed to other campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	At both fund-raisers, Bush took a slap at the Democratic  
presidential front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, by saying 
America's current prosperity is not due to the Clinton-Gore 
administration's policies. ``They no more invented prosperity than 
they invented the Internet,'' he told the Virginia crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Gun opponents showed up at both fund-raisers to protest what  
they said was Bush's poor record on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked in Baltimore why he opposes calls to equip guns with child  
safety locks, Bush said that like many other gun control measures, 
the locks made sense but would be tough to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do is to arrest people who commit crimes  
with guns and arrest people who illegally carry a weapon and to 
make sure we've got instant background checks so that guns don't 
get into the hands of people who shouldn't be having guns,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Woody Harrelson's Dad To Get Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Woody Harrelson's father will get another  
hearing in his battle to have his murder conviction overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Charles Harrelson will focus on whether his  
original defense failed to reveal other plausible suspects, 
including a San Antonio lawyer, in the slaying of a federal judge. 
Harrelson's lawyers also argue that prosecutors concealed evidence 
that could have led to an acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia ruled that  
Harrelson will get a hearing in September in Denver. He has served 
16 years on a life term for the 1979 slaying of Judge John Wood Jr. 
in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Harrelson was hired by a drug dealer facing  
trial before Wood. Harrelson claimed he was in Dallas at the time.

<HEADLINE> Smokers To Testify in Second Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The second phase of a trial involving up to 500,000  
sick Florida smokers and their families will start with testimony 
of two smokers who are terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases of Mary Farnan and Angie DellaVecchia will be tried  
together when phase two begins Sept. 7, Circuit Judge Robert Kaye 
ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In phase one, the jury decided the plaintiffs were entitled to  
punitive damages. The amount will be set, and the cases of the nine 
class representatives heard, in the next phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye also ruled that compensatory damages would be determined  
for the class representatives before the jury decides on punitive 
damages for the class. Plaintiffs' attorneys Susan and Stanley 
Rosenblatt sought punitive damages to be set first. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye deferred ruling on whether the jury would be instructed to  
award punitive damages as a ratio to the compensatory awards or as 
a dollar amount. He will announce his decision in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco lawyers argued that punitive damages should be decided  
for each case, not for the class. 
</P>
<P>
	But lead defense attorney Robert Heim said the jury already has  
determined that tobacco is a defective product causing illnesses 
and jurors could not determine the validity of claims of each 
plaintiff. ``It would be a pure exercise in guesswork,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The class-action lawsuit by smokers is the first to reach trial.  
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are the nation's five biggest cigarette makers  
and two industry groups: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co. and Liggett 
Group Inc., as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and the 
Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Two Plead Guilty to Baby Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women pleaded guilty Thursday to taking part  
in an illegal adoption ring in which 17 Mexican babies were 
smuggled across the border and placed in American homes for $20,000 
or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Reingold and Arlene Lieberman admitted breaking  
immigration laws. Conspiracy charges were dropped in exchange for 
their pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors in Medford on Long Island, the women face up to two  
years, three months in prison. Each was ordered to pay $43,500 
restitution to the American families. 
</P>
<P>
	The women are free on bail until their sentencing; no date was  
set. Both refused to comment as they left federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The two came to the attention of authorities in 1990, when the  
state Department of Social Services received complaints that they 
were arranging adoptions without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were arrested in May with a third defendant, Mario  
Reyes, 40, a Douglas, Ariz., lawyer with an office in a Mexican 
border town. 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes allegedly paid to have babies -- some only days old --  
smuggled across the border to his Arizona home. From there, 
according to court papers, Reingold and Liberman took the babies to 
the New York City area and delivered them to adoptive parents 
without any of the required immigration and adoption paperwork.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed in Stadium Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- One of the world's largest cranes collapsed  
while lifting a 400-ton load onto the partially completed Miller 
Park, killing three workers and leaving the Milwaukee Brewers' 
stadium plans in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece of the  
$400 million stadium's retractable roof when it essentially broke 
in half and came crashing down late Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off. It was like two explosions,''  
said Gary Craig, who lives near the stadium. ``When I went outside 
I looked around and saw the helicopters hovering over the stadium, 
and I could see that the crane was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Names of the three victims were not released Wednesday. Five  
others were injured, said Milwaukee County Sheriff Lev Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic tangled today on the highway surrounding the stadium as  
curious motorists slowed to look at the construction collapse at 
daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident had not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph at the time of the crane collapse, which 
left a heap of broken, twisted metal sitting in the center of the 
new stadium being built for the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a bomb hit. It's treacherous and it's  
unbelievable,'' said Milwaukee Sheriff Lev Baldwin. He said the 
investigation into the cause could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured was a 64-year-old crane operator who was  
ejected from the crane's cabin and fell 20 or 30 feet, said Mark 
McLaughlin, a spokesman for Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was listed in stable condition today with a broken hip  
and broken right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was treated for a dislocated collarbone and  
released from Columbia Hospital, said spokeswoman Kathy Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin said some construction workers left early from the  
construction site, and police did not know how many people were 
actually working when the accident happened. 
</P>
<P>
	The 43,000-seat, grass-field ballpark had been scheduled to open  
next April, but the completion date was uncertain after Wednesday's 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers postponed tonight's game with Kansas City out of  
respect for the accident victims. The team plays in Milwaukee 
County Stadium, adjacent to the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist said he was ``horrified'' by the  
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a game, baseball,'' Norquist said. ``What happened  
today was death, and that's horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tommy Thompson released a statement expressing his  
condolences to the victims' family members. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tragic and saddening loss,'' Thompson said. ``Our  
thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those 
who died, as well as all the men and women who are working to make 
Miller Park a reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The roof is being built by Mitsubishi. The huge crane, soaring  
480 feet into the air, was used to lift seven sections of a roof 
structure with a total weight of 12,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the company that built the crane, Kennewick,  
Wash.-based Neil F. Lampson Inc., was flying to Milwaukee on 
Wednesday to assist in the investigation of the crane's collapse, 
company spokesman Bruce Stemp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stemp said it was too early for company officials to speculate  
on the cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd just like to extend our sympathies to the families of the  
workers killed in the accident,'' he said. ``Our main concern right 
now is with the well-being of those injured in the accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was designed to hold 1,500 tons, said John Mlaker, who  
worked on its design in 1979. ``Big Blue'' is one of four cranes of 
its size in the world and is currently the largest crane in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not the first time there have been injuries at Miller  
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
being lowered into position collided with an aerial basket. And on 
May 10, a worker fell 60 feet from the retractable roof and was 
hospitalized for about a week with multiple injuries.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation has never traveled so quickly down  
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in history, Congress on Thursday e-mailed the  
president a bill to sign into law - and afterward, hand-delivered a 
traditional signed parchment copy of the Y2K legal reform bill, 
just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Clinton can't enact a law in cyberspace - yet - he is  
expected to sign the parchment copy the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, a compromise between House and Senate versions, could  
save American businesses billions of dollars in legal costs from 
Y2K-related lawsuits. It passed the House July 1 by 404-24 and the 
Senate 81-18. Clinton has said he will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 minutes of congratulating and thanking each other, a  
dozen Democratic and Republican lawmakers of both parties crowded 
around House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate President Pro 
Tempore Strom Thurmond as they took an electronic pen and 
``signed'' the document on plastic computer screens. Sen. Spence 
Abraham, R-Mich., then clicked the ``Send'' button and the bill 
began its journey through cyberspace to president@WhiteHouse.gov.

<HEADLINE> Study: Weather Linked to Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weather satellite data that detect warming in  
the Indian Ocean and the early signs of an El Nino in the Pacific 
may also give an early warning about an outbreak of Rift Valley 
Fever in Africa, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	A study appearing Friday in the journal Science has linked the  
warming of Pacific and Indian Ocean waters with increased rains in 
Africa and the periodic outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, a 
mosquito-borne disease that can kill humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,  
Md., and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington 
analyzed 50 years of weather and medical data to establish the 
connection between warm oceans, rains and the fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discovered a cycle of Rift Valley Fever outbreaks that  
appeared to depend on rainfall,'' said Kenneth Linthicum of Walter 
Reed. ``There were large outbreaks every seven to 10 years, but the 
virus apparently disappears between outbreaks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assaf Anyamba, a Goddard researcher who uses satellites to study  
the oceans, said that East Africa gets more rain during an El Nino, 
but that this effect, alone, is not enough to prompt a fever 
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	A fever outbreak is more likely to occur when the Indian Ocean  
warms at the same time as there is an El Nino, a phenomenon that 
includes the warming of Pacific Ocean waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the western equatorial Indian Ocean is similar to the  
East Pacific in sea-surface temperature, there will likely be a 
large-scale outbreak of Rift Valley Fever,'' said Anyamba. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers said their study suggests that satellite data that  
measures sea surface temperature, along with measurements of 
vegetation growth in East Africa, could pinpoint areas where Rift 
Valley Fever outbreaks are most likely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The cycle of Rift Valley Fever disease depends on two types of  
mosquitoes. The Aedes mosquito lay eggs in moist soil and the young 
hatch when the ground is flooded. These insects carry the Rift 
Valley Fever virus and infect livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	When there are excessive rains, a second type of mosquito, the  
Culex, becomes prevalent. It takes blood from both livestock and 
humans and spreads the virus to people. As a result, a major human 
outbreak occurs only when there is enough rain for a large hatch of 
Culex mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said that satellite data could give a  
two-to-five-month warning of a Rift Valley Fever outbreak. This 
would give time to vaccinate livestock and to treat mosquito 
habitats with insecticides that are released upon flooding. This 
would prevent the mosquitoes from hatching and, thus, break the 
cycle of disease.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: No Hart Probe Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one pulled any strings to discipline a  
federal investigator who claims he was punished hours after asking 
touchy questions last year about the sex life of former Sen. Gary 
Hart, Pentagon officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigator was doing a routine background check on Hart,  
who had been invited by his friend and former colleague, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen, to serve on a special national security 
study panel and needed a top-secret security clearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, a Colorado Democrat and former presidential candidate,  
called Cohen's office to complain about what he considered 
inappropriate questions posed by investigator David Kerno, both 
sides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not dictate any course of action,'' said Robert Tyrer,  
Cohen's chief of staff and a longtime aide. Tyrer took the call 
from Hart, and passed on Hart's complaint to senior officials at 
the Defense Security Service, where Kerno works. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno was reassigned to a desk job and stripped of his badge and  
credentials shortly after the Sept. 18, 1998, interviews with three 
of Hart's colleagues at a Denver law firm. The agency has since 
recommended he be suspended without pay, his Denver lawyer said. 
The case was first reported in Wednesday's editions of USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno declined comment Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``He thought he was doing the right things,'' said Kerno's  
lawyer, Daniel Minahan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno had no indication that the three Hart colleagues were  
miffed at his questions, Minahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our speculation that he (Hart) was,'' upset when told  
about the sessions later, Minahan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's assistant, Pamela Martinson, was one of the three people  
questioned. She said Wednesday neither she nor Hart would comment 
on Kerno's allegations. Two lawyers also questioned by Kerno were 
out of the office Wednesday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's 1988 presidential hopes were dashed after he was captured  
on film cavorting with a part-time model, Donna Rice. Hart was 
married at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno asked Hart's assistant and two other lawyers about the  
1988 incident and related personal questions, both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not so much just about other women, but it was very  
detailed and seemed a bit, I don't want to say prurient, but it was 
inappropriate,'' a defense official familiar with the case said. 
Kerno probed ``well beyond the scope of what you'd look for this 
type of investigation, where a guy's going to chair an unpaid 
(board),'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrer and other defense officials said Hart was concerned that  
intrusive questions could backfire on the Pentagon when it is 
trying to recruit prominent, well-qualified participants for 
positions like the National Security Study Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``His complaint was not so much his own case, but his fear was  
that if this was standard investigative practice that we would 
start to have people opt out of serving,'' Tyrer said. ``I had no 
independent way to evaluate the merit of his complaint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyrer, speaking while flying with Cohen to Ankara, Turkey,  
Wednesday for meetings with top officials on NATO and other 
matters, said the Kerno case was handled no differently from any 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	He said neither he nor Cohen had any plan to interfere with  
Kerno's bosses, nor did he keep abreast of what happened to Kerno 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerno remains ``in limbo,'' his lawyer said. The Defense  
Security Service has not yet acted on the recommendation for a 
suspension, and Kerno has tried to clear his name administratively, 
Minahan said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Presidential Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to  
give members of Congress a $4,600 pay raise in January and to 
double the next president's salary to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers voted 276-147 to increase their own pay, rolling up  
nearly 2-1 margins among Republicans and Democrats alike. They then 
voted 334-82 to reject an effort by conservatives trying to prevent 
the presidential pay boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on legislators' salaries underlined the favorable  
political climate for the first raise since January 1998 and the 
second since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do polls show Congress rated favorably by more than  
half the public, but its members serve during economic plenty and 
growing budget surpluses. While in past years the congressional pay 
question has often provoked heated battles, Thursday the issue came 
and went with scarcely a mention and as an obscure parliamentary 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The scant debate opened with Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., saying he  
hoped lawmakers would support a procedural motion -- on a Treasury 
Department spending bill -- that in effect allowed the congressional 
pay raise. It ended moments later when Reps. Ken Lucas, D-Ky., and 
Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky., said they would oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like there was so much bipartisan support for the  
COLA, I didn't think anybody wanted to make it a major, 
controversial issue,'' Fletcher said in an interview later. COLA is 
shorthand for cost-of-living adjustment, the official name for the 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
	The $28 billion Treasury bill squeaked to passage by 210-209.  
Most Democrats opposed it because of spending cuts in the Internal 
Revenue Service and other agencies. GOP opposition was largely due 
to language requiring most federal employees' health plans to cover 
prescription contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the potential volatility of the issue was reflected by  
the votes of the House's most vulnerable blocks of members. The 42 
freshmen voted 26-15 against the raise, and one did not vote. And 
the 44 lawmakers elected by margins of 10 percent or less last 
November voted ``no'' by 30-13, and one didn't vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Most members of Congress earn $136,700 annually but leaders get  
more, with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., earning a top of 
$175,400. The increase will be 3.4 percent -- by law rounded to the 
nearest $100 -- pushing most lawmakers to $141,300 and Hastert to 
$181,400. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an annual raise automatically  
unless they vote to deny it, a mechanism that has at times let them 
avoid taking politically risky votes. A formula in the law links 
the increase to the boost federal workers will receive, which 
President Clinton has proposed to be 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid a replay of past accusations that lawmakers gave  
themselves a raise in the dark of night, Hastert and House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., agreed to the roll-call vote. Both men 
voted for the boost, and party leaders had met repeatedly to make 
sure there would be broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill is the traditional vehicle for blocking the  
increase. Before lawmakers voted on the debate rules for the 
measure, the leaders told their rank and file that approving those 
rules meant that a later amendment to block the pay increase would 
not be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved the Treasury measure on July 1 without  
language preventing the increase, and with no mention of it during 
debate. It is all but certain that the compromise version of the 
bill will be silent on the issue, which means the increase will 
take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts have ruled that increases under the 1989 law do  
not violate the 27th constitutional amendment, which requires 
congressional pay raises to take effect after the next election, 
because they are triggered by a law enacted several elections ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill contained language doubling the current  
$200,000 presidential salary when Clinton's successor takes office 
in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Mark Sanford, R-S.C., tried to  
kill that increase, arguing that presidents are already paid enough 
and that their perks, like free, sumptuous housing and travel are 
worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't elect a king,'' Sanford said.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an increase said presidential pay has been the  
same since it was doubled in 1969. And they said if George 
Washington's $25,000 annual salary was adjusted for inflation, it 
would now be $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's Treasury bill does not give the president a raise.  
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of congressional pay raises argue that many lawmakers  
must maintain homes in Washington and their districts. They say the 
pay must continually grow to keep highly qualified people 
interested in becoming lawmakers and aides. Staff salaries must be 
less than legislators'. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say there is no need to boost congressional salaries  
that already far exceed what most people back home earn. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the liberal Congressional Accountability Project,  
congressional salaries began at $6 per day in session in 1789. They 
hit $10,000 annually in 1925, shrank to $8,500 during the 
Depression, and reached $30,000 in 1965. 

</P>

<HEADLINE> Greenwell Leads Little League Boots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Former All-Star outfielder Mike  
Greenwell is again a league leader -- this time in ejections from 
Little League games. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell, coaching an all-star team of 9- and 10-year-olds, was  
thrown out of a game by volunteer umpire Steve Ward for the second 
time this year on Tuesday. No other coach has been ejected in more 
than 400 county and all-star tournament games during the past two 
months, a league administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said Greenwell shoved him, threatened him and cursed during  
an argument over a call at second base in the latest confrontation 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell denied using obscene language and said Ward was  
jealous of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy targeted me,'' said Greenwell, a .303 career hitter  
who played for the Boston Red Sox from 1985-96. ``He gets to go to 
work and brag he threw me out of a Little League game. ... This 
umpire threw me out of a county tournament game a month ago. It's 
like he makes purposely bad calls to have this confrontation with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, a 37-year-old computer programmer, denied seeking a  
confrontation with Greenwell, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was out to get Mike or his team, why would I do that?''  
Ward said. ``I have no reason to go after Mike. What benefit would 
I have gained?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Morris, a Little League coach and former outfielder at LSU,  
witnessed Greenwell's latest outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a good role model at all,'' Morris said. ``Mike  
Greenwell, being the player that he was, I would think that he 
would show a little more self-restraint. ... I think he was kind of 
reliving his days back in Boston. But now in Little League, you 
don't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell and Ward likely won't see each again other for a  
while. Greenwell's team lost Tuesday 17-9, ending its season.

<HEADLINE> BankBoston Earnings Rise 4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- BankBoston Corp. reported a 4 percent increase in  
profits for the second quarter of 1999 due to strong performances 
by the corporation's investment and South American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank on Thursday posted net income of $250 million, or 83  
cents a share, beating Wall Street's expectations by 6 cents. 
During the second quarter last year, BankBoston earned $242 
million, or 80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.37 billion, up from $1.10 billion in the  
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors appeared pleased with the results, and sent  
BankBoston's shares up $1.81 1/4 to $50.81 1/4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based company is in the midst of being taken over by  
Fleet Financial Group Inc. in a merger that would create the 
nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston said its Brazilian and Argentine operations continued  
their strong performances, despite the region's economic troubles. 
Together, they reported an increase of approximately 50 percent in 
net income this year compared with the first half of 1998, the bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston's investment banking arm, Robertson Stephens,  
reported an 80 percent growth from first-quarter 1999, when it 
reported pretax income of $30 million. The company was acquired by 
BankBoston in the third quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston ended the quarter with total assets of $77.6 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, net income totaled $473 million, or  
$1.58 a share, compared with $480 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 
first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first half were $2.61 billion vs. $2.13  
billion.

<HEADLINE> WNBA Locations To Be Re-Evaluated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- WNBA president Val Ackerman says the league will  
consider moving teams that are not successful at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance has been low in Los Angeles, Charlotte and Utah, and  
all franchises will be re-evaluated in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will assess team performance after the third year,''  
Ackerman said before the All-Star game Wednesday night. ``There is 
no permanent right to a WNBA team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at WNBA games has decreased 2.8 percent compared to  
the midpoint of last season. The 12-team league is averaging 9,695 
through 80 games, down slightly from 9,970 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	When compared to attendance at the end of last season (10,821),  
attendance has decreased 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergence of rookie sensation Chamique Holdsclaw in the  
league has not caused a spike in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think Chamique and players like her will be why the WNBA  
will continue to grow and attract new fans,'' Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time MVP Cynthia Cooper is not concerned about the dip in  
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have up and down seasons, the key is not to  
get nervous about it,'' Cooper said. ``I think the WNBA will do 
what is necessary to pick up attendance in those cities. You have 
to get the right players in the right cities. It may just be a 
question of promotion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four expansion teams will be added in Seattle, Portland, Miami  
and Indianapolis next season. Ackerman said she does not anticipate 
the $14 league-average ticket price to increase. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *RIDING SOCCER WAVE:* Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain, Sara Whalen and  
other members of the World Cup soccer team received a standing 
ovation when they were introduced before the capacity crowd of 
18,645 at Madison Square Garden during the WNBA All-Star game 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're all great, especially Ticha Penicheiro and  
Sheryl Swoopes,'' Hamm said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just as exciting as a men's game, with behind the back  
passes,'' Chastain said. ``Tell them we're in awe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Honorary All-Star Rebecca Lobo said the way the country has  
embraced the women's soccer team reminds her of the USA basketball 
team's march to the 1996 Olympic gold medal in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's captivated everyone,'' said Lobo, who was voted onto the  
all-star team despite a season-ending knee injury. ``All the media 
attention was focused on it. I hope they can use it to get the 
things they want and use it as a spring board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lobo's not convinced a professional soccer league can be  
developed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major League Soccer is pretty much an infant league like we  
are, trying to grow,'' she said. ``Women's soccer is going to need 
some help from somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see a professional league. I also have seen  
everything that the NBA has had to do for us. It takes a lot of 
money, a lot of time, and an incredible infrastructure. I don't 
know if they have that yet.''

	 *COOPER MISSES MILLION:* Cynthia Cooper's half-court shot to  
make Jason Walters a millionaire was three feet short during 
halftime festivities of the inaugural WNBA All-Star Game Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The capacity crowd of 18,645 at Madison Square Garden groaned  
after the two-time MVP dribbled the ball twice at halfcourt and 
launched an airball. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters, a U.S. Treasury Department employee who coincidently  
works in the Statistics of Income division, made a layup worth 
$10,000 and missed a free throw worth $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Then it was up to Cooper to earn Walters and his family a cool  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone can make the shoot, it's going to be Cynthia,''  
Walters said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper went 1-for-7 from halfcourt while practicing with Walters  
at Columbia University on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Walters attended the game with his wife, Amie,  
and mother-in-law and brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife wants to start a family in the next couple of years,  
so this will definitely help,'' Walters said of the $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Walters had practiced daily in his hometown of Germantown, Md.,  
since June 29. He was selected after applying for the shootout on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Buick Regal sponsored the $1 million Supercharged Shootout. The  
West team beat the East, 79-61, behind 14 points by Natalie 
Williams. Buick donated $25,000 to Project Cure to fight breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *YO-YO GRIFFITH:* All-Star Yolanda Griffith scored 10 points and  
grabbed five rebounds in 21 minutes to boost the Western Conference 
All-Stars to a 79-61 victory over the East. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA's unheralded No. 2 pick has led the Sacramento Monarchs  
(10-5) to a second-place tie with Los Angeles in the Western 
Conference. The Monarchs finished 8-22 last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicknamed Yo-Yo, Griffith had a stretch in late June where she  
made 36 of 58 shots (.621). She wears No. 33 and has the number 
tattoed on her right bicep in honor of Scottie Pippen's defensive 
work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Griffith is averaging a third-best 19.5 points  
and league-leading 12.5 rebounds a game. The former ABL defensive 
player of the year leads the WNBA in double-doubles with 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith's superb play may be responsible for the boost in  
attendance at Arco Arena, where the Monarchs are 5-1. Of the 10 
WNBA teams that had franchises in 1998, only Sacramento has enjoyed 
more fans in the stands (8,019) compared to last season (6,578). 
</P>
<P>
	But it's hard to catch her on television -- the Monarchs have  
just two nationally televised games. The final televised game is 
against Cleveland Friday on Lifetime Television. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAN SUPPORT:* The throngs of fans attending WNBA festivites in  
Manhattan proved they wanted to see their role models up close. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassiopeia Williams of Marietta, Ga., was among those waiting in  
line at the WNBA Store to get New York Liberty guard Teresa 
Weatherspoon's autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	She put her leg up on the table and had Weatherspoon sign her  
basketball shoe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teresa's my favorite,'' said Williams, 16. ``Attitude. All  
attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had a copy of Weatherspoon's ``Basketball for Girls''  
book tucked under her arm along with a handful of WNBA basketball 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
	A street fair with shooting contests and a chance to meet the  
players occured outside of Madison Square Garden Wednesday 
afternoon before the All-Star game.

<HEADLINE> Strange Adds Insight to Broadcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Curtis Strange was never a media darling, even when he was  
capturing consecutive U.S. Open titles in the 1980s. Now, the 
traits that once were annoying to some are earning him praise. 
</P>
<P>
	In his third season as ABC's lead golf analyst, Strange brings  
an insight matched by few, if any, and a candor that may have irked 
many people in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The 44-year-old is still active on the PGA Tour and doesn't  
expect to quit anytime soon. Each of the past seven weeks he has 
done double duty, playing in tournaments televised by ABC and then 
changing into his broadcasting attire and running upstairs to the 
18th tower. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's done a fabulous job, because it's not easy to do  
both,'' said CBS commentator David Feherty. ``I can't think of 
another golfer who has come off the course and broadcast the rest 
of the round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Strange is the only one out there.  
</P>
<P>
	The viewer is the clear winner when Strange pulls his version of  
a doubleheader. When he comes off the course, he is able to 
describe it better than anybody. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, Strange's exemption ran out after this past U.S.  
Open, since his last PGA Tour win was in 1989, and he isn't playing 
at this year's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	You may be hearing a sigh of relief from Strange, especially  
after Thursday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the toughest course I've ever seen,'' he said after  
walking Carnoustie Golf Links twice before play began. ``Forget 
what par is. Low score wins. Here it's going to be survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange admits his relationship with the media hasn't always  
been peaceful. But that's part of what makes him successful in his 
newest endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had a lot of patience when I played and I guess I  
rubbed some of the media the wrong way,'' Strange said. ``But I 
think that's good for TV because I'm blunt and to the point. If I 
were wishy-washy and everyone liked me, I don't think I'd be worth 
a darn on TV.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strange hasn't won an event since he capturing back-to-back U.S.  
Opens (1988-89) -- the first to accomplish that since Ben Hogan did 
it in 1950 and 1951. Strange has played in 13 tournaments this year 
and ranks No. 154 on the money list with $113,263. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a full-time broadcaster now, but I'll always play some  
because I still enjoy it even though I don't play as well as I used 
to. But it's important for me to play in order to stay current.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC producer Jack Graham is trying to stay up on things as well.  
This year's telecast will look more Americanized than ever. In the 
past, the network strictly used the feed from the BBC. Now it has 
11 of its own cameras, plus two handheld ones on the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gives us a lot more flexibility about being able to cut  
back to players and give viewers tight shots and better graphics,'' 
Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *KEEPING PACE:* Mark McGwire isn't the only one to fall off last  
year's pace. Although some of the baseball networks have increased 
ratings, a few haven't been as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	At this time last season, all of the networks were up from the  
year before, but this season Fox is the only winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the first six weeks, Fox's Saturday game of the week is  
up 7 percent, Fox Sports Net is up 12 percent and FX is up 13 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ESPN is down 7 percent through 49 games this season,  
and Turner has dipped 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox didn't fare so well with Tuesday's All-Star game, in which  
ratings dropped 9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	 *MOVING TRIBUTE:* NBC's Bob Costas, who will do play-by-play for  
this year's World Series, was at home for the All-Star game and had 
nothing but praise for Fox's coverage -- especially its pregame 
ceremony involving Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was perfect and very moving,'' Costas said. ``You  
couldn't have asked for anything better. I think Fox did an 
excellent job presenting it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costas cites lots of reasons for the All-Star game's declining  
ratings, not the least of which is overexposure. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, the All-Star game was so special because you  
didn't see these guys,'' he said. ``You never saw the guys from the 
other league. Now we see them every night on highlight shows on

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Unchanged in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices remained frozen in June for  
the second straight month, the best showing on inflation in 13 
years, as energy costs and airline fares dropped sharply while food 
prices held steady. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that its Consumer Price Index --  
the most closely watched gauge of inflation -- was flat in June, as 
it was in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time prices showed no increase for two straight months  
was in 1986, when for three consecutive months the CPI actually 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance was even better than economists had been  
expecting. They had been forecasting a slight rise of 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news on consumer prices, which followed Wednesday's  
report that prices at the wholesale level actually fell 0.1 
percent, was certain to calm fears about inflation that had been 
generated when prices at the retail and wholesale level spiked in 
April. The rise was caused by a sharp runup in prices for gasoline 
and other energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in prices in April put the Federal Reserve on alert  
that inflationary pressures could be building and prompted the Fed 
on June 30 to nudge up interest rates for the first time in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with inflation pressures now moderating, some  
economists believe Fed policy-makers will not increase rates when 
they meet again next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other reports, the government said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose sharply 
to 310,000 last week, and stockpiles held by businesses edged up 
0.3 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase of 11,000 in jobless claims, the nation's  
labor market was still exceptionally healthy with unemployment 
remaining near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in May, the good showing on prices in June reflected a  
big drop in energy costs. Gasoline prices fell a sharp 3.2 percent 
last month, the most in more than two years. Gasoline prices were 
down 2.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drop in gasoline prices contributed to an overall  
decline of 1.2 percent in energy costs, which followed a 1.3 
percent drop in May and helped reverse a part of April's huge, 6.1 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, were unchanged in June, after a sharp  
0.4 percent rise the month before. The moderation in food costs 
came even though beef prices shot up 1.5 percent -- the biggest 
increase in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices were held back by big declines in prices of pork and  
fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, price pressures  
remained tame as well. This ``core rate'' of inflation was up only 
0.1 percent in June, the same as May. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparel prices, meanwhile, also fell 0.4 percent last month, the  
fifth decline this year. Airline fares were down 4.8 percent, the 
largest drop in more than three years, while new-car prices edged 
down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> NextCard Sues Providian over Web Ad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Web-based credit company NextCard sued  
credit giant Providian for copyright infringement in a case that 
could set a precedent for how the law applies to Internet 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	In the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San  
Francisco, NextCard accused Providian of copying a Web banner ad 
that features a descending thermometer to represent falling 
interest rates. NextCard said the ad is its most effective, with 
about 680,000 Web users clicking on it. 
</P>
<P>
	NextCard said Providian's ad infringed on its copyrights and  
trademarks, and represents unfair competition. NextCard asked the 
court to force Providian to stop running the ad and pay unspecified 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providian's strategy at this point is apparently to deceive  
Internet users into thinking they were clicking on to NextCard's 
site,'' NextCard chief executive Jeremy Lent told the San Francisco 
Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Lent was Providian's chief financial officer before leaving to  
found NextCard several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	NextCard is the largest credit card company that operates only  
on the Web. Providian is the nation's ninth largest credit card 
issuer. Both companies are based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no proprietary rights in banner ads,'' said  
Providian spokesman Marc Loewenthal. ``They are attention-getting 
devices that do not reflect any original work of authorship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and state laws define unfair competition and protect  
business trademarks, copyrights and proprietary symbols. But legal 
experts say there is little guidance on how the law applies to 
Internet ads. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a subject that's going to be one of the hottest in the  
next few years,'' said Joseph Cotchett, an attorney in Burlingame, 
Calif. ``It's going to spawn more litigation than you can 
imagine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Internet banners ads allow users to click and go to an  
advertiser's Web site, but they are becoming less effective as 
people learn to tune them out. Industry studies show that on 
average, users click on banner ads once out of every 200 times they 
view a Web page.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Downgrades Growth Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's 1998 recession was deeper than  
originally thought and its recovery slower, according to revised 
economic growth figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a new method of calculation designed to reflect changes in  
the financial sector, the 1998 third-quarter gross domestic product 
contracted 1.9 percent, the Statistics Department said. Its earlier 
calculations showed a 0.6 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourth-quarter GDP contracted 1.1 percent, the report said. The  
earlier calculation was 0.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's economic growth was revised downward to 0.3 percent  
from 1.5 percent, and this year's first-quarter growth was adjusted 
to 0.8 percent from 1.2 percent, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
	GDP is the measure of all goods and services produced within a  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the new way of measuring GDP reflects more  
accurately the adverse impact of the financial crisis, which 
seriously weakened financial services and the overall economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has estimated that Singapore's economy will show  
growth of up to 2 percent this year, but Deputy Prime Minister Lee 
Hsien Loong has said the forecast would be raised in August.

	Albanian Leader Returns to Kosovo

<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim  
Rugova returned from self-imposed exile today, welcomed by 
flower-throwing supporters but facing a province dominated by 
rivals eager to exploit his absence during the war. Kosovo 
Albanians lined the hilly two-lane highway that twists 40 miles 
from the Macedonian border north to Pristina to cheer Rugova. 
Rugova is hoping to reclaim authority eroded by his decision to go 
abroad during the war and by perceptions he cooperated with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the past months.

Angel Maturino Resendez. So far, the 39-year-old drifter is tied to 
nine slayings and charged in four. Most of the requests, which came 
from police in practically every state, had to be put aside during

<HEADLINE> Case Vs. Mexico Ex-Financier Shrinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican court has thrown out one of the  
last two charges remaining against a former financier accused of 
swindling his bank out of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	The court granted an injunction Wednesday blocking a charge that  
Angel Isidoro Rodriguez Saez arranged for his bank, Banpais, to 
make 59 million pesos (now $6.3 million) in illegal loans to 
companies he owned. It ruled that the charge was filed two months 
after the statute of limitations had expired, Mexican news media 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, known as ``El Divino'' -- ``The Divine One'' -- is one  
of several high-flying bankers from the early 1990s whose excesses 
and alleged corruption have made them symbols of the Mexican 
banking crisis that eventually required a government bailout, 
estimated at more than $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez fled to Spain as banking scandals emerged in 1994. He  
was arrested in Spain in July 1996 -- despite diving off his yacht 
in the Mediterranean in an effort to elude police -- and was 
extradited to Mexico last year on four criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the charges have now been dismissed. Rodriguez, who is  
free on bail, still faces a charge of violating stock trading laws.

<HEADLINE> Coke Motion on Bias Suit Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday denied a request by  
The Coca-Cola Co. that would have barred a racial discrimination 
suit by four current or past employees from being extended to cover 
1,500 black salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.S. District Court Judge Richard Story left open the  
possibility of turning down class-action status to the lawsuit as 
the case evolves. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a danger of reading too much into this, because all  
issues still must be resolved and a full and complete record must 
be created before I can make a decision on class action,'' Story 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which was filed April 22, alleges Coca-Cola pays  
black employees less, offers them fewer promotions and gives them 
lower performance evaluation scores than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers are seeking class-action status for the  
suit, which would then cover about 1,500 black salaried corporate 
employees. Lead attorney Cyrus Mehri told the judge that in 
addition to the four who are now suing Coke, 100 other potential 
clients already have contacted his office. 
</P>
<P>
	He also submitted to the court a confidential document from  
Coca-Cola that Mehri said shows potential discriminatory policies 
within Coke. The document was obtained as part of the 
evidence-gathering known as the discovery process, and the judge 
has ruled that such material from Coke should not be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's ruling cleared the way for a discovery process that  
could stretch into next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Story's action is ``important because this institution of the  
old South will be called to task for taking civil rights back in 
time,'' Mehri said. ``But we are sobered by the fact that this is 
not time for a victory dance, but a time to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke turned over 15,000 documents and a computer database on  
July 1. Plaintiffs' lawyers have 90 days to file a petition for 
class-action status. But they have argued that since they can't 
decipher the computerized records and because not all the requested 
documents have been turned over, the discovery period has not 
officially started. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke lawyers repeated arguments Thursday that since the suit  
asks for compensatory and punitive damages as well as a court order 
to stop alleged discriminatory practices, the case does not meet 
federal criteria for class-action status. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead Coca-Cola lawyer William Clineburg declined comment after  
the hearing, but Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said while the company 
was ``disappointed with the ruling ... we still recognize that it 
is a first step in a long legal process that will show that 
Coca-Cola has not in this case and does not discriminate.''

<HEADLINE> New York Times Earnings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. reported an 11 percent  
rise in second-quarter income on higher advertising revenue and 
lower newsprint prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday it earned $83.5 million, or 47  
cents per share, in its second quarter. The results did not include 
a $4 million pre-tax charge for expenses related to staff 
reductions at The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period a year ago, the company earned $75 million,  
or 38 cents a share. Excluding the effect of a one-time expense 
related to debt reduction, the year-ago profits were $78.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter rose 4 percent to $779.4 million from  
$749.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded analyst expectations of 45 cents a share,  
according to a survey by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Advertising revenues in the New York Times' newspaper business,  
which makes up 91 percent of the company's revenues, rose 6.6 
during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were strongest at The New York Times, where ad  
revenues increased 8.8 percent. Ad revenues at The Boston Globe 
also rose, posting a gain of 1.8 percent following two quarters of 
declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's total costs increased 2.7 percent in the quarter,  
mainly due to higher salaries and expenses related to a national 
expansion of The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsprint expenses for the company fell 10 percent in the  
quarter, as the average cost for the product fell 12.6 percent and 
the company increased its consumption of newsprint by 2.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from Internet-related businesses jumped 41.4 percent to  
$5.9 million compared to $4.2 million in the same period a year 
ago. The online ventures include nytimes.com, nytoday.com and 
boston.com. Unique registered users at The New York Times on the 
Web rose to 7.8 million from 6.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues slipped in the company's magazine business, which  
includes Golf Digest. The company attributed the decline to 
consolidation in the golf equipment industry and competition from 
other media outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's broadcast group, which includes eight  
network-affiliated television stations and two radio stations in 
New York City, posted an 8.1 percent increase in operating profits 
while revenues remained flat. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, the New York Times earned  
$144.9 million compared to $139.7 million in the same period a year 
earlier. Revenues rose to $1.52 billion from $1.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the company also announced it had named Lynn O.  
Matthews, publisher of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune in Florida, as 
president of the company's regional newspaper group. Matthews will 
replace James C. Weeks, who is retiring at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of the New York Times fell 25 cents to $39 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Winds Worried Stadium Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A union official said Thursday that many  
workers thought winds were too strong just before the deadly 
collapse of a giant crane being used to build the Milwaukee 
Brewers' baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Three workers were killed and five injured Wednesday when the  
567-foot crane collapsed and essentially broke in half as it was 
lowering a piece of the stadium's retractable roof in place. The 
three victims were in a basket suspended from a smaller crane 
inside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Winds were gusting to 26 mph at the time, and some workers were  
doubtful it was safe to lift the roof sections, said Brent Emons, 
business manager for Ironworkers Local 8, which represents workers 
on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not engineers. We're iron workers,'' he said. ``But we  
have a gut feeling of when we should and when we shouldn't, and 
most of our guys felt we shouldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironworkers Local 8 business representative Steve Boudreaux told  
WITI-TV in Milwaukee that he spoke with one of the victims who died 
about an hour before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim, Jerome Starr, 52, questioned whether the work should  
have been attempted, Boudreaux said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He questioned as to why we're doing this ... ,'' Boudreaux  
said. ``Why they carried on is beyond us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A medical examiner's report stated that Starr's wife said that  
she had stopped at the construction site shortly before the 
accident and was told by her husband that there had been an 
argument about whether to proceed with the roof raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff Lev Baldwin said investigators were looking at all  
possible causes, including the wind. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Larry Gardner said two ``black boxes'' in the cab of  
the giant crane recorded wind speeds and the weight being lifted, 
but mechanical problems had prevented investigators from retrieving 
the data. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the stadium's seating area was damaged.  
Brewers Vice President Laurel Prieb said it was too early to know 
whether the ballpark will still open as planned in April.

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Make Trades, Sign Karlsson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The expansion Atlanta Thrashers announced a pair  
of trades Thursday and agreed to terms with Swedish center Andreas 
Karlsson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thrashers, who appointed Curt Fraser as coach on Wednesday  
and will make their NHL debut in the fall, acquired left wing Jason 
Botterill from the Dallas Stars in exchange for defenseman Jamie 
Pushor. 
</P>
<P>
	In another deal, the Thrashers acquired right wing Martin  
Prochazka from the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a 
sixth-round draft pick in the 2001 NHL entry draft, said Don 
Waddell, the club's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The club also signed Karlsson, whose rights were acquired in a  
trade with the Calgary Flames following this year's NHL expansion 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Karlsson, 23, scored 18 goals and had 15 assists in 49 games  
last season with Leksand of the Swedish Elite League. 
</P>
<P>
	Botterill, 23, split last season with Dallas and Michigan, the  
Stars' top minor league affiliate in the International Hockey 
league. He was selected by Dallas in the first round of the 1994 
entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Pushor was acquired by the Thrashers in this year's expansion  
draft from the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prochazka, 27, played in the Czech Republic last season and was  
a member of its 1998 gold medal-winning Olympic team. He played in 
29 games with Toronto during the 1997-98 season, scoring two goals 
and four assists.

<HEADLINE> Air Traffic Controllers to Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Technicians who maintain the nation's air  
traffic control system planned to leaflet 21 airports across the 
country Friday, complaining that equipment is being rushed into 
service without sufficient testing or training. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration, which is responsible for  
ensuring the system's safety, said the labor union representing the 
10,000 technicians is merely trying to spur along stalled contract 
negotiations. The union has been without a contract since February 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We go through an extensive development and testing of  
equipment before it is even sent to the specific air traffic 
facility,'' said FAA spokesman William Shumann. 
</P>
<P>
	The Professional Airways Systems Specialists union says a ``rush  
to modernize'' the system has caused equipment outages and traffic 
delays at facilities controlling air travel in several cities, 
including Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, there have been at least six serious outages from New  
York to Seattle since January, but they have been blamed on a 
variety of causes. Among them have been power failures, faulty 
computers and software glitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Another outage on July 8 in Miami was caused when a contractor  
working on a communications system accidentally tripped circuit 
breakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem is that the Federal Aviation  
Administration is not listening to its highly skilled technicians 
about how the outages can be avoided,'' said a statement by union 
President Michael D. Fanfalone. ``The agency has also refused to 
provide appropriate staffing levels or to train employees on new 
technology so they can quickly deal with equipment failures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA says a $13 billion upgrade of the nation's air traffic  
control system now under way should reduce such problems and make 
maintenance easier. 
</P>
<P>
	Shumann, the FAA spokesman, said contract negotiations have  
bogged down over pay, job security and the amount and type of work 
that can be transferred to private contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency adamantly denied that its equipment replacements have  
jeopardized air traveler safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``On major systems, we introduce them gradually into operation  
so both the technicians and the controllers are fully aware of the 
systems and comfortable with it when we use it exclusively to 
control air traffic,'' Shumann said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also complained that leaflets distributed by the union on  
July 2 did not disclose that the union was in the midst of 
negotiating a contract with the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
	The system specialists planned to distribute leaflets in  
Atlanta; Albuquerque, N.M.; Beaumont, Texas; Buffalo, N.Y.; Corpus 
Christi, Texas; Covington, Ky.; Dallas; Houston; Indianapolis; 
Jacksonville, Fla.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Memphis, Tenn.; Nashville, 
Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Orlando, Fla.; Pittsburgh; San Antonio; 
Seattle; Tampa, Fla.; Tulsa, Okla.; and Tyler, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaflets provided the telephone number for the Capitol  
switchboard and urged readers to call their local congressman and 
register their views.

<HEADLINE> Editor &AMP; Publisher Is Sold to BPI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The owners of the privately held newspaper  
industry trade magazine Editor &AMP; Publisher have agreed to sell it 
to BPI Communications Inc., the publisher of Mediaweek and Adweek. 
</P>
<P>
	The Editor &AMP; Publisher Co., publisher of the 21,237-circulation  
weekly magazine, is unable to sustain its growth, co-publisher D. 
Colin Phillips said Thursday. The business has grown rapidly with 
acquisitions and new product launches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The properties sold to BPI include Editor &AMP; Publisher's Web  
site, its annual yearbook of publications, CD-ROMs and other 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our infrastructure is taxed to the max,'' Phillips said. ``The  
corporate resources of a strategic parent who has understood what 
we're about will help us get to the next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Phillips nor John Babcock Jr., president and chief  
executive officer of BPI, would disclose terms of the deal. The 
sale is expected to be completed in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	BPI is a subsidiary of VNU, a Dutch media company.  
</P>
<P>
	Babcock said the acquisition of the New York-based magazine  
``fits very well'' with VNU publications that cover the media, 
entertainment and design. 
</P>
<P>
	VNU reported net earnings of $292.3 million and revenue of $2.8  
billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and his brother and co-publisher Christopher Phillips,  
the third generation of the family that has owned the 115-year-old 
publication since 1912, informed 75 staff members Wednesday that 
the magazine had been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he and his brother have not decided whether they  
will remain with Editor &AMP; Publisher or seek out other projects.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires voted to resign Sept.  
2, and baseball seems happy with their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been at odds with owners and players since Roberto  
Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, claiming they don't get 
enough respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of repeated bickering and convinced the umpires  
are replaceable, sounded almost pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting in Philadelphia, saying they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 
weeks of the season. The other 11 were expected to announce their 
resignations in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, AL umpire Dale Scott said he and his colleagues aren't  
concerned that the decision to resign would be unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a job where you gain a lot of friends,'' Scott  
told ABC Sports Radio. ``It's a job you do the best you can and 
earn the respect you get from working hard every day on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually, depending on seniority. The 
deal bars strikes, so the resignations are an attempt to get around 
that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1984 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained an court 
injunction in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said the umpires' actions made him wonder if this would  
``escalate this situation to the point were it might be 
irretrievable.'' Several management officials said fans don't pay 
to see umpires, and players have never hesitated to play with 
replacement umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed higher Thursday, with oil  
stocks making a late surge to join rising telecommunications and 
media shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoying oil stocks was oil giant BP Amoco. In a presentation to  
analysts, a program of cost cuts, divestitures and investments was 
fleshed out by Chief Executive John Browne. He proposed to sell 
about $10 billion of assets and to raise capital expenditures by 
around $26 billion. BP closed up 26 pence (41 cents) at 1,285 pence 
($20.56). 
</P>
<P>
	Shell closed up 15 pence (24 cents), or 2.9 percent, and  
Paris-listed TotalFina also closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 594 European companies closed up  
3.40 points, or 1.1 percent, at 321.19, while the Dow Jones Euro 
Stoxx Index, which tracks 295 companies in countries that joined 
the euro single currency, was up 2.99 points at 337.19. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished up 38.18 points at  
3960.67, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index was up 43.98 points at 
3905.92. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was up 0.2 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	Returning from Wednesday's Bastille Day market close, the Paris  
CAC 40 index was 1.5 percent higher. Milan's MIBtel index rose 0.4 
percent, and Madrid's IBEX-35 index was up 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Merger speculation regarding Britain's three major cable  
companies excited London, where the FTSE 100 share index rose 
through the session and closed up 1.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications, which is 53 percent owned by  
Cable &AMP; Wireless, said it is continuing to discuss business 
opportunities with Telewest Communications and other telecoms 
companies.

<HEADLINE>  Reid To Square Off Against Kelly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Reid is a fighter with a golden  
future. He gets a kick out of talking about a golden moment in his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Mention The Punch, and both Reid and his trainer Al Mitchell  
still get emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference this week at Bally's Park Place to hype his  
WBA super welterweight title defense against Australian Kevin Kelly 
Friday night, neither man paid much attention to a tape of Reid's 
fights until the third round of his 1996 156-pound Olympic final 
came on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That got their undivided attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the greatest day of my life,'' Reid said Thursday.  
Needing a knockout to win, Reid knocked out Cuban Alejandro 
Duvergel with a right to the head and won a gold medal at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In his corner as head coach of the U.S. team was Mitchell, who  
has played such an important role in Reid's life that on Father's 
Day, Reid presented him with his WBA title belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably a year now from it will be worth something,'' said  
Mitchell, who hopes by then Reid will have added another title to 
the WBA 154-pound championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and Reid hope to get a fight against IBF 154-pound  
champion Fernando Vargas next spring. Vargas will defend his title 
against Raul Marque Saturday night at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to win a couple more titles,'' Mitchell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid already is scheduled defend against Keith Mullings Aug. 28  
at a site to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night in a ballroom at the Boardwalk Convention Center,  
the 25-year-old Reid, of Philadelphia (12-0, seven knockouts), will 
be making the first defense he won on a clear-cut decision over 
Laurent Boudouani of France March 6 at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good fighter,'' the 29-year-old Kelly (24-5-2, 11  
knockouts) said of Reid. ``He's very athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said Kelly has good jab and speed, but ``the only thing  
I'm concerned about is he comes in with his head. I expect a good 
fight for seven or eight rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is scheduled to start at 11 p.m., EDT, and will be  
televised by FX. The telecast is set to begin at 10 p.m. and 
include a 10-round lightweight bout John John Molina (46-6, 31 
knockouts) of Puerto Rico, a former IBF junior lightweight 
champion, and James Crayton of Las Vegas (30-9-2, 19 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the show will be a 10-round junior welterweight match  
between Hector Camacho Jr. (22-0, 12 knockouts) and Mike Cooley 
(8-11-2, three knockouts) of Omaha, Neb.

<HEADLINE> McKesson HBOC Restates Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Executives with drug and medical supplies  
wholesaler McKesson HBOC Inc. hope to put three months of turmoil 
behind them following a downward revision of the company earnings 
for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment announced Wednesday follows an exhaustive audit  
of HBOC's accounting for the past three years, which were suspected 
to be in error because of improperly reported software sales at 
HBOC, a medical software company acquired by McKesson in January. 
HBOC is now known as Healthcare Information Technology Business, or 
ITB. 
</P>
<P>
	The restatements reduced San Francisco-based McKesson HBOC's net  
income by $152.2 million or 53 cents per share for the fiscal year 
ended March 31, 1999, $25.8 million and 9 cents for 1998, and $13.5 
million and 5 cents per share for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson rose $1.12 1/2 to $32.12 1/2 in late morning  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson's board of directors last month fired Chairman Charles  
W. McCall, who was seen as most responsible for the incorrect 
earnings statements. McCall was chairman of HBO &AMP; Co. before 
McKesson bought it. Mark A. Pulido, president and chief executive 
of the merged company, and Chief Financial Officer Richard H. 
Hawkins were allowed to resign effective July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for fiscal year 1999 was $84.9 million and earnings  
were 31 cents per share on revised revenues of $30.4 billion 
compared to net income of $304.6 million and earnings of $1.10 per 
share on revised revenues of $22.4 billion for the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for fiscal year 1997 was $212.1 million and revised  
earnings were 80 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the disclosures today, and our commitment to new  
procedures and policies that aim to prevent this from happening 
again at McKessonHBOC, we can begin the process of rebuilding our 
relationships with investors and restoring credibility with the 
financial community, customers and employees,'' said John H. 
Hammergren and David L. Mahoney, newly named co-chief executive 
officers at McKesson HBOC, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of slowed growth in ITB's revenues, which the company  
attributed to an industrywide slowdown, McKesson HBOC warned its 
earnings for the first quarter ended June 30, 1999 will fall 
substantially short of a First Call survey of analysts projection 
of 49 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	McKesson HBOC also said Wednesday the U.S. Attorney's Office for  
the Northern District of California and the San Francisco District 
Office of the Securities and Exchange Commission has begun 
investigations in connection with the earnings restatements. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McKesson HBOC fell nearly 50 percent when it announced  
on April 28 it would have to restate some of its earnings reports. 
McKesson has been unable to recover.

<HEADLINE> Harness Driver Thrown From Horse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Harness driver Luc Ouellette was  
thrown from his horse, but escaped serious injury Thursday night 
before the seventh race at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Timely Scooter, the horse Ouellette was driving, crashed through  
a rail and unseated his driver. Both Ouellette and the horse 
escaped with just minor injuries. Ouellette was bruised, but was 
able to drive in the next race. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouellette, who turns 34 on July 22, was trying to get the  
3-year-old pacing colt up to the number 10 post position for the 
start of the seventh race. The colt, in his 22nd lifetime start, 
made a right turn into the rail the separates the track surface 
from the winner's circle and paddock and enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
	The force of the impact shattered the fence and sent Ouellette,  
the sport's leading money-winning driver with more than $5.3 
million in purses this year, hurled to the ground in the track's 
winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intention was to leave the gate with him,'' Ouellette said.  
``He lagged off and I tapped to keep him up with the field. 
Apparently, he saw the entrance he comes in and out of and decided 
to leave the track. I just got the wind knocked out of me. My 
colors weren't even torn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Timely Scooter suffered a minor cut on his hoof.  
</P>
<P>
	``He has a small laceration of the left rear coronary band (top  
area of hoof),'' said state veterinarian Dr. Eli Perris. 
``Otherwise, he seems normal. He was able to walk back to the 
paddock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ouellette is scheduled to drive Mystical Shark in Saturday  
night's $1 million Meadowlands Pace.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows Strong Push on Farm Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration promises to make  
elimination of foreign barriers to American farm exports the 
centerpiece of upcoming world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony Wednesday before a Senate Finance subcommittee on  
trade, administration witnesses said European efforts to sidetrack 
the upcoming round of global trade talks will not work. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, under secretary of commerce for international  
trade, called Europe's tactics the ``ABA strategy -- anything but 
agriculture,'' hoping to include so many issues for negotiators to 
tackle that nothing gets accomplished in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to reach a deal would preserve current European  
agriculture trade policies, which include high barriers blocking 
sales of many American farm products and trade-distorting 
production subsidies for their domestic crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make agriculture the centerpiece for progress in  
the round,'' Aaron told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said European  
farmers are the most protected in the world with EU programs 
accounting for 85 percent of total world spending on farm 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said U.S. negotiators will push for significant cuts in  
agricultural tariffs and the total elimination of export subsidies, 
which distort trade by driving down global prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the host for a meeting of trade ministers  
from the 134 nations that belong to the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO conference in Seattle in late November and early December 
is the expected formal launch of a new round of talks with a goal 
of further lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods, 
services and agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Emilio Navaira Returns To His Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tex-Mex singer Emilio Navaira has returned to  
his Spanish-language roots after making an unsuccessful attempt to 
make it big in the English-language country market. 
</P>
<P>
	The award-winning Texan was in Mexico City on Tuesday to promote  
his latest album ``Mi Primer Amor,'' or ``My First Love,'' which 
has 15 songs in Castellano Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do very well singing in English, but I'm not  
disappointed. In this business there are good and bad moments. What 
is important is that we have been on the scene for 10 years,'' 
Navaira said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navaira has been honored 24 times by the Tejano Music Awards and  
was nominated for a Grammy. He started his career singing alongside 
Tejana music star Selena, who was shot to death in 1995 by the head 
of her fan club. 
</P>
<P>
	Navaira credits the success of Tex-Mex music in part to Selena.  
</P>
<P>
	``Selena was and continues to be the queen of Tex-Mex,'' he  
said. ``Her support of the genre was invaluable and we owe much to 
her.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Likely To OK Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are moving toward granting  
themselves a cost-of-living pay raise exceeding $4,600 at a time 
when the economy, budget surpluses and congressional popularity are 
all surging. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid accusations of being sneaky, leaders of both parties  
planned a House debate and vote on the issue today as the chamber 
considers a bill financing the Treasury Department for the coming 
fiscal year. By law, legislators get automatic annual 
cost-of-living increases unless Congress votes against it, and the 
Treasury measure is the traditional vehicle for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's agreed it's not right to keep asking members to  
fall behind the cost of living,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a 
senior Democrat and supporter of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Most representatives and senators have earned $136,700 annually  
since January 1998. Leaders get more, with House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., earning $175,400, the same as Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.4 percent increase would take effect in January.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved its version of the Treasury bill on July 1  
without language preventing the increase or any debate on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters and opponents of the raise predicted the House would  
approve it. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chief author of the House's 
Treasury measure, agreed and said if that occurred, it would be 
``an extraordinary event'' for the increase to be blocked when 
House-Senate bargainers craft a compromise Treasury bill. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the 1990s, with huge federal deficits and an  
unpopular Congress, proposed pay raises often generated intense 
public opposition and became fodder for radio talk shows. Before 
last year, Congress had voted to block itself from getting a raise 
every year since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year's consideration comes as the country's economy is  
prospering, a three-decade string of budget deficits has melted 
into surpluses, and Congress' approval rating is at a healthy 56 
percent, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus ``takes away the argument some of us used in  
the past saying we shouldn't have any adjustment to our salaries 
until we take care of the deficit,'' said Kolbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., said he would oppose the  
increase, citing the uncertainty of long-term surplus projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have more accurate evidence of the long-term nature  
of this surplus, I think it's important for Congress to say we can 
live with a $136,700 income,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic is Pete Sepp, spokesman for the conservative  
National Taxpayers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last thing Congress should be considering right  
now, especially since taxpayers haven't yet received a single penny 
of tax reduction this year, nor any assurances spending will be 
held in check,'' Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., have  
discussed the pay boost, as have other House leaders, to make sure 
neither side will use the proposal as a partisan issue against the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker supports the  
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``All federal employees are getting a COLA,'' he said, using the  
shorthand for a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt offered the same justification.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way we treat government workers, and I think we ought  
to do this,'' he said in a brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides of the issue said the proposed increase  
has not been contentious this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``About none, aside from a few media people trying to stir it  
up,'' Kolbe said when asked how much controversy the proposal has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 law established the current mechanism for lawmakers'  
annual automatic increase, reducing the number of politically 
sensitive votes they must take on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	It also created a formula making the size of their increases  
slightly smaller than the boosts that federal employees receive. 
President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
government workers next year, while lawmakers would get 3.4 
percent, or $4,648.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo's Main Index Closed Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Taking a cue from an overnight high-technology  
rally on Wall Street, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index rose 
today for a second consecutive day. The dollar fell against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 74.00 points, or 0.40  
percent, closing at 18,431.86. On Wednesday, the average climbed 
176.77 points, or 0.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.92 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.20  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 120.59 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, trading was choppy as foreign investors  
remained enthusiastic buyers of Japanese stocks, but domestic 
financial institutions tried to lock in profits in blue-chip 
stocks, which have risen quickly this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities Japan, said he  
expects the Nikkei index to test the 18,500 mark on Friday, a level 
it last touched in September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei average was in negative territory in the morning, but  
the benchmark moved into positive territory after investors bought 
high-tech and international blue chips on dips in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	High-technology issues got a boost after the technology-rich  
Nasdaq Composite Index in New York rose 39.91, or 1.4 percent, to 
end at 2,818.14 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer-chip maker Intel Corp.'s forecast that its profit  
margins would expand in the second half of this year lifted the 
Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 765 million shares changed hands on the Tokyo  
exchange's first section, compared with Wednesday's turnover of 766 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall gain, decliners outnumbered advancers 637 to  
557, evidence of strong profit-taking pressure following recent 
sharp gains in stock prices, traders said. Meanwhile, 131 shares 
finished the day unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 14.66 points, or 0.98 percent, to finish at 
1,511.73. The TOPIX closed up 13.38 points, or 0.90 percent, the 
day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was in a seesaw game between  
Japanese importers and interbank players, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryuichi Takami, senior trader at Sanwa Bank, said the demand for  
dollars by Japanese importers remained strong and dollar sales were 
also strong on diminishing fears of the Bank of Japan intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has sold yen and bought dollars several times  
in recent week to help keep export prices low and help sustain the 
nation's fragile economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.25 yen and 121.40 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 123.54 yen, up from  
123.34 yen late today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6800 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.6600 
percent, driving its price down to 101.04 yen from 101.21 yen.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up 39.90 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced today amid further evidence that  
the economy's surprising strength still hasn't sparked rapid 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 39.90 at 11,188.00.  
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators held modest gains. The Nasdaq composite  
index was up 10.30 at 2,828.43 after rising nearly 40 points 
Wednesday to a new closing high. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index 
was up 10.15 at 1,408.32. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the start of trading, the Labor Department reported that  
consumer prices held steady in June for the second straight month -- 
the best showing since back in 1986, when prices actually fell 
three months in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had been expecting slight rise of 0.1 percent in the  
consumer price index. The data, along with Wednesday's news that 
prices at the wholesale level fell 0.1 percent in June, should help 
calm fears about an inflationary spurt back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-7 ratio on the  
New York Stock Exchange, while Nasdaq gainers led by a slimmer 
margin. NYSE volume came to 366.07 million shares, up modestly from 
Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 5.08 at 659.98, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.99 at 814.99.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Makes Light of Bush Dig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today stepped away from the  
swipe he took at George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism, 
saying he was just joking. ``I think we ought to lighten up,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was not being mean-spirited when he said  
Wednesday that a ``compassionate conservative'' is basically a 
Republican who will be polite in office, but doesn't plan to 
accomplish anything. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything I said yesterday was in complete good spirits,''  
Clinton said following a meeting with high school students on 
handgun violence. ``Everyone that was there knew that we were all 
having a very good time. ... And I think we ought to lighten up 
here on the politics and focus on the work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said even though Clinton  
insists he was joking, he obviously was delighted that he took a 
dig at Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was quite pleased with himself. That was the  
impression I got,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president had criticized Bush while addressing a Democratic  
Leadership Council meeting in Baltimore. ``This compassionate 
conservatism has a great ring to it, you know,'' Clinton said. ``It 
means, 'I like you. I do. And I'd like not to squander the surplus 
and, you know, save Social Security and Medicare for the next 
generation. ... But I just can't, and I feel terrible about it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who also was in Baltimore on Wednesday, responded that he  
is ``proud to be a compassionate conservative. I welcome the label, 
and on this ground I take my stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said, ``What part does he  
(Clinton) not understand, compassionate or conservative?'' She 
added, ``Many of the things that President Clinton claims to 
support Governor Bush has already successfully signed into law in 
Texas,'' such as protections for patients and penalties for 
gun-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he made the comments to ``cut the atmosphere a  
little bit'' and ``give us something to laugh about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us that are drawing a check ought to be doing the  
people's business now,'' Clinton said. ``You know we're going to 
have an election in November and then you'll have somebody else to 
chew on after 2001.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Unchanged in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices remained frozen in June for  
the second straight month, the best showing on inflation in 13 
years, as energy costs and airline fares dropped sharply while food 
prices held steady. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that its Consumer Price Index --  
the most closely watched gauge of inflation -- was flat in June, as 
it was in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time prices showed no increase for two straight months  
was in 1986, when for three consecutive months the CPI actually 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	June's performance was even better than economists had been  
expecting. They had been forecasting a slight rise of 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inflation remains totally absent,'' said Merrill Lynch  
economist Stan Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news on consumer prices, which followed Wednesday's  
report that prices at the wholesale level actually fell 0.1 
percent, was certain to calm fears about inflation that had been 
generated when prices at the retail and wholesale level spiked in 
April. The rise was caused by a sharp runup in prices for gasoline 
and other energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	The big jump in prices in April put the Federal Reserve on alert  
that inflationary pressures could be building and prompted the Fed 
on June 30 to nudge up interest rates for the first time in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	However, with inflation pressures now moderating, some  
economists believe Fed policy-makers will not increase rates when 
they meet again next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two big goose eggs will make it politically tough for  
the Fed to tighten at its Aug. 24'' meeting, said First Union 
economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, at midmorning, appeared buoyed by the  
remarkably tame inflation report. The Dow Jones industrial average 
was up 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In two other reports, the government said the number of  
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose sharply 
to 310,000 last week, and stockpiles held by businesses edged up 
0.3 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the increase of 11,000 in jobless claims, the nation's  
labor market was still exceptionally healthy with unemployment 
remaining near a 29-year low. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in May, the good showing on prices in June reflected a  
big drop in energy costs. Gasoline prices fell a sharp 3.2 percent 
last month, the most in more than two years. Gasoline prices were 
down 2.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The big drop in gasoline prices contributed to an overall  
decline of 1.2 percent in energy costs, which followed a 1.3 
percent drop in May and helped reverse a part of April's huge, 6.1 
percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices, meanwhile, were unchanged in June, after a sharp  
0.4 percent rise the month before. The moderation in food costs 
came even though beef prices shot up 1.5 percent -- the biggest 
increase in more than six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices were held back by big declines in prices of pork and  
fresh vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, price pressures  
remained tame as well. This ``core rate'' of inflation was up only 
0.1 percent in June, the same as May. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparel prices, meanwhile, also fell 0.4 percent last month, the  
fifth decline this year. Airline fares were down 4.8 percent, the 
largest drop in more than three years, while new-car prices edged 
down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Assets Are Down / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $407.8 million in the latest week to $870.72 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $157.8 million to $720.42 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $250 million to $150.30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds fell by $3.68 billion  
to $584.45 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets fell by $2.56 billion to $534.78 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $1.12 billion to $49.67 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.455 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.459 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was  
4.41 percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous 
week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in 
Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day average yield 
rose to 4.36 percent from 4.34 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield held at the previous week's 4.51  
percent, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 4.46 percent from 
4.43 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
58 days, up from 57 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.03 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts held steady at 0.86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.19 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.18 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.54 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.52 
percent; 4.78 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.73 percent; and 
4.94 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.92 percent.

	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Doin' The Town rallied down the  
stretch to win the $100,000 New Jersey Sire Stakes Final for 
2-year-old fillies Thursday night at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	Doin' The Town, guided by Mike Lachance, caught Cumin's Promise  
down the stretch to win by 1 1/4 lengths in 1:59. Day For Night 
finished 3 1/4 lengths back for third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I could beat that filly that made a break  
(Marita's Victory),'' Lachance said. ``She (Doin The Town) had her 
problems lately, but (trainer) Wayne (Nickells) has made some 
equipment changes. I qualified her back last week and she was good. 
Tonight, she was relaxed the whole way and she raced really easy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doin' The Town, daughter of Donerail, posted her second win in  
four starts this year with earnings of $66,750. Doin The Town was 
purchased for $42,000 at the Harrisburg Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was great,'' Nickells said. ``A couple weeks back we found  
that she had an abscess in her lower jaw and we switched her to an 
open bridle. That just turned her around. It has been like night 
and day. She is a nice filly who has a lot of ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doin' The Town paid $19.40, $10.20, $5.60. Cumin's Promise paid  
$5.60 and $4.60, and Day For Night paid $4.80.

<HEADLINE> Amish Are Subjects in Gene Testing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STRASBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Lancaster County's Amish and Mennonite  
people, the plain folk who mostly live, work and dress the way they 
did during the 19th century, are nevertheless serving as test 
subjects in one of the most advanced areas of medicine -- gene 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists hope to learn more about genetic diseases by studying  
members of the insular community, people who often ride in 
horse-drawn buggies and don't have electricity but are willing to 
climb into an MRI machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can see how it could be confusing if you don't understand  
our beliefs,'' said Leon Newswanger, a Mennonite whose son will be 
one of the first participants in human trials of a new gene 
therapy. ``But if we don't do whatever it takes, if we know what 
could help -- then that is worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish and Mennonites, known as the Plain community for their  
simple, dark clothes and rural way of life, have a higher rate of 
certain inherited diseases than other people. 
</P>
<P>
	They have become instrumental in genetic research because the  
estimated 75,000 sect members are descended from just 47 families. 
The sects have been providing blood samples and family histories to 
geneticists for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, scientists have studied Ashkenazi Jews, Cajuns in  
Louisiana and other groups with a high degree of genetic 
uniformity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amish people know the reality of genetic diseases and so any  
advances are welcomed,'' said Dr. Holmes Morton, who opened the 
Clinic for Special Children in the heart of Pennsylvania's Amish 
country in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	It is one of the most advanced gene research clinics in the  
country, situated in a timber-frame house surrounded by fields 
plowed by mules. 
</P>
<P>
	Newswanger's son, Marlin, and two other children from Morton's  
clinic will be the first subjects in a test of a process called 
chimeraplasty, which involves tricking the body into correcting a 
gene mutation. If successful, the technique could be used to treat 
up to 80 percent of all genetic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	All three children are stricken with Crigler-Najjar, a rare  
liver disease that is more common among Amish and Mennonites. About 
300 people worldwide have Crigler-Najjar; 16 trace their roots to 
Lancaster's Plain sects and are being treated by Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	Crigler children suffer severe jaundice and must sleep under  
special rehabilitating lights for up to 16 hours a day to prevent 
deadly brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, Morton treats hundreds of children with more than 70  
rare genetic diseases, and many regularly undergo MRIs and 
complicated blood tests and may be hospitalized for months at a 
time. Some children must be fed special formulas and vitamins -- 
another contrast in a community where nearly all the food is 
homegrown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what it takes to keep him alive,'' said Glenda Groff,  
a Mennonite whose 8-year-old son has a genetic disorder called 
maple syrup urine disease, which is fatal without a proper diet. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease -- extremely rare in the general population but more  
common among Mennonites -- prevents the body from processing certain 
amino acids, which then become toxic. One of the symptoms is urine 
that smells like maple sugar. 
</P>
<P>
	With the opening of Morton's clinic, many Amish and Mennonite  
have shed their traditional fatalism about disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a perception in the Plain community that some things  
are a fact of life,'' said Rebecca Smoker, an Amish worker at 
Morton's clinic. ``For years, these children lived their short 
little lives and died without any medical person seeing them 
because everybody knew they were going to die.''

<HEADLINE> Mary Kay Convention Opens in Dallas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- They dream of one day driving a pink Cadillac.  
``Positive'' is their adjective of choice. And when Mary Kay 
cosmetics disciples mention the company's founder, they may get a 
little misty. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just an incredible woman,'' gushed Karen Irwin of St.  
Louis. ``Unfortunately, I haven't met her. I mean, I feel like I 
have. From a distance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 40,000 Mary Kay makeup sellers have converged on  
Dallas this week from all around the country for this summer's 
two-week, 14-hotel convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Kay Ash herself doesn't make it to the national meetings  
these days. A plucky Texan who built the direct-sales company 30 
years ago, the aging Ms. Ash is recovering from a stroke and a 
broken leg. But her framed photos cast serene gazes over the Dallas 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The manicured fingers of Mary Kay reach far. The company has  
representatives in 29 countries, including Russia and China. Last 
year, 500,000 Mary Kay vendors sold more than $1 billion worth of 
merchandise worldwide, according to spokeswoman Shelley Whiddon. 
</P>
<P>
	The women who pay their $100 fee to join the Mary Kay sales  
force are handed a mantra, a set of priorities and a prescribed 
mental outlook along with the standard case of creams and powders. 
They must wear skirts or dresses. They must not drink or smoke. 
They must tell themselves, over and over, ``I am making other 
people's lives better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big sales bring lavish rewards -- diamond bar pins, diamond  
rings, cars and the ultimate prize: the pink Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is struggling to shed its image as a work force for  
housewives only. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have this image of big, blond hair,'' said Ms. Irwin, a  
former corporate executive whose brown hair is cropped short. ``But 
we're teachers, CPAs, financial directors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two marriages, a stint running a metaphysics bookstore and  
a few years driving a Federal Express truck, Sally Fairbanks of 
Orlando, Fla., joined the Mary Kay sales force. She liked the idea 
of setting her own hours, pulling down high pay and working outside 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Women have come full circle,'' Ms. Fairbanks said,  
speedwalking into the convention center in a crush of perfumed 
women. ``We've got it all. Now we want to give some of it back.''

<HEADLINE> Hoechst Chemicals Jobs Will Be Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP)-- Hoechst AG's industrial chemicals business, which  
is being spun off into a separate company later this year, plans to 
eliminate 1,000 of its 17,000 jobs to cut costs, a company official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts will be completed by the end of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	German drugmaker Hoechst is unloading its industrial chemical  
business as part of its proposed merger with French pharmaceutical 
firm Rhone-Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
	The industrial chemical businesses will be combined into a new  
company called Celanese AG that will be formed later this year. It 
has operations across Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokeswoman said it is unclear yet where the job cuts  
will occur. In the United States, Hoechst's chemical's operations 
are in Texas and the Southeast. The company also has administrative 
jobs in New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> British Open Course Brutal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- One after one, they came trudging  
off the 18th green at the Carnoustie Golf Links, moaning about the 
tiny slivers of fairways and the deep rough that swallowed ball 
after ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Days of battling winds, rain and chill spurred talk of scores in  
the 90s in the British Open, which begins today. Players worried 
privately about being embarrassed by a links course set up longer 
and narrower than any before. 
</P>
<P>
	Through it all, though, they agreed on one thing: Someone will  
stand holding with the claret jug Sunday, no matter how ugly this 
championship gets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of whether an individual player likes or dislikes  
the golf course, they haven't stopped giving out a trophy come 
Sunday,'' David Duval said. ``Whether you think it is fair, unfair, 
too hard, too easy, somebody is going to take home the claret 
jug.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first British Open at Carnoustie since Tom Watson won the  
first of his five titles in 1975 was never supposed to be easy. 
Carnoustie has never given up par willingly, even when the weather 
cooperates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the course was stretched this time around to 7,361 yards at  
par 71 and fairways narrowed to 12 yards wide in some points. A wet 
spring surprised even officials from the Royal &AMP; Ancient by growing 
the rough up to 12 inches in some places. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the R&AMP;A is offering any apologies. Far from it. The  
rough is what it is, period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would feel seriously guilty if we had deliberately set out  
to grow wheat fields off the edge of the fairways,'' said Hugh 
Campbell, chairman of the championship committee. ``That has not 
been the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intentional or not, the rough threatens to turn this Open into a  
battle for survival, where placing balls in the fairway takes 
priority and where greens will have to be approached with long 
irons because players are afraid to hit drivers off the tee. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a setup that would seem to favor longer hitters like Tiger  
Woods, who can hit 2-irons or 3-woods off the tee and hit fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's a tremendous advantage in any tournament,  
period,'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so, counters Greg Norman, who believes Carnoustie is so  
penal that it plays no favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this golf course basically takes away the strength of  
everybody,'' Norman said. ``This golf course doesn't allow you to 
play to your strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Talk about the golf course so dominated the days leading up to  
the Open that a number of subplots were almost lost along with it. 
</P>
<P>
	And the public talk didn't even match what was being whispered  
among the players themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably all minor compared to what we're actually  
saying on the putting green and the driving range,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is the hottest golfer here, with three wins in his last  
four starts, and newly minted pro Sergio Garcia isn't far behind 
after winning the Irish Open two weeks ago and finishing second at 
Loch Lomond last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is still searching for his first major, and Mark O'Meara  
is back defending the second he won last year. Phil Mickelson is 
playing well, and Payne Stewart figures if his game is suited to 
win the U.S. Open, it can win under course conditions that are very 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to come here and play poorly,'' Stewart said. ``I  
won't accept that. I want to come in and perform the way that Payne 
Stewart is capable of playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Stewart couldn't resist a few shots of his own at the  
course. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to make a lot of money when they cut and bale  
this hay out here, because the cows are going to eat very good this 
year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, now the No. 2 player in the world behind Woods after  
fading at the Masters and U.S. Open, played practice rounds Monday 
and Tuesday, but did not venture out on the course Wednesday as 
gusty winds wreaked havoc on the final practice day. 
</P>
<P>
	While others fretted, Duval said he didn't want to think about  
how tough the course will play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying not to expend much energy thinking about what it is  
going to be like,'' Duval said. ``It's going to be hard. It is 
going to beat up on everybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said it was never meant to be easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, the rough is now a real hazard, but that is  
an issue that the top players in the world will recognize and they 
will accommodate that,'' Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, he said, players might surprised by how they deal with  
the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the top players in the world actually enjoy the  
challenge,'' Campbell said.

<HEADLINE> Is Ventura News or Entertainment? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's return to the  
wrestling ring blends politics and entertainment in a novel fashion 
and, as a result, gave cable news networks an interesting test of 
how it defined news. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC's Laura Ingraham brought presidential contender John  
McCain on to talk about his campaign Wednesday, and he found 
himself competing for air time with pictures of Ventura in a 
feather boa and jewel-studden sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
	Like MSNBC, Fox News Channel aired live coverage of Ventura's  
announcement that he'll referee a World Wrestling Federation match 
next month. CNN ignored it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can do news events and still have fun,'' John Moody, Fox  
News Channel's vice president for news, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fox commentator Dick Morris, called the event ``a ritual  
political suicide ... In the last 15 minutes, this man has 
destroyed his political career,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's interview with Ingraham about his campaign was preceded  
by Ventura's news conference. McCain was answering a question about 
Ventura's political future when MSNBC switched back to the news 
conference, leaving the Arizona senator looking slightly perturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN thought Ventura's announcement wasn't particularly  
newsworthy, spokesman Earl Casey said. CNN was covering the arrest 
of a suspect in the railroad killer case and Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak's visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our decision at the time to give more topical  
information to our viewers,'' Casey said. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN was also queasy about airing live video provided by the WWF  
to promote a pay-per-view event. CNN founder Ted Turner's TNT 
network also telecast World Championship Wrestling events, and the 
WCW is the WWF's competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody admitted Fox considered whether it was being used to  
promote an event but thought he couldn't pass up the event. Fox 
used the WWF's video. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesse Ventura is a political phenomenon,'' he said. ``There is  
no other way to describe him. To come from his background and be 
elected governor is a political rarity. Therefore, he's 
newsworthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had its own news crew at Ventura's announcement, said Bob  
Epstein, MSNBC executive producer. He said covering the event was a 
perfect fit with Ingraham's show, which tries to mix politics and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really did show how these lines have been crossed and  
merged into one,'' Epstein said.

<HEADLINE> The Boss Kicks Off American Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- The Boss is back in town.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Springsteen kicked off his American tour Thursday night  
with a sold-out concert, the first in a 15-night stand at New 
Jersey's Continental Airlines Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen, who has been recording solo in recent years, has  
reunited with his E Street band for his first tour with them in 11 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour was also a reunion for fans Doug North of Morris Plains  
and pal Drew Santucci from Stanhope, who were among the fans 
milling around the parking lot hours before the 8 p.m. show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful to get back together and remember how it was  
when we wore younger men's clothes,'' said Santucci, 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Horvath, 21, was seeing Springsteen for the first time.  
His high school basketball coach introduced him to the music when 
he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the way he dances. He gets so into his own music and  
it's really easy to relate to. He talks about stuff that everybody 
knows,'' Horvath said. 
</P>
<P>
	To celebrate the Freehold native's return and give early  
arrivals a fun way to kill time, the New Jersey Sports and 
Exposition Authority created a mini-boardwalk in the parking lot. 
It had volleyball courts, carnival games, stands selling 
sausage-and-pepper sandwiches and a DJ cranking out Springsteen 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans snatched up 308,000 tickets for the 15 New Jersey shows  
from Thursday to Aug. 12. The 15-night stand in a single arena sets 
an industry record, breaking Springsteen's own mark of 11 shows in 
East Rutherford in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Springsteen and his band have hit the road  
since a 1988 tour for Amnesty International. They have already 
finished a 17-city European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	After the New Jersey shows, they move on to Detroit, Boston,  
Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the last great rock 'n' roll tour of the century,'' said  
Robert Santelli, a vice president at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
and Museum in Cleveland. ``He embodied a whole lot of New Jersey 
culture in his music. ... He gave a sense of pride to a lot of 
young people.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Falkland Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomes the agreement  
Britain and Argentina reached to reduce tension over the Falkland 
Islands, press secretary Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the accord demonstrated ``the determination of both  
Argentina and the United Kingdom to work cooperatively and 
constructively to promote the well-being and stability of the 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain and Argentina agreed Wednesday on a package of measures  
that included lifting a ban on Argentines visiting the islands, 
resuming direct flights from Chile and cooperating on fish 
preservation in the South Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures marked the most significant thaw in relations  
between the two nations since they went to war over the islands 
that Argentina calls the Malvinas in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. statement referred to both the Falklands and the  
Malvinas. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton congratulated British Prime Minister Tony  
Blair and Argentine President Carlos Menem for reaching the 
agreement.

<HEADLINE> China: Fast Economic Growth Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China's economy grew by 7.6 percent in the first  
half of 1999, a state newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report in the China Economic Times said growth slowed  
substantially in the April-June period from the 8.3 percent rate 
reported for the first quarter, and said ``the situation is 
serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said fixed asset investment, exports, consumption and prices  
all were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing is spending heavily on highway building and other public  
works, trying to stimulate demand that is so weak that consumer 
prices have fallen steadily for the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was scheduled to release official economic growth  
figures and other statistics on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	China reported economic growth of 7.8 percent last year, and set  
a target of 7 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The China Economic Times said industrial production in the first  
half of the year was up 9.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited figures given by Liu Hong, director of the State  
Statistical Bureau, in a presentation to Chinese legislators 
Wednesday in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Milosevic Front Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- When Slobodanka Vojinovic heard that  
Serbia's most powerful opposition leader plans to launch his own 
wave of anti-government rallies, she rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything,'' said the 31-year-old office worker,  
her voice weary. ``It's all the same as before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Not Again!'' response by the Serbs to a flood of protest  
rallies announced by various opposition groups is typical. Despite 
an overwhelming popular feeling that President Slobodan Milosevic 
should be ousted, most Serbs believe opposition leaders should go 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like any of them,'' declares Dragan Milovanovic, a  
photographer. ``Things have reached rock bottom, we need new 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Milovanovic, 32, pro-democracy leader Zoran Djindjic is an  
``actor.'' Another leader, Vuk Draskovic, is a little better, but 
still not good enough. Frowning, Milovanovic tries hard to remember 
a politician he likes: ``I've heard something good about 
somebody,'' he mutters, his voice trailing away into silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb skepticism about their pro-democracy leaders stems from the  
opposition's past performance. Instead of uniting to exploit 
massive anti-government feelings and protests to remove Milosevic 
from power, they feuded among themselves at crucial times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade of Milosevic's rule, Serbs rose up against  
him four times, enduring police beatings and other hardship. But 
each of the protests collapsed, mainly because the opposition 
leaders were divided or they decided to make a deal with Milosevic. 
Their credibility now is near zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Serbia's defeat by NATO and virtual loss of Kosovo to  
the ethnic Albanian majority, discontent with Milosevic's rule is 
greater than ever. But trust in the opposition remains low. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome any anti-Milosevic activity, but I also wish they  
(the opposition) had some kind of strategy, some vision,'' lamented 
Dusan Stojkovic, 29. ``I wish there was more coordination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the main pro-democracy group, the Alliance for Change,  
has held rallies throughout Serbia, campaigning for Milosevic's 
resignation. Thousands have attended the protests, leading to 
expectations that they would grow. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest protests, some 5,000 people gathered  
Wednesday in the northern city of Subotica and clashed briefly with 
pro-government supporters before dispersing. The anti-Milosevic 
demonstration was called by the Alliance for Change and a coalition 
of local parties. 
</P>
<P>
	More violence was reported today in Belgrade, where  
pro-democracy activists said they were attacked while organizing a 
petition for Milosevic's ouster. Dragan Kopcalic, of the Democratic 
Party, said three people were hospitalized and one activist, 
Slobodan Djodjevic, was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Draskovic with a now familiar move. On Tuesday, he  
announced separate protest rallies, with the first one to be held 
in Kragujevac on Saturday, only two days after the Alliance for 
Change plans its own rally in the same town. 
</P>
<P>
	Another opposition group planned protest in the northern town of  
Subotica today. Daily protests are being held in the southern city 
of Leskovac and a series of separate anti-Milosevic demonstrations 
planned into August is making it hard even for protesters to keep 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome all actions against the government,'' Slobodan  
Vuksanovic from the Alliance for Change commented on Draskovic's 
decision to hold rallies. ``But we must be very careful not to 
disperse people's energy and patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic's decision to rejoin the protest movement has left  
some Serbs shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic in the past led the most massive anti-Milosevic  
protests, but joined the Milosevic-led government earlier this year 
only to be kicked out after criticizing the Serb leader's hardline 
policies during the NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	His constant vacillation has cost Draskovic in terms of popular  
support. But the bearded writer-turned-politician is still believed 
to be the one most capable of mounting serious anti-government 
demonstrations. And the fact that he was fired by Milosevic during 
the NATO bombing has helped him regain some of his former 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sociologist Boza Jaksic says all political figures must go --  
whether governing or in the opposition -- ``so that a democratic 
change could happen in Serbia.'' He says current opposition leaders 
``do not carry democratic potential'' because they are identified 
with past failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful protests of the past months were spontaneous,  
without input from any established political group. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western town of Valjevo, the citizens said they were  
protesting against both the government and the ``incompetent 
opposition.''

<HEADLINE> Emilio Navaira Returns To His Roots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tex-Mex singer Emilio Navaira has returned to  
his Spanish-language roots after making an unsuccessful attempt to 
make it big in the English-language country market. 
</P>
<P>
	The award-winning Texan was in Mexico City on Tuesday to promote  
his latest album ``Mi Primer Amor,'' or ``My First Love,'' which 
has 15 songs in Castellano Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't do very well singing in English, but I'm not  
disappointed. In this business there are good and bad moments. What 
is important is that we have been on the scene for 10 years,'' 
Navaira said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navaira has been honored 24 times by the Tejano Music Awards and  
was nominated for a Grammy. He started his career singing alongside 
Tejana music star Selena, who was shot to death in 1995 by the head 
of her fan club. 
</P>
<P>
	Navaira credits the success of Tex-Mex music in part to Selena.  
</P>
<P>
	``Selena was and continues to be the queen of Tex-Mex,'' he  
said. ``Her support of the genre was invaluable and we owe much to 
her.''

<HEADLINE> Montgomery Ward Bankruptcy Exit OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Montgomery Ward &AMP; Co., the nation's  
seventh-largest department store chain, won approval Thursday to 
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after the venerable retailer appeared headed for  
extinction, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Peter Walsh gave the go-ahead for 
Wards to do its business without protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards would distribute more than $650 million to unsecured  
creditors, amounting to about 28 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its restructuring, the company also agreed earlier to  
sell its profitable Signature Group direct marketing unit to GE 
Capital Inc., its single largest creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company in the past few years has sold or  
shuttered unprofitable stores and embarked on an ambitious makeover 
strategy that has brought more customers back into its remaining 
252 full-line stores.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G, University Research Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Scientists from Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and the  
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine will collaborate in 
obesity research that P&AMP;G is supporting with up to $5 million, the 
medical school announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The project is designed to provide a better understanding of how  
appetite-controlling neurotransmitters in the brain help control 
eating and body weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers said they hope to learn why higher-fat diets can  
increase body weight and if the body becomes more efficient in 
storing fat when given a steady diet of higher-fat foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Woods, director of the university's Obesity Research  
Center, said the researchers want to find out why a high-fat diet 
can cause a person to eat more and become obese, and learn how body 
fat may alter the secretion of hormones that affect hunger. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, a professor of psychiatry, said the scientists plan  
experiments to examine several hormones that influence food intake 
and body weight through their interaction with each other and on 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the National Institutes of Health, obesity is  
second only to cigarette smoking as a cause of preventable deaths 
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Berkeley Station Rocked by Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- In 50 colorful years at the forefront of  
radical radio, KPFA has had Alan Ginsberg ``Howl,'' played sound 
bites from Patty Hearst and unleashed the counterculture couplets 
of The Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the voices raised in protest at KPFA were its own.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to stay here as long as we need to make sure they  
don't steal our marvelous and scrappy, unpredictable radio 
station,'' show host Dennis Bernstein told a crowd of several 
hundred demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, who was yanked off the air Tuesday night, was joined  
at the rally by ``The Color Purple'' author Alice Walker, who 
called KPFA ``the voice that reaches us and the voice that speaks 
for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dissent at KPFA has built since the dismissal of popular general  
manager Nicole Sawaya in April. A management edict that the issue 
not be discussed on-air set the stage for a series of showdowns 
that resulted in staff firings and the arrests of protesters for 
trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
	Disaffected staffers and their supporters charge that nonprofit  
parent company Pacifica Foundation is trying to force KPFA into a 
more conventional mold to attract corporate donations. They also 
believe there is a move afoot -- managers deny it -- to sell KPFA, 
which has a powerful 59,000-watt signal that reaches across the 
northern half of California. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people have come in and have stolen the station,'' said  
Lavarn Williams, part of the group that kicked off the day of 
protest outside the station Wednesday. ``Instead of free speech, 
they want government-controlled speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams is a consultant brought in to help KPFA -- one of  
the nation's oldest listener-supported stations -- celebrate its 
50th anniversary. Instead, she was caught up in an escalating 
series of clashes over KPFA's soul. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest has gotten so bad that on Wednesday, the doors were  
locked and managers were playing tapes of old shows. ``Everyone at 
KPFA has been placed on administrative leave until we're able to 
cool things off,'' said Pacifica spokeswoman Elan Fabbri. 
</P>
<P>
	KPFA, founded by World War II conscientious objectors, plays a  
mix of music, public affairs and educational programming. The 
station claims to have been the first to play the Grateful Dead. 
Over the years, it also broadcast poet Ginsberg reading his seminal 
``Howl'' and Patty Hearst, the kidnapped newspaper heiress, 
denouncing her parents as ``capitalist pigs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, a number of power struggles have been waged for  
control of the station. Ms. Fabbri said ``there is no attempt to 
`corporatize.' That's a nice little buzzword that's been thrown 
into this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest fracas heated up Tuesday night, when Bernstein, host  
of a public affairs program called ``Flashpoints,'' was pulled off 
the air for talking about conflicts with the station's management. 
That violated orders not to report on tensions between KPFA and its 
parent company, Ms. Fabbri said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein was told he was being put on administrative leave  
after his program ended, but his ensuing tussle with Pacifica 
guards was heard on the air. ``Those are my personal papers!'' 
Bernstein was heard yelling. ``Don't go into my desk!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Management cut off the newscast and, in a quintessentially  
Berkeley moment, replaced the evening news with a taped 
Marxist-Maoist analysis of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernstein, seven other KPFA employees and more than 40  
protesters were arrested Tuesday night for trespassing after they 
refused to leave the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm flabbergasted that I would be pulled from the air by  
people who founded the station to stand as a bastion of free 
speech,'' Bernstein said. ``This is an absolute case of 
censorship.''

<HEADLINE> Future of Milwaukee Stadium Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A lighted numeric sign has counted down the  
days until the Milwaukee Brewers open Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The display, visible from the freeway that runs past both County  
Stadium and the new park, read 261 on Wednesday. After an accident 
killed three workers and seriously damaged the new stadium, the 
display was dark Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not. We  
could just as likely be opening on time as not opening on time,'' 
said Brewers spokesman Laurel Prieb, the husband of team president 
Wendy Selig-Prieb and son-in-law of baseball commissioner Bud 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	A 567-foot crane collapsed while lifting a piece of the  
retractable roof Wednesday, crushing another crane and landing 
heavily on the first-base side of the $400 million ballpark. Winds 
were gusting to 26 mph at the time of the crane collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite several hundred tons of smashed, mangled structure,  
the Brewers insisted plans to open the ballpark next April haven't 
been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	Prieb said the team is playing ``a very secondary role in what  
is going on'' in the investigation of the accident. The team's most 
pressing concerns are financial burdens and public relations 
problems that delays might cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the main concerns are finding replacements for  
the crane and for the roof pieces, which are made with a type of 
steel manufactured only in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers' current home, County Stadium, is next to the new  
ballpark, and Milwaukee postponed Thursday's game against the 
Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a family in the Brewers organization and in the  
Milwaukee community,'' Brewers outfielder Jeromy Burnitz said. 
``The workers at Miller Park are a part of our family, and this 
loss has affected us all very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that County Stadium is completely safe.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a dangerous area for when they start picking  
things up, but it won't affect the activity in the other 
ballpark,'' fire chief Larry Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the team has planned its marketing and  
publicity agendas around Miller Park's existence. The team's slogan 
for the current season is ``Bringing Down the House,'' and County 
Stadium was scheduled for demolition this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team faces the prospect of remaining in County Stadium  
in 2000 and even beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Any delay in opening the ballpark would deprive the Brewers of  
millions of dollars in revenue. Fortunately for the Brewers, the 
Miller Park project is thoroughly insured, members of the stadium's 
board of directors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has $325 million in property insurance and $70  
million in liability insurance, with a deductible of $25,000, board 
member Bill Duckett said. The policy also contains a rider covering 
actual lost income sustained by the Brewers if the stadium is 
unable to open on time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay large premiums for policies like this, and you hope  
you'll never have to use them,'' board chair Bob Trunzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in five counties surrounding the stadium have paid a  
0.1 percent stadium sales tax since 1996 to help fund the project. 
A recent audit concluded the tax must remain in effect until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who put the team in trust when he became commissioner  
last July, traveled to Seattle on Thursday for the opening of 
Safeco Field and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Emons, business manager for Ironworkers Local 8 which  
represents workers on the project, said some workers were doubtful 
it was safe to do the lift Wednesday because of the winds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not engineers. We're iron workers. But we have a gut  
feeling of when we should and when we shouldn't, and most of our 
guys felt we shouldn't,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> No Charges Against Morgan Stanley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- No criminal charges will be filed against anyone  
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the investment firm that was accused 
of paying $10,000 to an informant who allegedly set up a fired 
employee to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manhattan district attorney's office said Wednesday that its  
investigation showed that Morgan Stanley officials used poor 
judgment but broke no laws in the case of Christian Curry, the 
discharged employee. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 25, worked for Morgan Stanley as a real estate analyst  
from July 1997 until he was fired in April 1998. He says he 
suffered harassment and bigotry almost the entire time and has sued 
the firm for $1.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Firm officials said they fired Curry for expense account abuses,  
but Curry says they fired him because he is black and because they 
thought he was homosexual after nude photos of him appeared in a 
gay men's magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry also says Morgan Stanley told lies about him and then had  
him arrested. His arrest resulted from a ``confidential informant'' 
telling Morgan Stanley, and then the Police Department, that Curry 
was planning to plant racist and homophobic e-mail messages in the 
company's computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail allegedly would have been designed to support Curry's  
wrongful termination lawsuit against Morgan Stanley, spokesman 
Wayne Brison of District Attorney Robert Morgenthau's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The informant, Charles Joseph Leuthke, set up a meeting last  
Aug. 20 between Curry and an undercover police officer posing as a 
computer hacker. At that meeting, Brison said, Curry gave the 
officer $200 to effect the plan and promised him a cut of any money 
from his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry was then arrested and charged with forgery, coercion and  
computer trespass. But prosecutors became concerned about the 
credibility of Leuthke and Morgan Stanley officials and dropped the 
charges against Curry after the investment firm quietly wired 
$10,000 into a Leuthke bank account. 
</P>
<P>
	Brison said the investigation showed no indication that Morgan  
Stanley tried to hide its payment to Leuthke. 
</P>
<P>
	And its failure to tell prosecutors about its contacts with  
Leuthke ``was due to its inexperience in dealing with law 
enforcement officials and a lack of appreciation for the effect the 
failure to disclose might have in a criminal case,'' Brison said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Leuthke has been charged with criminal possession of  
a forged instrument and aggravated harassment; those charges are 
still pending, Brison said.

<HEADLINE> Studio Chairmen, Co-CEOS Said Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Warner Bros. co-Chairmen Robert Daly and  
Terry Semel, the longest-serving studio heads in Hollywood, have 
announced they will be leaving the organization by year's end, 
according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The two made the announcement Wednesday at a board meeting at  
Time Warner Inc.'s New York headquarters, The Hollywood Reporter 
trade paper said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Their departure comes just as the studio rolls out its  
high-profile movie, Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Time Warner spokesman did not immediately return a phone call  
early today. Time Warner owns the Warner Bros. film and television 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
	Their jobs as studio and music heads raised the question of  
whether their duties were spread too thin to the detriment of the 
film division. But last winter when Time Warner's earnings nearly 
quadrupled, Chairman Gerald Levin staunchly defended their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner's strong second quarter results recently got a boost with  
the success of features like the science-fiction action film ``The 
Matrix,'' starring Keanu Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood Reporter quoted unidentified sources saying that  
Levin was ``very understanding'' when he learned that Daly would 
not renew his contract. Semel's contract was up earlier this summer 
and he had been planning to renegotiate it after this week's 
opening of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two have worked closely for nearly two decades. Daly arrived  
at the Burbank studio in 1980 after serving as chief programmer for 
CBS. Semel worked for both Disney and CBS. He joined Warners' 
distribution division in 1975 and worked his way up in the company.

<HEADLINE> Oracle Plans Boston-Area Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Software giant Oracle Corp. has announced plans to  
expand its area operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle, the No. 1 maker of database software, is looking for a  
new site in the Boston area to build a new facility for 975 
employees already located in the region, plus 1,000 new employees 
the company plans to hire over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle's East Coast telephone operations and one of its largest  
development facilities are already located in Boston. A 273-person 
center operated by Oracle in Nashua, N.H., will not be affected by 
the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Oracle Corp. has recently shifted its focus from database  
software to Internet- and customer service-related software 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the company acquired Concord-based E-Travel, Inc. for  
$35 million. E-Travel makes software that allows consumers to book 
business trips on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to become an e-business as fast as we can,''  
Oracle CEO Jeffrey Henley told The Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also is moving forward to challenge arch rival  
Microsoft Corp.'s dominance of the operating systems market. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Oracle and Sun Microsystems Inc., maker of business  
computers, announced a pact to sell new business computers 
developed to blunt the dominance of Microsoft's operating software. 
The companies plan to use a combination of Oracle's software and 
Sun's computers to make a business computer that won't require the 
use of an operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun Microsystems has a $250 million East Coast base located in  
Burlington.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Firefighters in helicopters pulled stranded  
hikers from the tops of trailside bathrooms and rescued pigs in 
wheelbarrows Thursday as monsoon rains pounded Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	The Catalina Mountains in southern Arizona were hit the hardest  
as 6 inches of rain fell overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, a 7-foot wall of water rushed through Sabino  
Canyon, a popular camping spot, snapping small trees in half. 
Several hikers hid inside public toilets and were later stranded as 
the water spilled over the cemented trails. 
</P>
<P>
	A rescue helicopter eventually plucked the hikers from the tops  
of the wilderness bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Downstream, a narrow creek swelled to a half-mile across. Rescue  
crews grabbed two women who had taken cover on top of a barn as the 
current got stronger. Then in two feet of water, firefighters 
grabbed three oversized gray pigs and pushed them to safety in 
wheelbarrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those weren't trained pigs, they just didn't jump in there,''  
George Good, district chief with Tucson Rural Metro, said with a 
laugh. ``They were screaming and making all sorts of noise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rushing water washed away large sections of Catalina  
Highway, the only paved road up or down the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, about 400 miles to the north, heavy rains swamped  
the Grand Canyon. Loosened boulders dropped on four hikers, who 
were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in northern Wisconsin, major highways were flooded  
Thursday by a storm that dumped up to 9 inches of rain. No injuries 
were reported.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Hit by Pitch, Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Cal Ripken was hit by a pitch in the wrist  
Thursday night and removed from the Baltimore Orioles' game against 
the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was batting against Mike Thurman in the second inning  
when a pitch struck him on the right wrist. He winced in pain and 
trotted to first base, where he kicked the bag in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was diagnosed as a bruise.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripken stayed in the game and scored a run, but was replaced at  
third base by Jeff Reboulet in the top of the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an incident might have drawn huge headlines a year ago,  
when Ripken was in the midst of his record streak of 2,632 
consecutive games. But he voluntarily ended that streak last 
September and earlier this year spent several weeks on the disabled 
list with back spasms. 
</P>

night.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Workers Can Seek Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The administration is moving to let employees  
of private contractors seek federal compensation for diseases 
related to beryllium exposure while they worked at government 
nuclear weapons plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Proposed legislation to allow such claims was to be outlined by  
administration officials today, with President Clinton expected to 
also announce that the National Economic council will lead an 
inter-agency study on whether illnesses other than those related to 
beryllium should be included. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today and The New York Times reported on the plan in today's  
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The new compensation plan is modeled on existing programs for  
federal employees that enable them to submit claims for lost wages 
and medical and rehabilitation costs associated with job exposure 
to toxic substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Although private contract employees made up the vast majority of  
the workforce at the nuclear facilities, they heretofore have not 
been ineligible to apply for federal compensation. Moreover, they 
generally have been unable to collect under state worker 
compensation programs because the state programs were designed for 
injuries, not occupational illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify under the new program, a medical panel would have to  
determine that any illness was related to the worker's employment. 
</P>
<P>
	Beryllium is a rare chemical element associated with several  
metallic alloys used in atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am reversing a policy of denial of compensation,'' Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson told the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	He depicted the affected workers as victims of a Cold War rush  
to produce nuclear weapons and said safety standards, which have 
evolved since the 1940s, had been established in good faith, but 
have since been determined to have been too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today quoted an internal Energy Department document saying  
``this important endeavor has potential to help our contractor 
workers who have been so vital in achieving the (DOE's national 
defense) mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the people eligible to file claims work or worked at  
plants that date from the World War II effort to build a nuclear 
bomb, like Oak Ridge in Tennessee. Others worked or still work at 
the Nevada Test site, the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington 
State, Rocky Flats near Denver, the Idaho National Environmental 
Engineering Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Lobbying To Save F-22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jolted by a congressional move that could kill  
a prized new fighter jet, the Air Force invoked its recent 
successes in Kosovo as it lobbied hard this week to save the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we will be able to convice people we need it,''  
Lt. Gen. Gary Martin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations defense subcommittee voted Monday to  
divert $1.8 billion from the F-22 program. The money was supposed 
to go to buy six of the jets with a new design. Instead, the key 
panel wants to use the money to buy more of the tried-and-true F-15 
and F-16 models. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's chairman, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., also said he  
wants the Air Force to reconsider the F-22's Cold War roots, and 
decide whether the plane is really necessary now that the world has 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force flew most of the missions in NATO's 78-day air war  
to liberate Kosovo from the clutch of Serbian government troops. 
But the F-15s that Air Force pilots often used in the air war are 
getting outdated, Air Force Maj. Gen. Bruce Carlson said at a 
briefing for reporters at the Pentagon. The planes were developed 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Asking a young fighter pilot to put his life on the line with  
a piece of equipment that is 26 years old does not make sense to 
us,'' said Carlson, director of the air service's operational 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and other skeptics have also cited the Kosovo  
example -- to say that the current force of pilots and planes is 
stretched too thin and may benefit little from a program timed to 
deliver large numbers of planes a decade from now. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a senior official in the Air Force acquisition office,  
said he was late to the Pentagon briefing because he was meeting 
with Lewis and others on Capitol Hill to press for the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to take up  
the fiscal 2000 defense authorization bill on Friday that includes 
the cut in F-22 funds. It will go to the House floor later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has not moved to stall purchase of the ``stealthy''  
plane, the first two of which are now going through test flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said this week the Air Force has become preoccupied with  
the F-22, to the point where ``they've been ignoring everything 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This has gotten their attention,'' he said of Monday's vote.  
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said he does not rule out resuming the F-22 program, and  
noted that the legislation leaves $1.2 billion in the budget for 
continued research and development.

<HEADLINE> Gore Aide Was at Odds With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's newest campaign  
strategist masterminded the tobacco industry ads opposing President 
Clinton's effort to fight teen-age smoking. His firm also has 
represented several other clients at odds with Clinton-Gore 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter Eskew is taking a leave of absence from his job as  
partner of the BSMG Worldwide public relations firm. But he will 
continue as a paid consultant even as he advises Gore, the firm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime Democratic political consultant, Eskew moved into the  
corporate world after working on the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, 
becoming head of the BSMG division that produced advertising to 
push client views on political issues. 
</P>
<P>
	BSMG has represented several well-known companies, including  
Northwest Airlines, Visa and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew personally developed the tobacco ad campaign that helped  
derail legislation, championed by Clinton and Gore, that would have 
raised cigarette taxes and curbed teen-age smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Republican National Committee, Jim  
Nicholson, whose party killed the tobacco bill in the Senate, has 
accused Gore of hypocrisy for hiring Eskew. Anti-smoking activists 
and congressional watchdog groups also have questioned the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Al Gore really believed his own speechifying about values,  
he wouldn't hire a front man for the merchants of death, the 
tobacco industry,'' said Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional 
Accountability Project. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew did not return several calls seeking comment. But Gore  
campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said the vice president's stand on 
tobacco remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's worked hard to pass tobacco legislation and he's fought  
to keep tobacco out of the hands of children and he will continue 
to do so,'' Salazar said. ``This doesn't change that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew's ads portrayed the tobacco bill as a big government,  
tax-and-spend boondoggle. One ad warned that the bill would mean 
``half a trillion dollars in new taxes ... 17 new government 
bureaucracies. Cigarettes up to $5 a pack ... Huge job losses among 
farmers, retailers and small businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another ad featured a noisy cuckoo clock and insisted  
``Washington has gone cuckoo again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Senate Republicans defeated the tobacco bill in June 1998,  
Clinton said, ``No one doubts that this came about, in part, 
because of an unanswered $40 million advertising campaign by the 
tobacco companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Novelli of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids called Gore's  
decision to hire Eskew ``a bitter irony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy not only did this huge advertising campaign but it was  
a misleading advertising campaign, something that we're not going 
to soon forget,'' Novelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the other hand,'' he said, ``we are very sure that Gore's  
commitment to protecting kids from tobacco is real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1996, Gore brought delegates to the Democratic  
National Convention to the verge of tears when he told of the 
painful death of his older sister from smoking-related cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore promised to protect children from the dangers of smoking  
``until I draw my last breath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president later admitted that he continued to receive  
annual checks from his family's tobacco farm for several years 
after his sister's death.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Republican HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats who lost a Senate battle this week  
over giving patients new rights against health maintenance 
organizations uttered a few choice words to victorious Republicans: 
``We'll be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With an eye on next year's elections and polls showing the  
public's desire for such rights, Democrats pledged to keep 
hammering away at the popular issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue this battle and we will be successful,'' Sen.  
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said before the Senate voted 53-47 passage 
Thursday of a GOP plan that would give some HMO patients a broad 
array of new rights. But the GOP plan did not go as far as 
Democrats and President Clinton had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have a setback tonight but ... we'll be back to fight  
and fight again,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans defended the bill as containing a lot of good.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight is a win-win,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a  
doctor and leader of the GOP effort. ``We've made health coverage 
really better, significantly better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the bill was weak and unenforceable and criticized  
its exclusion of more than 110 million Americans with private 
health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress insists on passing such an empty promise to the  
American people, I will not sign the bill,'' he said in a written 
statement after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The House first must pass its version of the legislation. So  
far, the House bill has been tied up in committee because of 
conflicts among Republicans on its scope. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill offered a number of new rights to 48 million  
Americans -- those covered by federally regulated plans. Among the 
provisions were easier access to specialists, emergency rooms and 
obstetricians-gynecologists. In most cases, the rejected Democratic 
proposals were broader and would have covered more people, such as 
the more than 100 million people in private plans subject to state 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP bill also would require coverage for overnight hospital  
stays when recommended by a doctor for women undergoing breast 
cancer treatment, would give consumers more information about their 
plans and would permit appeals of denials of coverage for specific 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would amend the tax code to make it easier  
for people to buy health insurance and coverage for long-term care, 
although the bill did not specify how the new benefits would be 
paid for. 
</P>
<P>
	During weeklong debate on the bill, Republicans triumphed on  
every vote, winning adoption of their more modest proposals over 
the broad protections favored by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan, they argued, would lead to higher insurance  
costs and force millions more Americans to go without coverage. 
Democrats said the GOP effort was a sham that wouldn't help 
millions of people frustrated by the penny-pinching practices of 
HMOs and other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP Sens. Peter Fitzgerald of Illinois and John Chafee of Rhode  
Island -- two of a handful of Republicans who strayed several times 
this week toward Democratic proposals -- joined all 45 Democrats in 
voting against the final product. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day of debate Thursday, Republicans continued to  
defeat Democratic provisions, including one of the most contentious 
that would have allowed patients claiming they were harmed by a 
medical decision to take the HMO to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Health plans covered by federal regulations cannot now be sued.  
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said it would force insurers to put the health of a  
patient ahead of the company bottom line. Republicans claimed it 
was a gift to trial lawyers that would do little else but drive up 
insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one Republican voiced frustrations over the process.  
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, a member of a bipartisan group of moderates who  
assembled an 11th-hour compromise that was ignored, suggested that 
nothing will become law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me we've let down the American people,'' he  
complained. ``We've got to ask ourselves could we have done a 
better job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., another of the moderates, said the  
group would continue its work. ``This is not the last chapter in 
this debate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Singing Duo Still Going Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr. say they're  
still going strong after 30 years of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who met as members of The Fifth Dimension in 1967  
and later won a Grammy as a duo for ``You Don't Have To Be A 
Star,'' celebrate their anniversary on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
	``I credit our friendship. We went into this marriage like  
everyone else -- we loved each other, we were friends, we fought and 
we had emotional problems,'' Davis said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But our commitment to each other was so strong that we just  
didn't want to do it without each other. Plus, we have the Lord in 
our lives, and that's an important part of our relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McCoo said starting off as friends was a big part of their  
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't spend this many years with another person if you  
don't like them,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> OK, So What Would You Name a Horse? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	What's in a name?  
</P>
<P>
	In the case of racehorses, there's a lot of thought, and in some  
instances a touch of mischief. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Edward A. ``Buddy'' Bishop, there's a lot of  
work, some laughs and an occasional headache. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Smells, sired by Odor in the Court, is a name Bishop,  
registrar of The Jockey Club, appreciates. 
</P>
<P>
	He also smiles at Don't Take Any, the name of a horse by Plugged  
Nickel out of Wooden, and Your Tent or Mine, whose dame was Wigwam. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are names that make Bishop cringe, or worse. It's his  
job and that of his staff to make sure vulgar or suggestive names 
aren't accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes one slips by.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we catch them (suggestive or vulgar names) before they  
race, we can call them back,'' Bishop said. Names can also be 
changed by the Board of Stewards or The Jockey Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Mike Pegram has tried to slip several names past Bishop,  
who is on the alert. After having several names for a horse 
rejected by Bishop, Pegram finally got one accepted. It was 
Censored. In another instance, a frustrated Pegram submitted and 
had accepted Buddynamedme. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop said he and his staff has to approve the names about  
34,000 horses a year, and that 59 percent of the time the first 
name submitted is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually six names are submitted, and a horse can be named at no  
cost up to Feb. 1 of his or her 2-year-old. There is a $50 fee 
after that and a $100 fee for name changes. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent name change was that of Columbine Is Sad, named long  
before the shooting incident at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owner said if he couldn't change the name, he would retire  
the horse,'' Bishop said. ``It was changed to Dake, a family 
name.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five people check name requests, making sure they are within the  
rules, and then a final check in made by Bishop, who said, ``I'm 
the dirty old man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suggestive or double-entendre names are not the only ones Bishop  
and crew must guard against. ``In this day and age, you've got to 
be politically correct,'' he said, noting names that are 
inoffensive to some can insult members of religious and ethnic 
groups and minorities. Names such as squaw and injun are no-no's. 
</P>
<P>
	Classes of names not eligible for use include names consisting  
of more than 18 letters (spaces and punctuations marks county as 
letters); names ending in ``filly,'' ``colt. ``stud, ``mare,'' 
``stallion'' or any similar horse-related terms; names of persons 
without their written permission; names of famous people no longer 
living, without approval of the Board of Stewards, and names of 
notorious people. The Jockey Club doesn't want to hear about Jack 
the Ripper being the Kentucky Derby favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade names and copyrighted material also cannot be used as  
horse names, and names of horses currently active in racing or 
breeding cannot be duplicated. Also unacceptable are names similar 
in spelling or pronunciation to those already in use. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is a permanent list of names that can never be used  
again -- names such as Secretariat or Man o'War.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Ends 38.31 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Thursday, lifting some market  
indexes to new highs, as another report showed that the economy's 
surprising strength still hasn't sparked inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 38.31 to 11,186.41,  
finishing the day less than 15 points from Monday's record close of 
11,200.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes also advanced. The Nasdaq composite rose  
21.24 to 2,839.37 for its second straight record close, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 11.45 to 1,409.62, topping last Friday's 
record high of 1,403.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were cheered for the second day in a row by an  
encouraging report on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the start of Thursday's trading, the Labor Department  
reported that consumer prices held steady in June for the second 
straight month -- the best showing since 1986, when prices fell for 
three months in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had been expecting a slight increase of 0.1 percent  
in the Consumer Price Index. The data, along with Wednesday's news 
that prices at the wholesale level fell 0.1 percent in June, should 
help calm fears about an inflationary spurt back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers today were wonderful,'' said Charles Pradilla,  
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that the buying remains restrained with the  
market trading at lofty levels and a barrage of second-quarter 
profit reports due next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a market that's acting scared by any means. I'm not  
saying there isn't nevousness about certain companies, but this is 
not a nervous market across the board,'' said Pradilla. ``If you 
own them, you're nervous. If they disappoint, you can really get 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early flow of second-quarter reports continued to figure  
prominently in the movements of individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola rose 2 1/8 to 64 to help lead the Dow's advance after the  
soda company, beset by recent contamination problems in Europe, 
posted a profit of nearly $1 billion that met most Wall Street 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow also drew a big boost from Hewlett-Packard, which  
rallied late in the day, closing 4 9/16 higher at 113. There was no 
news to explain the late surge, which may have been related to 
last-minute positioning before the expiration of options contracts 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,831 up, 1,091 down and 625 
unchanged. Nasdaq gainers led by a 4-to-3 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume of NYSE-listed shares on all exchanges totaled 1.006  
billion shares, up from 918.59 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.85 to 660.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 8.73 to 821.73, 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.34 to 465.80.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.40 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.15 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
1.57 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Injured Ford Workers OK Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Two workers injured in an explosion at  
Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex have accepted a settlement of $1 
million each plus part of their salaries until age 65, their lawyer 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Drouillard said he expects his clients to sign the  
No. 2 automaker's offer by the end of the month. Two of his other 
clients are considering the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Arrington, 47, of Detroit and another worker who was not  
identified accepted the offer, which requires them not to sue or 
comment, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to settle comes before any report on the blast  
cause has been released, and before any lawsuits have been filed 
against Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	Six workers died and 14 were seriously injured in the explosion  
at the complex in Dearborn. So far, three lawsuits on behalf of 
workers have been filed against Rouge Steel, which co-owns the 
plant with Ford. If Rouge Steel played a role in the plant's 
maintenance, it could be found liable under a looser standard than 
the employers, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a memo recently obtained by The Detroit News, Ford said it  
would make an offer totaling $30 million to the families of the six 
people killed and the 14 injured in the Feb. 1 explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Drouillard said he urged his clients to accept the offer because  
it might be difficult to win against Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``The settlement is by no means an accurate reflection of the  
damages these people suffered,'' he told the Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Some other attorneys also are recommending acceptance of the  
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Tucker, who represents one of those killed in the explosion  
at the complex's power plant, said recent efforts to cut down on 
jury awards help justify accepting Ford's offer. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer reportedly includes Ford's paying the salaries,  
benefits and medical insurance for the injured workers, and the 
families of the six deceased workers, until they are or would have 
been 65. 
</P>
<P>
	The Free Press reported that some workers are holding out. They  
say they want to wait until the state report is released. That 
report will look at the cause as well as whether Ford committed any 
safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Some family members of the killed workers are upset that they  
would receive the same amount as injured workers. Other injured 
workers are irked because they say that they will not be allowed to 
talk about the blast after they sign the agreement.

<P>
	And some workers or families have yet to be contacted by Ford  
about the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford also would provide trust funds for the minor children of  
the workers killed and injured. The trust funds are valued at about 
$100,000 each, the News reported recently. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Nuke Plant Leak Said Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- An accident at a Japanese nuclear reactor this week  
caused a radiation leak 11,500 times above the safety limit, the 
company operating the facility said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Atomic Power Co. insists that no radiation escaped  
into the environment during Monday's accident, caused by a cracked 
pipe in the building that houses the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leak's magnitude was significantly higher than the  
company's original estimate of levels 250 times higher than safety 
standards, the company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Measuring the radiation that leaked throughout the plant took  
about two days, during which officials discovered higher levels 
than they had expected, company spokesman Atsushi Naruse told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company was investigating the cause of the leak.  
</P>
<P>
	About 89 tons of water used for cooling the No. 2 reactor had  
leaked within the reactor building before the valve of the cracked 
pipe could be turned off Monday in Tsuruga, 200 miles west of 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Trust in Japan's nuclear industry has fallen in recent years  
following a series of accidents and cover-ups by plant operators. A 
fire in March 1997 exposed 37 workers to low-level radiation in a 
fuel processing facility in northern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan, a nation poor in natural resources, relies on nuclear  
power for about one-third of its electricity.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Pay Raise for Lawmakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With scant debate, the House voted 276-147  
today to let lawmakers receive a cost-of-living pay raise exceeding 
$4,600 at a time when the economy, budget surpluses and 
congressional popularity are all surging. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid accusations of being sneaky, leaders of both parties  
had the House vote on the issue as the chamber began debating a 
bill financing the Treasury Department for the coming fiscal year. 
By law, legislators get automatic annual cost-of-living increases 
unless Congress votes against it, and the Treasury measure is the 
traditional vehicle for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, the vote was a preliminary motion on the rules for  
debating the Treasury legislation. But leaders of both parties -- 
who support the increase -- had made it clear that approving the 
debate rules meant that a later amendment to block the pay increase 
would not be in order. 
</P>
<P>
	There was almost no discussion of the increase, let alone  
debate. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chief author of the Treasury 
measure, said he hoped the debate rules would be approved, and 
Reps. Ken Lucas, D-Ky. and Ernie Fletcher, R-Ky., rose to simply 
say they would oppose them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like there was so much bipartisan support for the  
COLA I didn't think anybody wanted to make it a major, 
controversial issue,'' Fletcher said in an interview afterward. 
COLA is short-hand for cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of both parties supported the boost by 2-1 margins.  
</P>
<P>
	Most representatives and senators have earned $136,700 annually  
since January 1998. Leaders get more, with House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., earning $175,400, the same as Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.4 percent increase would take effect in January.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved its version of the Treasury bill on July 1  
without language preventing the increase or any debate on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters and opponents of the raise predicted the House would  
approve it. Kolbe agreed and said if that occurred, it would be 
``an extraordinary event'' for the increase to be blocked when 
House-Senate bargainers craft a compromise Treasury bill. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the 1990s, with huge federal deficits and an  
unpopular Congress, proposed pay raises often generated intense 
public opposition and became fodder for radio talk shows. Before 
last year, Congress had voted to block itself from getting a raise 
every year since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year's consideration comes as the country's economy is  
prospering, a three-decade string of budget deficits has melted 
into surpluses, and Congress' approval rating is at a healthy 56 
percent, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus ``takes away the argument some of us used in  
the past saying we shouldn't have any adjustment to our salaries 
until we take care of the deficit,'' said Kolbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., said he would oppose the  
increase, citing the uncertainty of long-term surplus projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have more accurate evidence of the long-term nature  
of this surplus, I think it's important for Congress to say we can 
live with a $136,700 income,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic is Pete Sepp, spokesman for the conservative  
National Taxpayers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last thing Congress should be considering right  
now, especially since taxpayers haven't yet received a single penny 
of tax reduction this year, nor any assurances spending will be 
held in check,'' Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., have  
discussed the pay boost, as have other House leaders, to make sure 
neither side will use the proposal as a partisan issue against the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker supports the  
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``All federal employees are getting a COLA,'' he said, using the  
shorthand for a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt offered the same justification.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way we treat government workers, and I think we ought  
to do this,'' he said in a brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides of the issue said the proposed increase  
has not been contentious this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``About none, aside from a few media people trying to stir it  
up,'' Kolbe said when asked how much controversy the proposal has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 law established the current mechanism for lawmakers'  
annual automatic increase, reducing the number of politically 
sensitive votes they must take on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	It also created a formula making the size of their increases  
slightly smaller than the boosts that federal employees receive. 
President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
government workers next year, while lawmakers would get 3.4 
percent, or $4,648.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-American Monument Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Fine Arts Commission put off a decision  
today on what inscriptions should grace a planned monument near the 
Capitol honoring the patriotism of Japanese-Americans in World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some wonderful quotes, but there are too many of  
them,'' Chairman J. Carter Brown told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested limiting the quotations as far as possible to  
statements by Presidents Truman, Ford and Reagan, praising the 
Japanese-Americans, and a listing of the internment camps. The 
three presidents and many others condemned the internments, ordered 
by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and upheld by the Supreme Court 
as a war measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The memorial, a 7-foot-3-inch granite wall, will list about 840  
names, including Japanese-American war veterans, ``of those who 
lost their lives, or are missing in action in service to their 
country.'' The wall would be the centerpiece of a quarter-acre park 
between Union Station and the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Inscriptions will be etched on each of six narrative panels and  
at the entrance and exit of the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an effort to tell a 45-year story as succinctly as  
possible,'' said John Parsons, who was representing Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt today before the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The presidential quotes under consideration:  
</P>
<P>
	Reagan: ``Here we admit a wrong. Here we affirm our commitment  
as a nation to equal justice under the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truman: ``You fought not only the enemy, but you fought  
prejudice. ... And you won. Keep up the fight to make this great 
republic stand for what the Constitution says it stands for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford: ``Not only was evacuation wrong ... we have learned from  
the tragedy to forever treasure liberty and justice for each 
individual American, and resolve that this kind of action shall 
never be repeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposed inscription says: ``Japanese-Americans were  
forced to abandon homes, friends, farms and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allowed only what they could carry, more than 115,000  
individuals were evacuated to remote internment camps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese-Americans appealed against the restrictions in 1943,  
and the case reached the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another inscription would say: ``The court ruled that the  
adoption by government, in crisis of war and threatened invasion, 
of measures of public safety, is not wholly beyond the limits of 
the Constitution and is not to be condemned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1988 Congress approved reparations of $20,000 to each of  
those sent to the camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry Tsutsumida, executive director of the private group  
raising money for the Japanese-American Patriotism Memorial, said 
she knows of no objections to the inscriptions. She favors adding a 
quote from Rep. Robert T. Matsui, D-Calif., one of two 
Japanese-Americans serving in the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	A quote from Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii is proposed for the  
inscription at the exit: ``The lessons learned ... must remain ... 
as a grave reminder of what we must not allow to happen again to 
any group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also up before the Fine Arts Commission is a proposed memorial  
to Mohandas Gandhi, whose teaching of nonviolence helped bring 
independence to India. It too will be a small park, with a 10-foot 
statue of Gandhi, on Massachusetts Avenue facing the Indian 
Embassy.

<HEADLINE> Storm Wreck Wins at Hollywood Park </HEADLINE>

<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Storm Wreck surged from last place and  
overtook even-money favorite Free to win Thursday's $53,972 feature 
at Hollywood Park by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Alex Solis and carrying 116 pounds, Storm Wreck  
covered 1 1-16 miles in 1:42 and paid $7.40, $2.80 and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The third victory for Storm Wreck, a 4-year-old gelding, in 17  
career starts was worth $31,440, increasing his career earnings to 
$127,174. 
</P>
<P>
	Free, with Chris McCarron riding at 119 pounds, was unable to  
keep up with Storm Wreck's sustained rally and finished second, 
paying $2.80 and $2.60. March of Kings, a longshot with Garrett 
Gomez riding at 116 pounds, finished 5 1/2 lengths behind Free and 
paid $3.60 to show.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Killer Says He Wants To Live </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMERICUS, Ga. (AP) -- A man who tauntingly urged jurors to send  
him to the electric chair after admitting to two murders now says 
he wants to live. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Colwell's lawyer, Michael Mears, is seeking a new trial  
for Colwell in the July 1996 deaths of a couple gunned down in the 
parking lot of an Americus Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
	Colwell is on death row at the state prison in Jackson.  
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge R. Rucker Smith has already rejected one  
new-trial motion, but Mears recently filed an amended motion that 
included a letter from Colwell. 
</P>
<P>
	``I very much want to go to a state mental hospital to get help  
to save my life,'' Colwell said in the June 28 letter to Mears. ``I 
am very sorry for killing those people. I don't want to continue to 
be a murderer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colwell, a former football star at Arizona Western College and  
Middle Tennessee State University, drew a smiley face next to his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
	At his October trial, Colwell testified that he killed Mitchell  
and Judith Bell because he was depressed and wanted the state to 
kill him, something he lacked the courage to do himself. 
</P>
<P>
	He also taunted jurors with threats to return and kill or  
torture them and their families if they failed to give him a death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	District Attorney John R. Parks said Wednesday he doesn't  
believe Colwell's change of heart is grounds for a new trial.

<HEADLINE> Starter Winning Bid Is $46 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A consortium of five companies  
successfully bid $46 million for the trademark and sports apparel 
inventory of Starter Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, approved by Chief Judge Peter Walsh of the U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., is expected to be completed 
in 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
	New Haven, Conn.-based Starter, which makes sports apparel  
bearing professional and college team logos, has been under Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection since April 19. The company listed assets 
of $118.1 million and liabilities of $120.5 million in its 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's licensing agreements with the major league sports  
must be renegotiated by the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium was led by Columbus, Ohio-based Schottenstein  
Stores Corp., whose Value City Department Stores Inc. would receive 
the inventory. The other members of the consortium are LogoAthletic 
of Indianapolis, which is a partner of Puma NA, maker of athletic 
shoes and gear; Sol Werdiger of Outer Stuff Ltd. and Franco Apparel 
Group, both of New York; and Parthenon Capital of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited and we believe the group that was put  
together will take Starter to a higher level ... and make it one of 
the preeminent brands in the country,'' said Jay Schottenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter has a manufacturing plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; a  
distribution center in Memphis, Tenn.; and 18 retail outlets 
nationwide. In June, Ozer Group of Massachusetts was named to 
oversee the liquidation of Starter's retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold assets of its Memphis plant to Daisy Tech  
International for $2.5 million. The assets of a facility in Iowa 
went to Valley Products, Inc., of Cedar Rapids, Mich., for 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Starter Corp. founder David A. Beckerman announced  
his resignation as president and chief executive officer. Beckerman 
founded the company in 1971, and it quickly became one of the 
largest manufacturers of team-licensed sportswear, holding 
contracts with the National Football League, National Basketball 
Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, more 
than 150 colleges and universities, and World Championship 
Wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	With its signature team jacket, Starter also marketed clothing  
and accessories bearing its own name and logos to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company was forced into bankruptcy because company  
executives couldn't come up with a new game plan to compete with 
big names like Nike and Adidas, which could afford to take chances 
and even lose money in exchange for exposure on the playing field 
and in the locker room, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the company also was shoved to the sidelines by  
mainstream apparel retailers that wanted a piece of the action, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's 1997 annual report, Beckerman admitted Starter  
was being marginalized by the competition. He said the company also 
faced difficulties because of increasing royalty and marketing 
expenses demanded by the leagues.

	Senate Nixes Patient Suits vs. HMOs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning to one of the most contentious issues  
in the weeklong debate, the Senate today killed a Democratic 
provision that would have enabled some patients to sue their health 
plans. Health plans that fall under federal regulations cannot now 
be sued. The Senate voted 53-47 against the provision, which 
Democrats had argued would force insurers to put a patient's health 
before the company bottom line. President Clinton said he was 
bewildered by the rejection. ``The health insurers won't let them 
do it,'' Clinton said of the Republicans, who control the Senate. 
Republicans say the cost and expense of lengthy court fights would 
hurt patients.

	Clinton Meets Columbine Teens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Urging Congress to heed ``the lobbyists who  
truly matter, our children,'' President Clinton today challenged 
lawmakers to pass gun control legislation before the nation's 
students return to classes in September. The president, joined by 
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and Attorney General Janet 
Reno, met with more than 80 students from Colorado -- including some 
from Columbine High School -- to hear their concerns about the 
prospects of passage of tougher gun control laws. The president 
invited the students to the White House to help his campaign for 
mandatory background checks on buyers at gun shows, and to require 
child safety locks on handguns.

the spending limitations that go with them. The Republican 
presidential front-runner said that if he accepts the matching 
funds his campaign would have been restricted by spending limits in

rights act of the new century,'' Gore said to a standing ovation, 
Gore told 3,000 NAACP members on the closing day of the 
organization's annual national convention. Black advocates say 
racial profiling, the police practice of singling out minorities 
for questioning at airports, on highways and on streets, is often

U.S.-led bombings. France's highest court ruled that British

<HEADLINE> Two Warner Studio Chiefs Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The two leaders of Warner Bros.' movie,  
television and music division surprised Hollywood Thursday by 
announcing their resignations, ending one of the entertainment 
industry's longest-running success stories and leaving a huge 
management void. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, chairmen and co-chief executives  
of Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group, said they will remain until 
Dec. 31, when their current contracts expire. They've worked 
together running Warner Bros. operations since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and Semel are leaving at a time when their company appears  
to be on a roll, with recent box office successes of films such as 
``The Matrix'' and the ``Austin Powers'' sequel. Stanley Kubrick's 
final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' debuts Friday and is expected to do 
well. Earnings for parent company Time Warner were up 8 percent in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they wanted to pursue new ventures, but declined  
in an interview to elaborate, or say for sure if they would 
continue their partnership in any new undertakings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept asking myself if I wouldn't like to have one more  
challenge in my life,'' said Semel. ``If I was going to do that, 
this is the right time for both my company and myself to take that 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``At what point in your life do you decide you can, if you want,  
to try something else? For me it was when the company was healthy 
and things were going well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	News of their departure worried Wall Street. Shares of Time  
Warner fell $1.43 3/4, or nearly 2 percent, to $75.87 1/2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's negative,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst  
with Merrill Lynch. ``I think Bob and Terry are the most stable 
management team in entertainment history. They've had a long and 
successful run, but the company is very large and has a great 
breadth of management talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Daly and Semel were successful partly because they  
avoided the infighting and ego conflicts that often mark Hollywood 
business relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty rare to have co-chairmen of a major entity, which  
in itself is part of an even larger entity, and not have their own 
egos get in the way of being partners and managing others,'' said 
James Goss, an analyst with Barrington Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, Daly and Semel denied reports of friction with Time  
Warner Chairman Gerald Levin over concerns that their 
responsibilities were too broad. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just not the case. There's never been any friction  
between or amongst us, I can state that clearly,'' said Levin, who 
joined Daly and Semel for an interview. ``I don't know where this 
came from, but I'm the one who decided we should run our music 
company and studio together. I really believe in it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The current management structure will remain in place after  
Semel and Daly leave, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm even more convinced they should be run together,'' Levin  
said. ``There is so much synergy between music and film and the 
possibility of doing things online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Daly-Semel partnership began in 1980 when Daly was hired as  
chairman of the Warner Bros. studio, joining Semel, who was vice 
president and chief operating officer. Semel became chairman and 
co-CEO of Warner Bros. in 1994. The music division was combined 
with the movie and TV operations a year later and the pair was 
named co-CEOs. 
</P>
<P>
	When they started with the company, the film and television  
group had revenues of less than $1 billion. By the end of 1998, it 
reported revenues of approximately $6 billion. The film and 
television division and Warner Music Group reported combined 
revenues of an estimated $10 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Other successful films during the Daly-Semel era have included  
the ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Batman'' movies, ``The Killing 
Fields,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Unforgiven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daly and Semel said they had decidedly separately to leave, and  
began talking about their decisions privately about two months ago. 
They informed Levin and the Time Warner board on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Libbey Drops Latest Oneida Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) -- Glassware maker Libbey Inc. has abandoned  
its latest effort to acquire flatware giant Oneida Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida management rejected a $625 million offer earlier this  
month and has been adamantly opposed to Libbey's previous takeover 
bids. 
</P>
<P>
	Toledo-based Libbey said Thursday it was disappointed with  
Oneida's response. 
</P>
<P>
	Both companies want to become complete suppliers of table-top  
products: silverware, glassware, china, linen and other 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey, a leading glassware maker, made the $37.50 per share  
offer to Oneida shareholders in late June, its third attempt since 
1995 to control the world's largest silverware maker. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida, which has 4,700 employees worldwide and is based in  
Oneida, N.Y., also is a strong competitor of Libbey's in the 
glassware and other table-top products markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida board members said they rejected the proposal because it  
included ``substantial contingencies and uncertainties'' including 
concerns over financing and antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are equal in size, but Oneida has become  
vulnerable to a takeover in the last year because it has gone 
through a major restructuring following a 30 percent drop in 
earnings in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Libbey had revenue of $439.5 million last year with profits of  
$25.4 million, off 30 percent from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Oneida had sales of $465.9 million last year, but after years of  
growth, profits fell 32 percent to $19.8 million. That prompted the 
company to restructure and lay off 300 workers since January while 
closing two foreign plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Libbey rose 18 3/4 cents to $31.12 1/2, while shares of  
Oneida fell 75 cents to $27.75, both in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Brewers Postpone Game After Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers postponed their  
game tonight in a gesture of respect to three workers who died when 
a huge crane collapsed while handling a portion of the roof for the 
team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Five others were injured Wednesday afternoon when the crane  
broke in half as it lifted the 400-ton load. It crumbled into the 
partially completed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 567-foot crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece  
of Miller Park's $400 million retractable roof into place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off,'' said Gary Craig, who lives  
nearby. ``When I went outside I looked around and saw the 
helicopters hovering over the stadium, and I could see that the 
crane was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of thee victims were not released. Only one of the  
injured -- the 64-year-old crane operator who fell up to 30 feet -- 
remained hospitalized today. He was listed in stable condition with 
a broken hip and broken shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers used used dogs and searchlights to search the rubble  
for any other victims until late Wednesday, but none were found, 
Deputy Fire Chief Gerald Frank said. No one known to be at the site 
was unaccounted for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident has not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph at the time the crane fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who play in adjacent Milwaukee County Stadium and  
will move to Miller Park, postponed their scheduled game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a game, baseball,'' Mayor John Norquist said. ``What  
happened today was death, and that's horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fleming, a mayoral spokesman, said the accident caused  
significant damage to the 43,000-seat stadium, scheduled to open 
next season. He said he did not know how long it would set the 
project back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, built by Neil F. Lampson Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., is  
the largest in North America and one of four of its size in the 
world, a designer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several Miller Park workers were injured when a  
steel girder being lowered into position collided with an aerial 
basket. On May 10, a worker was hospitalized for a week after 
falling 60 feet from the roof.

<HEADLINE> Bush's Six-Month Total: $37 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush reported today that  
he had raised a record $37 million for his Republican presidential 
campaign -- even more than his earlier estimate -- and had more than 
$30 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	With a bank account of that size, the GOP front-runner announced  
in Iowa today that he will not accept federal matching funds and 
the spending limitations that go with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got limits that constrain a candidate,'' Bush said. ``I  
want to be in a position to respond. I want to be in a position to 
plan, and I want to be in a position to plan according to need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, publisher Steve Forbes once again exhibited his  
willingness to self-finance his campaign, contributing $6 million 
of his own money between April and June and raising an additional 
$2.7 million. During the first six months of the year, Forbes took 
in $9.5 million, including $6.6 million of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes reported spending $8.2 million through June 30, and the  
campaign reported debts of $1.4 million and a bank account balance 
of $1.2 million -- leaving the campaign $200,000 in debt. Bush, on 
the other hand, spent only $7.1 million during the first six months 
of the year and had a bank account balance of $30.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole reported  
raising $3.5 million during the first six months of the year, 
including $2.8 million between April and June. She had $1.8 million 
in the bank June 30. Dole's campaign reported that 43 percent of 
those contributing at least $200 were women. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our campaign is gaining strength and momentum,'' Dole said  
today. ``This campaign is on its way to making history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, former Sen. Bill Bradley reported  
raising $11.7 million during the first six months of 1999 and had 
$7.5 million in the bank as of June 30. The campaign said it had 
received more than $240,000 in contributions through its web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the ways our campaign is doing things differently is by  
working to bring new people into the process,'' campaign chairman 
Douglas Berman said. ``We believe that the Internet is a valuable 
tool in getting people involved in the campaign who might not have 
done so in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has raised more money than the $32 million that  
1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole took in for his entire 
campaign. Bush's campaign counted more than 74,000 contributors, 
with an average contribution of $467. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am honored and humbled by this outpouring of support from my  
fellow citizens,'' Bush said today. ``The fact that individual 
Americans care enough about the future of our country to send 
contributions ranging from $5 to a maximum of $1,000 says that my 
message of prosperity with a purpose is resonating in every 
community in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates also were scheduled to file their midyear  
reports today with the Federal Election Commission. Previously, 
Vice President Al Gore indicated he would raise $18.2 million to 
$18.5 million, and his Democratic challenger, former Sen. Bill 
Bradley, said he would raise $11.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Sen. John McCain said he would raise  
$4.1 million, plus $2 million transferred from his Senate campaign 
account; Gary Bauer and former Vice President Dan Quayle said they 
would raise about $3.4 million apiece; and Lamar Alexander said he 
would raise $2 million.

<HEADLINE> Hawks Sign Glover to 3-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks on Thursday signed guard Dion  
Glover, one of the team's three first-round draft choices, to a 
three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the NBA rookie salary scale, Glover, the 20th  
overall pick in last month's draft, must be paid $744,500 the first 
year, $800,400 the second and $856,200 the third. Exact terms 
weren't revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Glover was the third-leading freshman scorer in the  
nation in 1997-98, averaging 18.4 points for Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed last season after he tore left knee ligaments during  
his first practice as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks signed their other first-round choices, Jason Terry  
and Cal Bowdler, on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Says He's 100 Percent Retired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *AP Sports Writers    	
</P>
<P>
	LONG GROVE, Ill. (AP) -- Remember when Michael Jordan said he was  
``99.9 percent'' sure he was finished with basketball? Well, bump 
it up to 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after announcing his retirement, Jordan said Thursday  
his days of playing basketball are definitely over. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it's 100 percent,'' he said after playing in a pro-am  
with Raymond Floyd in the Ameritech Senior Open. ``A lot of you 
guys anticipated that I would be not happy in retirement. I'm at 
peace with the world. I wake up and do whatever, and I love that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan admitted he did feel ``a little bit of an itch'' during  
the playoffs, but he went out, played a few more rounds of golf and 
it went away. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as I'm busy, I don't think about it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He's played only three times in the last year, and in a sure  
sign his days of ruling the NBA are over, he no longer hears gossip 
firsthand. He hasn't even talked to Phil Jackson since Jackson took 
over as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he hasn't worked out since the Chicago Bulls won their  
sixth NBA title in June 1998, Jordan still looks like he could suit 
up and play. He hasn't gained weight and there's not even a hint of 
a post-retirement pot belly. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not for lack of trying, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working,'' he said, grabbing his stomach and laughing.  
``It just doesn't seem to want to pop out. It's not because I 
haven't tried. What you see is just a product of my metabolism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So what does His Airness do with all of his free time? Golf,  
golf and more golf. He plays two or three rounds a day and is down 
to a 4 handicap. Earlier this summer, he took a bunch of buddies to 
Ireland and Scotland, where they played 20 courses in 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them had a hard time with two-a-days. But they have a  
better appreciation for Michael Jordan's love for the game,'' he 
said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	While he's not ruling out the possibility of playing golf  
professionally someday, he also knows he's got a lot more work to 
do. On Thursday, he ran into trouble on the 18th hole, dribbling 
his drive into a marsh area and hitting a tree with his second 
shot. He finally picked up the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows I need some improvement. I'm not on Raymond's caliber  
yet,'' he said. ``Even the greatest athlete can have some 
humiliating situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan shot a 13-over 85 during the pro-am, and admitted he was  
a little nervous playing. The gallery was huge, with crowds lining 
every hole and fairway. Fans screamed out his name, and dozens of 
hands reached out to touch him as he walked between holes. 
</P>
<P>
	There were little kids wearing Jordan jerseys and business men  
and women still dressed in suits. People took pictures and everyone 
wanted an autograph. One woman even asked Jordan to sign her 
diploma from North Carolina, Jordan's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan looked more at ease than he did last year, when his  
future was on everyone's mind. He bantered back and forth with the 
crowd, and playfully chastised a police officer walking with his 
group when the officer guzzled a Powerade -- a competitor of 
Gatorade, which Jordan endorses. 
</P>
<P>
	The funniest sight was on the 13th hole. Someone hung a bed  
sheet that read, ``Hey Mike, Remember Me!'' from the second story 
of a house overlooking the hole. Jordan laughed when he saw it, and 
chuckled again when he noticed a young man standing on top of the 
house with a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he'd fallen, it would be my fault,'' Jordan said. ``But  
it's amazing what people will do to gain your attention. But also 
pay their respects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Jordan's future, he has no firm plans other than to hang  
out with his friends and family and play more golf. He has no 
regrets that his attempt to buy the Charlotte Hornets fell through, 
and said it's still possible he will own a team someday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything's possible,'' he said. ``Other than me playing  
basketball.''

<HEADLINE>  Ulster Unionists Nix Nominations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's major  
Protestant party refused today to nominate ministers for the new 
provincial administration, a long-delayed decision that threw years 
of peacemaking efforts into disarray. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists refused even to attend today's session of  
Belfast's year-old legislature. Their unexpectedly stubborn stand 
dealt a severe blow to British Prime Minister Tony Blair's hopes of 
forming an administration of Protestants and Catholics after a year 
of deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam  
announced that the British and Irish governments would meet next 
week to plan a comprehensive ``review'' summit with Northern 
Ireland's key parties, designed to salvage last year's Good Friday 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Mowlam said politicians should ``not seek to blame any party''  
for this ``very serious setback.'' She said, ``The reality is we 
either move forward together or we do not move forward at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House press secretary Joe Lockhart called  
the developments ``a setback.'' He said President Clinton 
``believes there's clearly a mandate among all the people for 
peace, and that the parties need to stay at this until they find a 
way to solve their differences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislature last year elected Ulster Unionist leader David  
Trimble to lead an intended four-party, 12-member Cabinet, the core 
institution envisaged in April 1998's peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
	But Trimble's badly divided party has refused to support the  
formation of any administration that includes the Irish Republican 
Army-linked Sinn Fein party unless the IRA starts to disarm, 
something the outlawed group has long refused to do. 
</P>
<P>
	Trimble, who remained with his legislators at their party  
headquarters as other parties assembled at Stormont Parliament 
Building, said the effort to form the administration ``should not 
be crashed. It should be parked, which will lead to a review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending his actions, Trimble said: ``It is quite unreasonable  
to expect us to bring into government an active and fully armed 
terrorist organization without any commitment by them to act purely 
in accordance with the democratic process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after proceedings began at Stormont, Trimble's Catholic  
deputy atop the unformed administration for the past year, Seamus 
Mallon, condemned the Ulster Unionists' tactics -- and immediately 
resigned as the Cabinet's would-be deputy first minister. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ulster Unionists ``are dishonoring this agreement. They are  
insulting its principles,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the 
moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, which represents most 
of Northern Ireland's substantial Catholic minority. 
</P>
<P>
	Mallon said Trimble also should resign and take the Ulster  
Unionists into a review process without ``the privileged position 
of first minister of this Assembly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had pushed for weeks  
for the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to sanction a compromise 
whereby the Protestant side would support Sinn Fein's entry into 
government in exchange for the IRA's rapid commitment to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA, however, remained silent on the initiative, and Sinn  
Fein emphasized that the outlawed group had given no commitment to 
meet the accord's expectation of total disarmament by next May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be desirable if the IRA were to make a statement, but  
they have not done so,'' the Irish government's justice minister, 
John O'Donoghue, said in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the British government ordered the Belfast  
legislature -- the only branch of provincial government established 
under terms of last year's accord -- to convene especially to fill 
10 Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision had been postponed since October in the certain  
knowledge that the body's Protestant members would refuse to elect 
Sinn Fein candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Three posts each are earmarked for Trimble's Ulster Unionists  
and the SDLP. Two others each would go to Sinn Fein and to the 
Democratic Unionists, a hard-line Protestant party that strenuously 
opposes the Good Friday accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the legislature -- pointedly minus the Ulster Unionists  
-- went through an exercise today of electing, then immediately 
abolishing, an entirely Catholic administration from the SDLP and 
Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair had hoped to devolve considerable powers to the new  
administration on Sunday. The British government took direct 
control of Northern Ireland in 1972 after abolishing its 
Protestant-dominated parliament.

	Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern had pushed for weeks  
for the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein to sanction a compromise 
whereby the Protestant side would support Sinn Fein's entry into 
government in exchange for the IRA's rapid commitment to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA, however, remained silent on the initiative, and Sinn  
Fein emphasized that the outlawed group had given no commitment to 
meet the accord's expectation of total disarmament by next May. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be desirable if the IRA were to make a statement, but  
they have not done so,'' the Irish government's justice minister, 
John O'Donoghue, said in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the British government ordered the Belfast  
legislature -- the only branch of provincial government established 
under terms of last year's accord -- to convene especially to fill 
10 Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision had been postponed since October in the certain  
knowledge that the body's Protestant members would refuse to elect 
Sinn Fein candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Three posts each are earmarked for Trimble's Ulster Unionists  
and the SDLP. Two others each would go to Sinn Fein and to the 
Democratic Unionists, a hard-line Protestant party that strenuously 
opposes the Good Friday accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the legislature -- pointedly minus the Ulster Unionists  
-- went through an exercise today of electing, then immediately 
abolishing, an entirely Catholic administration from the SDLP and 
Sinn Fein. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair had hoped to devolve considerable powers to the new  
administration on Sunday. The British government took direct 
control of Northern Ireland in 1972 after abolishing its 
Protestant-dominated parliament.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Students To Talk Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was joining with more than  
80 students from Colorado -- including some from Columbine High 
School -- to ``send a message to Congress'' for tougher gun control 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The president invited the students to the White House to help  
his campaign for mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun 
shows, and to require child safety locks on handguns. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton would use  
the occasion to tell the students and Congress that ``the tragedy 
of Littleton should not be forgotten and that Congress needs to 
move forward expeditiously with the kind of sensible gun control 
legislation that the Senate passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The April 20 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton left  
15 dead, including the two killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart denied that Clinton was using the students  
inappropriately for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that what the president is doing is politicizing  
it,'' Lockhart said. ``He thinks that these actions should be 
taken, and these students who are coming here today on their way to 
the Hill feel very strongly about it. And they'll make their 
message known. I don't think they see this as a political issue. 
They see this as an issue of safety for themselves and for their 
fellow students.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students' visit was organized by Handgun Control Inc. and  
SAFE (Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic), a political 
action group formed in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy.

<HEADLINE> 'Star Wars' Helps Hasbro Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Hasbro Inc.'s second-quarter earnings  
climbed almost six-fold from a year ago, fueled by robust demand 
for its ``Star Wars'' toys, Furby dolls and computer games. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest toy maker reported Thursday that it  
earned $32.3 million, or 16 cents a share, for the quarter ended 
June 27, compared with $5.5 million, or 3 cents a share, in the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter were $875 million, compared to $572  
million in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro's results topped Wall Street analysts expectations of 10  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company's stock rose $1.43 3/4 to $27.62 1/2  
Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, boosted by the big 
quarterly profit gains as well as an upbeat outlook from Hasbro for 
the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had worried in recent months that the much-hyped ``Star  
Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' toys weren't selling as well 
as many had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But the second-quarter results showed that strong demand for  
merchandise tied to the movie, and some products sold even better 
than the company had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	The company now expects to realize $650 million in ``Star Wars''  
toy sales this year, up from the company's original projection of 
$500 million to $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the strength in its ``Star Wars'' line, Hasbro's  
earnings benefited from continued demand for its interactive Furby 
dolls, computer software, and toys tied to the fantasy Japanese 
cartoon Pokemon and British children's television show Teletubbies. 
</P>
<P>
	If Hasbro's sales and profits keep up this pace, analysts said  
the company may be on track to become the nation's biggest toymaker 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beating Mattel is still a very attainable goal for Hasbro,''  
said Cliff Annicelli, associate editor of Play Things magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro spent $147 million in the second quarter to repurchase  
almost five million shares of its common stock. About $90 million 
of that money went to repurchase most of the Dreamworks film 
studio's equity interest in Hasbro. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Hasbro earned $46.08  
million, or 22 cents a share, compared with $13.25 million, or 6 
cents a share. Sales were $1.54 billion, up from $1.05 billion a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro owns the Playskool, Kenner, Tonka, Milton Bradley, Parker  
Brothers and Galoob toy and game brands.

<HEADLINE> Reid To Square Off Against Kelly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Reid is a fighter with a golden  
future. He gets a kick out of talking about a golden moment in his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Mention The Punch, and both Reid and his trainer Al Mitchell  
still get emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference this week at Bally's Park Place to hype his  
WBA super welterweight title defense against Australian Kevin Kelly 
Friday night, neither man paid much attention to a tape of Reid's 
fights until the third round of his 1996 156-pound Olympic final 
came on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That got their undivided attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the greatest day of my life,'' Reid said Thursday.  
Needing a knockout to win, Reid knocked out Cuban Alejandro 
Duvergel with a right to the head and won a gold medal at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In his corner as head coach of the U.S. team was Mitchell, who  
has played such an important role in Reid's life that on Father's 
Day, Reid presented him with his WBA title belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably a year now from it will be worth something,'' said  
Mitchell, who hopes by then Reid will have added another title to 
the WBA 154-pound championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and Reid hope to get a fight against IBF 154-pound  
champion Fernando Vargas next spring. Vargas will defend his title 
against Raul Marque Saturday night at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to win a couple more titles,'' Mitchell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid already is scheduled defend against Keith Mullings Aug. 28  
at a site to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night in a ballroom at the Boardwalk Convention Center,  
the 25-year-old Reid, of Philadelphia (12-0, seven knockouts), will 
be making the first defense he won on a clear-cut decision over 
Laurent Boudouani of France March 6 at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good fighter,'' the 29-year-old Kelly (24-5-2, 11  
knockouts) said of Reid. ``He's very athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said Kelly has good jab and speed, but ``the only thing  
I'm concerned about is he comes in with his head. I expect a good 
fight for seven or eight rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is scheduled to start at 11 p.m., EDT, and will be  
televised by FX. The telecast is set to begin at 10 p.m. and 
include a 10-round lightweight bout John John Molina (46-6, 31 
knockouts) of Puerto Rico, a former IBF junior lightweight 
champion, and James Crayton of Las Vegas (30-9-2, 19 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the show will be a 10-round junior welterweight match  
between Hector Camacho Jr. (22-0, 12 knockouts) and Mike Cooley 
(8-11-2, three knockouts) of Omaha, Neb.

	Senate Nixes Patient Suits vs. HMOs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today killed a Democratic provision  
that would have enabled some patients to sue their health plans. 
Health plans that fall under federal regulations cannot now be 
sued. The Senate voted 53-47 against the provision, which Democrats 
had argued would force insurers to put a patient's health before 
the company bottom line. The sponsor of the doomed amendment, Sen. 
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said: ``This is what the patients' bill of 
rights is all about.'' Republicans countered by saying patients 
would actually suffer because of the cost of lengthy court fights.

	N. Ireland Peace Prospects Damaged  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Northern Ireland's major  
Protestant party refused today to nominate ministers for the new 
provincial administration, a long-delayed decision that threw years 
of peacemaking efforts into disarray. The Ulster Unionists refused 
even to attend today's session of Belfast's year-old legislature. 
Their unexpectedly stubborn stand dealt a severe blow to British 
Prime Minister Tony Blair's hopes of forming an administration of 
Protestants and Catholics after a year of deadlock. In response, 
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam announced that the 
British and Irish governments would meet next week to plan a 
comprehensive ``review'' summit with Northern Ireland's key 
parties, designed to salvage last year's Good Friday peace accord.

five-time champion Tom Watson could do only one stroke better. 
Carnoustie more than lived up to its reputation as a brutal test of 
golf, with scores soaring on the first day of play amid the wind

<HEADLINE> Tim Allen To Drop $8M Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Tim Allen has agreed to drop an $8 million  
libel lawsuit after learning the defendant has brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who maintains a home in the Detroit suburb of Beverly  
Hills, filed the lawsuit last year in county court against 
73-year-old Henry Armstrong of Studio City, Calif., alleging he 
gave false statements to The National Enquirer for his own 
financial benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accused Armstrong of telling the tabloid in 1997  
that Allen appeared ``drunk or high'' when the actor struck him 
with his sports car. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was dismissed in May.  
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, (Allen) learned the defendant was in ill health  
and out of humanitarian reasons decided not to pursue the case any 
further,'' said Allen's attorney, Michael Novak. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he was crossing a street in California in March  
1997 when he was hit by Allen's Ferrari, flew into the air and 
landed on the car. Allen was not ticketed.

<HEADLINE> More Surgery for Ex-Indiana Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Former Indiana basketball star Luke Recker  
checked into Methodist Hospital on Thursday, where he will undergo 
surgery Friday for a wrist fracture doctors didn't detect until 
three days after the Colorado traffic accident that killed another 
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``A review of his original X-rays following continued swelling  
on his left wrist led doctors to determine he does have a fracture 
of a small bone in his left wrist,'' Joe Wade Plunk, a spokesman 
for Mercy Hospital in Durango, Colo., said Wednesday. Recker was 
released from Mercy on Thursday and flew to Indianapolis by private 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, who transferred to Arizona after last season, severely  
lacerated his left ear in the three-vehicle accident Saturday night 
that killed the driver of the car Recker was in. Recker's 
girlfriend, Kelly Craig, 19, and her brother, Jason Craig, 17, both 
of Jasper, Ind., were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk said Recker seemed in good spirits during a visit  
Wednesday, but ``his main concern is his girlfriend, who is in the 
hospital in Farmington, N.M. He more or less feels helpless to help 
her, and now he's going back to Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly Craig, who suffered a spinal fracture and partial  
paralysis, remained in serious condition at San Juan Regional 
Medical Center in Farmington. Jason Craig was in critical condition 
Thursday night with a head injury, according to Diana Candelaria, 
the hospital's vice president of emergency and clinical services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I'm just so scared -- scared for my girlfriend and  
her brother,'' Recker told The Durango Herald on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I get healthy and Kelly and Jason are healthy, I'll be  
anxious to get back on the court,'' he said. ``But right now, it's 
not the most important thing to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker and four friends were injured in the accident near  
Durango. Recker was a passenger in a vehicle driven by John 
Hollberg, 23, of Senoia, Ga., who was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, 21, must sit out the upcoming season under NCAA transfer  
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the pickup truck, identified as Bob Hardwick, 21,  
of Durango, was being held on $50,000 bond for investigation of 
vehicular homicide, reckless driving, driving under the influence, 
careless driving resulting in bodily injury and vehicular assault.

<HEADLINE> Future of Milwaukee Stadium Unclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A lighted numeric sign has counted down the  
days until the Milwaukee Brewers open Miller Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The display, visible from the freeway that runs past both County  
Stadium and the new park, read 261 on Wednesday. After an accident 
killed three workers and seriously damaged the new stadium, the 
display was dark Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not. We  
could just as likely be opening on time as not opening on time,'' 
said Brewers spokesman Laurel Prieb, the husband of team president 
Wendy Selig-Prieb and son-in-law of baseball commissioner Bud 
Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	A 567-foot crane collapsed while lifting a piece of the  
retractable roof Wednesday, crushing another crane and landing 
heavily on the first-base side of the $400 million ballpark. Winds 
were gusting to 26 mph at the time of the crane collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind telling anybody it is about as painful an  
experience as I have ever gone through in my life. Very sad. Very 
emotional,'' Selig said in Seattle, where he attended the opening 
of Safeco Field. ``While I'm very glad to be here tonight for a lot 
of reasons, you will understand my heart is still in Milwaukee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite several hundred tons of smashed, mangled structure, the  
Brewers insisted plans to open the ballpark next April haven't been 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never been through anything like this in my life,''  
Selig-Prieb said. ``The only thing we know for sure is that Miller 
Park will be built, it will have a retractable roof and it will be 
second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prieb said the team is playing ``a very secondary role in what  
is going on'' in the investigation of the accident. The team's most 
pressing concerns are financial burdens and public relations 
problems that delays might cause. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the main concerns are finding replacements for  
the crane and for the roof pieces, which are made with a type of 
steel manufactured only in Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee postponed its Thursday night game against the Kansas  
City Royals rescheduled it as part of a doubleheader Friday. Both 
teams held closed workouts Thursday at County Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers also plan to wear a memorial patch featuring the  
logo of the ironworkers' local union. 
</P>
<P>
	The team announced that the County Stadium bleachers -- the  
section of the old park closest to the accident -- will be closed 
until the investigation is complete. Fans with tickets for the 
bleachers will be given different seats for their game or another. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a family in the Brewers organization and in the  
Milwaukee community,'' Brewers outfielder Jeromy Burnitz said. 
``The workers at Miller Park are a part of our family, and this 
loss has affected us all very deeply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials stressed that County Stadium is completely safe.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is still a dangerous area for when they start picking  
things up, but it won't affect the activity in the other 
ballpark,'' fire chief Larry Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, the team has planned its marketing and  
publicity agendas around Miller Park's existence. The team's slogan 
for the current season is ``Bringing Down the House,'' and County 
Stadium was scheduled for demolition this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the team faces the prospect of remaining in County Stadium  
in 2000 and even beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Any delay in opening the ballpark would deprive the Brewers of  
millions of dollars in revenue. Fortunately for the Brewers, the 
Miller Park project is thoroughly insured, members of the stadium's 
board of directors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The project has $325 million in property insurance and $70  
million in liability insurance, with a deductible of $25,000, board 
member Bill Duckett said. The policy also contains a rider covering 
actual lost income sustained by the Brewers if the stadium is 
unable to open on time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You pay large premiums for policies like this, and you hope  
you'll never have to use them,'' board chair Bob Trunzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents in five counties surrounding the stadium have paid a  
0.1 percent stadium sales tax since 1996 to help fund the project. 
A recent audit concluded the tax must remain in effect until 2014. 
</P>
<P>
	Brent Emons, business manager for Ironworkers Local 8 which  
represents workers on the project, said some workers were doubtful 
it was safe to do the lift Wednesday because of the winds.

<HEADLINE> Differences Between HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Differences between Senate Democratic and Republican versions of  
a ``patients' bill of rights,'' as shown in votes Thursday, all won 
by Republicans: 
</P>
<P>
                          *WHO IS COVERED?   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have covered all Americans who have private  
health insurance -- an estimated 161 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Many provisions only apply to 48 million Americans  
who are in plans that are regulated only by federal law. This 
includes greater access to emergency rooms, specialists, 
medications and the right to choose a health plan that allows them 
to use doctors who are outside a defined network. 
</P>
<P>
                            *RIGHT TO SUE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Wanted to let patients who are harmed by the denial  
of care sue their health insurance companies and collect damages. 
Current law only allows patients to recoup the cost of denied 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: No new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>
                  *OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have let women see OB-GYN doctors without prior  
approval and designate them as a primary care physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow women to see them without prior approval, but  
not to designate them as primary care doctors. Only applies to 
federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                        *EMERGENCY ROOM CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Wanted to require health plans to pay for reasonable  
care even if the hospital is outside the network. That includes 
care needed to stabilize patients and follow-up care after they are 
medically stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Altered provision to more closely match Democrats,  
but only applies to federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                          *CLINICAL TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have required health plans to pay the routine  
health care costs associated with clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Only included cancer patients.  
</P>
<P>
                         *MEDICAL NECESSITY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have given doctors more say over what care is  
provided by forcing health plans to pay for medically necessary 
care. They defined that as care consistent with generally accepted 
principles of professional medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow plans to continue determining what care is  
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
                            *MASTECTOMY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Required that health plans pay for overnight hospital  
stays if doctor and patient want it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Added virtually identical provision. Unlike other  
aspects of the GOP bill, applies to all Americans with private 
health insurance, about 161 million people. 
</P>
<P>
                         *CONTINUITY OF CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Allow patients who are pregnant or undergoing a  
course of treatment to keep their doctors for 90 days, even if the 
doctor leaves the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Similar, but only applies to patients who are  
pregnant, terminally ill or institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
                            *TAX CHANGES   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow people who are self-employed to deduct the  
cost of health insurance and create a new deduction for long-term 
care. Allow more medical savings accounts, which let people to set 
aside money, tax-free, to pay for routine care if they buy a 
high-deductible insurance policy in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
                             *APPEALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health plans to allow patients to appeal denials,  
first through an internal process and then to experts outside the 
plan. But Republicans would only allow for appeals based on medical 
necessity, not procedural issues. 
</P>
<P>
                      *INFORMATION DISCLOSURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health insurance companies to disclose details  
about what they cover and how they operate.

<HEADLINE> Part of Energy Dept. Budget Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In another fallout over allegations of Chinese  
espionage, a House subcommittee today directed that $1 billion of 
the Energy Department's budget be withheld until Congress 
reorganizes the department's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on energy and water, said reforms to improve nuclear 
weapons security were essential before the $1 billion in DOE 
operating funds will be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee action was taken as the panel approved the  
fiscal 2000 energy and water appropriations bill. The legislation 
will be considered by the full House in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has a budget of about $18 billion, but  
most of that goes to contractors. The $1 billion withheld for DOE 
operations represents a large part of the department's direct, 
noncontractor spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to be withheld until Congress restructures the  
department's national security programs or establishes an 
independent agency to oversee and manage their operations, Packard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been growing sentiment among lawmakers to create a  
largely autonomous agency within the Energy Department responsible 
for nuclear weapons programs, including operation of the three 
nuclear weapons labs and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said he is willing to  
accept in theory creation of a semiautonomous agency as long as 
it's clear the energy secretary has authority over the agency. He 
also wants security and counterintelligence functions to be 
departmentwide and not confined to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A largely Republican proposal gaining momentum in the Senate  
would create a semiautonomous agency, but insulate it more from the 
rest of the department than what Richardson has been willing to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some Republican members of the House, including  
Packard, would prefer to have the nuclear programs taken away from 
the Energy Department altogether, and create a totally independent 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But House members are divided on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven House committee and subcommittee chairmen wrote a letter  
to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., this week urging him to 
oppose any effort to restructure the Energy Department without 
further hearings and review. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce Committee chairman, and F.  
James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., the Science Committee chairman, 
warned against trying to make ``quick fixes'' at the Energy 
Department that could harm science research programs and hinder 
safety and environmental protection at the weapons facilities.

<HEADLINE> Starter Winning Bid Is $46 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- A consortium of five companies  
successfully bid $46 million for the trademark and sports apparel 
inventory of Starter Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, approved by Chief Judge Peter Walsh of the U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., is expected to be completed 
in 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
	New Haven, Conn.-based Starter, which makes sports apparel  
bearing professional and college team logos, has been under Chapter 
11 bankruptcy protection since April 19. The company listed assets 
of $118.1 million and liabilities of $120.5 million in its 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's licensing agreements with the major league sports  
must be renegotiated by the new owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium was led by Columbus, Ohio-based Schottenstein  
Stores Corp., whose Value City Department Stores Inc. would receive 
the inventory. The other members of the consortium are LogoAthletic 
of Indianapolis, which is a partner of Puma NA, maker of athletic 
shoes and gear; Sol Werdiger of Outer Stuff Ltd. and Franco Apparel 
Group, both of New York; and Parthenon Capital of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited and we believe the group that was put  
together will take Starter to a higher level ... and make it one of 
the preeminent brands in the country,'' said Jay Schottenstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter has a manufacturing plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; a  
distribution center in Memphis, Tenn.; and 18 retail outlets 
nationwide. In June, Ozer Group of Massachusetts was named to 
oversee the liquidation of Starter's retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company sold assets of its Memphis plant to Daisy Tech  
International for $2.5 million. The assets of a facility in Iowa 
went to Valley Products, Inc., of Cedar Rapids, Mich., for 
$125,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Starter Corp. founder David A. Beckerman announced  
his resignation as president and chief executive officer. Beckerman 
founded the company in 1971, and it quickly became one of the 
largest manufacturers of team-licensed sportswear, holding 
contracts with the National Football League, National Basketball 
Association, Major League Baseball, National Hockey League, more 
than 150 colleges and universities, and World Championship 
Wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	With its signature team jacket, Starter also marketed clothing  
and accessories bearing its own name and logos to the public. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company was forced into bankruptcy because company  
executives couldn't come up with a new game plan to compete with 
big names like Nike and Adidas, which could afford to take chances 
and even lose money in exchange for exposure on the playing field 
and in the locker room, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, the company also was shoved to the sidelines by  
mainstream apparel retailers that wanted a piece of the action, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's 1997 annual report, Beckerman admitted Starter  
was being marginalized by the competition. He said the company also 
faced difficulties because of increasing royalty and marketing 
expenses demanded by the leagues.

<HEADLINE> Rugova Returns to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo Albanian political leader  
Ibrahim Rugova made his long-awaited return from wartime exile 
today, declaring he is still president of the province as crowds of 
supporters chanted his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the warm welcome, Rugova faces what likely will be a  
stern test of his power to unify Kosovo's Albanians and temper 
their desire for vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I am president,'' said the pacifist leader, who twice won  
in unrecognized elections in Kosovo, as he crossed into the Serb 
province from neighboring Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy to be back in a free Kosovo,'' said Rugova,  
returning from exile in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the mass return of hundreds of thousands of ethnic  
Albanians to Kosovo just weeks after the end of mass expulsions by 
the Serbs ``a miracle of God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in a message to Kosovo Serbs fearful of retribution by  
ethnic Albanians, he declared: ``We ... are not in favor of seeing 
any other ethnic group moving out of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people cheered and threw flowers in nearly every  
town he passed through on the drive north to Pristina, the 
provincial capital. Some chanted ``Rugova! Rugova!'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 1,500 people applauded his arrival for a meeting with  
the chief U.N. administrator in Kosovo, Sergio Vieira de Mello. 
Rugova was accompanied by Christopher Hill, Washington's ambassador 
to Macedonia and envoy to Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	A pacifist moderate, Rugova could help the United Nations  
establish critical support from Kosovo's majority Albanian 
population for its efforts to rebuild demolished institutions and 
re-establish political life. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova said he intended ``to work with the international  
community,'' adding: ``I am very happy to be part of the 
reconstruction of economic and democratic life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rugova's popularity has diminished during his extended  
exile. A rival, Kosovo Liberation Army leader Hashim Thaci, has in 
the meantime staked his claim as the ethnic Albanians' sole leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he needed time to secure support, Rugova resisted  
pressure from Thaci to return after NATO troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Rugova's authority also was eroded by wartime photographs  
showing him shaking hands with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic and by statements made during his house arrest in 
Pristina during the Serb offensive that made it appear he was 
taking a more conciliatory position. He said the statements were 
made under duress. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe political life in Kosovo will have a new  
direction,'' said Eqrem Kryeziu, an official of Rugova's Democratic 
League of Kosovo, who was with a delegation that greeted him at the 
border. ``I don't believe he has lost support, because we have 
political maturity that overcomes these secondary matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the presence of 32,000 NATO soldiers, the international  
community has been unable to stop growing attacks by ethnic 
Albanians against Serbs and Gypsies, accused of aiding Yugoslav 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	De Mello has expressed ``increasing alarm'' over the attacks and  
appealed to Kosovo Albanian leaders to discourage acts of 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killings, kidnapping, forced expulsions, house burnings and  
looting are a daily occurrence,'' he said in a statement Wednesday. 
``They cannot be excused by the suffering that has been inflicted 
in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Thaci has called directly on ethnic Albanians to stop the  
attacks, Rugova and his party have been less forceful -- despite 
their long-standing calls for pacifism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still stand by our position against violence,'' Milazim  
Krasniqi, a Democratic League spokesman, said. ``At the same time, 
we ask that every single Serb who committed atrocities be 
punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations also is seeking ethnic Albanian support for a  
multiparty council to create consensus for Kosovo's physical and 
political reconstruction. The Serbs have refused to participate, 
and no Albanian leader has yet agreed to join. 
</P>
<P>
	The absence of a single leader of Kosovo's Albanian population  
has hampered U.N. efforts at establishing a functioning 
administration and reopening state-run enterprises, most critically 
radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner, who is replacing de Mello as head of the U.N.  
mission, also arrives today. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, several  
pro-democracy activists were attacked while they organized signing 
of a petition for the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic, an 
opposition official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragan Kopcalic, of the Democratic Party, said three people were  
hospitalized and one activist, Slobodan Djodjevic, was seriously 
injured.

<HEADLINE> America's Beaches Need Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite improvements in state and local  
monitoring, America's beaches remain threatened by pollution and 
too many are not tested for water quality, according to a report 
Thursday by an environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ninth annual ``Testing the Waters'' survey of vacation  
beaches, the Natural Resources Defense Council reported a record 
number of beach closings and swimming advisories in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those were due to pollution stirred up by storms that  
hit southern California last year caused by the phenomenon known as 
El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	One positive reason for the large number of closings, the group  
reported, is better monitoring of water quality by state and local 
beach authorities. The report praises Myrtle Beach, S.C., and the 
state of Georgia -- derided as ``beach bums'' in previous annual 
reports -- for enacting new monitoring and public notification 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon and Washington still lack any  
regular monitoring of beach water for swimmer safety, while 
Mississippi, Texas and Puerto Rico test beaches but have no public 
notification programs, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are issuing this report ... as a reminder of how unchecked  
pollution continues to lower our quality of life and threaten 
public health,'' the NRDC wrote. ``We hope this will provide an 
incentive for Congress, the (Environmental Protection Agency), 
states and localities to improve controls over the sources of 
coastal pollution and to close the gaps in monitoring and public 
notification along our coasts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The annual report has been criticized for not recognizing  
distinctions among states with beaches. State officials in 
Washington, for instance, have pointed out that their beaches are 
used far less for swimming and surfing than beaches in states like 
Florida, New Jersey and California. 
</P>
<P>
	The NRDC says nine states -- Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,  
Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and 
Pennsylvania -- ``comprehensively monitor most or all of their 
beaches and notify the public when health hazards exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NRDC reported there were at least 7,236 days of closings and  
advisories in 1998 at ocean, bay, Great Lakes and freshwater 
beaches around the nation. There also were 41 extended closings and 
advisories lasting six to 12 weeks, and 36 that lasted more than 12 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the beach closings and advisories were the result of  
tests that showed unhealthy levels of bacteria in the water, 
usually caused by sewage or stormwater discharges. About a quarter 
of the closings were caused by a specific pollution event.

<HEADLINE> Senator's Move May signal GOP Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Until Sen. Bob Smith quit the Republican  
Party, its leaders weren't paying much attention to his quixotic 
campaign for president. 
</P>
<P>
	A candidate with marginal support can't make waves. Smith has,  
with unintended help from the GOP party hierarchy he accused of 
forsaking conservative principles for polls and pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Smith episode will be a brief one, unless his switch to  
independent proves to be a symptom of real conservative discontent 
and not just one candidate's frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	The newly independent senator from New Hampshire said his  
``gut-wrenching political decision'' was to get out of a party that 
made a sucker of him by claiming devotion to principles it isn't 
pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a decision of conscience,'' he told the Senate. It can't  
be a good political career move -- he now plans to seek the 
presidency on a minor party ticket, his Senate committee standing 
is at risk, and he would have to take on the New Hampshire GOP as 
well as the Democrats to win a third term in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Republican chairman, Steve Duprey, said the switch  
would signal the end of Smith's political career in New Hampshire, 
where he was narrowly re-elected last time. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that while he was breaking with the Republican  
establishment and its party machinery, he intends to stay in the 
Senate GOP caucus and to vote for its leaders, so long as there is 
``no retaliation or punitive action taken against me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate committee rank is based on party seniority, and Sen.  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., the majority leader, has said Republicans 
might decide that an independent can't be a chairman. Smith is 
chairman of the Ethics Committee, and in line to be chairman of the 
Environment and Public Works Committee in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	There's more precedent for switching between parties -- two  
current Senate Republicans were first elected as Democrats -- than 
for leaving one without joining the other. Sen. Harry F. Byrd of 
Virginia quit the Democrats to run as an independent in 1970, 
winning then and again in 1976. Sen. Wayne Morse of Oregon broke 
with the Republican ticket in 1952, became an independent, and then 
switched to the Democratic side. 
</P>
<P>
	Morse lost his prime committee assignments when he went  
independent. Byrd kept his. For Republicans to oust Smith now would 
risk the wrath of conservative activists, already complaining about 
the public scolding the senator got from the GOP national chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson wrote Smith before the switch that his inability  
to move past 1 percent in the presidential campaign polls reflected 
his own redundancy and failure as a messenger. That rebuke 
magnified what Smith was doing, made it a topic on the Sunday TV 
talk shows, and stirred angry retorts on the right. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's petty and it's vindictive and it's insulting,'' Smith  
said of the Nicholson letter when he announced his switch in the 
Senate on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Republican Pat Buchanan called it arrogant and  
stupid. Buchanan said in a TV interview the Republican 
establishment was almost forcing a fracture with the party's 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said he'd seen reports that he and other candidates  
might be asked to sign a loyalty oath to the eventual Republican 
ticket. ``I'm not signing any oath,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith isn't the real problem. His impact as a minor party  
candidate probably would be negligible and marginal, as Nicholson 
said. Smith may wind up running for the U.S. Taxpayers Party, which 
drew scattered votes in the past two presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The greater risk for Republicans would be the defection of a  
conservative like Buchanan, to seek to run on the Reform Party 
ticket, on which Ross Perot challenged the major parties in 1992 
and 1996. There's been speculation he might try that. 
</P>
<P>
	While Buchanan hasn't ruled it out, he said he is a Republican  
and is running as one, although against what he and other 
conservatives call ``the Republican establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They mean the lineup of party leaders, donors, and endorsers who  
have signed on with Texas Gov. George Bush, front-running in the 
polls and in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	When Republican Rep. John B. Anderson of Illinois quit the GOP  
primary campaign in 1980 and ran as an independent, he aimed at the 
political center, and got 7 percent of the vote, as Ronald Reagan 
was elected president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican challenge in 2000, as in every campaign since  
Reagan's two elections, will be to satisfy and mobilize 
conservatives.

<HEADLINE> Nancy Kerrigan Sues Internet Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Figure skater Nancy Kerrigan filed a lawsuit  
Thursday against a company she says is using her name to sell 
sexually explicit pictures over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suit filed in Essex Superior Court, Kerrigan accuses FSX  
Network Communications Corp., of Staten Island, N.Y., of inserting 
her name 32 times into a 22-line text page in an effort to get 
search engines to point to the site whenever a computer user 
requests information on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The text page links to three pages where sexually explicit  
pictures are for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also names Bill Tay of Staten Island as a principal of  
FSX and Linda Zoker as the owner of the company's telephone lines. 
Four other companies believed to be associated with the sites are 
named as well. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the parties named in the suit could be located for  
comment. Kerrigan's lawyer, Victor Polk, believed there might only 
be one person behind the Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with all of these pornographers, it is very hard to follow  
the trail,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks to have Kerrigan's name permanently removed from  
the site, as well as unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
	The names Audrey Hepburn, Brooke Shields, Connie Chung and Jane  
Seymour are used in a fashion similar to Kerrigan's, and Polk 
believes the names of as many as 500 other well-known women are 
also being used to lure web surfers to the FSX site. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, Kerrigan settled a lawsuit against a California  
company she accused of displaying false sexually explicit pictures 
of her on the Internet. And Polk said a lawsuit is pending against 
a company that had been selling such pictures on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan, 29, won a silver medal at the Lillehammer Olympic  
Games in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Differences Between HMO Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Differences between Senate Democratic and Republican versions of  
a ``patients' bill of rights,'' as shown in votes Thursday, all won 
by Republicans: 
</P>
<P>
                          *WHO IS COVERED?   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have covered all Americans who have private  
health insurance -- an estimated 161 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Many provisions only apply to 48 million Americans  
who are in plans that are regulated only by federal law. This 
includes greater access to emergency rooms, specialists, 
medications and the right to choose a health plan that allows them 
to use doctors who are outside a defined network. 
</P>
<P>
                            *RIGHT TO SUE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Wanted to let patients who are harmed by the denial  
of care sue their health insurance companies and collect damages. 
Current law only allows patients to recoup the cost of denied 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: No new rights to sue.  
</P>
<P>
                  *OBSTETRICIANS AND GYNECOLOGISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have let women see OB-GYN doctors without prior  
approval and designate them as a primary care physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow women to see them without prior approval, but  
not to designate them as primary care doctors. Only applies to 
federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                        *EMERGENCY ROOM CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Wanted to require health plans to pay for reasonable  
care even if the hospital is outside the network. That includes 
care needed to stabilize patients and follow-up care after they are 
medically stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Altered provision to more closely match Democrats,  
but only applies to federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
                          *CLINICAL TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have required health plans to pay the routine  
health care costs associated with clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Only included cancer patients.  
</P>
<P>
                         *MEDICAL NECESSITY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Would have given doctors more say over what care is  
provided by forcing health plans to pay for medically necessary 
care. They defined that as care consistent with generally accepted 
principles of professional medical practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow plans to continue determining what care is  
medically necessary. 
</P>
<P>
                            *MASTECTOMY   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Required that health plans pay for overnight hospital  
stays if doctor and patient want it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Added virtually identical provision. Unlike other  
aspects of the GOP bill, applies to all Americans with private 
health insurance, about 161 million people. 
</P>
<P>
                         *CONTINUITY OF CARE   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: Allow patients who are pregnant or undergoing a  
course of treatment to keep their doctors for 90 days, even if the 
doctor leaves the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Similar, but only applies to patients who are  
pregnant, terminally ill or institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
                            *TAX CHANGES   	
</P>
<P>
	Democrats: No provision.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans: Allow people who are self-employed to deduct the  
cost of health insurance and create a new deduction for long-term 
care. Allow more medical savings accounts, which let people to set 
aside money, tax-free, to pay for routine care if they buy a 
high-deductible insurance policy in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
                             *APPEALS   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health plans to allow patients to appeal denials,  
first through an internal process and then to experts outside the 
plan. But Republicans would only allow for appeals based on medical 
necessity, not procedural issues. 
</P>
<P>
                      *INFORMATION DISCLOSURE   	
</P>
<P>
	Both require health insurance companies to disclose details  
about what they cover and how they operate.

<HEADLINE> Killer Suspected in Unsolved Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- More than 200 murders cases are being reviewed  
for possible ties to the Mexican drifter already charged in four 
slayings and linked with five others, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has gotten calls, letters and faxes from police agencies  
around the country that believe murders in their jurisdictions 
could be the work of suspected railroad killer Angel Maturino 
Resendez. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the 39-year-old drifter is tied to nine slayings and  
charged in four. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston FBI agent Brian Loader said Thursday that most of the  
200 cases will be eliminated because ``some of the crime scenes 
don't match.'' Still, all clues are being considered, and cases are 
coming in as quickly as old ones can be ruled out, Loader said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the requests, which came from police in practically  
every state, had to be put aside during the intense six-week 
manhunt for Maturino Resendez. The illegal immigrant surrendered 
Tuesday to a Texas Ranger in El Paso. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI had to put all of their emphasis on the manhunt,''  
Loader said. ``We knew after he was caught we would have time and 
go back and see if they can provide any evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the FBI has helped Lexington, Ky., police connect  
Maturino Resendez to a 1997 slaying of a college student, based on 
evidence that was similar to that collected at the scene of recent 
killings in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI maintains a database that logs and compares violent  
crimes by possible forensic evidence and by similar 
characteristics, such as the type of weapon used and how the crime 
scene appears. 
</P>
<P>
	Forensic evidence, such as DNA and fingerprints, have been  
collected from the nine slayings linked to Maturino Resendez and 
are being matched with samples taken from him shortly after his 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	He is charged with capital murder in the east Texas town of  
Hughes Springs and murder in Illinois and Kentucky. He could get 
the death penalty in the Hughes Springs case, the slaying of an 
87-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also charged with burglarizing the home of a Houston-area  
doctor killed in December. If Maturino Resendez's DNA matches 
evidence left in her home, Houston prosecutors plan to also charge 
him with capital murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez -- who was called by one of his aliases, Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez, during the manhunt -- is being held without bond 
at the Harris County Jail in Houston. He surprisingly surrendered 
to American authorities instead of those in Mexico, which routinely 
refuses to extradite people subject to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Tanner, one of two court-appointed attorneys for Maturino  
Resendez, said the Mexican consulate would be contacted to work on 
the accused man's behalf. A consular official had no comment 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping that the Mexican consulate helps, and any  
persuasion they might bring, to keep the state from seeking the 
death penalty,'' Tanner said. ``He and his family understood that 
he would be treated humanely, and he doesn't think that if they're 
going to seek the death penalty, that that's humane.''

<HEADLINE> Accused Ex-Deputy Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- A retired California sheriff's deputy who  
vanished after providing tissue samples that linked him to the 1985 
slaying of a colleague was found dead in an apparent suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles police said a love triangle may have led to the  
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA tests unavailable 14 years ago were performed on blood and  
hair evidence, implicating Ted Eugene Kirby in the death of Los 
Angeles County sheriff's Sgt. George Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	A manhunt for Kirby ended Wednesday when a television reporter  
and photographer who were searching the 54-year-old's Spokane 
neighborhood found a decomposed body three blocks from his home. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife, Denise, told authorities he left June 30 without  
explanation after having provided the DNA samples. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Los Angeles authorities issued a capital murder  
warrant for Kirby. They said the samples linked him to the June 1, 
1985, shooting death of Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Pomeroy, Los Angeles deputy police chief, said the FBI  
was confident the body was that of Kirby, who retired in 1996 
before moving to this eastern Washington city. 
</P>
<P>
	A handgun was found with the body, which ``appeared to have some  
sort of head trauma,'' said Spokane County sheriff's Deputy David 
Reagan. ``There is nothing inconsistent, at this time, with this 
being a suicide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	KHQ-TV reporter Gary Darigol said he and a photographer began  
searching the hilly, wooded neighborhood after hearing reports that 
Kirby might have been suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur was 37 when he was shot in his van moments after leaving  
work at the Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles. Detectives believe 
Kirby, who also worked at the jail, hid inside the van. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur was behind the wheel when he was shot, causing the  
vehicle to crash. Witnesses said they saw a man crawl from the 
wreckage and limp away. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, however, there was no DNA technology to link  
possible suspects to hair and blood samples found in the van. In 
April, investigators reopened the case and took saliva and other 
DNA samples from several people, including Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
	A love triangle may have been the motive, police sources told  
the Los Angeles Times. Detectives said Wednesday that Kirby might 
have killed Arthur out of jealousy, but they did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio in Thailand Tizzy Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Leonardo DiCaprio is starring in a new  
ruckus in Thailand -- Customs officials want a piece of his gift to 
a school. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, activists began hounding DiCaprio because they  
claimed his movie ``The Beach'' caused environmental damage to an 
island. 
</P>

	Now Customs officers have seized a parcel containing 120  
videotapes DiCaprio sent to students at a private school on the 
outskirts of Bangkok. The officials said $324 in duty is owed, but 
the school doesn't have the money, the Thai Rath newspaper reported 
Thursday. 
</P>

	The videos are mostly a profile of the star and copies of  
``Titanic.''

<HEADLINE> Catholic Monks Selling Caskets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. MEINRAD, Ind. (AP) -- Now, you too can be laid to rest in an  
authentic replica of the plain, wooden coffins used for more than a 
century to bury dozens of Benedictine monks at St. Meinrad 
Archabbey. 
</P>
<P>
	Abbey Caskets, a new marketing division of the Roman Catholic  
monastery and theology school in southern Indiana, opened for 
business last month offering one product -- caskets similar to those 
handcrafted by the monks for their brethren. 
</P>
<P>
	The casket, which is only slightly more ornate than the real  
thing, is made from poplar and available in either a natural finish 
or a cherry stain. The cost is $1,750 plus shipping, with or 
without the optional cross inlay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not out to compete with the industry. That's not what  
this is about,'' said the Rev. Julian Peters, the division's 
associate director. ``We have a very specific group of people to 
whom we think this is going to appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archabbey already operates a successful business called  
Abbey Press, which makes and sells religious and inspirational 
gifts, greeting cards and books. Monks created Abbey Press more 
than 130 years ago to handle in-house printing. 
</P>
<P>
	As with Abbey Press, profits from Abbey Caskets will be used to  
help support the archabbey's operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The monks began studying the idea of casket sales in February  
1997 after years of inquiries from interested students, alumni, 
family members and area residents. Many liked the coffins used for 
interring monks at the archabbey's cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody had said, 'Why don't you sell your caskets, your  
coffins, the things that you guys are buried in,''' Peters said. 
``So we said, 'We help people to live, so it seems sensible that we 
should help them in death.''' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, St. Meinrad Archabbey announced the creation of Abbey  
Caskets. Peters isn't aware of another monk-run casket business in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The caskets being sold to the public aren't identical to the  
monks' coffins, which are little more than nailed-together wooden 
boxes with dowel rods for handles and white sheets for lining. 
</P>
<P>
	The Abbey Caskets product retains the same classic shape: narrow  
at the head and feet and wide at the shoulders. But while still 
somewhat plain, it offers such refinements as a nicer finish, 
full-size wooden handles and a fully lined cloth interior. 
</P>
<P>
	A customer can choose to have a cross design engraved into the  
casket lid. A matching cross placed in the inset can be removed 
before burial and retained as a family keepsake. 
</P>
<P>
	Local woodworkers, not monks, make the caskets. Peters said he  
was confident that buyers will be satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who will be attracted by the price,'' he  
said. ``But we hope they will be buying it because of the quality, 
the authenticity, the craftsmanship and the value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The average casket sold in America costs $2,176 and is outfitted  
with velvet interior inside an 18-gauge steel chamber, according to 
the National Funeral Directors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Wend, treasurer of the National Casket Retailers  
Association, a trade organization, said she believes the monks can 
carve out a niche in the marketplace. She said her own business, 
Affordable Casket Co., based in Southgate, Mich., hears from at 
least one person each week looking for a similarly austere coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they can reach enough people and let them know it's  
available, I'm sure there's a market,'' Wend said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential buyers can make an appointment to see display samples  
at Abbey Caskets, which is temporarily housed in an old storage 
building on the archabbey's picturesque 250-acre campus. Those 
unwilling or unable to make the trip can order a casket by 
telephone or via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The monks placed an initial order of 15 caskets, four of which  
had been sold as of this week, said Barbara Crawford, a spokeswoman 
for the archabbey. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain element of confidence that it's going to be  
successful,'' Peters said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Gun Control Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After listening to a group of Colorado  
teen-agers, President Clinton urged Congress on Thursday to pass 
gun control legislation before school resumes this fall. ``Don't 
allow the victims at Columbine to have died in vain,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, joined by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and  
Attorney General Janet Reno, met at the White House with 95 
students who made the trip to Washington to lobby Congress on gun 
control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the students attended Columbine High School in Littleton,  
Colo., site of the most deadly of all the school shootings. The 
April 20 Columbine shootings left 15 dead, including the two 
killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton emerged from the meeting saying the young people were  
``plainly impatient'' with Congress for moving so slowly on gun 
legislation and deserved to return home believing that lawmakers 
would heed their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask Congress to reaffirm these young people's faith in  
America, in our system of democracy,'' Clinton said. ``There are 
less than two months now before the start of a new school year. 
Let's show all our children that, when it comes to making their 
classrooms and communities safe from gun violence, America did not 
take a summer vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects for speedy action were delayed further during the  
day in Congress, a result of parliamentary difficulties and the 
pledge of one senator, Bob Smith, I-N.H., to thwart any efforts at 
compromise. Officials said it could be 10 days or longer before 
formal negotiations can even begin, depending on how far Smith 
wishes to carry his campaign in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, efforts to advance the issue are in limbo, for  
the second time, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., will be 
unable to keep a pledge to begin formal talks on compromise 
legislation. He first pledged to do so before lawmakers took a 
weeklong break over the Fourth of July. He then passed the word he 
would act this week, but those plans, too, have been put off. 
</P>
<P>
	As the students made their way from the White House to Capitol  
Hill, Hastert announced that he and House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., have formed a ``bipartisan working group on youth 
violence'' that will identify areas of consensus on proposals to 
reduce violence among young people and call them to the attention 
of House leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Capitol, students posed for photos with members of  
Congress and then broke up into small groups to lobby individual 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not want anyone else to lose a friend or a loved one like  
I did,'' said Erin Flynn, a Columbine student. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let you go into a new school year without this  
Congress taking action,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt told the students, ``You can be tremendously helpful in  
talking to a broad range of members about your feelings, your 
thoughts, what's important to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students also spoke with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who  
was elected to Congress on a gun-control stance after her husband 
was shot to death by a gunman aboard a Long Island commuter train 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the students they can expect formidable opposition from  
the National Rifle Association, but should have faith that most 
Americans are on their side. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when I first started lobbying, a lot of doors were  
closed in my face,'' McCarthy said. ``Unless Congress hears from 
the American people, we will have a tough time with the NRA 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore presented seven of the teens with an  
autographed tally of the May 21 Senate vote on requiring a 
background check for all firearms transactions at gun shows and 
pawn shops. The students were asking House members to support the 
Senate measure, which passed with the help of Gore's tie-breaking 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have to counterbalance the gun lobby with a  
family lobby that's more powerful,'' Gore told them. 
</P>
<P>
	The students' trip was organized by Handgun Control Inc. and  
SAFE (Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic), a political 
action group formed in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want action, not excuses, and we call on the rest of  
America to join with us,'' said David Winkler, a recent graduate of 
George Washington High School in Denver and a leader in SAFE. He 
said tougher gun control measures are needed now, noting that on a 
typical day, 13 children are slain in gun violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a Columbine every day,'' Winkler said. ``The problem is  
that the wrong people have easy access to firearms. We do not call 
for the abolition of guns. We call for reasonable gun legislation. 
Our country needs simple laws that are easy to understand and easy 
to enforce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president invited the students to the White House to help  
his campaign for mandatory background checks on all buyers at gun 
shows, and to require child safety locks on handguns. He criticized 
lawmakers for delaying gun legislation, noting that three months 
have passed since the Columbine tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't allow the victims at Columbine to have died in vain,''  
Clinton said. ``We must not lose the urgency of our mission.''

<HEADLINE> Montgomerie 3 Back at British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Maybe this finally is Colin  
Montgomerie's year. 
</P>
<P>
	While some of his rivals were shooting scores in the high 70s  
and 80s at windswept Carnoustie on Thursday, Montgomerie produced 
his best ever first-round performance at the British Open on the 
toughest links course the Royal and Ancient could find. 
</P>
<P>
	His 74 left him just three strokes off the lead and compared  
well with the 79s of U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart and David 
Duval, and much better than the 83 of defending titlist Mark 
O'Meara and 89 of teen-age star Sergio Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scot whose Open performances have been disappointing to the  
point of embarrassing, admitted his performance was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgetting the score, this is the best position I have been in  
and the best I've felt going into a second day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mind you, that's not really saying much, is it?.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have much of a record to go on here so anything is an  
improvement from what I have been showing at this tournament 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago at Troon, Montgomerie was playing at the course  
where he had played regularly as a youngster when his father was 
the course secretary. He shot a 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Monty missed the cut at Royal Birkdale last year, the fifth time  
he had failed to make the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the 36-year-old Scot, who is still searching for his first  
major after a decade of trying, feels he is in the right frame of 
mind to do well at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie has won three tournaments this season on the  
European Tour, the last being the Loch Lomond event on Saturday 
when he finished with a 7-under 64. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think last week's win has relaxed me into trying to enjoy  
this championship,'' he said. ``If you say I'm unnaturally calm 
that's up to you but I am more relaxed than I have been coming into 
here and, hopefully, I can improve it with the scores on the next 
three days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It looked like the same old story for Montgomerie when he double  
bogeyed the par-3 eighth hole to go three over. But he matched 
three bogeys with three birdies to stay three over by the end of 
the round. 
</P>
<P>
	``After eight, to play the next 10 holes on level par was a good  
effort,'' he said. ``It's the best I have felt after one round of 
the Open championship. I am hoping that I won't add many to that 
total tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He still found the course, with its thick, sometimes knee-length  
rough and narrow fairways, demanding and tiring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad to get off there,'' he said. I was up and down  
like a yo-yo. ``It's very tough. You've just got to live with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he didn't think like some players that the wind was the  
biggest influence to the high scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who do score badly here may say that,'' he said. ``It  
can blow worse than this. This is just a breezy summer's day here, 
nothing more than that. 
</P>
<P>
	``The course is very, very difficult and very, very demanding,  
the most demanding tournament that we have ever played,'' 
Montgomerie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was only 30 days ago that we were saying that Pinehurst was  
the hardest course that we have played. We're all changing our 
opinion coming here. Some of the shots that have to be hit can't be 
made, no one's that good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie prefers playing target golf to bump and run, links  
golf which makes Thursday's performance and score that much more 
impressive. He says he prefers the scores to come down to make the 
players look a little better. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average score of over 79 is the highest it has ever been  
in any major anywhere,'' Montgomerie said. ``Let's hope that the 
wind can die off and you can actually hit some shots that aren't 
going to look like you have hit bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been very fortunate at this tournament over the last  
few years. I have been saving it up I suppose.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Praises Greenspan's Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore sent a strong signal  
Thursday that he would favor reappointing Alan Greenspan to another 
term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, calling his performance 
``A-plus-plus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Greenspan's future, the Democratic presidential  
hopeful told reporters that it has been his policy and that of 
President Clinton to avoid discussing personnel matters until it 
was time for a decision. Greenspan's current term as chairman does 
not end until June 20, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore added, ``I'll send you the clearest signal I think is  
appropriate to send. ... I personally believe that no one could 
have possibly done a better job. I think he has done an outstanding 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said there had been times ``when I have doubted that. But  
fewer and fewer because I think the overall record is one of really 
an outstanding A-plus-plus performance. And so you can interpret 
that I hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's strong endorsement follows similar comments from the camp  
of the Republican presidential front-runner Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Lindsey, an economic adviser to Bush, has said that  
Clinton should not wait until Greenspan's term is over but announce 
now that he is reappointing Greenspan as a way to remove a major 
threat of market uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Greenspan has come to be seen as the economy's indispensable  
man and the prospect that he might depart when his term expires 
next June is creating uncertainty about the future course of 
monetary policy,'' Lindsey wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall 
Street Journal on July 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taken together, this is a potent recipe for economic trouble --  
the most effective remedy for which is for President Clinton to 
reappoint Mr. Greenspan at once for another term,'' wrote Lindsey, 
who served as a Fed board member with Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Clinton said earlier this month that he has yet to  
have a discussion with Greenspan about the Fed job. But there is a 
widespread view in Congress that Clinton is likely to ask Greenspan 
to stay on given that it would be difficult for Clinton, serving 
his last year in office, to win approval in the 
Repubican-controlled Senate for any other nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, 73, a prominent Republican economist, was first  
appointed Fed chairman in 1987 by Ronald Reagan. He is serving his 
third four-year term, having been reappointed by Presidents Bush 
and Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Meeting With Barak Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton launched a new U.S. drive  
for Mideast peacemaking today, looking to Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak for a formula to reopen negotiations with the 
Palestinians and to affirm he will give up West Bank land to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is holding to the idea that Israel's security depends on  
land-for-peace accords with all the Arabs. And from Barak the 
president hopes to hear that the stalled agreement to yield an 
additional 13.1 percent of the territory will be implemented soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak met this morning with his advisers at Blair House, the  
presidential guest house across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House endorsed Barak's statement that the United  
States should allow Israel and the Arabs to play the lead role in 
peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States government and the president have always  
taken the view that we are best served when we act as a facilitator 
or honest broker,'' press secretary Joe Lockhart said. ``And that 
no peace agreement can be imposed from the outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was planning on a three-hour meeting with Barak in the  
White House residence. After Barak sees Vice President Al Gore, 
Clinton, Barak and their wives will go to Camp David, Md., by 
helicopter for dinner there and breakfast together the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The personal relationship is very important,'' Lockhart said,  
and is an opportunity for Clinton ``to get to know the prime 
minister better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president and his advisers are openly exuberant that Barak  
is apt to tell them what he is prepared to concede to the 
Palestinians and Syria and what will remain for hard bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Palestinians are showing patience. ``It's not a question  
of trusting Mr. Barak. It's a question of allowing him the 
opportunity, and we will allow him the opportunity with all the 
good will we have,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath 
said at a conference in Geneva, Switzerland, on the West Bank and 
Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
	But, Shaath added, ``We don't like to see him delay much  
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged  
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who co-brokered a peace plan 
for Kosovo, to help get the Middle East peace process back on 
track. Finland currently holds the European Union presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We urge ... (Ahtisaari) to play a similar role in the peace  
process in the Middle East region because he enjoys prestige, 
respect and appreciation of all parties,'' Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Momentum is what the administration seeks, according to key  
strategists, and in Barak they believe they have found an Israeli 
leader who, while cautious, will also take risks for peace with the 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm eager as a kid with a new toy,'' Clinton said,  
anticipating their White House talks today and Monday and over two 
dinners in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that we can begin to energize the peace process in the  
Middle East on terms that are just and fair and will guarantee 
genuine security for Israel and a way of living for the 
Palestinians,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Clinton intends to sound out Barak on prospects for  
reopening stalled negotiations with Syria in which President Hafez 
Assad had been assured by the last Labor-led government he could 
get back the strategic Golan Heights enclave for the right peace 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	While formal talks have been in suspension for three years,  
former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disclosed Wednesday that 
while he was in office Syria secretly agreed to a long-term 
Israeli-staffed early warning station on the heights in the event 
of a negotiated Israeli withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials privately have blamed Netanyahu  
for causing the Arabs to distrust Israel and the peace process -- 
and are crediting his successor, Barak, with a cautious but keen 
commitment in making peace. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, before flying here, Barak said he preferred the United  
States scale back its role as ``policeman and judge'' and let 
Israel and the Arabs work out their problems directly. 
</P>
<P>
	And State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the United  
States intervened in the talks between Israel and the Palestinians 
in October at the Wye River resort in Maryland only when they were 
near collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, the more the parties can do themselves, the less we  
will need to be involved,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak also said that while he would resume an Israeli troop  
pullback in the West Bank, he would not stick to the tight 
timetable stipulated by the Wye land-for-security agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians disagreed with him on both points, suggesting  
that difficulties lie ahead. Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, secretary-general 
of the Palestinian Cabinet, said Wednesday the Wye accord must be 
implemented before Israel and the Palestinians could open 
negotiations on a final peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration again took a conciliatory stance toward  
Barak. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said ``there is nothing inconsistent'' between  
implementing the Wye accords while also proceeding with 
negotiations on a final settlement. ``Those two can happen at the 
same time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the State Department spokesman said, ``modest adjustment''  
in the timetable or in various provisions of the Wye accords were 
acceptable to the United States if the parties agreed on them.

	SABANA GRANDE, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Ramonita Belen can still smell  
the roses at the well where, as a schoolgirl in 1953, she caused a 
sensation by insisting she saw the Virgin Mary, standing on a 
cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other people also could smell the scent of roses that filled  
the air when she appeared,'' said Belen, whose 33 days of visions 
drew tens of thousands of people to the farming town of Sabana 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico's Catholic church never recognized Belen's visions,  
which she shared with two other children. But word spread 
throughout Latin America. Soon a shrine was built for what came to 
be known as Our Lady of the Rosary. It draws 100,000 pilgrims each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, believers have upset church leaders by planning a tourism  
complex, called Mystical City. It's centerpiece is to be a 
towering, 305-foot statue of the Virgin -- about the height of the 
Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	Set to begin this year, the project is to have observation  
decks, apartments, broadcast studios and a sanctuary, all inside 
the statue. It is expected to cost $40 million -- one-quarter of 
which has already been raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishops object to what they see as the Virgin's  
commercialization. Cardinal Luis Aponte Martinez, who retired as 
San Juan's archbishop May 8, urged Puerto Ricans not to contribute 
to a fund for the statue. 
</P>
<P>
	The church's problems with the believers' movement largely began  
in the late 1970s when one of the child visionaries, Juan Angel 
Collado, started delivering ``messages'' from the Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
	In them, Collado warned about a future ``spiritual and moral  
deterioration'' in the church and its pastors. 
</P>
<P>
	That upset church leaders, who eventually banned the celebration  
of Mass at the Sabana Grande shrine and in 1997 ordered a devotees' 
association to disband -- to no avail. The group claims to have 
thousands of supporters throughout Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Before retiring, Aponte Martinez called the devotees'  
association a ``cult'' whose leaders advocated unnecessary acts of 
penance such as habitual fasting and kneeling on pieces of waffled 
metal during prayer. The group threatened to sue the cardinal for 
defamation. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt us a lot,'' said Jose Ramirez, president of the  
Committee of the Well, which operates the Sabana Grande shrine. 
``All that was intended to defame us. We didn't practice any of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new archbishop, Roberto Gonzalez Nieves, has called for a  
truce while he studies the dispute, one of his first tests as 
leader of the island's estimated 2.8 million Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say that Puerto Rico's church has spent too much time  
battling the believers' group and too little time on crime, drugs, 
family violence and other challenges to Puerto Rican society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it matter whether there was an apparition or not?'' asked  
the Rev. Felix Struik, director of the Caribbean Center for 
Dominican Studies at Bayamon's Central University. ``The devotion 
is correct. ... There is no reason to say they can't worship the 
Virgin Mary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Mystical City could hurt the believers' cause, said  
Struik, a Catholic priest. 
</P>
<P>
	Undaunted, organizers have raised more than $10 million through  
commemorative brick sales, sponsorships of statue sections and 
fund-raisers in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Miami and 
elsewhere. They also hope to issue bonds to pay for construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Mystical City president Carlos Humberto Mercader said nearly all  
permits -- including one from the Federal Aviation Administration 
because of the statue's height -- are in place. Barring a new 
challenge from the church, government or other quarters, he said 
builders hope to finish by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a lighthouse of hope,'' Mercader said.  
</P>
<P>
	Belen, a 53-year-old health worker, frequently returns to the  
simple shrine built atop the former field of sugar cane where, as a 
child, she said she gazed at the Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few days of apparitions, she recalled, ``the  
mountain was full of thousands and thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they saw were (sugar cane stalks) bowing to her. Nature  
was happy that she was there,'' Belen said. ``She would create 
little whirlwinds from dry sugar cane stalks that whirled before 
her as she walked,'' and the pilgrims ``would make way for her.''

<HEADLINE> Injury Makes Wohlers Appreciative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Mark Wohlers held an unblemished National  
League baseball in his right hand, squeezing it ever so gently with 
his fingertips as he sat in the Cincinnati Reds dugout Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's about all the right arm can handle for now. It will be  
another four months before the closer known for his 95 mph fastball 
can grip the ball tightly, bring back his arm and toss it gently. 
</P>
<P>
	A bulky brace cradles the right elbow, which was rebuilt last  
week. Wohlers will be limited to daily therapy sessions for the 
near future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still can't comb my hair with my right arm or brush my  
teeth,'' Wohlers said Thursday. ``I have to do everything 
left-handed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He smiled slightly when he mentioned the limitations. And he  
smiled quite often as he talked about his latest hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	With little else to do but think, Wohlers has finally started to  
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just made me realize that with all the good things that  
have happened to me, I should enjoy those things as much as I dwell 
on the bad things,'' Wohlers said. ``Unfortunately, it might have 
taken this to open up my eyes a little bit and recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, I've got a beautiful little girl, I've been to four  
World Series, I've been to the playoffs six times in my career, 
I've won a world championship, I'm still young and relatively 
healthy. And with everything going on in the world, you just 
realize it's not that big of a deal -- it's a torn ligament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers, 29, cried after tests found that he had torn the  
ligament during a minor league outing last month. At the time, he 
thought he was getting close to a promotion to the majors after one 
year of trying to regain his control. 
</P>
<P>
	He got the final out in the Atlanta Braves' 1995 World Series  
victory over Cleveland, but lost his ability to throw strikes after 
injuring his side last season. Last April, the Braves traded him to 
the Reds, who hoped a new setting and some changes in his delivery 
would take care of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he has bigger worries.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews repaired the torn ligament, transplanted one  
from his left forearm to strengthen it and cleaned out some chips 
in the elbow. Recovery could take a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have experience in this area. Jose Rijo, their 1990  
World Series MVP, had the ligament in his pitching elbow replaced 
and never made it back. He started throwing too hard too quickly 
and needed more surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to do it right,'' Wohlers said. ``I know some guys  
who have had setbacks coming back from this, guys who tried to rush 
it. From what I've been through in the last year and a half and now 
this on top if it, I'm not really in any position to have any 
significant setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something were to happen and I have to get cut on again,  
somebody's telling me to open a restaurant or something.''

	Senate Passes Republican HMO Bill  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans, rolling over Democrats in  
a week of party-line votes, approved a modest set of patient 
protections today aimed at millions of Americans who fear 
cost-conscious HMOs may deny them needed care. ``This bill 
addresses the real problems many Americans face,'' said Senate

	House OKs Presidential Pay Raise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly today to give  
members of Congress a $4,600 pay raise in January and to double the 
next president's salary to $400,000. Lawmakers voted 276-147 to 
increase their own pay, rolling up nearly 2-1 margins among 
Republicans and Democrats alike. They then voted 334-82 to reject 
an effort by conservatives trying to prevent the presidential pay 
boost. The vote on legislators' salaries underlined the favorable 
political climate for the first raise since January 1998 and the 
second since 1993.

	White House Plays Down Bomb Report

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sought to minimize

neutron bomb, noting that intelligence reports for years have shown 
that Beijing has tested such a weapon. But in light of heightened 
tensions between China and Taiwan and the West, officials took care 
to note that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is vastly superior to 
China's.

<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The struggle to form a Northern  
Ireland government imploded today in chaos and anger, as the main 
Protestant party boycotted a crucial vote because of the Irish 
Republican Army's refusal to disarm. The British and Irish 
governments, which have spent months trying to coax the Protestants 
of the Ulster Unionist party to accept the Catholics of Sinn Fein 
as government colleagues, conceded that the damage could take 
months to repair.

	House OKs $4,600 Pay Raise  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy, budget surpluses and  
congressional popularity surging, the House today voted 276-147 to 
let lawmakers receive a cost-of-living pay raise exceeding $4,600. 
There was little debate on the issue. Leaders of both parties had 
the House vote on the pay hikes as the chamber began debating a 
bill financing the Treasury Department for the coming fiscal year. 
By law, legislators get automatic annual cost-of-living increases 
unless Congress votes against it. The Treasury measure is the 
traditional vehicle for the pay increases.

The Senate voted 53-47 against the provision, which Democrats had 
argued would force insurers to put a patient's health before the 
company bottom line. Health plans that fall under federal 
regulations cannot now be sued. The sponsor of the doomed 
amendment, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., had said: ``This is what 
the patients' bill of rights is all about.'' But Republicans said 
patients would suffer because of the cost of lengthy court fights.

students return to classes in September. The president met with 
more than 80 students from Colorado -- including some from Columbine 
High School -- to hear their concerns about the prospects of passage 
of tougher gun control laws. The president invited the students to 
the White House to help his campaign for mandatory background

new initiative, to be announced later today by the Energy 
Department, will end years of litigation between the government and 
workers who were exposed over three decades at weapons production 
facilities. ``This is long deserved and long overdue,'' Energy

<HEADLINE> Movie Puts Spotlight on Md. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURKITTSVILLE, Md. (AP) -- The scariest thing in Burkittsville  
isn't the Blair Witch. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the curiosity-seekers already converging on this small  
western Maryland town that was the setting for the horror film 
``The Blair Witch Project,'' a mock documentary opening nationally 
this month. It purports to show the final days of three student 
filmmakers who vanish mysteriously while traipsing through the 
Black Hills Forest to make a movie on the legendary witch of Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no such legend here. No Black Hills Forest. And  
there never was a town named Blair around here. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in Burkittsville -- which consists of just 75 old  
homes, a post office and a Lutheran church near a country 
crossroads at the base of South Mountain -- fear the sort of tourist 
siege that Amityville, N.Y., suffered 20 years ago after ``The 
Amityville Horror'' was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, council members approved payment for 10 additional  
patrol hours by a Frederick County sheriff's deputy during July and 
August, especially at an old graveyard featured in the film. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also sent a notice to the town's 214 residents  
disclaiming any advance knowledge of the production and warning: 
``After viewing the movie, people may want to come out and see what 
Burkittsville is really like. We ask that you be cautious and 
reinforce safety precautions within your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Joyce M. Brown said Burkittsville has ``a very Christian  
quality,'' with little patience for witches and such. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot know what impact this will have on the community,''  
she said, ``and it's better to be alert.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, someone has left chalk markings on the weathered  
tombstones at the old hillside cemetery. Some residents have 
received inquiries by e-mail from people following the film's 
marketing campaign on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Seals and John Henry, both 21, of nearby Frederick spent  
Thursday afternoon poking around Burkittsville cemeteries and 
searching for the spot where, according to the movie's elaborate 
mythology, the students' car was found after they disappeared in 
1994. Seals and Henry said they don't believe the movie is fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going by what my buddy saw on the Internet. And I  
saw the Sci-Fi Channel documentary on it,'' Seals said. The cable 
channel recently ran a program about the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, a native of  
neighboring Montgomery County, have acknowledged the story is 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The town was indeed founded in 1824, as the film says, but not,  
as it contends, on the site of an 18th-century community called 
Blair, where witchcraft was practiced. Burkittsville was originally 
known as Harley's Post Office, named for one of the two farmers -- 
Henry Burkitt was the other -- who settled the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's forest scenes were shot mostly in the Seneca Creek  
and Patapsco Valley state parks farther east. But South Mountain, 
the densely wooded ridge just west of Burkittsville, has its own 
ghostly folklore. 
</P>
<P>
	Fallen soldiers from the Civil War Battle of South Mountain are  
said to haunt the area. Along one stretch of road, known as Spook 
Hill, legend holds that your car will roll uphill, pushed by Civil 
War ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say if you put powder on your trunk and stop up there,  
you'll see the hand prints on your car,'' said John Millard, a 
farmhand who has lived in Burkittsville for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Elaine Canonico, owner of a gift shop in nearby Middletown,  
hopes for a little extra business if ``The Blair Witch Project'' 
makes Burkittsville a tourist draw. 
</P>
<P>
	And a few more visitors won't hurt the town, either, said  
Michael Smerkanich, president of the local historical society. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to have people visiting who are asking to  
try to find the different landmarks and, yeah, that's fine,'' he 
said. ``I think we are concerned that if it got to be too much -- 
bus groups going through and crowds of people dressed up as witches 
camping out -- that is certainly unwanted.''

<HEADLINE> Business Targets Family Leave Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Business groups are asking Congress to revamp  
a 1993 law that requires employers to give workers up to 12 weeks 
of unpaid medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants to expand the law to cover more  
employees, but Robert Verdisco, president of the International Mass 
Retail Association, said in a statement that ``clarifying and 
resolving'' problems with the law would make it ``more useful and 
easier to understand and comply with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said he suspects some opposition  
is coming from employers who would prefer not to have to comply the 
Family and Medical Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``I seem to be hearing from those who are looking through  
regulatory process as a way of undoing some of the legislation we 
achieved,'' Dodd said during a hearing Wednesday before the Senate 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee's panel on children 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
	Aug. 5 will mark the sixth anniversary of the law, which was  
intended to help employees balance the demands of work and family 
life. It applies to public agencies, public schools, and private 
employers with 50 or more workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The law has been a ``tremendous success,'' said John R. Fraser,  
deputy administrator of the Labor Department's wage and hour 
division. By Sept. 30, the department had received only 13,600 
complaints, ``an extremely small number given the millions of 
workers who have taken time off,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, he said, the Labor Department found no evidence of  
widespread problems or abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	But Edward Harold, a New Orleans lawyer who represents  
businesses in employment-related matters, said there are problems 
stemming from the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``The confusion that leads all these people to my door is not a  
product of the act itself,'' he said, but of the rules developed by 
the Labor Department, Harold said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that many of the regulations were written not to  
implement Congress's intent, but rather to expand the rights of 
employees beyond what Congress intended,'' Harold said. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems include getting enough information from employees on  
health problems that might qualify for the leave, and trying to 
determine what constitutes a ``serious illness,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has proposed revising the law to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make it apply to any business with 25 or more employees. The  
law now covers only about half of the work force, Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow eligible employees to take an additional 24 hours of  
unpaid leave each year to participate in their children's school 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Allow states to create innovative ways of using unemployment  
compensation payments to support people taking parental leave.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Publicist Keeps Eye on Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Cruise's publicist is hoping to keep  
close tabs on broadcasts involving the star's racy new movie, 
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PMK, the publicity firm that represents Cruise, distributed a  
waiver to media at a preview for ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' asking to see 
rough cuts in advance of any TV reports featuring interviews with 
the actor. 
</P>
<P>
	The waivers gave Cruise representatives the option to veto  
segments prior to broadcast and specified that unused video ``will 
be destroyed'' and news outlets must, if asked, ``supply evidence 
of such destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood'' were among  
those handed the waiver. ``Entertainment Tonight'' didn't sign the 
waiver, spokeswoman Kristy Barrett said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	PMK's Pat Kingsley has said the request to see advance footage  
was a mistake and that the requirement was rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone interviewing Cruise had to sign a revised waiver  
with the pledge that ``the interview and the program will not show 
the artist in a negative or derogatory manner.''

<HEADLINE> Latin American Markets Still Shaky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- It's becoming a scene that is all  
too familiar in Latin America: the dazed look of frantic floor 
traders, the flash of televised updates on tumbling stock prices, 
the rush of politicians to assure skittish investors that their 
slumping market is no cause for long-term concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's leading Merval Index tumbled 8.7 percent Monday on  
worries about Argentina's election-year recession and comments by 
one presidential candidate that appeared to suggest the need for a 
debt-repayment moratorium. Concerns over protests by low-paid 
teachers and disgruntled truck drivers also gave investors more 
reason to be edgy about the final year of Carlos Menem's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentine stock market recouped about half of its losses  
Tuesday and has since steadied. But the volatility at the week's 
outset underscored the fact that many Latin American markets are 
still wobbling six months after the Brazilian devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Election-year politics in some nations, widening budget gaps,  
and even sagging tax revenues are all part of the scene in one 
fashion or another. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the whole region there are a lot of unknowns,'' said Omar  
Borla, chief Latin American economist at Robert Fleming in New 
York. ``But to some extent they are blown out of proportion, such 
as in the case of Argentina and who takes office in December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in Argentina later this year will elect a successor to  
Menem, who has governed this country for 10 years through two 
terms. Until election time, international investors are certain to 
remain on guard, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Latin American economies face their own internal  
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	--The more apprehensive investors appear to be holding off in  
Venezuela until President Hugo Chavez forces through his first 
initiative: amending the country's constitution to give him more 
presidential powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan economy has contracted nearly 9 percent in the  
first half of 1999, unemployment has swelled to over 20 percent and 
hundreds of companies have gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Slipping prices in oil, Venezuela's chief source of revenue,  
initiated the hardships last year. Brazil's devaluation deepened 
the economic woes and uncertainty over Chavez further compounded 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ecuador is locked in its worst economic crisis in 50 years,  
with the economy expected to shrink by 5 percent this year and 
inflation to top 50 percent. Hoping to prune a bloated budget 
deficit, President Jamil Mahuad is battling powerful unions to 
enact tough reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mahuad decree that hiked gasoline prices by 13 percent met  
with stiff resistance by taxi, bus and truck drivers who launched a 
strike paralyzing movement in Andean country for days. Mahuad 
eventually backed off, but unions haven't. They say their strike 
will end when the cancellation of the decree goes into effect. 
Mahuad is also jostling with Congress, where his plans to privatize 
state companies and raise taxes are making little headway. 
</P>
<P>
	--In June, Colombia devalued its currency, the second time since  
President Andres Pastrana took office in August. Critics have 
decried his budget-slashing plan and say it caused a gigantic 
interest-rate hike. An escalating war with leftist guerrillas 
hasn't helped. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brazil appears to be slightly rebounding from its January  
devaluation. Fears of a double-digit inflationary spiral are 
easing. But there are problems: Brazil still needs to pass a 
balanced-budget, reign in spending, and launch privatization 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Mexican economy last year managed to weather the economic  
tumult in Asia and Brazil, despite a drop in world oil prices, 
which makes up about a third of government revenues. This year the 
outlook has improved with oil prices rising, inflation in check and 
slow but steady growth of about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mexico still hasn't fully recovered from the 1994 peso  
crisis, which sent interest rates and inflation soaring. The 
banking system remains weak, about 40 percent of the country lives 
in poverty and there are fears the country could face more turmoil 
around the July 2000 presidential election.

<HEADLINE> TNT Explores News Photography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A freed prisoner of war receives a joyous  
welcome home. An accused presidential assassin is shot to death. A 
black football player is viciously mauled on the field by his white 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The camera shutter clicks, and these singular moments are frozen  
in a single frame for our wonder or anguish. Go ahead and find the 
proverbial thousand words -- or thousand feet of film -- that can 
beat a great picture. 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when detractors have tarred photojournalism with the  
paparazzi's sensationalist brush (and when the media has, in some 
cases, tarred itself) a new documentary reminds us of the righteous 
power of the news photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Six Pulitzer Prize-winning pictures and the stories and  
photographers behind them are the focus of ``Moment of Impact,'' 
showing 8 p.m. EDT Sunday on Turner Network Television. Actor Sam 
Waterston (``Law &AMP; Order'') is the host. 
</P>
<P>
	As a slender national photo album (there are no international  
pictures), the program displays evidence of our best behavior and 
our worst, our depths of cruelty and heights of compassion. All 
that is within the camera's grasp when it is wielded by those with 
skill and judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Mixing interviews with the photographers and their subjects,  
film footage and the award-winning pictures, ``Moment of Impact'' 
provides insight into the technical and decision-making process 
leading to each photograph or series of photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The program also manages some tidy historical context and a good  
measure of drama, using effective but not excessive re-creations to 
build to an event's crucial moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since photography was added to the Pulitzers in 1942, more than  
100 people have received the prize. Some of the half-dozen profiled 
in ``Moment of Impact'' excelled on stories of national importance, 
jostling with the pack for the most telling shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Others were alone in capturing small-town or seemingly mundane  
events that would not have become widely known were it not for the 
photographer's extraordinary eye. 
</P>
<P>
	A family tragedy in Pottstown, Pa., in 1978, was just such a  
case. Thomas J. Kelly III, then working for the Pottstown Mercury 
News, heard a police scanner report of a family held hostage at a 
farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	He arrived to find officers surrounding the home. Inside,  
Richard Greist held his pregnant wife and 5-year-old daughter 
captive. Kelly edged in close and had a clear field when the child 
emerged, bloodied from stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought you could take pictures of anything and then  
not use them if they were too terrible,'' Kelly says in the film. 
``But I couldn't take a picture of her that day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Douglas Weaver, a detective and now Pottstown's police  
chief, swooped in on the girl. Kelly snapped the image of her tiny, 
limp body clutched by Weaver, who wore a smile of sweet relief. Her 
obscured face provided a measure of privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``For days and months and even now I still feel the moments I  
was down there at that scene. ... It will affect me forever,'' 
Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
	An exhilarating event, the 1973 homecoming of freed Vietnam POWs  
at Travis Air Force Base in California, was indelibly captured by 
veteran Associated Press photographer Sal Veder. 
</P>
<P>
	As the family of Lt. Col Robert L. Stirm rushed to embrace him --  
with Stirm's miniskirted daughter, her arms stretched as wide as 
her grin, leading the charge -- Veder precisely captured the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to anticipate action. Everything looks routine, then  
suddenly all hell breaks loose,'' Veder says in the film.

contributing to the record of the tragedy is remarkable. He, in 
essence, stalked the participants and history to ensure that he got 
a piece of it. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least one photographer expresses mixed feelings about his  
honor. In the film, Kelly recalls the many images he made capturing 
Pottstown's small-town warmth.

It's good to win the top photo prize in the world, but I wish it 
was for something else.''

<HEADLINE> Snyder Group Takes Over Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Washington Redskins officially have a new  
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Snyder and his group of investors closed their purchase  
of the team Wednesday, ending three decades of ownership under the 
Jack Kent Cooke family. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder's $800 million offer to buy the team was approved by NFL  
owners last May. His group of investors includes Mortimer 
Zuckerman, owner of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, Zuckerman's business 
associate Fred Drasner, and members of Snyder's immediate family. 
</P>
<P>
	At 34, Snyder is the youngest majority owner in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
	``Over the next few days we're going to celebrate, and then  
we'll get down to the work at hand. Our commitment is to bring 
winning football back to Washington,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Snyder continued to keep mum about his plans for the team. His  
only firm position has been that he plans to retain the Redskins 
name despite objections from some Native American groups.

<HEADLINE> Novartis Reports Higher Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis  
AG's sales edged up 1 percent in the first half as gains in the 
drug and healthcare products businesses offset a decline in 
agricultural product sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis said Thursday its sales from continuing operations rose  
to 16.3 billion Swiss francs, or $10.3 billion, from 16.2 billion 
francs a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings figures will be released Aug. 26.  
</P>
<P>
	The company's key healthcare division, which includes drugs,  
posted a 6 percent rise to $5.7 billion while sales in the consumer 
health division also rose 6 percent to $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agricultural products division, which is being  
overhauled under new leadership, saw sales fall 10 percent to $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief financial officer Raymund Breu said the division is in the  
midst of a cyclical downturn and that its management needs time to 
put through its program until the farming industry rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Breu said Novartis' top priority is to expand its drugs  
business. For the period going from the year 2000 to 2002, Breu 
said the company has 14 new products for launch in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we want to get those launches right,'' he said. ``We don't  
want to get sidetracked.''

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Teens Are Programming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN MATEO, Calif. (AP) -- Most teens working this summer across  
the country will be making minimum wage flipping burgers, but 
Silicon Valley teen-ager Roddy Knight is writing computer code for 
$20 an hour -- plus stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is fascinating work,'' said Knight, 18. ``I'm learning so  
much, and they give me a lot of responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working at Keynote Systems in San Mateo, Knight's first project  
was to write a computer program that will help e-commerce companies 
test their Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``He may be a kid, but he's got a lot of skills,'' said  
Keynote's chief executive, Umang Gupta. ``Our attitude is really 
simple: We pay based on performance, not age or other factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude, prevalent among Silicon Valley employers, is  
paying off for teens. Low national unemployment is magnified in 
this high-tech region, where the booming information technology 
industry has created a vast shortage of trained computer 
programmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can program, you can program. It doesn't matter how old  
you are, there's going to be a job,'' said Rich Halberg, of Joint 
Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit community and business 
group. ``I think many of these kids are going to find it hard to go 
back to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A recent Joint Venture study about the work force shortage found  
that 160,000 high-tech positions -- roughly one-third of the 
high-tech industry demand in Silicon Valley -- are filled by 
recruits from outside the region, by long-distance commuters -- or 
they go unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, unemployment for all workers is also low, and  
jobless rates for teen-agers and adult women fell to the lowest 
levels in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, many teens growing up in the silicon-soaked culture  
of semiconductor chips and programming languages are becoming 
experts, albeit young ones, in the burgeoning industry that spawns 
young millionaires every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be said that I'm like the ordinary summer teen-ager,  
except that I work while others vegetate,'' said Darrick Wong, 17, 
of Sunnyvale, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Wong is a ``webmaster'' at VIT, a Palo Alto, Calif., company,  
where he's building Web sites, rewriting his own programs and, in 
his spare time, studying to get certified in computer programming 
from Sun Microsystems. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't feel like he's missing out on a laid-back vacation.  
</P>
<P>
	'' I usually look at computer work in an entirely different  
light,'' he said. ``Computing is my goofing off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the school year, Wong's parents agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``They think that I should focus almost exclusively on  
schoolwork,'' said Wong. ``I, however, think that if I were to do 
that, I'd go insane. Of course, they don't appreciate my computer 
development when I'm not getting good grades in school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer, however, Wong's parents -- and those of his peers  
-- are supportive that their kids are opting for high-tech jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost 10 million American teens are working this summer,  
earning about $6 an hour, according to the Labor Department's 
Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, almost all are in the retail trade or service  
industry, scooping ice cream, operating amusement park rides, 
taking theater tickets or selling T-shirts at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of teens are working in ``business services,'' a  
category that includes auto repair and maintenance as well as 
computer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously there's not a lot of teens doing computer  
programming,'' said BLS labor economist John Stinson. 
</P>
<P>
	And fewer still are earning stock options.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yea, it's pretty cool to own part of this company. Now I'm  
just waiting for them to go public,'' said Knight, who spent some 
of his earnings to buy himself a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradford Brown, a professor at University of Wisconsin who  
specializes in adolescent development, said that in general, these 
high-tech jobs are much better than the routine types of summer 
jobs kids have. 
</P>
<P>
	``This work is connected to their interests and skills, they  
have more contact with adults than most teen jobs, and they are 
preparing for a future,'' he said. ``The only problem comes along 
in the fall. If this employment continues into the school year and 
has heavy time demands on the kids, it could be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Brown said the solution is not stopping work altogether. He  
said teens generally do better in school when they work between 10 
and 15 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what 17-year-old Elizabeth Yin plans to do.  
</P>
<P>
	She and eight friends this summer are designing and building a  
new student life section for her school's Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the project, I hope to increase my programming skills,  
but perhaps more importantly, I hope to improve my project 
coordinating skills,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Owners Prepared To Let Umps Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As umpires began what might be the final eight  
weeks of their baseball careers, management officials said they are 
prepared to let the men in blue resign en masse and replace them 
all. 
</P>
<P>
	And in an escalation of the conflict, officials of the Major  
League Umpires Association planned a conference call Friday with 
minor league umpires that could lead to a walkout by them. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips said 220 of 228 minor league umpires  
had voted to form a union, with two abstaining, but management 
refused to negotiate with it. Union lawyer Pat Campbell said a 
walkout could ``happen sooner rather than later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are forced to live two to a room in second-rate motor  
lodges, as opposed to minor league hockey officials who are in 
Marriotts and Hiltons,'' Phillips said. ``They have no pension plan 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations  
in the commissioner's office, said the minor league move was 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not surprised by it,'' Alderson said. ``I heard he might  
make an effort like this in the near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At some major league ballparks, including Yankee Stadium, The  
Ballpark in Arlington and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, 
umpires were booed when they took the field Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to get killed. Sandy Alderson has bashed us, and  
people believe what they read or see,'' National League umpire Ed 
Montague said. ``They're going to believe the umpires are always 
the bad guys. We're on the bottom of the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball officials said they are not inclined to challenge the  
umpires' decision to quit over the tension that began when Roberto 
Alomar spat at an ump in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad. It's very, very sad,'' commissioner Bud Selig said.  
``I will have plenty to say in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While baseball is leaning toward hiring a new set of umpires,  
Selig will make the final decision, said several officials who 
spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That reaction typifies the smugness, the arrogance that has  
led us to where we are, and it exemplifies the lack of appreciation 
for the umpires,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson is expected to take a hard-line approach with umpires,  
who would get up to $400,000 each in severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' Alderson said after Phillips made his announcement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he had submitted the resignations of 57 of the 68  
major league umpires, effective Sept. 2, 4 1/2 weeks before the end of 
the regular season. The American and National League offices said 
Thursday they hadn't received them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that doesn't happen, because that's when the pennant  
races start heating up and you want your best back there working 
the games,'' said catcher Jeff Reed, whose bumping incident with 
umpire Tom Hallion led to the latest escalation in tension. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the remaining umpires will soon add their resignations,  
Phillips said. Three haven't been heard from and two, John Shulock 
and Darryl Cousins, aren't union members because they joined the AL 
staff as strikebreakers during the seven-week walkout in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	If the umps do quit, owners could hire umpires from minor  
leagues, high schools and colleges, as they have during previous 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son plays college ball and I've seen those umpires  
intimidated by college coaches,'' Montague said. ``What happens 
when they go to Atlanta and New York with 50,000 in the stands? You 
think those guys are going to be intimidated by Bobby Cox or Joe 
Torre?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Players agreed the quality of umpires would go down.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big difference, there's no doubt about it,'' Chicago  
Cubs first baseman Mark Grace said. ``They are the best at what 
they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While hiring new umps, owners could use legal maneuvers to avoid  
or delay handing over $15 million in termination pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When push comes to shove, the fans know the umpires are the  
real people of baseball,'' Phillips said. ``They are not phonies; 
they go out and work hard. They are blue-collar workers, like the 
fans. The fans understand there's a certain amount of grime and 
grit that's associated with the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the view held by some players. After umpire Greg Kosc  
had to leave in the middle of a game on a hot and humid afternoon 
earlier this month, New York Yankees catcher Jorge Posada said: 
``They're not prepared, they're not in shape. It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was hospitalized, and Phillips said the umpire was  
diagnosed with diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure they'd like every umpire to weigh 175 pounds,'' AL  
umpire Jim McKean said. ``But that's not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Posada apologized the day after his remark. Nonetheless,  
Phillips called him ``a jerk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg Kosc, who doesn't have an ounce of body fat on him, is in  
better shape than Posada,'' he said. ``But I think the relationship 
between the players and the umpires is good. There are some players 
who are jerks. There are some pitchers who make $11 million who 
think every pitch they throw is a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether all umpires would follow through on their  
threat. In March, about 50 umpires voted to give Phillips a new 
five-year contract, but about a dozen voted against him, wanting to 
bring in Ron Shapiro, the agent for Cal Ripken and many other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro is much less confrontational in negotiations than  
Phillips, but Shapiro told umpires he wouldn't become involved as 
long as the majority of them backed their longtime leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been angry since Alomar spat at John Hirschbeck  
three years ago and was suspended for five games, a punishment they 
deemed too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no support,'' McKean said. ``(The NFL) came out in  
support of their officials, said they were the best in the world. 
... You never hear that about us. The only thing you hear about us 
is negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions rose even higher earlier this month when NL president  
Len Coleman suspended Hallion for three days for bumping a player, 
the first such action that baseball officials could remember.

<HEADLINE> Dimissal Sought in Redskins Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Redskins general manager Charley  
Casserly and former team president John Kent Cooke asked a federal 
judge to dismiss a lawsuit by New York real estate developer Howard 
Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein sued the men in May, claiming they worked together to  
have the NFL reject his $800 million bid to purchase the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke and Casserly filed motions Thursday in U.S. District Court  
claiming Milstein voluntarily decided to drop his application for 
the team, making invalid his claim that someone else caused him 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the bid was withdrawn, there was no way to know whether  
NFL owners would have approved it, they said in the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is nothing more than a mean-spirited and vindictive lawsuit  
against Charley Casserly for ulterior purposes that have nothing to 
do with the allegations in the complaint,'' Casserly's motion said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein's suit claims that Cooke, with Casserly's help, ``used  
league officials and certain owners themselves to unfairly block 
our bid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milstein had reached an agreement with the trustees of the  
estate of the late Jack Kent Cooke, the father of John Kent Cooke, 
in January to buy the team for $800 million. He withdrew the bid 
during an NFL owners' meeting in April after it became apparent he 
did not have the 24 votes among 31 owners needed for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was sold instead to Daniel M. Snyder, a 34-year-old  
Maryland-based media entrepreneur.

<HEADLINE> Dog Flea Powder Can Be Bad for Cats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Perhaps someone should warn the White House:  
Flea powder used on Buddy could kill Socks. 
</P>
<P>
	Cats can become extremely sick and even die if their owners  
treat them with flea products intended for dogs only, said 
veterinarian E. Kathryn Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical for owners to be aware of the severe  
consequences of using flea products incorrectly -- particularly when 
cats are involved -- because cats can be very sensitive to certain 
chemicals,'' said Meyer, who coordinates the U.S. Pharmacopeia 
Veterinary Practitioners' Reporting Program. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, which identifies quality problems with  
products, medication and chemicals used in veterinary medicine, 
published a report on the topic in today's issue of the Journal of 
the American Veterinary Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	While flea products often are packaged similarly, the active  
ingredients can vary greatly, especially among popular ``spot-on'' 
products in which a small amount of liquid is applied directly to 
the animal's skin. 
</P>
<P>
	A common chemical in such products is permethrin, which can be  
toxic to cats. In products made for dogs, permethrin is usually 
concentrated at levels of 45 percent to 65 percent. Flea sprays 
intended for cats contain much lower -- and safer -- concentrations, 
often about 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer advised cat owners to closely follow directions on flea  
products because even small amounts of permethrin can be bad for 
cats. 
</P>
<P>
	``Furthermore, people who own both dogs and cats should be aware  
that 'dog-only' flea products applied to their dogs can cause 
illness in cats that are in close contact with the treated dogs,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer's organization received 11 reports between August 1997 and  
September 1998 involving 12 cats that were hospitalized after 
exposure to a concentrated permethrin flea product. Four of the 
cats died. 
</P>
<P>
	The article also cites similar cases reported to the  
Environmental Protection Agency, which received accounts of about 
125 cats that got sick or died following incorrect applications of 
permethrin. About two dozen of the felines became ill or died 
because of contact with treated dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Symptoms of permethrin toxicity in cats include excitability,  
twitching and seizures. Cat owners noticing signs should quickly 
bathe their pet in mild dishwashing detergent and seek veterinary 
care.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs' Johnson Gets Some Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- For the first time in 34 innings, the  
Arizona Diamondbacks scored a run for Randy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson took a 1-0 lead to the mound Thursday night after Matt  
Williams singled to left with two out in the top of the first, 
driving in Tony Womack. The 1,500th hit of Williams' career ensured 
that Johnson wouldn't be shut out for a fifth straight start. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is the 10th player since 1900 to lose four straight  
games while his team was shut out each time, according to the Elias 
Sports Bureau, baseball's statistician. Johnson gave up just five 
earned runs over those 32 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought began in the last two innings five starts ago on  
June 20, also a Johnson loss.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Investigate Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The country's biggest coal-burning power  
plants are suspected of releasing far more smog-causing pollution 
than allowed by law, prompting an industry-wide investigation by 
the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said Thursday that utilities found to exceed  
the emissions levels allowed under the Clean Air Act could be 
forced to install new pollution control equipment and possibly face 
civil penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration official familiar with the  
investigation said authorities suspect a large number of coal-power 
utilities profited by polluting the air beyond legal health-based 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials discussed the investigation only under condition  
of not being further identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry spokesmen acknowledged that utility executives were  
holding discussions with the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not been advised of any specific allegations,'' said  
Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for the American Electric Power Co., one 
of the largest operators of coal-burning power plants, largely in 
the Ohio Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA investigation, although industry-wide, is focusing on  
more than 100 coal-burning power plants -- many of them in the 
Midwest and Ohio Valley -- that were allowed to continue operating 
under the 1990 Clean Air Act without having the pollution-control 
devices required of newer plants. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``grandfather'' provision assumed, however, that the plants  
would not be modernized or retrofitted so as to expand electricity 
production, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	In examining six power plants and a variety of state and  
industry records, EPA investigators have found that under the guise 
of routine maintenance, there have been major capital improvements 
in the plants that allow increased electricity generation, 
officials said. This, in turn, has led to increases in releases of 
smog-causing nitrogen oxide in violation of the Clean Air Act, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the investigators found utilities had added  
distribution pipes and new turbines to expand electricity 
generation, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, utilities must obtain new permits, requiring  
additional pollution controls, if they expand the power plants 
beyond what they were in 1990. But investigators found significant 
increases in electricity generation and pollution and few requests 
for permits. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA investigation found nitrogen oxide smokestack emissions  
had increased by 1,000 tons per year at one of the plants examined, 
although the utility had not sought a permit requiring new 
pollution controls. Normally, an increase of as little as 40 tons 
should trigger a permit requirement, one official said. The release 
of 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxide is equivalent to the amount coming 
from 150,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50 largest coal-burning electric power plants produce nearly  
4.5 million tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide a year with three 
companies -- American Electric Power Co., Southern Co. and the 
Tennessee Valley Authority -- accounting for about 1.3 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity generation accounts for 29 percent of nitrogen oxide  
emissions, the rest coming from transportation to a lesser extent 
industrial sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Two environmental groups released a study this week that showed  
electricity generation from coal-burning plants had increased 16 
percent between 1992 and 1997, resulting in an additional 755,000 
tons of nitrogen oxide emissions annually. The groups used EPA and 
Energy Department figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings back up what we've been saying for the last  
couple of years: The old plants are not living up to modern 
pollution standards,'' said Rebecca Stanfield of U.S.PIRG, one of 
the authors of the study.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Are Mostly Unchanged / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were little changed Thursday after  
another economic report showed no sign of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the government's benchmark 30-year Treasury bond  
dipped 1/32 percent, or 31 1/4 cents per $1,000 in face value, as its 
yield hovered around Tuesday's 5.91 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported that consumer prices held steady  
in June for the second straight month -- the best showing since 
1986, when prices actually fell three months in a row. The report 
gives further evidence that the U.S. economy is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation erodes the value of fixed-rate securities, such as  
Treasurys. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ongoing fear of inflation held back any significant  
gains in bond prices, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
rose 1/32 percent and intermediate securities rose 1/32 point to 
1/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 4.70  
percent while the discount held steady at Wednesday's 4.58 percent. 
Six-month yields were unchanged at 4.67 percent, as the discount 
held at 4.50 percent. One-year yields were unchanged at 4.96 
percent as the discount held at 4.72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.19 percent from 5.00 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 3/16 to 119 13/32. The average yield to 
maturity was 5.50 percent, down from 5.51 percent Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign Goalie Legace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings signed free agent goalie  
Manny Legace to a multiyear contract Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes less than a week after signing free agent goalie  
Ken Wregget as a backup to Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	Legace, 26, played in 17 games with the Los Angeles Kings last  
season, posting a 2-9-2 record with a 2.60 goals-against-average 
and a .911 save percentage. He spent the last four seasons in the 
minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Legace originally was drafted by Hartford, which later became  
Carolina, and was traded a year ago to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an exceptional young goaltender and he will add more  
depth to our goaltending position,'' general manager Ken Holland 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings lost three goalies in the past four months after  
Bill Ranford was waived, Norm Maracle was lost in the expansion 
draft and Kevin Hodson was traded to Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Ends 38.31 Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Thursday, lifting some market  
indexes to new highs, as another report showed that the economy's 
surprising strength still hasn't sparked inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 38.31 to 11,186.41,  
finishing the day less than 15 points from Monday's record close of 
11,200.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes also advanced. The Nasdaq composite rose  
21.24 to 2,839.37 for its second straight record close, and the 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 11.45 to 1,409.62, topping last Friday's 
record high of 1,403.28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were cheered for the second day in a row by an  
encouraging report on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the start of Thursday's trading, the Labor Department  
reported that consumer prices held steady in June for the second 
straight month -- the best showing since 1986, when prices fell for 
three months in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists had been expecting a slight increase of 0.1 percent  
in the Consumer Price Index. The data, along with Wednesday's news 
that prices at the wholesale level fell 0.1 percent in June, should 
help calm fears about an inflationary spurt back in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``The numbers today were wonderful,'' said Charles Pradilla,  
chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted, however, that the buying remains restrained with the  
market trading at lofty levels and a barrage of second-quarter 
profit reports due next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a market that's acting scared by any means. I'm not  
saying there isn't nevousness about certain companies, but this is 
not a nervous market across the board,'' said Pradilla. ``If you 
own them, you're nervous. If they disappoint, you can really get 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early flow of second-quarter reports continued to figure  
prominently in the movements of individual stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola rose 2 1/8 to 64 to help lead the Dow's advance after the  
soda company, beset by recent contamination problems in Europe, 
posted a profit of nearly $1 billion that met most Wall Street 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow also drew a big boost from Hewlett-Packard, which  
rallied late in the day, closing 4 9/16 higher at 113. There was no 
news to explain the late surge, which may have been related to 
last-minute positioning before the expiration of options contracts 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,831 up, 1,091 down and 625 
unchanged. Nasdaq gainers led by a 4-to-3 margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume of NYSE-listed shares on all exchanges totaled 1.006  
billion shares, up from 918.59 million on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 5.85 to 660.75, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 8.73 to 821.73, 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.34 to 465.80.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.40 percent.  
Germany's DAX index rose 0.15 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 
1.57 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 1.55 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nuke Workers Can Seek Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON AP) -- Thousands of federal contract workers exposed  
to toxic and radioactive substances at nuclear weapons facilities 
will be eligible for federal compensation under a new policy, 
administration officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new health care initiative to be announced later today by  
the Energy Department will conclude years of litigation between the 
government and workers who were exposed during more than three 
decades of the Cold War at weapons production facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is long deserved and long overdue,'' said Energy  
Secretary Bill Richardson. ``It's time to stop spending money 
litigating against these workers and focus our efforts on getting 
them the help they need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is expected to cost about $13 million a year over the  
next 10 years, department officials said. It was unclear how many 
of the contract workers will seek compensation or qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to reverse years of policy and make the workers  
eligible for federal compensation marks the first time the federal 
government has acknowledged that nuclear weapons production caused 
illnesses in thousands of workers during the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the men and women who helped us win the Cold War  
worked in extremely sensitive conditions and were exposed to 
extremely hazardous substances,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers for private contractors at many weapons production  
facilities accounted for the vast majority of the employees at the 
plants. Richardson said those workers ``deserve to receive the same 
occupational illness benefits available to regular federal 
employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime weapons production workers have complained for years of  
illnesses. Their advocates have said the workers suffered from 
cancers and lung disease because of long-term exposure to 
beryllium, mercury, uranium, asbestos and other materials under 
inadequate safety standards set by the Energy Department and its 
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	According to officials, the compensation plan will allow workers  
to claim lost wages, and medical and rehabilitation costs for 
illnesses linked to their exposure to beryllium while working at 
nuclear bomb factories and nuclear production facilities. The 
claims would be considered by the Labor Department. 
</P>
<P>
	While the claims initially must be linked to illnesses from  
exposure to beryllium, other illnesses may be added later, 
officials said. An independent panel of scientists was to examine 
possible expansion of coverage to other toxic or radioactive 
exposures. 
</P>
<P>
	Beryllium is a rare chemical element associated with several  
metallic alloys used in atomic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Although private contract employees made up the vast majority of  
the workforce at the nuclear facilities, they have been ineligible 
to apply for federal compensation. They also have been unable to 
collect under state worker compensation programs because the state 
programs were designed for injuries, not occupational illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify under the new program, a medical panel would have to  
determine that any illness was related to the worker's employment. 
</P>
<P>
	The program applies to workers across the federal weapons  
complex involved in production of plutonium and the manufacture and 
assembly of America's nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the workers were employed at the Oak Ridge weapons  
complex in Tennessee. Others worked at the Nevada Test site, the 
Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington state, the Rocky Flats 
facility near Denver, Colo., the Idaho National Environmental 
Engineering Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> 30-yr Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rate Down / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages edged down to 7.58 percent this week, marking 
the second straight weekly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.65 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates had been creeping up for the past two months and  
have fluctuated from their low for this year of 6.74 percent set at 
the end of January to a high of 7.71 percent set at the beginning 
of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
declined sharply. They averaged 7.19 percent this week, down from 
the average of 7.30 percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``With concern about inflation easing, Treasuries dropped this  
week and mortgage rates followed them downward,'' said Robert Van 
Order, chief economist for Freddie Mac. ``In fact rates seem to be 
stabilizing after the recent spike in mortgage interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.97 percent this week, up slightly from 
5.96 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks closed the morning session higher  
Friday, bolstered by a rally in high-technology issues on Wall 
Street. The dollar edged lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 147.21 points,  
or 0.79 percent, to close the morning session at 18,579.07. On 
Thursday, the average closed up 74.00 points, or 0.40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.91 yen in early trading, down a marginal  
0.01 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York 
level of 120.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, shares in high-technology and blue chip  
exporters gained following advances in their U.S. counterparts in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 38.31  
points to 11,186.41 at Thursday's close. The technology-rich Nasdaq 
Composite Index climbed 21.24 points to a new all-time high of 
2,839.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 17.49 points, or 1.16 percent, to 1,529.22 
points at the end of the morning session. The TOPIX closed down 
14.66 points, or 0.98 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar fell slightly against the yen  
after Japanese Economic Planning Agency chief Taichi Sakaiya said a 
120 yen per dollar exchange rate is appropriate for Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the dollar decline was limited after the Nihon Keizai  
financial newspaper reported Friday that the Bank of Japan bought 
dollars the previous day to stop the U.S. currency from falling 
below the 120 yen mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the international bureau at Japan's  
Ministry of Finance, declined to comment Friday on whether Japan's 
central bank had intervened in the foreign exchange markets 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mizoguchi said, however, he is ``watching the foreign exchange  
markets carefully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haruhiko Kuroda, Japan's vice finance minister for international  
affairs, Thursday also declined to comment on the reported BOJ 
move. 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ has on several occasions in recent weeks intervened in  
currency markets to support the dollar against the yen in an effort 
to safeguard the country's fragile recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
therefore less competitive, while reducing exporters' foreign 
revenues in terms of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.42 yen, down from  
123.54 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.7450 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6800 percent, driving 
its price down to 100.47 yen from 101.04 yen.

<HEADLINE> Rights Abuses in Sudan Cited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defending the appointment of a special human  
rights envoy for Sudan, a top State Department official on Thursday 
called that country ``perhaps the world's worst'' rights abuser. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, briefing reporters,  
noted that slavery and religious persecution are widespread in 
Sudan, and she also cited the ``horrible'' consequences of its long 
running civil war on the civilian population. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said President  
Clinton will appoint a special envoy to deal with the rights 
situation in Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who heads the State Department's Africa bureau, said the  
envoy also will call attention to the humanitarian crisis in Sudan 
and seek to muster international support for an effective response. 
</P>
<P>
	The envoy, who has yet to be named, also will reinforce U.S.  
support for a regional effort to bring an end to Sudan's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice was joined at the news conference by Gayle Smith, an  
African affairs expert at the National Security Council. They 
highlighted recent gains in efforts to end wars in both Congo and 
Sierra Leone. 
</P>
<P>
	They also hailed the decision at this week's Organization of  
African Unity Summit in Algiers to exclude from future summits any 
governments that come to power by undemocratic means. Rice called 
the resolution ``groundbreaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two officials spoke on the eve of a House of Representatives  
vote on legislation to provide increased access of African textiles 
and other products to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice noted that eligibility criteria will limit beneficiary  
countries to those which are taking what she called ``important and 
necessary reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another administration official predicted the legislation will  
pass by a comfortable margin. A similar proposal failed to win 
congressional approval last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Edward Royce, R-Calif., chairman of the House International  
Relations subcommittee on Africa, told a news conference he also 
expected a favorable vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bipartisan legislation is critical to the U.S.-Africa  
relationship. It has been the centerpiece of what this Congress has 
been doing to reorient U.S. relations with Africa, moving away from 
an aid relationship to one based on trade by promoting markets in 
Africa,'' Royce said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., said, ``A new generation of leadership  
is emerging in sub-Saharan Africa...As Africa changes, so should 
U.S. policy. Our goal must be to help Africa become fully 
integrated into the world economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Donald Payne, D-N.J., called the legislation ``a stepping  
stone for Africa's future. This is a bipartisan piece of 
legislation that will make the economic development of sub-Saharan 
Africa a reality.''

<HEADLINE> Thrashers Turn to Minors for Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- As soon as his NHL playing career ended, Curt  
Fraser began plotting his return as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't care if it took me two years, 10 years or 15 years,''  
Fraser said. ``That's what I wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years later, he's back in the league.  
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, an NHL player from 1978-90, was introduced Wednesday as  
the first coach of the Atlanta Thrashers, who selected him over 
more experienced candidates Ted Nolan and Ron Low. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old Fraser had the inside track for the job despite  
his lack of NHL coaching experience. He has been close friends with 
Thrashers general manager Don Waddell since they teamed up in 1995 
to build an International Hockey League expansion franchise in 
Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you hire someone you've known previously, you're over the  
first hurdle,'' Waddell said. ``I know what he's capable of and he 
knows what I'm capable of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell initially wanted to hire a coach with NHL experience,  
but he began to change his mind as he watched Ken Hitchcock -- who 
formerly coached in the IHL -- guide the Dallas Stars to the Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I closed the process, I was eliminating some good  
people,'' Waddell said. ``We were looking for someone to grow with 
the program. When you get someone who's been coaching a long time, 
they can get set in their ways. This team is going to change a lot 
over the next couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell spent last weekend mulling his choice, making sure in  
his own mind that he wasn't hiring Fraser simply because of their 
personal relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he the best guy? Is Ron Low the best guy? Is Ted Nolan the  
best guy?'' Waddell asked himself. ``Honestly, I came to the 
decision that Curt was the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando reached the IHL finals in its first season with Waddell  
as general manager and Fraser as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell left after two years in Orlando to take a front office  
job with the Detroit Red Wings, then moved on to the Thrashers. 
Fraser remained behind to coach the Solar Bears, leading them to 
the IHL finals again this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	Waddell waited until just 80 days before the team's first game  
to hire a coach, paring the list of candidates to three finalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Nolan was a coach of the year with the Buffalo Sabres, Low  
coached the Edmonton Oilers for 4 1/2 years, but Fraser wound up 
getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``The four years I had in the `I' trained me well,'' said  
Fraser, who had a 192-111-25 record in Orlando, the league's 
second-best mark during that span. ``I've worked hard to develop my 
coaching skills so I would be ready when this opportunity came 
along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was a feisty, aggressive left wing during a 12-year NHL  
career, scoring 193 goals and racking up 1,306 penalty minutes 
while playing for Vancouver, Chicago and Minnesota. He still 
chuckles at the thought of his on-ice battles with former Atlanta 
Flames tough guy Willi Plett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 12 years in the NHL,'' Fraser said. ``I know the  
league. I know the players. I know how they feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring as a player, he spent four years with the IHL's  
Milwaukee Admirals -- two as an assistant coach, two as a head coach 
-- then one season with Syracuse of the American Hockey League 
before joining Waddell in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last four years, the Solar Bears won eight of 12  
playoff series and had a 17-4 record in playoff elimination games. 
This past season, they became the first team in the IHL's 54-year 
history to rally from an 0-3 deficit in a best-of-7 series, beating 
Detroit in the Eastern Conference finals before losing to Houston 
4-3 in the Turner Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think my strength as a coach is being very resilient,''  
Fraser said. ``I'm good at refocusing my teams. All of my teams 
have responded well to being down and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, who signed a three-year contract, takes over a team that  
figures to struggle for at least a couple of seasons -- particularly 
on offense. Still, he vowed the Thrashers won't be trying to win 
every game 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team is going to be very aggressive,'' he said. ``It's  
going to be a team the fans will enjoy coming out to see.''

	Republican HMO Bill Passed by Senate  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rolling over Democrats in a week of party-line  
votes, Senate Republicans approved a modest set of patient 
protections today aimed at millions of Americans who fear 
cost-conscious HMOs may deny them needed care. ``This bill 
addresses the real problems many Americans face,'' said Senate 
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. President Clinton called the 
bill unacceptable and aides said he would veto it.

	House OKs Pay Raise for President  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted overwhelmingly today to give  
members of Congress a $4,600 pay raise in January and to double the 
next president's salary to $400,000. Lawmakers voted 276-147 to 
increase their own pay, rolling up nearly 2-1 margins among 
Republicans and Democrats alike. They then voted 334-82 to reject 
an effort by conservatives trying to prevent the presidential pay 
boost. The vote on legislators' salaries underlined the favorable 
political climate for the first raise since January 1998 and the 
second since 1993.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sought to minimize  
the importance of China's announcement today that it had built a 
neutron bomb, noting that intelligence reports for years have shown 
that Beijing has tested such a weapon. But in light of heightened 
tensions between China and Taiwan and the West, officials took care 
to note that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is vastly superior to 
China's.

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The struggle to form a Northern

Republican Army's refusal to disarm. The British and Irish 
governments, which have spent months trying to coax the Protestants 
of the Ulster Unionist party to accept the Catholics of Sinn Fein 
as government colleagues, conceded that the damage could take 
months to repair.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Bush Gains in GOP Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- George W. Bush has increased his lead for  
the Republican presidential nomination in a poll of New Hampshire 
Republicans, according to a poll released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for Bush, the governor of Texas and national  
front-runner in the GOP race, increased from 38 percent in June in 
an independent poll by the American Research Group Inc. of 
Manchester, to 47 percent in the firm's latest poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona received 13 percent, compared to 10  
percent in June, while Pat Buchanan had 9 percent, compared to 5 
percent in June. Elizabeth Dole's support dropped to 7 percent from 
15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The sampling of 450 Republican registered voters in the state  
holding the nation's first presidential primary was conducted July 
8-12. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased,'' McCain told WMUR-TV of Manchester. ``I think  
the kind of campaigning I'm doing in New Hampshire has paid a 
dividend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky said the poll results suggest  
``Elizabeth Dole is falling apart, while Steve Forbes is spending 
all this money and not gaining any ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Polls this far out are meaningless,'' said Juleanna Glover  
Weiss, spokeswoman for Forbes, the wealthy publisher, who was at 2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole spokesman Ari Fleischer said the McCain campaign has put  
more resources into New Hampshire than the Dole campaign has. 
``This is all part of Senator McCain's strategy to spend early, 
peak early and get an early artificial bump in the polls,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who won the 1996 New Hampshire primary, ``has emerged  
as the conservative alternative to the establishment candidates,'' 
said Bay Buchanan, the candidate's senior adviser and sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Commentator Alan Keyes was at 4 percent; former Vice President  
Dan Quayle at 3 percent; former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander at 2 
percent; conservative activist Gary Bauer at 1 percent; and New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, who has announced he is leaving the GOP, 
at 1 percent. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, a recent entry into the race, 
and Ohio Rep. John Kasich, who dropped out this week, each got less 
than 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 415 registered New Hampshire Democrats questioned, 48  
percent preferred Vice President Gore, 32 percent preferred former 
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and 20 percent were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier New Hampshire polls, Bradley had cut into Gore's  
lead. Gore led 61 percent to 9 percent in February, but only 45 
percent to 30 percent last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The error margin in the New Hampshire poll for both Democrats  
and Republicans was plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Congress E-mails Bill to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation has never traveled so quickly down  
Pennsylvania Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in history, Congress on Wednesday e-mailed  
the president a bill to sign into law. A traditional signed 
parchment copy of the Y2K legal reform bill was hand-delivered 
afterward, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Clinton can't enact a law in cyberspace yet, he is  
expected to sign the parchment copy the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, a compromise between House and Senate versions, could  
save American businesses billions of dollars in legal costs from 
Y2K-related lawsuits. It passed the House July 1 by 404-24 and the 
Senate 81-18. Clinton has said he will sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 minutes of congratulating and thanking each other, a  
dozen Democratic and Republican lawmakers of both houses crowded 
around House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate President Pro 
Tempore Strom Thurmond as they took an electronic pen and 
``signed'' the document on plastic computer screens. Sen. Spence 
Abraham, R-Mich., then clicked the ``Send'' button and the bill 
began its journey through cyberspace.

<HEADLINE> Energy Secretary's Beard Temporary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was  
introduced Thursday by his deputy as a man with ``a new look and a 
sense of action.'' Maybe the beard had something to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said his new beard, grown during a recent week-long  
vacation on Cape Cod, probably won't be permanent. For one thing 
his wife, Barbara, is not crazy about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's not being very supportive or helpful,'' he confided.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson for months has been the point man in containing the  
nuclear weapons espionage controversy for the administration, and 
he thought growing a beard might bring him some new fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went on vacation and decided not to shave. I looked at  
myself in the mirror and I felt I needed some better luck,'' he 
said. ``I liked the look. It saves me 70 minutes a week in not 
shaving. So, I've grown the beard, but it's not permanent.''

<HEADLINE> Nextel Earnings Off; CEO To Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RESTON, Va. (AP) -- Nextel Communications chief executive Daniel  
Akerson is leaving the wireless calling company, which on Thursday 
reported better-than-expected quarterly results. 
</P>
<P>
	Akerson will become co-chairman of Eagle River Investments, a  
private company owned by Nextel investor Craig McCaw. Eagle River 
holds McCaw's interests in Nextel, Nextlink and Teledesic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Donahue, Nextel's president and chief operating officer,  
became president and chief executive as of Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Akerson will continue to serve as chairman of Nextel until  
January, at which time McCaw will assume that post. Akerson will 
remain on Nextel's board of directors and operations committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves came as Nextel reported that it nearly halved its  
second-quarter loss compared with a year ago as revenues jumped 88 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time factors, Nextel had an operating loss of  
$134.1 million for the three months ended June 30. In the same 
period last year, operating losses totaled of $266.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, Nextel posted a net loss of $267.7 million, or $1.04  
per share, down from a loss of $491.4 million, or $1.94 a share, a 
year ago. The latest figures include a gain of $70.3 million from 
the sale of Nextel's stake in Nextband, while the year-ago data 
includes a charge $133.2 million for debt payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues totaled $793.1 million, up from $421.4  
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Nextel, based in Reston, Va., attributed the strong showing to  
growth in both wireless telephone and paging services. 
</P>
<P>
	The company added 440,000 domestic subscribers in the second  
quarter and increased its average monthly digital revenue per 
subscriber to $74, Nextel reported. In addition, usage per 
subscriber climbed to an average of 425 minutes per month, up 25 
minutes from the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, Nextel had 3.6 million wireless subscribers in  
the United States, with a network covering 92 of the top 100 
markets in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``That $74 average revenue per user is the best in the  
industry,'' said Bear Stearns analyst David Freedman. ``This 
company still won't make money for a couple more years. The 
important thing is they are breaking through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman said Ackerson's departure was not an ouster, and that  
the transition in senior management should go smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Nextel rose $2 to close at $54.68 3/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Owners Prepared To Let Umps Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Get ready for the amateur umps. Baseball owners  
are prepared to let the men in blue resign en masse and replace 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
	Management officials said Thursday they are not inclined to  
challenge the umpires' decision to quit over the tension that began 
when Roberto Alomar spat at an ump in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But while baseball is leaning toward hiring a new set of  
umpires, commissioner Bud Selig will make the final decision, said 
the officials, who spoke on the condition they not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``That reaction typifies the smugness, the arrogance that has  
led us to where we are, and it exemplifies the lack of appreciation 
for the umpires,'' union head Richie Phillips said. ``They tried it 
before, it wasn't successful. They tried it in '79, it wasn't 
successful. They tried it in '84, it wasn't successful. I guess 
periodically they have to try that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he had submitted the resignations of 57 of the 68  
major league umpires, effective Sept. 2, 4 1/2 weeks before the end of 
the regular season. The American and National League offices said 
Thursday they hadn't received them yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Six of the remaining umpires will soon add their resignations,  
Phillips said. Three haven't been heard from and two, John Shulock 
and Darryl Cousins, aren't union members because they joined the AL 
staff as strikebreakers during the seven-week walkout in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	If the umps do quit, owners could hire umpires from minor  
leagues, high schools and colleges, as they have during previous 
work stoppages. They also could use legal maneuvers to avoid or 
delay handing over $15 million in termination pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``When push comes to shove, the fans know the umpires are the  
real people of baseball,'' Phillips said. ``They are not phonies; 
they go out and work hard. They are blue-collar workers, like the 
fans. The fans understand there's a certain amount of grime and 
grit that's associated with the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the view held by some players. After umpire Greg Kosc  
had to leave in the middle of a game on a hot and humid afternoon 
earlier this month, New York Yankees catcher Jorge Posada said: 
``They're not prepared, they're not in shape. It's a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kosc was hospitalized, and Phillips said the umpire was  
diagnosed with diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Posada apologized the day after his remark. Nonetheless,  
Phillips called him ``a jerk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Greg Kosc, who doesn't have an ounce of body fat on him, is in  
better shape than Posada,'' he said. ``But I think the relationship 
between the players and the umpires is good. There are some players 
who are jerks. There are some pitchers who make $11 million who 
think every pitch they throw is a strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips maintains umpires are caught in the fight over who will  
supervise them. Selig wants to shift authority after this year from 
the league presidents to Sandy Alderson, his executive vice 
president for baseball operations. Alderson is expected to take a 
harder approach with the umpires, who would get up to $400,000 each 
in severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' Alderson said after Phillips made his announcement 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips called Alderson's comment a ``knee-jerk reaction.''  
</P>
<P>
	``There's a great deal of tension within baseball,'' Phillips  
said. ``I think you have various people trying to seize power in 
the game. I think we're going to have to see this power move play 
out before there's any real direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether all umpires would follow through on their  
threat. In March, about 50 umpires voted to give Phillips a new 
five-year contract, but about a dozen voted against him, wanting to 
bring in Ron Shapiro, the agent for Cal Ripken and many other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro is much less confrontational in negotiations than  
Phillips, but he told umpires he wouldn't become involved as long 
as the majority of them backed their longtime leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been angry since Alomar spat at John Hirschbeck's  
face three years ago and was suspended for five games, a punishment 
they deemed too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions rose even higher earlier this month when NL president  
Len Coleman suspended umpire Tom Hallion for three days for bumping 
a player, the first such action that baseball officials could 
remember.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Ready for Second Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker is back with the Houston Astros, and  
the Seattle Mariners are in Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles, Baltimore and Anaheim are looking to make up for  
dismal first halves. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, with the second half of the season starting tonight, many  
are focusing on the New York Yankees, the defending World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everyone knows the Yankees can be beat,'' the Rangers'  
Rafael Palmeiro said, ``but everyone still knows they're the team 
to beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into tonight's games, the AL looks the same as it did at  
the end of last season, with the Yankees, Cleveland and Texas 
leading the divisions, and Boston heading the wild-card race. 
</P>
<P>
	Surprises, however, abound in the National League. While Atlanta  
has a five-game lead in the East and seems on track to its eighth 
straight division title, surprising Cincinnati is one percentage 
point ahead of Houston in the Central, San Francisco is 2 1/2 games up 
on Arizona in the West, and the Astros and New York Mets are 
bunched up in the wild-card standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland had baseball's best record in the first half, going  
56-31, and no other team in the AL Central is over .500. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees (52-34), while not the invincible machine that won  
an AL record 114 games last year, hold a four-game lead in the East 
over Boston (49-39), with Toronto (47-43) three games behind the 
Red Sox, who sputtered when Nomar Garciaparra missed the final nine 
games of the first half with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, Texas (48-39) is five games ahead of Oakland  
(43-44), six in front of Seattle (42-45) and 6 1/2 in front of Anaheim 
(41-45). 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's focus will be on Seattle on tonight when the Mariners  
move into Safeco Field, at $517 million the most expensive ballpark 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an awesome place,'' said Jamie Moyer, scheduled to start  
tonight's game against San Diego. ``What an amazing place to be a 
part of. It's phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, attention in the AL West shifts to the Angels, who  
have gone 11-7 since the return of shortstop Gary DiSarcina and 
will try to make up for a dismal start, caused partly by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can say we miss this guy or that guy, that doesn't go on  
here,'' manager Terry Collins said. ``There is more being made of 
our first half because expectations going into spring training were 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's biggest underachievers are the Los Angeles Dodgers.  
With a $79.2 million opening-day payroll, big things were expected 
of them. But Kevin Brown, baseball's first $100 million man, is 
just 9-6, and Los Angeles is last in the NL West at 39-47, 10 games 
behind the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to completely forget about the first half, to tell you  
the truth,'' catcher Todd Hundley said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least the Dodgers have hopes they can make a run. Not so for  
Baltimore (36-51), 16 1/2 games out despite the third-highest payroll 
on opening day ($78.5 million). A dozen of baseball's low-payroll 
franchise also have little hope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the game starts, payrolls are out the window,'' Minnesota  
All-Star Ron Coomer said. ``If the ball's over the plate, if you 
put good wood on it, it doesn't matter if you're making the minimum 
or $50 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At $33.2 million, Cincinnati has the smallest opening-day  
payroll among the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning teams are teams that work together,'' Scott Williamson  
said. ``You don't have to have the big money to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, Dierker returns to the Astros for tonight's game  
against Detroit. The manager collapsed in the dugout on June 13 
from a seizure, then had surgery to repair abnormal blood vessels 
in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be delighted, but I haven't been antsy to get back,''  
Dierker said. ``I don't feel anything but normal. I'd say at no 
point did I worry about my recovery. I had confidence that I would 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee's game against Kansas City was postponed after a crane  
being used to build Miller Park, the Brewers' new home, collapsed 
Wednesday, killing three people.	   Robert Trunzo, chairman of the board overseeing construction of 
the $400 million stadium, said contractors were cooperating with 
the police and sheriff's investigation into the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time we have a death or serious injury, we treat it as a  
criminal investigation,'' Police Chief Arthur Jones said. ``It may 
not result in that, but that is how we treat it.''

<HEADLINE> Functions of PC Put on Single Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- National Semiconductor Corp. today  
unveiled a new computer chip that puts most of the functions of a 
PC on a single chip, a move that will bring more power and 
functionality to small information devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Geode SC1400 chip will do the work of what would  
normally require six different chips, company spokeswoman Linda 
Ashmore said. 
</P>
<P>
	National Semiconductor is targeting the chip for use in  
``information appliances'' such as television set-top boxes, 
hand-held information devices such as the Palm Pilot, and, 
eventually, car navigation systems. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the industry research firm International Data  
Corp., the information appliance market will reach a worldwide 
shipment of 65 million units in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Clara, Calif.-based developer and manufacturer of  
semiconductor products says the Geode chip, which has speed of 266 
megahertz, can offer full Web-browsing and play digital video. 
</P>
<P>
	The chip consumes little power, eliminating the need for  
space-consuming cooling fans, National Semiconductor says. The chip 
will further shrink machines as only a few other chips will be 
needed for the functions of memory storage and to run high-voltage 
components. 
</P>
<P>
	Cost of information appliances also will be reduced, National  
Semiconductor says, because of the need for fewer components. 
</P>
<P>
	National Semiconductor expects to have its new chip on the  
market by next summer.

<HEADLINE> Boston Votes To End School Busing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The city that became a national emblem of fury  
over court-ordered busing has decided to stop using racial quotas 
in determining which schools children attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston School Committee's 5-2 vote came 25 years after the  
city erupted in violence over an order to desegregate public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The order ignited huge protests, staining the city's reputation  
as white parents hurled rocks and epithets at buses that brought 
black children into their neighborhoods, then refused to let their 
own attend black schools. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge had ruled then that Boston discriminated against  
black children. But a quarter-century later, a federal lawsuit 
accuses the city of discriminating against whites. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing Wednesday night before the vote, the school  
committee was urged not to cave into the pressure created by the 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are giving up only because we have a threat of losing a  
lawsuit, then shame on us,'' said Democratic state Rep. Gloria Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boston may be this first city to be convicted of racial  
segregation for the second time,'' added Sheila Decter, executive 
director of the New England region of the American Jewish Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Superintendent Thomas Payzant said recent court decisions  
against racial preferences and a marked change in the demographics 
of the city support the move. 
</P>
<P>
	``Underlying all of this is a dose of good old common sense that  
says `Let's move on. It's not the '70s. It's not the '80s. It's the 
end of the '90s,''' said Payzant, who was flanked at a news 
conference by some three dozen parents, politicians and community 
leaders -- black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit, a group of white parents claim the current  
busing policy discriminates against their children by denying them 
access to the schools they want. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal by Payzant will allow Boston parents to choose  
where they want to send their children to school and does not allow 
race to be used as a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials will evaluate other criteria when deciding  
which students attend which schools: the proximity of the child's 
home to the school; whether he or she has any siblings there; and 
the results of a yearly school choice lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston still needs busing. There aren't enough neighborhood  
schools to allow every one of the city's 63,000 students to walk, 
and some parents would opt to send their children to schools across 
town. Mayor Thomas Menino has promised to build six schools in 
impoverished areas of the city that need them most. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, some children are bused to maintain racial balance,  
although not to the extent of the 1974 order. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials say the change -- scheduled to take effect in  
the fall of 2000 -- will not significantly change the look of the 
schools. The city's school population is now about 85 percent 
minority: 49 percent black, 26 percent Hispanic and 9 percent 
Asian. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter century ago, about 48 percent of the city's school  
children were minority. Back then, schools were either mostly white 
or all-black. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not going to have a dramatic impact,'' Payzant said.

<HEADLINE> Euro Edges Higher Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro edged higher against the dollar  
Thursday, bolstered by statements from the president of the 
European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0219, up  
from $1.0209 late Wednesday. It reclaimed ground for a second day 
after hitting a low of $1.0108 against the U.S. currency during 
trading on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,  
supported the euro in comments following the regular monthly 
meeting of the ECB and hinted at higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank council left its key interest rates unchanged Thursday,  
as widely expected, and no further changes are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether the bank was moving toward a bias in favor of  
tightening monetary policy -- meaning raising rates -- Duisenberg 
said ``you could see a tightening bias slightly creeping in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates would make returns more attractive on  
holding assets denominated in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clear potential for a stronger'' euro, Duisenberg also  
said, citing an improving European economy and the central bank's 
anti-inflation stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 120.83 Japanese yen in late New  
York trading Thursday, up from 120.59 yen, and rose to 1.5739 Swiss 
francs from 1.5727, and 1.4816 Canadian dollars from 1.4810. The 
British pound rose to $1.5654 from $1.5637. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.9139 German 
marks, down from 1.9152, and 6.4185 French francs, down from 
6.4250.

<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Right-handers Rolando Arrojo and  
Esteban Yan were activated from the disabled list Thursday by the 
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who designated reliever Julio Santana for 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrojo, sidelined since May 26 because of shoulder inflammation,  
made his first start in nearly seven weeks against the New York 
Mets on Thursday night. Yan, who returned to the bullpen, had been 
out since June 20 with a sore right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Santana (1-4, 7.32 ERA) must be traded, sent outright to the  
minors or released within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The other roster opened when Jose Canseco, who leads the AL with  
31 homers, was placed on the disabled list Sunday after back 
surgery last Sunday. He is expected to be sidelined for about six 
weeks.

<HEADLINE> Reed Hopes Umps Stick Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Jeff Reed, whose run-in with Tom Hallion prompted  
the umpire's almost unheard of suspension, said Thursday he hopes 
the men in blue don't quit in September when the pennant races heat 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want your best back there working games,'' Reed said.  
``I'm sure that's going to cause some problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before he was waived by Colorado on July 2, Reed was involved in  
a confrontation with Hallion, who was suspended three games, a 
penalty that begins July 19. 
</P>
<P>
	That punishment is only the latest in the list of grievances  
among the unhappy umpires, who say they will quit baseball Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed's confrontation last month came after Rockies pitcher Mike  
DeJean, while walking to his dugout after an inning, complained to 
third base umpire Terry Tata about a check-swing call. Hallion, 
working at home plate during the game at San Diego, told DeJean to 
get in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	DeJean said he told Hallion he was going to the dugout. At that  
point, DeJean and manager Jim Leyland were ejected. During the 
ensuing argument, it appeared Hallion made contact with Reed and 
Rockies pitching coach Milt May, a charge Tata denied after the 
game on Hallion's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those spur of the moment things,'' said Reed,  
now with the Chicago Cubs. ``I'm sure Tom was upset about some 
things and he might have snapped a little bit. That stuff happens 
in baseball. Ballplayers can do it just as easy as an umpire 
snapping. You try to control your emotions, but this is an 
emotion-filled game. That stuff happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Ed Montague, working in Pittsburgh on Thursday night,  
said umpires have to stand up for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say umpires are arrogant and they talk about the case of  
Tom Hallion,'' Montague said. ``Every single umpire believes Tom 
was wrong. Two years ago I had a case with (Atlanta manager) Bobby 
Cox where I snapped. It's a game of emotion. We're not robots. But 
that's what they want. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't let the players walk all over you. I'm not the game.  
I believe in letting the players play. But if ... happens, I'm 
going to handle it. You're a policeman on the field. We've battled 
for everything we've got. It's always a battle.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kaitlin Sandeno of Mission Viejo, Calif., won  
the women's 800-meter freestyle Thursday, the opening event of the 
Janet Evans Invitational at USC. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandeno, 16, won her first national title this spring in the

<HEADLINE> Purdue To Appeal Proposed Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Purdue is appealing an NCAA committee's  
recommendation to sanction its men's basketball program for alleged 
rule violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sanctions won't take effect until the appeal is  
resolved, which may take several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We filed formal notification that we intend to appeal,''  
athletic department spokesman Jim Vruggink said Thursday. ``That 
sets in motion a chain of events that will resolve the issue. I 
would imagine that it will be around October before the process is 
complete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA confirmed it had received the notice of appeal. That  
gives Purdue 30 days to file the appeal, after which the NCAA will 
have 30 days to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the NCAA's response, Purdue would have another two  
weeks to file a rebuttal, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA's Committee on Infractions found last month that  
Purdue's basketball program had committed several violations and 
recommended two years' probation and sanctions including the loss 
of scholarships and a limit on recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the committee recommended forcing Purdue to forfeit 24  
games in the 1996 season in which the athletes appeared and 
returning 90 percent of the money the school received for competing 
in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We, frankly, are surprised, disappointed and puzzled by some  
of the recommendations,'' athletic director Morgan Burke said when 
the recommendations were made last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if the findings are upheld on appeal, we consider some of  
the recommended penalties to be inappropriate and excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a two-year investigation, the committee said a bank loan  
was granted to a prospective athlete and financial help was 
provided by an Indianapolis businessman to the mother of an 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	In each case, the committee said former assistant Frank Kendrick  
arranged the contacts between the athletes and the outside parties. 
Kendrick, who has said he would appeal individually, has since been 
reassigned at his request.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Profits Jump 172 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co., its production problems apparently  
behind it, today reported second-quarter profits up 172 percent 
over last year and well above analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended June 30, the aerospace company had net  
earnings of $701 million or 75 cents a share, compared with profits 
of $258 million or 26 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 
13 percent, from $13.39 billion to $15.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results far outpaced the 48 cents per share predicted in a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter figures include a one-time gain of $181  
million or 19 cents a share from a federal income tax audit 
settlement covering 1988-1991. Second-quarter earnings in 1998 were 
reduced by a non-recurring charge of $78 million or 8 cents a share 
to reflect the planned termination of the MD-11 jetliner program 
and late delivery costs associated with new-generation 737 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those one-time items, second-quarter earnings were up  
55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second-quarter results demonstrate growing momentum and  
confidence,'' said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commercial airplanes group is on plan -- delivering  
airplanes and improving margins every day. Boeing delivered 165 
commercial airplanes this quarter -- on time, and with 17 percent 
fewer employees and a 10 percentage point improvement in overtime 
from the highest levels in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing struggled with production line snarls, delayed deliveries  
and the Asian financial crisis during the past two years. It lost 
$178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of $1.1 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division had second-quarter  
operating earnings of $435 million, compared with a loss of $178 
million a year ago, when it delivered 137 planes in the quarter. 
Condit said the improvement was principally due to better cost 
control on the new 737 and 777 jetliner programs, more deliveries, 
and lower research and development spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's military aircraft and missiles segment had a 16 percent  
improvement in operating revenues, while the space and 
communications segment was down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Boeing had profits of $1.17  
billion or $1.24 a share, compared with net earnings of $308 
million or 31 cents a share in 1998. Revenues rose 12 percent, from 
$26.33 billion to $29.52 billion.

<HEADLINE> Working Mom Wins Custody Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A lawyer regained primary custody of her two  
daughters in a battle with their stay-at-home dad that caught the 
attention of working mothers around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Alice Hector lost custody of her two daughters to her  
ex-husband, Robert Young, after he argued last year that he was the 
primary caregiver and it would be in the children's best interest 
to remain with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls, now aged 14 and 9, never should have been removed  
from their mother's custody and turned over to Young, the 3rd 
District Court of Appeal said Wednesday in a 7-3 decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said there was ``enough competent evidence'' presented  
to the judge who handled the couple's divorce to support giving 
primary custody to Ms. Hector. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left Thursday for Ms. Hector was not immediately  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellen Lyons, the lawyer who represented Young in his appeal,  
said she planned to argue the case before the Florida Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the appeals court ``keeps referring to the fact  
that he should have been gainfully employed outside the home. They 
never would have said that about the woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young and Ms. Hector were married in 1982 in Albuquerque, N.M.,  
where she worked as a public defender and he an architect. She 
landed a job at a law firm in Miami and moved here in 1989 with the 
children. Young followed six months later but couldn't find work. 
</P>
<P>
	As a stay-at-home father, Young led a Brownie troop for one of  
his daughters, coached the other's soccer team, and took them to 
doctor and dentist appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hector, 54, who later joined a large firm, did what she saw  
as her fair share: woke the children up in the morning, helped with 
homework, spent time with them on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	She filed for divorce in 1995 and was given primary custody a  
year later. Young was to have frequent contact with the girls, and 
within five years they were to move in with him for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, who got a full-time job early in 1997, fought the ruling  
and in June 1998 won a decision by three members of the appeals 
court. The decision focused on such issues as gender bias and who 
should get custody when a marriage ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hector's lawyers asked for another hearing, resulting in the  
latest ruling. One judge removed himself because he is Hector's 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's 1993 ``gender-neutral'' custody law grants custody to  
the proven caretaker -- not always the mother. Gender-neutral laws 
replaced the earlier ``tender years doctrine,'' in which the 
presumption was that the mother should get custody of young 
children unless the father proved she was unfit. 
</P>
<P>
	The case had advocates of working mothers and supporters of  
fathers' rights questioning whether a working mother must choose 
between career and children if she wants to maintain primary 
custody, or if a father has the same nurturing ability as a mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision is a tremendous victory for working mothers as  
well as working fathers,'' said Nancy Chang, an attorney with the 
Center for Constitutional Rights in New York. ``The parents ought 
not (to) be penalized when ... pursuing a career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sidney Siller, founder of the National Organization for Men in  
New York, said: ``You can't rule against a woman in this country, 
that's what it's come down to.''

<HEADLINE> Artest Signs With the Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Ron Artest, the Chicago Bulls' second first-round  
pick and the 16th player taken overall in last month's NBA draft, 
signed a three-year contract with the team on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the NBA rookie salary scale, Artest must be paid  
$899,800 the first year, $967,300 the second and $1,034,000 the 
third. The team has has option for a fourth year. Exact terms 
weren't revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a privilege to wear the Bulls uniform,'' Artest said in a  
statement. ``I'm going to work extremely hard to justify the Bulls' 
selection of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7 forward averaged 13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.2  
assists in two years at St. John's. 
</P>
<P>
	``At St. John's, Ron sacrificed much of his individual game to  
fit the specific needs of the team.'' Bulls general manager Jerry 
Krause said. ``His ability and willingness to sacrifice his own 
game will make him an excellent NBA player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artest will take part in the team's minicamp beginning next  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Artest's former AAU teammate, Elton Brand, the NBA's top draft  
pick, has not yet come to terms with the Bulls.

<HEADLINE> NTSB: TWA 800 Probe Nearing End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three years after TWA Flight 800 turned into a  
fireball in the skies off New York's Long Island, the end of the 
investigation is finally in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are certain that a fuel-air explosion in the  
center fuel tank brought down the Boeing 747 on July 17, 1996, 
killing all 230 aboard, but a final determination of the ignition 
source will have to wait until this fall or winter, Jim Hall, 
chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said 
Wednesday in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	For the safety board, the investigation has been the longest and  
most expensive probe in its 30-year history. Hall said he didn't 
yet want staffers diverting their time to tallying the cost, but 
``it's clearly going to be millions and millions of dollars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Loeb, the panel's head of aviation safety, said  
investigators already have examined the possibility of a static 
electricity buildup, stray current from nearby fuel pumps and 
electrical shorts in the tank's fuel gauge system. 
</P>
<P>
	The final phase of their work is now focusing on possible  
electromagnetic induction, which occurs when electricity from an 
active source or wire causes a trace of activity in a nearby 
inactive wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have studied external sources such as  
radar-emitting military planes and ships. They have also looked at 
carryon items such as laptop computers and other personal 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they are testing electronics built into the plane itself,  
although they have not ruled out any of the earlier possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't favor any particular ways of getting ignition, but we  
know there are a number of them, and the FAA has addressed some of 
them,'' Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In directives issued since the crash, the Federal Aviation  
Administration has ordered a series of safety changes on a variety 
of airplanes. They include new wiring checks on older aircraft, the 
installation of extra wire insulation and a prohibition on draining 
the center fuel tanks in 747s, a practice that can cause 
overheating in fuel-pump bearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Hall and Loeb indicated the five-member safety board likely  
would recommend further safety precautions when it holds its final 
meeting about the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still hopeful that we will be able to have our final board  
meeting and final report by the end of the year,'' the chairman 
said as he sat in his office with binders about the crash nearby. 
He said if there were delays, the meeting would occur by ``early 
winter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris-bound flight exploded in a clear evening sky shortly  
after takeoff from New York's Kennedy International Airport. The 
wreckage fell 13,000 feet into the waters off Long Island. There 
were no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the following weeks, the Navy, FBI and other state, federal  
and local agencies mounted a massive recovery operation and 
investigation. It included checks for bomb-toting terrorists and 
eyewitness reports that a missile was seen streaking toward the 
jumbo jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also partially rebuilt the airplane in a hangar in  
Calverton, N.Y., in their search for clues. 
</P>
<P>
	The relatives of the victims planned a series of remembrances  
this weekend, including a memorial service and the dedication of a 
monument. Both Hall and Loeb were to attend and also deliver an 
investigation update to the families. 
</P>
<P>
	While some have speculated that the plane was blown up by  
terrorists or the military, the FBI concluded that no criminal act 
was involved. On Wednesday, Hall adamantly repeated that the plane 
was not harmed by a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stories will probably continue past my lifetime,'' he said.  
``One of the board's important roles is to protect the integrity of 
investigations and, in doing so, the integrity of the government we 
all work for.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates Over Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A jury deliberated for a second day  
Thursday without reaching a verdict in an antitrust case filed 
against Microsoft Corp. by a small Danbury software company. 
</P>
<P>
	Deliberations were scheduled to resume Friday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	Bristol Technology Inc. claimed during a six-week civil trial  
that Microsoft cut off its access to Windows source code -- software 
blueprints -- hampering its ability to do business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a product called Wind/U, which allows programs --  
such as word processors and spreadsheets -- written to work with 
Windows to be converted to run on computers with different 
operating systems such as Unix. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies had a three-year contract in which Microsoft  
gave Bristol access to source code it needed to create Wind/U. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol sued in August, claiming it was unable to reach an  
agreement with Microsoft for a new contract for the latest versions 
of Windows NT, a top program for running computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends the company tried repeatedly to negotiate a  
new contract with Bristol.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rebounded Thursday  
after sharp falls in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose for a second  
straight day as high-tech companies got a boost from a 1.4-percent 
rally overnight in Wall Street's technology-rich Nasdaq Composite 
Index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei gained 74.0 points, or 0.40 percent, to close at  
18,431.86. On Wednesday, the average had gained 0.97 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the U.S. dollar slipped against the  
Japanese yen. In late trading, the dollar bought 120.64 yen, down 
0.48 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo, but above its late New York 
level of 120.59 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares bounced back after plunging to their lowest  
levels in four weeks on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index rose 183.32 points, or 1.4 percent, to  
13,758.89. The Hang Seng had tumbled 2.9 percent Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were expecting meetings this week between creditors  
and executives of debt-ridden Guangdong Enterprises (Holdings) 
Ltd., which defaulted on debts of more than U.S. $4 billion, to 
produce an agreement on its restructuring plans. That would benefit 
local companies, including banks that are owed millions. 
</P>
<P>
	But after the market closed, company officials denied they were  
coming close to any agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, share prices rose after finance officials said the  
government was ready to step in to curb the recent fall, triggered 
by escalating tensions between Taiwan and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weighted Price Index rose 29.38 points, or 0.37 percent, to  
7,918.04. It had dipped 7.7 percent in the past three sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Vice Finance Minister J.C. Wang said that the  
government will use its stock stabilization funds to buy shares 
when the time seems right to support the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said there were already indications that government was  
buying select banking and blue-chip electronics shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui infuriated Beijing this week by  
saying that the relations between China and Taiwan should be 
handled on a ``state-to-state'' basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing, which insists that they are two political entities  
within the same country, has threatened to use force against Taiwan 
if Lee declares the island's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stocks rose as local investors bought low-priced  
stocks after two days of declines. The SET index rose 2.70 points, 
or 0.5 percent, to 496.70. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares fell as investors remained on the  
sidelines awaiting results of the general elections scheduled to be 
announced July 21. The JSX Composite Index fell 0.7 percent, or 
4.340 points, to 660.542. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares fell as local blue chips received  
little interest from retail investors, who have dominated trading. 
The Composite Index fell 6.35 points, or 0.8 percent, to 844.86 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rose on the central bank's assurance  
it will not raise interest rates. The PSE index gained 8.37 points, 
or 0.3 percent, closing at 2,579.33. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: South Korean shares rallied following three days of  
declines, after Moody's Investors Service improved the ratings of 
nine local banks, and as interest rate worries subsided. The Kospi 
index jumped 28.47 points, or 3 percent, to 982.14. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Singapore shares fell as a recent rally ran out of  
steam. The Straits Times Index dropped 20.91 points, or 1.0 
percent, to 2,157.72. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian stocks rose on buying in leading financial  
and resources stocks. The All Ordinaries Index gained 10.6 points, 
or 0.3 percent, to 3,065. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand stocks rose, led by forest products  
concern Carter Holt Harvey Ltd., which rose on expectations of 
stronger demand for paper products. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 
15.69 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,185.24.

<HEADLINE>  Milwaukee Stadium Deaths Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers postponed their game  
tonight in a gesture of respect to three workers who died when a 
huge crane collapsed while lifting part of the roof for the team's 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece of the  
$400 million stadium's retractable roof in place when it broke in 
half and came crashing down Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off. It was like two explosions,''  
said Gary Craig, who lives near the stadium, called Miller Park. 
``When I went outside I looked around and saw the helicopters 
hovering over the stadium, and I could see that the crane was 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident had not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph. The collapse left a heap of broken, twisted 
metal sitting in the center of the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was positioned outside of the park. The three people  
killed were in a basket attached to another crane in the stadium 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are looking at all possible causes, Milwaukee  
County Sheriff Lev Baldwin said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it the wind? Was it something that happened with the  
crane? We're not sure yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary concern now is the structural integrity of what is  
left of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Larry Gardner described the rubble as ``pick-up  
sticks. Which one is going to fall next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the dead were identified as Jerry Starr and Jeff Wischer,  
35. The identity of the third was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium will be finished, but it is too early to speculate  
on a timetable, Brewers Vice President Laurel Prieb said today. The 
43,000-seat, grass-field ballpark had been scheduled to open next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not,''  
Prieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof, the stadium's most unusual feature, is being built by  
Mitsubishi. The huge crane, soaring 567 feet into the air, was used 
to lift seven sections of a roof structure with a total weight of 
12,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi offered condolences today and said it is cooperating  
fully in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured was a 64-year-old crane operator who was  
ejected from the crane's cabin and fell 20 or 30 feet, said Mark 
McLaughlin, a spokesman for Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital. 
The man was listed in stable condition today with a broken hip and 
broken right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was treated for a dislocated collar bone and  
released from Columbia Hospital, said spokeswoman Kathy Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who suffered minor injuries were treated at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Rescue personnel used dogs to search the rubble Wednesday night  
for any other victims, but none were found, Frank said. Everyone 
known to be at the site was accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers postponed tonight's game with Kansas City at County  
Stadium, which is adjacent to their future home, out of respect for 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was built by Neil F. Lampson Inc., based in Kennewick,  
Wash. Company spokesman Bruce Stemp said it's too early for company 
officials to speculate on the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was designed to hold 1,500 tons, said John Mlaker, who  
worked on its design in 1979. ``Big Blue'' is one of four cranes of 
its size in the world and the largest crane in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
being lowered into position collided with an aerial basket. And on 
May 10, a worker fell 60 feet from the retractable roof and was 
hospitalized for about a week with multiple injuries.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Israeli Leader Meet in D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak presented  
himself to President Clinton on Thursday as ``a messenger of 
change'' in the Middle East and promised to carry out accords to 
give the Palestinians control over another chunk of West Bank 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``America will walk with you,'' Clinton told the new prime  
minister, as they stood together in the Rose Garden under a 
broiling summer sun, taking questions from American and Israeli 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	They then walked purposefully to the residential part of the  
White House where Barak laid out his priorities for peacemaking 
with the Palestinians while Clinton used the 2 1/2 hour session to 
encourage Israel's most decorated soldier to recapture lost 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are approaching the moment of truth,'' Barak told the  
president, according to a senior Israeli official. ``There are 
dangers and there are hopes and we have to find a way to approach 
the risks and enhance the hopes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On specifics, Barak was quoted as telling Clinton that he was  
prepared for ``a painful compromise'' with Syria over the 
Israeli-held Golan Heights, which President Hafez Assady is intent 
to recover after 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Barak did not outline the steps he would take in  
peacemaking with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians, he told 
Clinton that Israel would not return to the pre-1967 lines -- its 
boundaries before capturing the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan 
Heights in the Middle East war that year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the settlements will remain under Israeli sovereignty  
and Jersualem will remain Israel's capital,'' Barak was quoted as 
telling Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Later they were dining and then spending the night at Camp  
David, Md., the presidential retreat identified with Mideast 
peacemaking ever since an agreement between Israel and Egypt was 
reached there two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Easing away from public statements supporting Palestinian  
aspirations for a homeland and a right to return many thousands of 
refugees to Israel, the president said in a joint news conference 
earlier , ``We certainly should be doing nothing to prejudge the 
final status issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also reconsidered the ebullient statement he made in a  
Democratic fund-raiser Tuesday in Coral Gables, Fla., that he was 
as eager as ``a kid with a toy'' to receive a new Israeli prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	This was translated in Hebrew to suggest Clinton intended to  
deal with Barak as if he were a plaything -- an allusion Clinton 
rejected Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``In American English it means I am very excited about the  
prospect of the rejuvenation of the peace process, and that's all 
it means,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, in their statements and body language, Clinton and Barak  
projected a joint determination to work together toward a peaceful 
resolution of conflict in the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
	``For more than a half-century,'' Clinton said, referring to the  
birth of Israel with the support of President Truman in 1948, ``the 
United States has stood proudly with Israel and for the security of 
its people and its nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now, he said, as Barak proceeds with implementing the Wye  
River accords, ``America will help as you move forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Barak pledged to ``inject new momentum into the  
peace process, and to put it back on all tracks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he had urged the United States on his way here to back off  
trying to be the ``judge'' of issues between Israel and the Arabs, 
Barak declared ``we need American leadership and support all the 
way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On two thorny issues, meanwhile, Barak took a tough stand.  
</P>
<P>
	He said that while he was not going to authorize any new Jewish  
settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza, where the Palestinians 
plan to establish a state, Barak said he was also not going to 
dismantle any existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
	The 200,000 Israeli Jews who live among 2 million Arabs had the  
approval of the Israeli government and ``we are responsible for 
them,'' Barak said. ``I believe in strong blocks of settlement that 
will include most of the settlers in Judea-Samaria and the Gaza 
Strip,'' he said, using the Old Testament Hebrew name for the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Barak said he would like to see the embassies of all  
countries relocated to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Clinton has blocked 
transfer of the U.S. Embassy, saying that was part of the issue of 
Jerusalem's future that depended on negotiations with the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak was meeting with Vice President Al Gore after his talk  
with Clinton. Then, Clinton, Barak and their wives were going by 
helicopter to Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a rare gesture of friendship for the new Israeli leader,  
and also an opportunity for Clinton to try out his persuasive 
powers in a relaxed setting. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is determined to see Israel give up land on all fronts  
in exchange for pledges of peace from the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians are showing patience. ``It's not a question of  
trusting Mr. Barak. It's a question of allowing him the 
opportunity, and we will allow him the opportunity with all the 
good will we have,'' senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath 
said at a conference in Geneva concerning the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, meanwhile, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged  
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who co-brokered a peace plan 
for Kosovo, to help get the Middle East peace process back on 
track.

	Clinton Meeting Columbine Students  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton this hour is joining with  
more than 80 students from Colorado -- including some from Columbine 
High School -- to ``send a message to Congress'' for tougher gun 
control laws. The president invited the students to the White House 
to help his campaign for mandatory background checks on all buyers 
at gun shows, and to require child safety locks on handguns. The 
April 20 shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton left 15 
dead. The students' visit was organized by Handgun Control Inc. and 
SAFE (Sane Alternatives to the Firearms Epidemic), a political 
action group formed in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy.

	Bush Says He'll Forgo Matching Funds

<P>
	WATERLOO, Iowa (AP) -- Texas Gov. George Bush said today that he  
would forgo federal matching funds to maintain ``strategic 
flexibility'' in his campaign for the presidency. ``After looking 
at the numbers, cash on hand of $30 million, I've decided not to 
accept federal matching funds during the course of this campaign,'' 
Bush said while campaigning in Iowa. The Republican presidential 
front-runner said that if he accepted the matching funds his 
campaign would have been restricted by spending limits in early 
states like Iowa and New Hampshire.

	MIAMI (AP) -- Three men charged in the deadly 1996 ValuJet crash  
surrendered to the FBI today, with one suspect reiterating that he 
was under orders to sign forms allowing mislabeled oxygen canisters 
onto the flight. Daniel Gonzalez, former vice president of 
maintenance contractor SabreTech Inc., and mechanics Eugene 
Florence and Mauro Valenzuela arrived at FBI headquarters 
accompanied by their lawyers. A court appearance is planned for 
later in the day. The men are charged with conspiracy and making 
false statements that led to the 1996 crash in the Everglades that 
killed 110 people.

	U.S. Launches Mideast Peace Drive

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today is launching a new  
U.S. drive for Mideast peacemaking, looking to Israeli Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak for a formula to reopen negotiations with the 
Palestinians and to affirm he will give up West Bank land to them. 
Clinton is holding to the idea that Israel's security depends on 
land-for-peace accords with all the Arabs. And from Barak the 
president hopes to hear that the stalled agreement to yield an 
additional 13.1 percent of the territory will be implemented soon. 
The two leaders are to make a joint statement at the White House 
later today.

	Former S. African Leader Implicated

<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Former President P.W. Botha  
has been implicated in the 1985 killings of eight anti-apartheid 
activists, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said today. A 
former police death squad commander nicknamed ``Prime Evil'' and 
other officials said the activists were killed in an operation 
approved by the Cabinet ministers and the former president, the 
commission said. The policemen are applying for amnesty in exchange 
for their testimony. The 83-year-old Botha was convicted last year 
of refusing to appear before the commission, but won an appeal last 
month when the court ruled the subpoena technically invalid.

work through seven days of advanced tests on algebra, geometry and 
combined mathematics at Bucharest's main polytechnic institute. 
Over the years, China, Russia, Romania, the United States, Iran and

	Pampling Takes British Open Lead  
</P>

	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Carnoustie Golf Links more than  
lived up to its reputation today as players battled deep rough and 
narrow fairways on their way to some astronomical scores in the 
first round of the British Open. Rounds in the 80s abounded. Among 
the victims were rookie sensation Sergio Garcia who shot an 18-over 
89, and defending champion Mark O'Meara, who finished with 83. 
Through it all emerged a most unlikely clubhouse leader. Rodney 
Pampling, a 30-year-old Australian playing in his first Open, used 
an eagle on the par-5 14th to shoot even par 71.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise Sharply / Jobless Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits rose sharply last week to its highest level 
in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 310,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 10 -- up by 
11,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first increase in weekly jobless claims after two  
consecutive declines and left the claims at their highest point 
since June 5 when they were at 326,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out  
week-to-week volatility, also was up to 303,250. That was the 
highest level since June 26 when they were at 307,250. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase was larger than economists had been  
expecting, but still kept claims at a level indicating that the 
nation's job market remains exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago the government reported that unemployment for the  
month of June crept up to 4.3 percent, still near a 29-year low, 
and even with the increase in the jobless rate the nation's 
businesses added a sizeable 268,000 new jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending July 3,  
12 states and territories reported declines in jobless claims, 
while 39 had increases. The state data lag a week behind the 
national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decline in applications for jobless  
benefits was Florida, down 1,172, a decrease officials attributed 
to fewer layoffs in the construction, trade and service industries 
as well as in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with large decreases were: Washington, down 927;  
South Carolina, down 597; New Hampshire, down 527; and Maryland, 
down 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase was Missouri, up 5,457, an  
increase officials blamed on layoffs in the automobile and 
transportation industries. Other states with big increases were: 
New York, up 3,921; California, up 3,448; Michigan, up 3,294; and 
Wisconsin, up 2,299.

<HEADLINE>  Milwaukee Stadium Deaths Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers postponed their game  
tonight in a gesture of respect to three workers who died when a 
huge crane collapsed while lifting part of the roof for the team's 
new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece of the  
$400 million stadium's retractable roof in place when it broke in 
half and came crashing down Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off. It was like two explosions,''  
said Gary Craig, who lives near the stadium, called Miller Park. 
``When I went outside I looked around and saw the helicopters 
hovering over the stadium, and I could see that the crane was 
gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident had not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph. The collapse left a heap of broken, twisted 
metal sitting in the center of the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was positioned outside of the park. The three people  
killed were in a basket attached to another crane in the stadium 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are looking at all possible causes, Milwaukee  
County Sheriff Lev Baldwin said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Was it the wind? Was it something that happened with the  
crane? We're not sure yet,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary concern now is the structural integrity of what is  
left of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire Chief Larry Gardner described the rubble as ``pick-up  
sticks. Which one is going to fall next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the dead were identified as Jerry Starr and Jeff Wischer,  
35. The identity of the third was not immediately released. 
</P>
<P>
	The stadium will be finished, but it is too early to speculate  
on a timetable, Brewers Vice President Laurel Prieb said today. The 
43,000-seat, grass-field ballpark had been scheduled to open next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no idea as to whether there will be a delay or not,''  
Prieb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The roof, the stadium's most unusual feature, is being built by  
Mitsubishi. The huge crane, soaring 567 feet into the air, was used 
to lift seven sections of a roof structure with a total weight of 
12,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi offered condolences today and said it is cooperating  
fully in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the injured was a 64-year-old crane operator who was  
ejected from the crane's cabin and fell 20 or 30 feet, said Mark 
McLaughlin, a spokesman for Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital. 
The man was listed in stable condition today with a broken hip and 
broken right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Another person was treated for a dislocated collar bone and  
released from Columbia Hospital, said spokeswoman Kathy Schmitz. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who suffered minor injuries were treated at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Rescue personnel used dogs to search the rubble Wednesday night  
for any other victims, but none were found, Frank said. Everyone 
known to be at the site was accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers postponed tonight's game with Kansas City at County  
Stadium, which is adjacent to their future home, out of respect for 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was built by Neil F. Lampson Inc., based in Kennewick,  
Wash. Company spokesman Bruce Stemp said it's too early for company 
officials to speculate on the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane was designed to hold 1,500 tons, said John Mlaker, who  
worked on its design in 1979. ``Big Blue'' is one of four cranes of 
its size in the world and the largest crane in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several workers were injured when a steel girder  
being lowered into position collided with an aerial basket. And on 
May 10, a worker fell 60 feet from the retractable roof and was 
hospitalized for about a week with multiple injuries.

<HEADLINE> Alou Returns to Dome for Workouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Moises Alou made it welcome home night Thursday  
for the Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	On the day manager Larry Dierker returned to the dugout for the  
first time since having a seizure June 13, Alou also arrived at the 
Astrodome to continue his comeback from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou said he expects to play later this season and general  
manager Gerry Hunsicker called Sept. 1 a realistic date for the 
return of the All-Star left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Alou wrecked his knee when he fell off a treadmill at home  
during workouts prior to reporting to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Alou hit .312 and set career highs with 38 home runs  
and 124 RBIs. He had 34 doubles and scored 104 runs as Houston won 
its second straight NL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been through the frustrating part,'' Alou said. ``That's  
why I haven't been here where I would feel sorry for myself. But 
now I need to be here to get my mind ready. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be here with the guys and hope the leg tells me I am  
ready to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros were one percentage point behind Cincinnati in the NL  
Central at the All-Star break. They began the second half Thursday 
night at home against Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pleasure to sit in front of my locker with a baseball  
shirt and shoes and see my teammates,'' Alou said.

<HEADLINE> Australians Happy As Sampras Sits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Pete Sampras wasn't kidding, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Australians barely suppressed their glee Thursday when U.S.  
captain Tom Gullikson made it official at the Davis Cup draw: 
Sampras, arguably the greatest singles player in history, will play 
only doubles in the quarterfinal duel starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras chose team camaraderie over the common sense that his  
presence in singles would make the U.S. team stronger. Gullikson, 
forced to accept that decision, wore the worried look of a man who 
knew he would face a lifetime of second guesses if the gamble 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a few skeptics expected Gullikson to announce that  
Sampras had changed his mind, or had been persuaded by his 
teammates, to join the singles fray. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Gullikson submitted his lineup at noon -- which cannot  
be changed except for injury -- Sampras was posted in the doubles 
with Alex O'Brien, and Todd Martin and Jim Courier were posted for 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	After tennis balls bearing the players' names were drawn from  
the magnificent silver Davis Cup, Martin was set to open against 
fast-rising 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt on the hardcourt of the 
Longwood Cricket Club. That match will be followed by Courier vs. 
two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's doubles, Sampras and O'Brien will take on Mark  
Woodforde and Sandon Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Martin is scheduled to play Rafter before Courier  
takes on Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sensitive as far as being here this week,'' said  
Sampras, who originally hadn't planned on playing Davis Cup this 
year, but changed his mind after being inspired by the U.S. team's 
victory over Britain in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what Jim and Todd did in England, the last thing I  
wanted to do was kind of come along and jump on the bandwagon. That 
is why I have said for the past couple of months that I was just 
going to play doubles. Jim and Todd deserve to play singles. They 
have shown, not only this year but the past couple of years, their 
commitment to Davis Cup. I haven't been in the same boat. ... I 
just never felt comfortable, two months ago, a month ago. I don't 
feel comfortable now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the decision was made by ``consensus'' of all the  
players and himself. Martin said he would have stepped aside if 
Gullikson thought that would make the team better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have come to a decision that I think most of the  
guys are very comfortable with, and we will make the most of it,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel good about it,'' Gullikson said, not very  
convincingly. ``I feel good about it. The players feel good about 
it. If other people don't feel good about it, that is their 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians certainly feel good about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Australian captain John Newcombe said if he had been in  
Gullikson's shoes with, say, Rafter making a decision like Sampras, 
he would never have considered benching Rafter in singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't like to be in Gully's shoes if we win, either,''  
Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde, one of the world's best doubles players, thought  
Sampras would have a difficult time adjusting to doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he is one of the best singles players around at the  
moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to be a 
great doubles player,'' Woodforde said. ``I think, given the 
opportunity to play more matches, sure, he definitely could be with 
that serve. It is a big, big plus. I just can't see how he can just 
walk out there and believe he can play good doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde's regular doubles partner, Todd Woodbridge, is  
injured, but Stolle has plenty of experience playing doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras didn't seem too worried about not having played doubles  
much. He's won only two doubles titles in his career -- in 1995 with 
Martin on the grass at Queen's Club, and in 1989 with Courier on 
clay in Rome. He's 3-1 in Davis Cup doubles, the loss coming with 
Martin against Woodforde and Woodbridge on hardcourt in Washington 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still the same sport out there -- keep it in the lines  
and serve big and return well,'' Sampras said. ``I have practiced 
quite a bit with Alex this week, and I think we feel pretty good. I 
can play good doubles. I know I can. So I think we are going to be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-five match format will put a lot of pressure on  
Sampras and O'Brien if the opening singles are split. But Newcombe 
thought the opening match -- Martin vs. Hewitt -- would be the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the draw came out very well for us,'' Newcombe said.  
``It is a must-win situation for them in that first match, which 
puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Todd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will have the added pressure knowing that he is on the  
court instead of Sampras, who is fresh from winning his sixth 
Wimbledon title, and that, on paper, he is expected to beat Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some anxious moments for them in that first  
match,'' Newcombe said. ``If we lose the first match, we are not 
going to be as worried as they will be if they lose the first 
match.''

<HEADLINE> AMD President Quits After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Computer chipmaker Advanced Micro  
Devices Inc. announced a second-quarter loss, stemming from tough 
competition from Intel Corp. and low sales of a benchmark chip. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report released Wednesday was followed by the  
resignation of company president and chief operating officer S. 
Atiq Raza. But Raza cited personal reasons for his resignation and 
said his departure was not related to the company's financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``My decision to leave AMD was a difficult one,'' he said. ``I  
have enjoyed the challenges of helping to restore competition in 
the microprocessor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Raza's unexpected announcement came as AMD reported a loss of  
$162 million, or $1.10 per share, for the three months ended June 
27. The loss was less than the $1.26 predicted by industry analysts 
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year-ago period, AMD lost $64.6 million, or 45 cents per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Including a one-time, after-tax gain of $259 million from the  
sale of its subsidiary Vantis, as well some charges, AMD recorded 
net income of $79.9 million for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterly revenues totaled $595 million, up from $526 million in  
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	In late morning trading, shares of AMD were up 6 1/4 cents to  
$18.06 1/4 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Several weeks ago, AMD warned that it would suffer a significant  
second-quarter loss because production problems with its most 
popular microprocessor, the K6, would hurt sales. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive  
officer of AMD, said the company's short-term future rested with 
its new Athlon processor. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the face of Intel's intensifying aggression in the consumer  
sector of the PC market, where our AMD-K6-2 processor family ... 
has achieved substantial market share in both desktop and portable 
PCs, further gains in unit market share or revenue growth are 
unlikely,'' he said. ``The key to resuming growth and expanding 
margins is the recently introduced AMD Athlon processor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The world's first seventh-generation processor, Athlon is the  
highest-performance processor for PCs available. Initial shipments 
of Athlon processors, including 600-megahertz versions, began in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD ranks second in the microprocessor market in terms of market  
share, behind Silicon Valley rival Intel.

<HEADLINE>  Anti-Milosevic Front Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- When Slobodanka Vojinovic heard that  
Serbia's most powerful opposition leader plans to launch his own 
wave of anti-government rallies, she rolled her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anything,'' said the 31-year-old office worker,  
her voice weary. ``It's all the same as before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Not Again!'' response by the Serbs to a flood of protest  
rallies announced by various opposition groups is typical. Despite 
an overwhelming popular feeling that President Slobodan Milosevic 
should be ousted, most Serbs believe opposition leaders should go 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like any of them,'' declares Dragan Milovanovic, a  
photographer. ``Things have reached rock bottom, we need new 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Milovanovic, 32, pro-democracy leader Zoran Djindjic is an  
``actor.'' Another leader, Vuk Draskovic, is a little better, but 
still not good enough. Frowning, Milovanovic tries hard to remember 
a politician he likes: ``I've heard something good about 
somebody,'' he mutters, his voice trailing away into silence. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb skepticism about their pro-democracy leaders stems from the  
opposition's past performance. Instead of uniting to exploit 
massive anti-government feelings and protests to remove Milosevic 
from power, they feuded among themselves at crucial times. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past decade of Milosevic's rule, Serbs rose up against  
him four times, enduring police beatings and other hardship. But 
each of the protests collapsed, mainly because the opposition 
leaders were divided or they decided to make a deal with Milosevic. 
Their credibility now is near zero. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Serbia's defeat by NATO and virtual loss of Kosovo to  
the ethnic Albanian majority, discontent with Milosevic's rule is 
greater than ever. But trust in the opposition remains low. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome any anti-Milosevic activity, but I also wish they  
(the opposition) had some kind of strategy, some vision,'' lamented 
Dusan Stojkovic, 29. ``I wish there was more coordination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the main pro-democracy group, the Alliance for Change,  
has held rallies throughout Serbia, campaigning for Milosevic's 
resignation. Thousands have attended the protests, leading to 
expectations that they would grow. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of the latest protests, some 5,000 people gathered  
Wednesday in the northern city of Subotica and clashed briefly with 
pro-government supporters before dispersing. The anti-Milosevic 
demonstration was called by the Alliance for Change and a coalition 
of local parties. 
</P>
<P>
	More violence was reported today in Belgrade, where  
pro-democracy activists said they were attacked while organizing a 
petition for Milosevic's ouster. Dragan Kopcalic, of the Democratic 
Party, said three people were hospitalized and one activist, 
Slobodan Djodjevic, was seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter Draskovic with a now familiar move. On Tuesday, he  
announced separate protest rallies, with the first one to be held 
in Kragujevac on Saturday, only two days after the Alliance for 
Change plans its own rally in the same town. 
</P>
<P>
	Another opposition group planned protest in the northern town of  
Subotica today. Daily protests are being held in the southern city 
of Leskovac and a series of separate anti-Milosevic demonstrations 
planned into August is making it hard even for protesters to keep 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We welcome all actions against the government,'' Slobodan  
Vuksanovic from the Alliance for Change commented on Draskovic's 
decision to hold rallies. ``But we must be very careful not to 
disperse people's energy and patience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic's decision to rejoin the protest movement has left  
some Serbs shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
	Draskovic in the past led the most massive anti-Milosevic  
protests, but joined the Milosevic-led government earlier this year 
only to be kicked out after criticizing the Serb leader's hardline 
policies during the NATO air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	His constant vacillation has cost Draskovic in terms of popular  
support. But the bearded writer-turned-politician is still believed 
to be the one most capable of mounting serious anti-government 
demonstrations. And the fact that he was fired by Milosevic during 
the NATO bombing has helped him regain some of his former 
popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sociologist Boza Jaksic says all political figures must go --  
whether governing or in the opposition -- ``so that a democratic 
change could happen in Serbia.'' He says current opposition leaders 
``do not carry democratic potential'' because they are identified 
with past failures. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful protests of the past months were spontaneous,  
without input from any established political group. 
</P>
<P>
	In the western town of Valjevo, the citizens said they were  
protesting against both the government and the ``incompetent 
opposition.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Exec: Malone, Johnson Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While frustrated with the Los Angeles Dodgers'  
awful first half, the Fox executive in charge of the team doesn't 
blame general manager Kevin Malone or manager Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good about the people running the team. The one thing  
I feel quite comfortable about is it's not a a lack of trying and 
effort,'' said Chase Carey, co-chief operating officer of News 
Corp., the Dodgers' corporate owner. ``We don't like the results, 
but we do like the decisions being made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After starting the second half of the season with a 7-6,  
10-inning loss at Anaheim on Thursday night, the Dodgers were last 
in the NL West at 39-48, 10 games behind division-leading San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	While Carey frequently praised Malone and Johnson during an  
interview at News Corp.'s New York offices, he did not mention 
Dodgers president Bob Graziano, a holdover from the days of Peter 
O'Malley's ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, News Corp. decided to have Graziano report to  
former NBA executive Rick Welts, the new president of the Fox 
Sports Entertainment Group, rather than directly to Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105 million,  
seven-year contract before the season and opened with a $79.2 
million payroll, second in the major leagues behind the New York 
Yankees ($85.1 million). The big spending caused the Dodgers to be 
criticized by division rivals San Francisco and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the cheap shots in terms of us, that's sports,'' Carey  
said. ``I'm a big boy, I can take it,'' he said, adding that others 
owners were using the Dodgers as ``a scapegoat'' for baseball's 
economic disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``When other owners take those kinds of shots, I don't think  
that's productive,'' he said. ``Baseball's problems from an 
economic perspective are industry problems and have been since long 
before we bought the Dodgers.''

<HEADLINE> Dierckxsens Won Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) -- Belgian champion Ludo Dierckxsens  
won the 11th stage of the Tour de France today as the leading 
contenders sat back to recover from their mountain exploits. 
</P>
<P>
	The results had little effect on the overall standings, because  
Dierckxsens was 77th overall going into the stage -- one hour, 14 
minutes and 33 seconds behind the race leader, American Lance 
Armstrong, who easily retained his yellow jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In second place was Dmitri Konyshev of Russia, 1 minute 27  
seconds behind, who narrowly edged out Kazakstan's Alexandre 
Vinokourov. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack finished more than 22 minutes later, including  
Armstrong, Richard Virenque, and other top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierckxsens, a 35-year-old veteran, was punching the air in  
celebration well before the end, and smiled in delight as he 
crossed the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th stage was a relatively flat 124-mile ride from Le Bourg  
d'Oisans in the Alps to Saint-Etienne, the capital of French 
bicycle manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	After two days in the Alps, the ride was more tranquil, snaking  
through villages, vineyards, apricot orchards and fields of 
sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of seven riders broke away after about 62.5 miles and  
led for the whole race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race, in order to control the only riders likely to eat into 
Armstrong's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one notable climb, the 3,963-foot Col de la Croix de  
Chaubouret, before a descent into St. Etienne. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Virenque summed up the mood of many Tour de France  
riders after watching Armstrong extend his already commanding 
overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Armstrong doesn't crack, the rest of us will simply be  
playing for podium places in Paris,'' said Virenque, who finished 
sixth in Wednesday's 10th stage in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, the 27-year-old Texan making a remarkable recovery  
from testicular cancer, said he was ``in a good position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After two stages in the mountains, I've got to be happy. I'm  
in a good position. After yesterday I was tired, so I just tried to 
control my competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's race was won by Italy's Giuseppe Guerini, who  
recovered from a last-minute crash with a spectator who had jumped 
into his path to take a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour officials said Thursday that the spectator visited  
Guerini's hotel to offer his apologies. The two then shook hands, 
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Dierker Back in Astros Dugout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros fans welcomed back Larry Dierker  
with a big Astrodome ``aloha.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The manager, who missed a month following a seizure and brain  
surgery to repair malformed blood vessels, is fond of Hawaiian 
shirts. Some fans entered the Astrodome on Thursday night wearing 
Hawaiian shirts in tribute. The Astros distributed 10,000 leis to 
fans as part of the theme. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker got a standing ovation when he appeared in the dugout  
shortly before the game and was greeted warmly by the umpiring crew 
when he took out the starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign in left field read, ``Welcome back Dirk.'' Another down  
the right-field line said: ``Welcome back Wrangler,'' referring to 
a nickname given Dierker by Astros announcer Milo Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not nervous but I've had this thought creeping up in my  
mind: Will I be the same when situations come up?'' Dierker said 
before the Astros played the Detroit Tigers. ``Sometimes they say 
the game is slow, but after the sixth inning, when you need a 
pinch-hitter, sometimes the decisions come quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker, who collapsed in the dugout June 13, tried to remember  
he wasn't viewing the game on television anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watching at home, I could yell and scream, but in the dugout  
you want to give the impression that you are in control,'' he said. 
``In the dugout, you can't always see if the umpire blew it. On TV, 
you can tell and sometimes that can be really distressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker reclaimed his No. 49 jersey, which had been hanging the  
Astros' dugout since his collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``You see what he went through, and you see how badly he wants  
to be out here, and it makes you thrilled,'' Derek Bell said. 
``It's good that he's able to be out here and not stuck around the 
house screaming and hollering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, 13-14 under interim manager Matt Galante, the team's  
bench coach, rallied from a 6-0 deficit to defeat the Tigers 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``My philosophy is to trust people to do the job and Mattie  
did,'' Dierker said. ``One of the reasons you have a bench coach is 
if something like this happens. It's like having a vice president 
in a large corporation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker said he had answered about 500 cards that wished him  
well, and still had more responses to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``That has been the overwhelming part,'' Dierker said. ``I can't  
even explain how it makes me feel. I think it helped me get healthy 
sooner.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Likely To OK Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are moving toward granting  
themselves a cost-of-living pay raise exceeding $4,600 at a time 
when the economy, budget surpluses and congressional popularity are 
all surging. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid accusations of being sneaky, leaders of both parties  
planned a House debate and vote on the issue today as the chamber 
considers a bill financing the Treasury Department for the coming 
fiscal year. By law, legislators get automatic annual 
cost-of-living increases unless Congress votes against it, and the 
Treasury measure is the traditional vehicle for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's agreed it's not right to keep asking members to  
fall behind the cost of living,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., a 
senior Democrat and supporter of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Most representatives and senators have earned $136,700 annually  
since January 1998. Leaders get more, with House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., earning $175,400, the same as Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3.4 percent increase would take effect in January.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved its version of the Treasury bill on July 1  
without language preventing the increase or any debate on the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters and opponents of the raise predicted the House would  
approve it. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chief author of the House's 
Treasury measure, agreed and said if that occurred, it would be 
``an extraordinary event'' for the increase to be blocked when 
House-Senate bargainers craft a compromise Treasury bill. 
</P>
<P>
	For much of the 1990s, with huge federal deficits and an  
unpopular Congress, proposed pay raises often generated intense 
public opposition and became fodder for radio talk shows. Before 
last year, Congress had voted to block itself from getting a raise 
every year since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	But this year's consideration comes as the country's economy is  
prospering, a three-decade string of budget deficits has melted 
into surpluses, and Congress' approval rating is at a healthy 56 
percent, according to a poll by the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal surplus ``takes away the argument some of us used in  
the past saying we shouldn't have any adjustment to our salaries 
until we take care of the deficit,'' said Kolbe. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Rep. Bob Franks, R-N.J., said he would oppose the  
increase, citing the uncertainty of long-term surplus projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have more accurate evidence of the long-term nature  
of this surplus, I think it's important for Congress to say we can 
live with a $136,700 income,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another critic is Pete Sepp, spokesman for the conservative  
National Taxpayers' Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the last thing Congress should be considering right  
now, especially since taxpayers haven't yet received a single penny 
of tax reduction this year, nor any assurances spending will be 
held in check,'' Sepp said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., have  
discussed the pay boost, as have other House leaders, to make sure 
neither side will use the proposal as a partisan issue against the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker supports the  
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``All federal employees are getting a COLA,'' he said, using the  
shorthand for a cost-of-living adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt offered the same justification.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's the way we treat government workers, and I think we ought  
to do this,'' he said in a brief interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers on both sides of the issue said the proposed increase  
has not been contentious this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``About none, aside from a few media people trying to stir it  
up,'' Kolbe said when asked how much controversy the proposal has 
created. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1989 law established the current mechanism for lawmakers'  
annual automatic increase, reducing the number of politically 
sensitive votes they must take on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	It also created a formula making the size of their increases  
slightly smaller than the boosts that federal employees receive. 
President Clinton has proposed a 4.4 percent increase for 
government workers next year, while lawmakers would get 3.4 
percent, or $4,648.

<HEADLINE> Memorial Pool Now a Crumbled Mess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Buster Crabbe and Johnny Weismuller trained for  
the Olympics in the tide-fed saltwater pool. So did world-renowned 
Hawaiian surfer Duke Kahanamoku. Generations of children learned to 
swim there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Waikiki War Memorial Natatorium was intended to be a  
``living memorial' to the 102 servicemen from Hawaii killed in 
World War I. It's on both federal and state historic preservation 
registers. 
</P>
<P>
	But after decades of neglect, it has become an embarrassment. It  
is also a puzzling eyesore to have on Waikiki Beach as Hawaii tries 
to grab a bigger share of the world tourism market. 
</P>
<P>
	``An apology is owed to every veteran on this island that this  
war memorial has been allowed to deteriorate, and be this monument 
to decay and neglect,'' complained Honolulu Mayor Jeremy Harris, 
whose $11.5 million plan to restore the structure was stalled by a 
court order. ``To stop the restoration of the nation's first living 
war memorial, I think, will go down in history as a disgrace to our 
city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 72-year-old facility in the shadow of Diamond Head is a  
crumbling ruin, surrounded by chain-link fences that keep visitors 
away. One of four stone eagles perched atop the 20-foot archway 
leading to the pool and the ocean-facing bleachers is headless. Two 
rusting support rods protrude from its body. 
</P>
<P>
	Pool decks have collapsed in several places, and numerous  
concrete chunks have broken away from the surrounding walls and 
bleacher seats, exposing rusted bars. The showers, lockers, 
restrooms and offices beneath have long been sealed. The entire 
facility was declared unsafe 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that no one is quite sure what to do with it.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's renovation plan called for tourist-related water  
shows at the natatorium as a means of covering up to $300,000 in 
estimated annual maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the move has been opposed by some users of nearby San Souci  
Beach, who fear a revitalized pool would create more competition 
for parking and attract tourists to an area now largely frequented 
by locals. They'd like to see the bleachers and pool demolished and 
the area made into a 400-foot stretch of beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``We strongly support restoring the arch and having the memorial  
there,'' said James Bickerton, an attorney representing the 
beachgoers. ``But we think the bleachers are a strong attraction to 
the commercial interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Citing water quality and health concerns, the group sued to  
block the mayor's proposal and the plan was put on hold pending a 
trial over which standards should apply to the natatorium's 
saltwater pool. 
</P>
<P>
	Honolulu officials contend circulating salt water would prevent  
harmful buildup of bacteria in the natatorium. State Health 
Director Bruce Anderson disagrees; he can remember getting staph 
infections from swimming there as a child. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the type of disagreement that frustrates the mayor.  
</P>
<P>
	``When we want to fix the pool -- no you can't do that,'' Harris  
said. ``When we want to tear it down -- no you can't do that. When 
we just want to fix the restrooms -- no you can't do that because 
you're not doing the pool, but you can't do the pool. It appears 
nothing can be done without someone trying to stop us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Manny Lopes, 70, who often spends time in nearby  
Kapiolani Park, can recall swimming in the natatorium when he was a 
teen-ager. He wants it back the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a commitment we had to take care of it and we just let  
it slide,'' Lopes said. ``Why did they let it run down? That's the 
question we all have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What if they let Punchbowl run down?'' he added, referring to  
the hallowed National Cemetery of the Pacific, where the nation's 
war dead are buried in a volcanic crater overlooking Honolulu. 
``The people would be screaming and yelling.''

	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The Three Tenors became a dynamic duo  
when Luciano Pavarotti had to bow out of a news conference because 
of a hoarse voice.

	Pavarotti spoke a few hoarse words and blew kisses before  
leaving the news conference Thursday.

<P>
	The concert will launch the Michigan Opera Theatre's New Century

<HEADLINE> Bush Will Forgo Matching Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With his campaign's bank balance bulging at  
$30 million, George W. Bush said Thursday that he would forgo 
federal matching funds in his race for the Republican presidential 
nomination, freeing him from the spending limits that his poorer 
rivals will have to abide by. 
</P>
<P>
	Multimillionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who is largely  
financing his own campaign, is the only other GOP candidate to 
reject the matching funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush reported raising a record $37 million during the first six  
months of the year -- more than either Bob Dole or President Clinton 
took in during their entire 1996 campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	It was more than the rest of the Republican field combined and  
also eclipsed the Democratic front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, 
whose campaign raised $17.5 million, plus an additional $2 million 
for legal and accounting expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican front-runner has three times more cash on hand  
than Gore, who reported $9.4 million in the bank. Gore's Democratic 
challenger, former Sen. Bill Bradley, reported raising $11.7 
million and had $7.5 million in the bank as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Watergate-era campaign finance laws, the federal  
government will match the first $250 of each individual's 
contributions to a candidate. In exchange, candidates agree to 
limit the amount of money they spend on their campaigns -- the cap 
is expected to be about $40 million next year -- and how much they 
spend in each state. 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins the nomination, Bush could still choose to receive  
full federal funding for the general election, which was $61.8 
million for each major party candidate in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has raised almost as much as he could spend under  
the limits. By forgoing the federal matching funds, he frees 
himself from any restriction on campaign spending during the 
primaries, although he still can't accept individual contributions 
of more than $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got limits that constrain a candidate,'' Bush said. ``I  
want to be in a position to respond. I want to be in a position to 
plan, and I want to be in a position to plan according to need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He can spend millions, for example, in Iowa and New Hampshire,  
where other candidates will be limited to an estimated $1.1 million 
and $660,000 respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	``In what will be in all probability just a three or four-week  
race, he will have the funds needed to run a full-fledged 
campaign,'' said Anthony Corrado, a professor of government at 
Colby College in Waterville, Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain, also seeking the GOP presidential  
nomination, quickly criticized Bush's decision, saying he may be 
``unintentionally adding to the already widespread cynicism of the 
American people regarding the influence of special interest money 
in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corrado noted, however, that the other candidates would benefit  
somewhat. The federal election fund faces a shortfall this election 
cycle because fewer Americans are contributing through their income 
tax returns. Candidates had faced the prospect of delayed payments, 
but taking Bush out of the pool means the other candidates will get 
their money sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other 2000 presidential candidates, Forbes also is  
turning down federal funds, as he did in 1996, but he is financing 
much of his GOP campaign himself. Through June 30, Forbes had 
raised $2.9 million and contributed $6.6 million of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes outspent Bush during the first half of 1999, $8.3 million  
to $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush relied on a broad network of contributors. His campaign  
reported that more than 74,000 people have given an average of $467 
so far this year. Nearly 27,000 have given the maximum of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's home state, Texas, was his most fertile fund-raising  
ground, an Associated Press computer analysis of his quarterly 
spending report found. Bush took in 10,269 contributions totaling 
$7 million from the Lone Star State from April through June. 
</P>
<P>
	California was second, with 4,132 contributions totaling $3.6  
million. In Florida, where brother Jeb is the governor, 2,949 
contributors kicked in $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush took in almost $700,000 from political action committees  
and more than $110,000 from members of Washington lobbying firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the federal spending limits, Bush will be able to keep  
raising and spending money up until the national political 
conventions next summer. In 1996, Dole ran up against the spending 
limits in the spring and couldn't respond to Clinton and the 
Democrats, who spent millions of dollars on TV ads attacking him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm mindful of what happened in 1996,'' Bush said. ``I'm not  
going to let it happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, campaign finance experts said Bush's decision will lead  
to a further erosion of the Watergate-era reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we've entered a new era of presidential  
politicking,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the 
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group. ``This 
is going to be financed by private donors, not the public at large. 
We're getting closer to a market-driven presidential economy, where 
the market rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Simon, acting president of Common Cause, said Bush's  
position could hurt him next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is opting to choose unlimited fund raising at the expense  
of the law designed to safeguard the integrity of our presidential 
elections,'' said Simon, whose group supports overhauling the 
campaign finance laws. ``His decision means that the 2000 election 
may be the most expensive ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe said campaign  
finance reform won't be much of an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have spent the money wisely, you have overwhelmed the  
fact of how you got the money,'' Mahe said. ``'I'm not taking any 
taxpayers' money to buy balloons.' Tell me how you're going to lose 
on that line.''

<HEADLINE> IRL Ponders Fender Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) -- It's a change that would strike at the very  
name of open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Indy Racing League returns to another high-banked track,  
Atlanta Motor Speedway, there's serious debate about adding fenders 
to the cars for the 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruton Smith, who owns four tracks where the IRL stages five of  
its 11 races, is pushing the idea mainly as a way of improving 
safety -- a primary concern since flying debris killed three fans 
and injured eight during the May 1 race at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith owns the North Carolina track and the similarly designed  
1.54-mile oval south of Atlanta, where the Kobalt Mechanics Tools 
500 will be held Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the drivers are cool to making such a drastic  
change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe some people would like to see that kind racing on  
ovals,'' said Kenny Brack, winner of the Indianapolis 500 and 
defending IRL champion, ``but if they do, they should go to a 
sports car race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the prototype developed by Smith's organization -- with  
fenders covering all four wheels -- looks similar to a Le Mans-type 
endurance car. 
</P>
<P>
	``Open-wheel racing has its own mystique, its own special  
history in American motorsports,'' said Billy Boat, Brack's 
teammate with A.J. Foyt Motorsports. ``I don't think you need to 
drastically change the formula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, though, open-wheel racing is struggling in America. The  
IRL and its more established rival, Championship Auto Racing Teams 
(CART), have been at odds since 1996, while NASCAR Winston Cup 
racing has blossomed in popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	While more than 150,000 fans routinely pack the grandstands for  
Winston Cup's season-ending race in Atlanta, there probably won't 
be much more than 30,000 for the IRL event. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR racing is the main source of income for Smith's tracks in  
Atlanta, North Carolina, Texas and Las Vegas, so he's reluctant to 
continue playing host to IRL events if there are concerns for fan 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director, said he plans to meet  
with Smith this weekend to discuss the fender proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bruton is a great promoter and he's always trying to  
think of ways to make the sport better,'' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mehl and others have concerns about whether fenders would  
actually make the sport safer. While they might help contain the 
tires and suspension systems that break off in crashes, they 
wouldn't be as secure as the wall of metal that surrounds the tires 
on a Winston Cup car. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think putting a piece of fiberglass around the tire is  
going to stop all debris?'' Brack asked. ``I don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRL already has taken steps to improve safety on high-banked  
tracks like Atlanta and Charlotte, which were originally designed 
for the slower Winston Cup cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A wheel-tether system -- designed to keep tires from flying loose  
from the car -- was implemented after the tragedy in North Carolina. 
Also, new engine regulations have drastically reduced speeds at the 
IRL's fastest tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Boat won the pole for the league's inaugural Atlanta  
race at more than 224 mph. During Thursday's opening practice 
session, the fastest laps were around 216 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	A car with fenders would undoubtedly increase speeds, since the  
exposed tires of an open-wheel car account for 40 percent of the 
aerodynamic drag, according to Mehl. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, sports cars have shown a tendency to lift off the  
track. During the 24 Hours of Le Mans last month, a car flew 60 
feet into the air and flipped five times. Fortunately, the wreck 
occurred on a road course, far away from any fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an accident could be disastrous at a facility like Atlanta,  
where massive grandstands are located right next to the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going after safety, that's the wrong approach,''  
Boat said. ``A lot of aerodynamic issues become more of a factor 
when you put a body on something that's going 220 mph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's proposal is not entirely based on safety concerns.  
Fenders also would allow more distinctive color schemes and provide 
additional room for advertising, no small consideration in a sport 
driven by corporate cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest problem we have is identifying the drivers and the  
cars for the fans,'' said Sam Schmidt, who drives for Treadway 
Racing. ``If there's more space on the car, there's more room for a 
Rainbow Warrior paint scheme (the colors of NASCAR star Jeff 
Gordon) and on and on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But safety will be the deciding factor in the debate over  
fenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to be real cautious,'' Mehl said. ``You're  
talking about a long history of open-wheel racing.''

	Disastrous Day for N. Ireland Peace  
</P>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The struggle to form a Northern  
Ireland government imploded today in chaos and anger, as the main 
Protestant party boycotted a crucial vote because of the Irish 
Republican Army's refusal to disarm. The British and Irish 
governments, which have spent months trying to coax the Protestants 
of the Ulster Unionist party to accept the Catholics of Sinn Fein 
as government colleagues, conceded that the damage could take 
months to repair.

	Clinton, Barak Confer in Washington  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak presented  
himself to President Clinton today as ``a messenger of change'' in 
the Middle East and promised to carry out accords to give the 
Palestinians control over another chunk of West Bank territory. 
``America will walk with you,'' Clinton told the new prime 
minister, as they stood together in the Rose Garden under a 
broiling summer sun.

	China Declares Its Own Neutron Bomb  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China declared today that it had invented its own  
neutron bomb, making an unprecedented disclosure about its nuclear 
arsenal amid U.S. accusations of atomic spying. The timing of the 
announcement also came the same week China launched a verbal tirade 
against rival Taiwan and threatened to attack the island. China is 
known to have exploded a neutron bomb in 1988, but in keeping with 
its secretive military traditions, apparently never announced its 
achievement.

<P>
	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iranian police kept Tehran  
under a tight leash today, manning checkpoints across the Iranian 
capital and demanding identity papers as they searched for the 
students who ignited a week of pro-democracy protests. Government 
officials said those found guilty of damaging public property 
during the protests will be tried as ``enemies of the state'' and 
could face the death penalty.

	Campaign Finance Probe Faulted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department investigation of  
campaign finance abuses was delayed but ultimately not impaired by 
mishandling of FBI intelligence on possible Chinese efforts to 
influence U.S. politics, Attorney General Janet Reno said today. 
Reno praised a report by Justice's inspector general, Michael 
Bromwich, that criticized department officials for showing Congress 
raw, uncorroborated intelligence but also took FBI counterspies to 
task for earlier keeping the same data from campaign finance 
investigators.

	Killer Suspected in Unsolved Cases  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The FBI has gotten calls, letters and faxes from  
police agencies around the country about more than 200 unsolved 
murders they believe could be the work of suspected railroad killer 
Angel Maturino Resendez. So far, the 39-year-old drifter is tied to 
nine slayings and charged in four. Most of the requests, which came 
from police in practically every state, had to be put aside during 
the intense six-week manhunt for Maturino Resendez. The illegal 
immigrant surrendered Tuesday to a Texas Ranger in El Paso.

	Panel Urges Clinton To Indict Castro

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House panel and  
Cuban-American leaders accused the Clinton administration today of 
stalling in a long-running investigation of Cuba's shooting down of 
two civilian aircraft in 1996. They suggested Fidel Castro should 
be indicted in the inquiry. The episode over the Florida Straits, 
between Cuba and the Florida Keys, claimed the lives of four.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in history, Congress  
e-mailed the president a bill to sign into law yesterday. A 
traditional signed parchment copy of the Y2K legal reform bill was 
hand-delivered afterward, just in case. The bill, a compromise 
between House and Senate versions, could save American businesses 
billions of dollars in legal costs from Y2K-related lawsuits. It 
passed the House July 1 by 404-24 and the Senate 81-18. Clinton has 
said he will sign it.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose today, lifting some market indexes  
to new highs, as another report showed the strong economy still 
hasn't sparked inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 
38.31 to 11,186.41, ending less than 15 points below Monday's 
record close. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 1,831-1,091. The 
Nasdaq rose 21.18 to 2,839.31, setting a record high for the second 
day in a row.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Management officials said today they are not  
inclined to challenge the baseball umpires' decision to quit over 
the tension that began when Roberto Alomar spat at an ump in 1996. 
But while baseball is leaning toward hiring a new set of umpires, 
commissioner Bud Selig will make the final decision, said the 
officials, who spoke on the condition they not be identified.

<HEADLINE> Golf Barely Surviving British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Golf was invented 550 years ago just  
a few miles down the grim, gray coast. After Thursday, the surprise 
is that it didn't die here as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the average player had to play out there,'' David Duval  
said after walking off with a 79, ``he'd probably quit the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of pros, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie is simply the hardest place in the world to play  
championship golf. At 7,361 yards, it's the longest course ever 
used for the British Open. Seven of the par-4s are 459 yards or 
longer, none with landing areas wide enough to park a half-dozen 
cars side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	The rough is tall enough in places to tickle your nose. No more  
than two consecutive holes play in the same direction, giving the 
raking winds several shots at any golfer who crosses them. Water, 
in the form of a meandering stream known as Barry Burn, comes into 
play on 11 holes; seven feature out-of-bounds on the left. Even the 
driving range has a water hazard. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Danny Kaye played here and below his name in the visitors'  
book scribbled one word: murder. Scotsman Sam Torrance, who's 
played golf on this side of the Atlantic for four decades and 
hadn't missed any of the previous 27 Opens, pulled out of this one 
20 minutes before his scheduled tee time. According to a statement 
from the Royal &AMP; Ancient Championship Committee, he told officials 
``he felt he was not happy enough with his game to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In hindsight, most of the 156 players who went ahead with their  
opening rounds probably wished they'd said the same thing. Not to 
worry; most of them will get what they want soon enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could actually be a place where people wished they'd miss  
the cut,'' said reigning U.S. Open champion Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Most won't have to wish. The only round of even-par or better  
was recorded by a little-known Australian pro named Rodney 
Pampling. His wife, a sports psychologist, helped him map out a 
plan to attack the course. Her work can only get tougher from here 
on out. 
</P>
<P>
	Pampling, a former greenskeeper, went out in the second group at  
7:25 a.m., enjoyed relatively mild breezes for four holes and found 
his way back to the clubhouse several hours later with a 71. 
Instead of heading back to the driving range, Pampling went 
straight to a barber shop, somehow convinced less wind resistance 
would serve him better than more practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Pampling didn't say where he got his hair cut, but he must have  
traveled some distance. Judging by the height of the rough at 
Carnoustie, there haven't been any sharp objects in the vicinity 
for several weeks, which turned out to be a good thing. Just 
getting around the links proved dangerous enough for most of the 
golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who shot 79, said the toughest thing about playing  
``was trying not to injure yourself.'' He was not kidding. Tiger 
Woods, who spent parts of his day hacking free of rough en route to 
a 74, said: ``You could get hurt out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the golfers suffered nothing worse than injured pride.  
The average score was 78.3. Fifty-seven golfers failed to break 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Scotsman Sandy Lyle, who won the 1985 Open but has been in a  
career slump since his 1988 Masters victory, believed his game was 
coming around until he set foot on Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has probably set me back six months,'' he said. ``All this  
hard work I've been doing getting my swing organized -- it's just 
torn apart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little consolation to be had after shooting 85, but  
Lyle found some in the misery of playing partner Fred Funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``When someone like Fred Funk, who's known for accurate play and  
hitting fairways all the time, shoots 83, you know it's 
impossible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Lyle didn't know at the time was that after their round,  
Funk withdrew. He injured his shoulder hitting out of the rough he 
so rarely encounters. 
</P>
<P>
	The moaning and groaning was severe enough, finally, to put  
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the R &AMP; A, on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
	When the players straggled in after practice rounds and  
complained the fairways were too narrow, the rough was too high, 
and the course too hard, Bonallack sweetly shot back, ``Too hard 
for what?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But by the end of the day, he was in full retreat.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to punish the golfers or make them look  
silly,'' he said. ``Far from it. We feel very sorry for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not sorry enough to change a thing.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Euro Edges Higher Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro edged higher against the dollar  
Thursday, bolstered by statements from the president of the 
European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0219, up  
from $1.0209 late Wednesday. It reclaimed ground for a second day 
after hitting a low of $1.0108 against the U.S. currency during 
trading on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,  
supported the euro in comments following the regular monthly 
meeting of the ECB and hinted at higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank council left its key interest rates unchanged Thursday,  
as widely expected, and no further changes are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether the bank was moving toward a bias in favor of  
tightening monetary policy -- meaning raising rates -- Duisenberg 
said ``you could see a tightening bias slightly creeping in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates would make returns more attractive on  
holding assets denominated in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clear potential for a stronger'' euro, Duisenberg also  
said, citing an improving European economy and the central bank's 
anti-inflation stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 120.83 Japanese yen in late New  
York trading Thursday, up from 120.59 yen, and rose to 1.5739 Swiss 
francs from 1.5727, and 1.4816 Canadian dollars from 1.4810. The 
British pound rose to $1.5654 from $1.5637. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.9139 German 
marks, down from 1.9152, and 6.4185 French francs, down from 
6.4250.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Publicist Keeps Eye on Film </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tom Cruise's publicist is hoping to keep  
close tabs on broadcasts involving the star's racy new movie, 
``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PMK, the publicity firm that represents Cruise, distributed a  
waiver to media at a preview for ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' asking to see 
rough cuts in advance of any TV reports featuring interviews with 
the actor. 
</P>
<P>
	The waivers gave Cruise representatives the option to veto  
segments prior to broadcast and specified that unused video ``will 
be destroyed'' and news outlets must, if asked, ``supply evidence 
of such destruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Entertainment Tonight'' and ``Access Hollywood'' were among  
those handed the waiver. ``Entertainment Tonight'' didn't sign the 
waiver, spokeswoman Kristy Barrett said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	PMK's Pat Kingsley has said the request to see advance footage  
was a mistake and that the requirement was rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
	But everyone interviewing Cruise had to sign a revised waiver  
with the pledge that ``the interview and the program will not show 
the artist in a negative or derogatory manner.''

<HEADLINE>  Gore: No More Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told the NAACP Thursday  
that ending the practice of racial profiling by police departments 
would be a top priority in his presidential administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to end the shameful practice of racial profiling,''  
Gore told 3,000 NAACP members Thursday on the closing day of the 
organization's annual national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the front-runner who is facing former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination, struck several 
themes popular with members of the largest and oldest civil rights 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	They included support for tighter gun laws, a federal hate  
crimes law, the launch of an investment fund to boost trade with 
African nations and quality preschool for all children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have to rise to the challenge and do right by our  
children,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black advocates say racial profiling, the police practice of  
singling out minorities for questioning, is often at the crux of 
fatal shootings, such as the killings of young blacks by police 
under questionable circumstances in New York, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm elected president, ending racial profiling will be the  
first civil rights act of the new century,'' Gore said to a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeated his call for strong national gun safety  
provisions, saying handgun purchasers should be required to have 
photo licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to create a family lobby that will be more  
powerful than the gun lobby,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo license provision is part of an anti-crime agenda Gore  
has outlined this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore took up the anthem again while addressing the College  
Democrats of America at their national convention in Washington. He 
accused the GOP of doing ``the bidding of the NRA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also promised the students that he would carry on the legacy  
of the civil rights movement, by focusing on eliminating 
discrimination and helping those who have been left out of the 
nation's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the country there are people who are misperceived,''  
Gore said. ``Those individuals who are misperceived hold the keys 
to our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most important missions of the country in the future,  
Gore added, will be to prove that people of all different 
backgrounds can benefit from working together. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's address to the 500 students was interrupted a few times  
by several animal rights activists in the audience. They began 
chanting ``burn bunnies, lose votes'' during the first part of 
Gore's speech. The vice president tried to diffuse the incident by 
saying, ``Let's hear it for the First Amendment. Let's hear it for 
free speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the students started chanting again, the vice president  
spoke directly to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad to speak with you later if you want to actually  
exchange ideas,'' he said. Hotel security eventually led the 
activists out of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Monday to Boston city police officers, Gore  
announced a plan for ``gang-free zones'' with curfews on individual 
gang members and a ban on ``gang-related clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore focused on reducing rural crime on campaign stops in Iowa  
on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million New Africa Infrastructure Fund, which will be  
the largest equity investment fund ever developed by the Overseas 
Private Investment Corporation, is expected to attract an 
additional $2 billion in financing capital to countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa at no cost to U.S. taxpayers, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund is expected to create nearly 7,000 new jobs and $50  
million in annual revenues for the countries involved while 
generating new markets for U.S. products.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star Likes Her Golf Noisy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Something was missing.  
</P>
<P>
	Brandi Chastain, one of the heroes in the American soccer team's  
World Cup victory, was trying her hand at golf. The ball was on the 
tee, the driver was in her hands and she was about to swing. Then 
it came to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``In soccer we have noise,'' she shouted to the fans around her,  
who had hushed as golf galleries do when a shot is about to be 
made. ``So don't be afraid. I'm serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans let loose with ``USA!'' and ``Go for the goal.''  
Satisfied, Chastain clubbed the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf was a little different Wednesday at the Wykagyl Country  
Club. Soccer jerseys and ponytails were the order of the day as 
preteen girls swarmed to see soccer stars Chastain, Mia Hamm and 
Julie Foudy. They played an exuberant 18 holes, bantering with fans 
and insulting each other across the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	When Chastain got more sod than ball on one shot, Foudy shouted,  
``I hate when that happens.'' And when Chastain was asked to reveal 
her handicap, she said, ``Julie's my handicap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer stars played with pros Meg Mallon and Karrie Webb in  
the best-ball pro-am tournament of the Japan Airlines Big Apple 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before they teed off, the soccer players attracted uncommon  
early morning attention as they warmed up on the club's driving 
range. Among the scores of youngsters was Allison Kowalski, 6, of 
Wayne, N.J., who sneaked inside the spectator ropes and got her 
jersey -- already labeled with Hamm's name and number -- autographed 
by all three stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Staci Whinfield and Allison Farina, both 11 and from Cheshire,  
Conn., staked out a spot alongside the cart path between the 
driving range and the first tee, hoping for a chat with Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't figured out what to say yet,'' Staci said.  
``Probably just `Hi' and `You're my hero.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hamm and Foudy teed off before a crowd of 200, the starter  
announced that he'd never seen that many people at 8:30. 
</P>
<P>
	The foursome that included Hamm and Foudy was just ahead of the  
one that included Chastain, and they managed to rib each other 
whenever they were close enough. Just as Chastain was about to hit 
a tee shot, Foudy shouted from the fairway of the next hole, ``Head 
down! Watch your knees!'' And Hamm added, ``Breathe through your 
eyelids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, as Chastain was sizing up a putt, a fan shouted, ``Kick  
it!.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be better if I did,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hamm poked fun at Chastain's outfit, shouting, ``You look good,  
except for that one long sock.'' Chastain, who at the moment of 
victory on Saturday tore off her jersey and revealed her sports 
bra, kept her sleeveless shirt on, but did doff a gray sweater she 
wore during warmups. 
</P>
<P>
	The soccer champs were asked by officials not to delay the  
tourney by signing autographs, but Chastain broke the rule a couple 
of times. When the women finished their 18 holes, they signed 
autographs for 40 minutes on balls, magazine covers, jerseys and 
even faces. 
</P>
<P>
	As they ran out of time, adults were asked to leave the line,  
then older children, leaving just the smiling, adoring youngest 
fans.

<HEADLINE>  Gore: No More Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore told the NAACP Thursday  
that ending the practice of racial profiling by police departments 
would be a top priority in his presidential administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to end the shameful practice of racial profiling,''  
Gore told 3,000 NAACP members Thursday on the closing day of the 
organization's annual national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the front-runner who is facing former New Jersey Sen. Bill  
Bradley for the Democratic presidential nomination, struck several 
themes popular with members of the largest and oldest civil rights 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	They included support for tighter gun laws, a federal hate  
crimes law, the launch of an investment fund to boost trade with 
African nations and quality preschool for all children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have to rise to the challenge and do right by our  
children,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black advocates say racial profiling, the police practice of  
singling out minorities for questioning, is often at the crux of 
fatal shootings, such as the killings of young blacks by police 
under questionable circumstances in New York, Pittsburgh and 
Riverside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm elected president, ending racial profiling will be the  
first civil rights act of the new century,'' Gore said to a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeated his call for strong national gun safety  
provisions, saying handgun purchasers should be required to have 
photo licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to create a family lobby that will be more  
powerful than the gun lobby,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo license provision is part of an anti-crime agenda Gore  
has outlined this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore took up the anthem again while addressing the College  
Democrats of America at their national convention in Washington. He 
accused the GOP of doing ``the bidding of the NRA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also promised the students that he would carry on the legacy  
of the civil rights movement, by focusing on eliminating 
discrimination and helping those who have been left out of the 
nation's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	``All over the country there are people who are misperceived,''  
Gore said. ``Those individuals who are misperceived hold the keys 
to our future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the most important missions of the country in the future,  
Gore added, will be to prove that people of all different 
backgrounds can benefit from working together. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's address to the 500 students was interrupted a few times  
by several animal rights activists in the audience. They began 
chanting ``burn bunnies, lose votes'' during the first part of 
Gore's speech. The vice president tried to diffuse the incident by 
saying, ``Let's hear it for the First Amendment. Let's hear it for 
free speech.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the students started chanting again, the vice president  
spoke directly to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be glad to speak with you later if you want to actually  
exchange ideas,'' he said. Hotel security eventually led the 
activists out of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Monday to Boston city police officers, Gore  
announced a plan for ``gang-free zones'' with curfews on individual 
gang members and a ban on ``gang-related clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore focused on reducing rural crime on campaign stops in Iowa  
on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $350 million New Africa Infrastructure Fund, which will be  
the largest equity investment fund ever developed by the Overseas 
Private Investment Corporation, is expected to attract an 
additional $2 billion in financing capital to countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa at no cost to U.S. taxpayers, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund is expected to create nearly 7,000 new jobs and $50  
million in annual revenues for the countries involved while 
generating new markets for U.S. products.

<HEADLINE> Ex-SLA Member Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An accused terrorist-turned-housewife has  
pleaded innocent to planting bombs under police cars in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Ann Soliah, 52, a suspected Symbionese Liberation Army  
member who fled to Minnesota and became a doctor's wife and mother 
of three, entered the plea Wednesday. She was ordered held on $1 
million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense argued for a lower bail, saying the woman who called  
herself as Sara Jane Olson is a different person from the one who 
fled California in the turbulent 1970s and is no longer a flight 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses portrayed her as a caring churchgoer who gave  
Christmas parties, acted in local theater, helped immigrants learn 
English and served meals to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Larry Fidler said prosecutors have accused her of an  
act that could have killed police officers and innocent bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is something about the use of a bomb that I find ...  
abhorrent,'' Fidler said. ``It is the terrorist weapon of choice. 
It has no discretion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah's daughters wept in their father's arms after the  
five-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her family is very worried that she won't make bail,'' said  
defense lawyer Susan Jordan. ``A million dollars is a lot of money, 
(but) we're optimistic that it can be raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah was a fugitive before FBI agents acting on a tip from  
the TV show ``America's Most Wanted'' captured her last month in 
St. Paul, Minn. She was extradited on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1976 grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday accused her of  
placing pipe bombs filled with nails under two Los Angeles police 
cars in retaliation for a 1974 shootout with police in which six 
members of the SLA were killed. One bomb malfunctioned and the 
other was found before it could go off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, charged with conspiracy to commit murder and other  
crimes, faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The bail hearing also revealed that in 1986, Ms. Soliah tried to  
reach a plea bargain that fell through when prosecutors declined to 
guarantee that she would not receive jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Michael Latin said there was circumstantial evidence  
linking Ms. Soliah to the bombing attempts, including statements 
made by Patty Hearst, who was kidnapped and held by the SLA in 1974 
and later convicted of taking part in a bank holdup with SLA 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hearst, now a mother of two living in Connecticut, told the  
TV show ``Rivera Live'' on Wednesday that the government had 
destroyed the case against Ms. Soliah by convicting her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a convicted felon now. A bank robber. My credibility is  
zero,'' Ms. Hearst said. ``How can they convict her, if I'm the 
only witness?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I resent this all being dredged up. It is ancient history at  
this point,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Ms. Soliah, Ms. Hearst said: ``I'm sorry for her children  
... she's got a lot of explaining to do.''

<HEADLINE> Gossip Columnist, Critic in Tiff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Gossip columnist Liz Smith as The New York Times  
chief theater critic? 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly meant as a compliment, Smith said Wednesday, even  
though the suggestion came from Ben Brantley, the man who already 
holds the job. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in the August issue of W, Brantley playfully  
makes the proposal after saying that part of Broadway's problem is 
certain theatergoers are unreceptive to challenging plays and 
musicals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was dishing tourist crowds and inattentive, unappreciated  
audiences -- the man in the street whom Brantley obviously considers 
not clever enough to appreciate what he appreciates,'' Smith wrote 
in her column. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, the 'man on the street' is whom I write for, and I think  
they're a pretty smart lot, overall,'' Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley and Smith have disagreed in the past, most forcefully  
over the Tony-winning production of ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his review last March of ``Annie,'' Brantley called the  
revival of the Irving Berlin musical ``acrid smog'' and said its 
star, Bernadette Peters, was ``misdirected and miscast in a role 
forever associated with its orginator, Ethel Merman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith responded with a spirited defense of Peters and the show,  
adding ``Sometimes, one would like to take ... Brantley, string him 
up in Shubert Alley and just let the fellow hang there, watching 
the rest of us enjoy and love the theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet their dust-ups have all been good-natured, according to a  
spokesman for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brantley is a really smart guy. He loves the theater. We agree  
to disagree,'' Smith wrote Wednesday. ``That's America to me!''

<HEADLINE> NYC Couple Accused of Holding Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A city social worker and her husband have been  
accused of luring a young Nigerian girl to this country with the 
promise of a better life and then forcing her into servitude for 
nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosper Emeka Udogwu, 48, a proofreader, and Ifeoma Ezeonu  
Udogwu, 39, the social worker, were arrested Wednesday accused of 
conspiracy, harboring an alien, involuntary servitude and witness 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Udogwu was suspended from her city job as a child  
evaluation specialist who chooses appropriate homes for foster 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the couple brought the then-13-year-old girl,  
who was a baby sitter for Mrs. Udogwu's sister in Nigeria, to the 
United States in 1989 and promised she would go to trade school, 
learn how to sew and ``enjoy a better life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she was beaten, forced to do the family's chores and  
threatened by the couple, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Tritz, a lawyer for Udogwu, said prosecutors unfairly give  
the impression that the girl was ``chained in the basement and 
beaten at every turn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said, she was treated well, even enjoying trips to  
Disney World and a trip home during which she gave her family 
$4,000 in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, now 22, was identified court papers only as ``Girl  
A.'' Prosecutors say she arrived in the United States in August 
1989 and was told she was responsible for cooking, cleaning, yard 
work, laundry and the caring for and feeding of the Udogwu 
children. The family now has four children, ages 6, 7, 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said she was told she would be stripped naked and  
returned to Nigeria if she did not obey the couple, who are 
naturalized U.S. citizens but are from Nigeria. The couple 
allegedly warned her that they could cause her brother to lose his 
job and her family to suffer financially. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next nine years, the girl was forbidden from speaking  
to anyone outside the home, from using the telephone and from 
collecting the mail received at the Udogwu residence, prosecutors 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she was permitted to attend public high school.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple periodically beat the girl with their hands, belts,  
slippers and a Nigerian-style broom made with sticks whenever she 
did something wrong, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tritz said Udogwu brought the girl to this country after he was  
told by her mother that he was the child's father. He said she 
sought help from the authorities only after he discovered she was 
not his daughter and reported that fact to immigration authorities, 
jeopardizing her ability to stay here. 
</P>
<P>
	``This places a cloud over the allegations made by this woman,''  
Tritz said. ``At the appropriate time, her credibility will be 
questioned in a very large way.''

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Storms Cause Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Storms sweeping through Arizona drenched the  
Grand Canyon, producing flash floods and mudslides that injured 
four people, undermined a water supply line and closed a major 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter plucked a Phoenix man stranded in his car, and an  
officer in Tucson narrowly managed to grab an 8-year-old child 
being swept away. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms on Wednesday dumped 1.24 inches of rain on Phoenix,  
eclipsing the record of .47 inches for the date set in 1942. Tucson 
got 1.48 inches, the most recorded there since Oct. 26, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the summer monsoons, we've had only 61 days with an  
inch or more in the past 103 years. This is a real rarity,'' said 
National Weather Service meterologist Craig Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3 inches drenched the Grand Canyon, leading officials  
to close the main trail from the South Rim to the canyon's floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The trans-canyon pipeline that brings water up to the southern  
rim's visitor center remained intact but was exposed and undercut 
for about 2,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the four injured in the canyon had broken legs, and parts  
of the 9-mile Bright Angel Trail were washed out or covered by 
mudslides, rock falls and debris, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other trails were open but the park set a moratorium on  
backcountry hiking and camping permits until the trail is repaired 
-- which might take three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tucson, three police officers sprinted after a van with three  
people aboard as it was swept down a suddenly raging wash. One 
officer tossed a garden hose to a woman who climbed out of the van 
and was pulled to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other officers smashed a window and pulled a teen-ager out,  
but an 8-year-old girl was swept downstream as the van went under. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the officers, Mike Carroll, raced to the far side of a  
nearby bridge, jumped into the torrent, grabbed a tree limb and 
snatched her out by her clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people are extremely lucky to be alive,'' said fire  
Capt. Brian Delfs.

<HEADLINE> Unisys Profits Rise 33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) -- Strong growth in computer services led  
Unisys Corp. to a 33 percent increase in second-quarter profit, 
easily surpassing Wall Street predictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys reported Thursday it earned $119.7 million, or 38 cents  
per share, during the three months ended June 30. That was up from 
a profit of $90.1 million, or 24 cents per share, during the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew 9 percent to $1.89 billion from $1.73 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Bell, Pa.-based computer manufacturing and services  
company cited double-digit increases in revenue, including big 
gains in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Unisys also saw a 3 percent growth in computer technology  
revenue, partly due to continued strong shipments of business 
computers called servers, which run networks of smaller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit exceeded the 33 cents per share expected by analysts  
surveyed by First Call. Unisys stock rose 37 1/2 cents at $44.43 3/4 in 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the first six months of the year was $230.9  
million, or 70 cents per share, on revenue of $3.7 billion. That 
was up from a profit of $152.8 million, or 38 cents per share, on 
revenue of $3.38 billion in the first six months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Terrorist Threats Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Concerned about a series of doomsday scenarios  
ranging from an anthrax release in Boston to an Iraqi nerve gas 
attack on U.S. troops, a government commission proposes a 
far-reaching reform of agencies now handling such threats. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the recommendations ``deserve serious  
consideration.'' He directed his national security adviser, Sandy 
Berger, to coordinate an interagency assessment and to report back 
within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's report released Wednesday details a plan to  
give the vice president the lead role in preventing and dealing 
with the threat of weapons of mass destruction and calls for 
appointment of a high-profile national director for 
nonproliferation 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, a congressional study estimated it would  
cost a city of 500,000 about $1.3 million to acquire basic 
equipment to prepare for a hazardous material incident and $12 
million to be ``highly prepared'' for a chemical, biological, 
radiological or nuclear event. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's main proposals and conclusions were disclosed  
last week in interviews, but former CIA Director John Deutch, who 
headed the panel, released details of its work Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the country needs to be better protected,'' Deutch  
said, introducing his congressionally-established 12-member panel 
at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the commission's vice chairman,  
announced plans to introduce legislation today that would tighten 
export controls on items that might be used to manufacture heavily 
destructive weapons, including requiring electronic registration of 
all sales of such products-- a practice he said should be adopted 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are woefully unprepared, and we would like to see something  
done before some incident occurs,'' Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission concludes that the top levels of government are  
``not effectively organized to combat proliferation'' and 
recommends more presidential and vice presidential involvement in 
the issue, as well as a reorganization of the nearly 100 agencies 
now dealing with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	One commission member, former Democratic Sen. James Exon of  
Nebraska, dissenting from the report's main recommendation, urged 
greater Cabinet-level involvement and a nonproliferation director 
who would report directly to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``What has been crafted, in my opinion, is another lower-level  
'working group,''' Exon said. 
</P>
<P>
	To underscore the motivation for its proposals, the commission  
listed four scenarios it said could occur: 
</P>
<P>
	--Anthrax is released in a Boston subway station during rush  
hour, sending 6,000 people to hospital emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	--Analysts estimate that North Korean scientists have assembled  
10 nuclear weapons, and intelligence reports say North Korea is 
planning to sell two. 
</P>
<P>
	--Iraqi President Saddam Hussein orders Scud missiles carrying  
nerve agents fired upon U.S. troops in Turkey and Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	--A disgruntled Russian scientist at Ozersk acquires 44 pounds of  
highly enriched uranium and sells it to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	``These events have not taken place,'' it said. ``But they  
could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the separate General Accounting Office report, investigators  
compiled estimates of the resources it would take to meet a 
catastrophic attack on a U.S. city of 500,000. The report cautions 
that the estimates and accompanying list of needed supplies are 
meant only to be illustrative of possible needs. 
</P>
<P>
	For a typical hazardous materials incident, it estimated $1.3  
million to procure materials ranging from duct tape to mobil comand 
posts and another $3.3 million to sustain the preparedness over 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	For a high level of preparation, the estimates were $12.2  
million for initial procurement and $42.9 million over a decade.

<HEADLINE> Nurse Probed in Patients Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Virginia health officials have suspended the  
license of a nurse who allegedly admitted giving morphine overdoses 
to two terminally ill patients to hasten their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhea E. Henson, who had been licensed in the state since 1987,  
helped care for the men at Inova Fair Oaks Hospital, where she 
worked in the critical care unit, according to Fairfax County 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Both patients died in June. Police and hospital officials  
declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Henson declined Wednesday to comment on the investigation.  
No criminal charges have been filed. Her attorney, Dale Race, said 
his client contends that she is innocent of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the state Board of Nursing issued an emergency order  
Wednesday declaring Ms. Henson a danger to the public and suspended 
her license immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	In its order, the nursing board said Ms. Henson admitted that  
she ``administered an inappropriate dose of morphine to Patient A 
in order to hasten his death.'' The board said she also admitted 
giving another patient a morphine overdose. 
</P>
<P>
	Morphine, a powerful and addictive narcotic, typically is used  
to relieve the pain of cancer patients whose disease has spread 
throughout their bodies. An overdose can stop the respiratory 
system. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> House Upholds Bill on Mining Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats and moderate Republicans are  
winning some battles as Congress moves toward shaping Interior 
Department programs for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 377-47 shortly after midnight this morning to  
approve a $14 billion measure financing federal land and cultural 
programs for the coming fiscal year. The bill fell about $1.2 
billion short of the amount President Clinton requested, cutting 
his requests for land purchases and energy conservation, but 
Democrats and their moderate GOP allies managed a few wins. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for environmentalists over Western mining  
interests, the House voted 273-151 to require hard-rock mining 
companies using public lands to obey a 1997 Interior Department 
ruling limiting the size of their waste dumps to five acres per 
20-acre claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is no limitation,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., of  
pro-mining lawmakers' claims that companies could legally operate 
additional dumps. ``That would be a bad joke on America 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment said it was based on a  
misinterpretation of law by overzealous bureaucrats that would hurt 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need these jobs,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont. ``Our  
communities need these jobs, our families need these jobs, our 
schools need these jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight Republicans joined 194 Democrats and one  
independent in upholding the limits on waste sites. Voting no were 
eight Democrats and 143 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of the legislation approved by the Senate  
Appropriations Committee would let companies ignore the Interior 
Department ruling, an interpretation of the 1872 law that governs 
mining for gold and other hard-rock minerals on federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry supporters say the five-acre limitation on waste sites  
is too small for modern techniques, which use chemicals like 
cyanide on vast piles of rock from open-pit mines. Opponents say 
the provision is the only pro-environmental one in the entire 
127-year-old law, which lets companies purchase federal lands for 
$2.50 an acre or lease them for $100 annually per 20-acre claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also voted 259-166 to ban the use of steel-jaw traps  
or neck snares for commercial or recreational purposes at the 520 
national wildlife refuges. The Senate bill has no similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	It voted 243-180 to add $13 million to a program that helps  
low-income people insulate and otherwise winterize their homes, 
bringing it to $133 million, the same as this year. It also voted 
225-198 against eliminating a new requirement that states provide 
$1 for every $3 they receive from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House trimmed $140 million from the  
legislation, part of a continuing effort by Republican leaders to 
satisfy conservatives demanding spending cuts. The reductions would 
come from clean coal and land acquisition programs plus a 0.48 
percent cut in the entire measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are what ``we have to do to get where we have to be,''  
said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chided Republicans for yielding to  
conservatives ``who detest government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other votes Wednesday, the House:  
</P>
<P>
	--By 217-207, rejected an attempt by Democrats and moderate  
Republicans to add $10 million each for the National Endowment for 
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The House 
also defeated a conservative effort to cut the arts endowment by $2 
million by 300-124. The bill would provide NEA with $98 million 
next year, the same as this year and $52 million less than Clinton 
wanted. The NEH would get $111 million, the same as this year and 
$39 million below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to block new federal regulations that would help Indian  
tribes open gambling casinos over objections by their states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ordered the National Park Service to redraw its plans for a new  
visitors center at the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Latin America Markets Still Shaky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- It's becoming a scene that is all  
too familiar in Latin America: the dazed look of frantic floor 
traders, the flash of televised updates on tumbling stock prices, 
the rush of politicians to assure skittish investors that their 
slumping market is no cause for long-term concern. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina's leading Merval Index tumbled 8.7 percent last Monday  
on worries about Argentina's election-year recession and comments 
by one presidential candidate that appeared to suggest the need for 
a debt-repayment moratorium. Concerns over protests by low-paid 
teachers and disgruntled truck drivers also gave investors more 
reason to be edgy about the final year of Carlos Menem's 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Argentine stock market recouped about half of its losses  
Tuesday and has since steadied. But the volatility at the week's 
outset underscored the fact that many Latin American markets are 
still wobbling six months after the Brazilian devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	Election-year politics in some nations, widening budget gaps,  
and even sagging tax revenues are all part of the scene in one 
fashion or another. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the whole region there are a lot of unknowns,'' said Omar  
Borla, chief Latin American economist at Robert Fleming in New 
York. ``But to some extent they are blown out of proportion, such 
as in the case of Argentina and who takes office in December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voters in Argentina later this year will elect a successor to  
Menem, who has governed this country for 10 years through two 
terms. Until election time, international investors are certain to 
remain on guard, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Latin American economies face their own internal  
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	--The more apprehensive investors appear to be holding off in  
Venezuela until President Hugo Chavez forces through his first 
initiative: amending the country's constitution to give him more 
presidential powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venezuelan economy has contracted nearly 9 percent in the  
first half of 1999, unemployment has swelled to over 20 percent and 
hundreds of companies have gone bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	Slipping prices in oil, Venezuela's chief source of revenue,  
initiated the hardships last year. Brazil's devaluation deepened 
the economic woes and uncertainty over Chavez further compounded 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ecuador is locked in its worst economic crisis in 50 years,  
with the economy expected to shrink by 5 percent this year and 
inflation to top 50 percent. Hoping to prune a bloated budget 
deficit, President Jamil Mahuad is battling powerful unions to 
enact tough reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	A Mahuad decree that hiked gasoline prices by 13 percent met  
with stiff resistance by taxi, bus and truck drivers who launched a 
strike paralyzing movement in Andean country for days. Mahuad 
eventually backed off, but unions haven't. They say their strike 
will end when the cancellation of the decree goes into effect. 
Mahuad is also jostling with Congress, where his plans to privatize 
state companies and raise taxes are making little headway. 
</P>
<P>
	--In June, Colombia devalued its currency, the second time since  
President Andres Pastrana took office in August. Critics have 
decried his budget-slashing plan and say it caused a gigantic 
interest-rate hike. An escalating war with leftist guerrillas 
hasn't helped. 
</P>
<P>
	--Brazil appears to be slightly rebounding from its January  
devaluation. Fears of a double-digit inflationary spiral are 
easing. But there are problems: Brazil still needs to pass a 
balanced-budget, reign in spending, and launch privatization 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	--The Mexican economy last year managed to weather the economic  
tumult in Asia and Brazil, despite a drop in world oil prices, 
which makes up about a third of government revenues. This year the 
outlook has improved with oil prices rising, inflation in check and 
slow but steady growth of about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mexico still hasn't fully recovered from the 1994 peso  
crisis, which sent interest rates and inflation soaring. The 
banking system remains weak, about 40 percent of the country lives 
in poverty and there are fears the country could face more turmoil 
around the July 2000 presidential election.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers Exec: Malone, Johnson Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While frustrated with the Los Angeles Dodgers'  
awful first half, the Fox executive in charge of the team doesn't 
blame general manager Kevin Malone or manager Davey Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel good about the people running the team. The one thing  
I feel quite comfortable about is it's not a a lack of trying and 
effort,'' said Chase Carey, co-chief operating officer of News 
Corp., the Dodgers' corporate owner. ``We don't like the results, 
but we do like the decisions being made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Going into the second half of the season Thursday night, the  
Dodgers were last in the NL West at 39-47, 10 games behind 
division-leading San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	While Carey frequently praised Malone and Johnson during an  
interview at News Corp.'s New York offices, he did not mention 
Dodgers president Bob Graziano, a holdover from the days of Peter 
O'Malley's ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, News Corp. decided to have Graziano report to  
former NBA executive Rick Welts, the new president of the Fox 
Sports Entertainment Group, rather than directly to Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105 million,  
seven-year contract before the season and opened with a $79.2 
million payroll, second in the major leagues behind the New York 
Yankees ($85.1 million). The big spending caused the Dodgers to be 
criticized by division rivals San Francisco and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the cheap shots in terms of us, that's sports,'' Carey  
said. ``I'm a big boy, I can take it,'' he said, adding that others 
owners were using the Dodgers as ``a scapegoat'' for baseball's 
economic disparity. 
</P>
<P>
	``When other owners take those kinds of shots, I don't think  
that's productive,'' he said. ``Baseball's problems from an 
economic perspective are industry problems and have been since long 
before we bought the Dodgers.''

<HEADLINE> House Backs Scientists' Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers should be permitted to keep  
federally supported work confidential to protect patient privacy 
and corporate secrets, several House members said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``One individual's right to government information may infringe  
upon another's right to privacy,'' said Rep. Steve Horn, R-Calif., 
chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's 
panel on government management, information and technology. 
</P>
<P>
	His subcommittee is considering a measure sponsored by Rep.  
George Brown Jr., D-Calif., that would repeal a law providing more 
access to federally funded research information under the Freedom 
of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The FOIA, passed in 1966, put the burden on the government to  
justify barring someone from having access to government 
information. Under the law, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., won 
approval last year to attach a provision to the Emergency 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 requiring most 
taxpayer-funded research to be made public upon request. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government funds 60 percent of the scientific  
research at universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Taxpayers, Shelby said, ``are entitled to this information, and  
will thus play a positive role in ensuring that the conclusions 
drawn from government-funded data and studies are more solid by 
allowing a more open process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the FOIA contains exemptions that protect the  
privacy of patients and trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the Office of Management and Budget crafts a rule that  
would allow anyone to see the scientific calculations that give 
rise to thousands of federal rules and policies, scientific, 
university and medical communities want to limit broad access to 
this data. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the rule would allow anyone to look at the data in  
studies that underpin highly controversial rules. Rape victims who 
participate in studies, for example, might hesitate to volunteer if 
they believe that their names and stories might be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are pitfalls in unrestrained openness, including ... the  
chilling effect that inappropriate public scrutiny could have on 
the free exchange of ideas and the willingness to take risks to 
find answers,'' Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes 
of Health Department of Health and Human Resources, told Horn's 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``FOIA was not designed to accommodate the confidentiality  
requirements of the most sensitive scientific data,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But business leaders believe they have the right to know the  
scientific basis for government regulations they must comply with. 
</P>
<P>
	``This situation will be harmful to taxpayers and the regulated  
community because they will be limited in their ability to 
understand the operations of government,'' said William Kovacs, 
vice president for environment and regulatory affairs for the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Argentina's Jobless Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Argentina's unemployment rate  
rose to 14.5 percent in May, up from 12.4 percent at last reading 
in October, according to government figures published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising unemployment comes amid a deepening recession in  
Argentina and means some 1.8 million of the workforce are without 
jobs. In May 1998, the nation's unemployment rate stood at 13.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate measure of underemployment also inched up to 13.7  
percent in May from 13.6 percent in October, according to the 
national statistics institute. Underemployment is defined as those 
working less than 35 hours a week who want to be employed fulltime.

<HEADLINE> PBS Decried in Political Furor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- What started with campaign mailings to a little  
boy by the Democratic National Committee has become an embarrassing 
episode for a Boston TV station that could threaten funding for 
public broadcasting nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on Capitol Hill are demanding a review of public  
broadcasting after learning that WGBH-TV swapped its donor list 
with the Democratic Party earlier this year. The practice was 
discovered in May, after the child got a fund-raising pitch and 
``agenda survey'' from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said the station has been swapping names with  
the party since 1994, handing over a total of more than 32,000 
names, The Boston Globe reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Backus, a DNC spokeswoman, said the station approached the  
Democrats about name-swapping in 1993, and station officials were 
given 5,000 names of Democratic donors to approach for money. WGBH 
got an additional 7,800 names the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in 1994, station officials gave the names of their own  
contributors to the DNC, Backus said. 
</P>
<P>
	A WGBH spokeswoman told the newspaper that the station did not  
implement a policy of refusing to swap names with political parties 
until 1994, a year after making the deal with the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	WGBH had acknowledged giving a list of donors' names earlier  
this year to the DNC, despite tax laws that prohibit public 
stations from playing political favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unfortunate if members of Congress take action  
against the whole system because one member made a mistake,'' said 
Angela Lifsey, a WGBH spokeswoman. ``What happened was not a 
partisan situation. It was the result of administrative errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce Committee was scheduled to consider hundreds  
of millions of dollars in funding for public broadcasting on 
Wednesday, but the meeting was postponed because of the furor. 
Lawmakers said they want to hold a hearing first to air their 
concerns, probably in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the committee's  
telecommunications subcommittee, said he will reduce his funding 
proposal for public broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't punitive,'' said Tauzin's spokesman, Ken Johnson.  
But Johnson said: ``The worst part about this whole thing is that 
it feeds the old stereotypes. There are a number of people in our 
party who are absolutely convinced that public broadcasting is in 
the hip pocket of the Democratic Party and liberals in this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The name swap was discovered in May amid media reports that Sam  
Black, a 4-year-old boy from Wellesley who watches public TV's 
``Barney,'' had been receiving mail from the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
	His mother, Jody Black, had donated $40 to WGBH last fall in  
gratitude for its children's programs. She made the donation in her 
name and Sam's. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the station mistakenly gave a few thousand names  
to the DNC in exchange for an equal number of names. The deal was 
made by new employees who weren't aware of station policy, WGBH 
said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Locates Teen Fugitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A Virginia teen-ager convicted of robbery  
has been arrested in Las Vegas -- two years after vanishing in a 
boating accident the night before his sentencing, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sage Alexander Weakland's family had maintained that he went  
overboard during the July 29, 1997, accident and died. But 
authorities suspected that Weakland, then 16, faked his death to 
avoid going to jail for three years on robbery and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so glad to know he's alive and well, and I want to do my  
part to make sure we can keep him alive and well for the next 20 
years,'' said prosecutor Bob Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakland, 18, was picked up Wednesday, the FBI in Norfolk said.  
Federal marshals had been tipped that he was in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakland disappeared after his father's 19-foot fishing boat  
slammed into a merchant ship anchored in the James River in Newport 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Eugene Weakland, went overboard and was rescued.  
Helicopters, divers and sonar equipment searched the river bottom 
for months for the younger Weakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a lot of doubt he was dead,'' said Major Mike Nicely of  
the Gloucester County sheriff's department. ``For one, the body 
never showed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weakland likely will have to do a lot more time than the three  
years to which prosecutors originally had agreed. He now faces up 
to life in prison for robbery, plus up to 10 years for fleeing, 
Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weaklands have an unlisted telephone number and could not be  
reached for comment. In previous interviews, they said they had no 
reason to think their son survived.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise Sharply / Jobless Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits rose sharply last week to its highest level 
in a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 310,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 10 -- up by 
11,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first increase in weekly jobless claims after two  
consecutive declines and left the claims at their highest point 
since June 5 when they were at 326,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out  
week-to-week volatility, also was up to 303,250. That was the 
highest level since June 26 when they were at 307,250. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase was larger than economists had been  
expecting, but still kept claims at a level indicating that the 
nation's job market remains exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago the government reported that unemployment for the  
month of June crept up to 4.3 percent, still near a 29-year low, 
and even with the increase in the jobless rate the nation's 
businesses added a sizeable 268,000 new jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending July 3,  
12 states and territories reported declines in jobless claims, 
while 39 had increases. The state data lag a week behind the 
national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decline in applications for jobless  
benefits was Florida, down 1,172, a decrease officials attributed 
to fewer layoffs in the construction, trade and service industries 
as well as in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with large decreases were: Washington, down 927;  
South Carolina, down 597; New Hampshire, down 527; and Maryland, 
down 400. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase was Missouri, up 5,457, an  
increase officials blamed on layoffs in the automobile and 
transportation industries. Other states with big increases were: 
New York, up 3,921; California, up 3,448; Michigan, up 3,294; and 
Wisconsin, up 2,299.

<HEADLINE>  57 Umpires Plan To Resign Sept. 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Major league umpires voted to resign Sept.  
2, and baseball seems happy with their decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have been at odds with owners and players since Roberto  
Alomar spat at an ump three years ago, claiming they don't get 
enough respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, tired of repeated bickering and convinced the umpires  
are replaceable, sounded almost pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is either a threat to be ignored, or an offer to be  
accepted,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of 
baseball operations, speaking for commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 68 major league umpires, and 57 of them attended the  
meeting in Philadelphia, saying they wouldn't work the last 4 1/2 
weeks of the season. The other 11 were expected to announce their 
resignations in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	What set the umpires off this time was NL president Len  
Coleman's three-day suspension of umpire Tom Hallion on July 2 for 
bumping a player. It was the first such action that baseball 
officials could remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose of this meeting was to address quarrels with  
baseball,'' umpires' union head Richie Phillips said. ``The tension 
is much greater than it's ever been. Baseball is in a state of 
chaos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said umpires will form a new corporation on Sept. 3 and the  
AL and NL would have to contract for services with the new body. 
Umpires would supervise themselves and make their own schedules, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners, however, could hire umpires from minor leagues, high  
schools and colleges, as they have during previous work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the umpires would comment following the four-hour  
meeting, the day after the All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, AL umpire Dale Scott said he and his colleagues aren't  
concerned that the decision to resign would be unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a job where you gain a lot of friends,'' Scott  
told ABC Sports Radio. ``It's a job you do the best you can and 
earn the respect you get from working hard every day on the 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The umpires have a contract that runs through this season and  
pays them $75,000-to-$225,000 annually, depending on seniority. The 
deal bars strikes, so the resignations are an attempt to get around 
that, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the contract calls for resigning umpires to  
collect a total of $15 million in severance pay. Most senior 
umpires would get $400,000 severance, and baseball would have until 
early January to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might be our cheapest solution,'' Alderson said, meaning  
that it would be preferable to costly litigation or a work 
stoppage. ``Unless I'm mistaken, I don't think these tactics have 
convinced a single person to be supportive. That would include the 
fans, the media and baseball itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said umpires originally voted to strike immediately,  
then changed their votes and decided to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, umpires were locked out and missed the first 86 games  
of the regular season. They also struck and missed the first seven 
weeks of the 1979 season and the first seven games of the 1984 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tension has been high since September 1996, when Alomar was  
suspended for five games for spitting in umpire John Hirschbeck's 
face -- a penalty deemed too lenient by the umps. When they 
attempted to strike during the postseason, owners obtained an court 
injunction in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Alderson said the umpires' actions made him wonder if this would  
``escalate this situation to the point were it might be 
irretrievable.'' Several management officials said fans don't pay 
to see umpires, and players have never hesitated to play with 
replacement umps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame that it's gotten to this point,'' Kansas City  
Royals manager Tony Muser said. ``For them not to want to be 
accountable, and to be policed by their own is not fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig wants to shift responsibility for umpires from the leagues  
to Alderson. He originally wanted to make the shift before this 
season, but was blocked by Phillips, who demanded severance pay if 
the leagues were no longer the umpires' official employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had been a hope on our part that we'd be able to  
commence negotiations early,'' Alderson said. ``In light of this 
increasingly belligerent posture, that would seem to be out of the 
question.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Profits Beat Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc.'s profits and revenues are  
riding a wave of consumer demand for the unusual-looking iMac 
desktop computer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Wednesday that its profits doubled in the  
recent quarter, topping Wall Street expectations. Apple, based in 
Cupertino, Calif., credited a 40 percent rise in unit sales of 
computers. Apple's share of retail desktop sales was 6.7 percent in 
May, double that of a year ago, according to ZD Infobeads research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's profit in its fiscal third quarter rose to $203 million,  
or $1.20 a share. That was up from a profit of $101 million, or 65 
cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time gain, Apple would have earned $114 million,  
or 69 cents a share in the three months ended June 26, exceeding 
the 64 cents projected by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 11 percent to $1.56 billion from $1.40 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, pushed shares down in early trading today on  
the Nasdaq Stock Market. Shares were down $2.31 1/4 to $53.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said it sold 487,000 iMacs in the recent quarter, up from  
350,000 in the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of the desktop computer has spurred a design  
shakeup in the PC industry since its introduction last August. The 
iMac is shaped like a giant jelly bean, equipped with a built-in 
monitor, and comes in five translucent colors through which inner 
circuitry is faintly visible. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple also profited from an unexpected drop in the cost of iMac  
parts, including memory and microprocessor chips, chief financial 
officer Fred Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were somewhat offset by higher expenses as Apple  
added 500 workers for a total work force of 8,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple said its sales and growth rate are expected to rise  
slightly the next quarter, but will increase more strongly as the 
company rolls out new product lines, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple is widely expected to introduce a new consumer laptop to  
the market next week, but has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ended June 26, Apple earned $490 million, or  
$2.99 a share, up from earnings of $203 million, or $1.40 a share, 
in the year-ago period. Revenues rose to $4.80 billion from $4.36 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Ranger Credited in Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Drew Carter fulfilled a childhood dream when he  
became a Texas Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he has his own chapter in the lore of the legendary  
crime-fighting force that killed outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde 
Barrow. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter is the Ranger who orchestrated the surrender of Angel  
Maturino Resendez, a suspected serial killer who was the subject of 
a nationwide manhunt until Carter slipped the cuffs onto him. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's surrender at the Ysleta international bridge in El  
Paso came after 1 1/2 days of negotiations in Albuquerque, N.M., with 
Maturino Resendez's sister. Officials credit Carter's relationship 
with Manuela Maturino as the break that led to the fugitive's 
capture. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was obtaining information about him and in setting up the  
interviews, and in talking with them and setting up things, they 
understood that I could be trusted, and I could trust them,'' 
Carter said in an interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I love about this job,'' the 32-year-old lawman  
said. ``You don't know what the next day is going to hold. It's a 
real neat adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One former classmate at Bellaire High School in Houston said  
he's not surprised that Carter, a 1985 graduate, easily built a 
relationship with the suspect's relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was always real talkative, a real good listener, very  
attentive and real interested in other people,'' said Craig 
Loewenstern, who works at a Houston software firm. ``I'm sure 
that's part of his job, building up the trust, being a good 
listener and that probably helped that lady trust him with her 
brother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Luling, La., and raised in Houston, Carter rose through  
the ranks quickly after joining the Texas Department of Public 
Safety in 1988, becoming a lieutenant with the highway patrol in 
1996. A year later, he was accepted into the Rangers, the 
investigative arm of the department. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter had long dreamed of donning the force's uniform white  
hat, silver badge and cowboy boots -- even if it meant taking a 
demotion to sergeant, the entry rank for a Ranger, 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be a Ranger since I was five years old. It's been  
a lifelong dream,'' said Carter. ``I've pretty much always been a 
cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were founded in 1823 when Texas leader Stephen F.  
Austin hired 10 gunmen to ``range'' his property and punish hostile 
Indians for attacks. The original Rangers got $1.25 a day and had 
to supply their own guns, horses and food. 
</P>
<P>
	The legend of the Rangers and their toughness grew during the  
Mexican War, as they fought alongside regular U.S. Army troops. The 
Rangers also captured or killed some of the Old West's most 
infamous outlaws, including train robber Sam Bass and gunslinger 
John Wesley Hardin, a preacher's son reputed to have killed 31 men. 
In the 1930s, a Texas Ranger tracked down and killed Bonnie and 
Clyde. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the force has just 107 members and there are usually  
between 100 and 200 candidates for each opening, said DPS spokesman 
Mike Cox.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Cuba Differ on Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- U.S. Chamber of Commerce officials refused to sign  
a memorandum of understanding with their Cuban counterparts 
Thursday because it left out members of the country's nascent 
independent business community. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamber president Thomas Donohue said the chamber was dedicated  
to including the communist country's small self-employed sector. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from Cuban officials, who had  
hoped to sign the agreement on Thursday. A noontime signing 
ceremony had been included on a schedule of the American chamber's 
activities provided to foreign media. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been easy to sign a document,'' Donohue said.  
But he said the American chamber would instead look for ways to 
make contact with Cuba's small independent sector, which has no 
formal representation. The Cuban chamber represents just Cuban 
government-run firms and foreign firms with Cuban government 
partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue said he did not expect the self-employed sector to form  
any kind of representative group soon, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect that it will be more of a marathon than a sprint,''  
he said. But they must somehow be included before the American 
chamber will sign the memorandum of understanding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The self-employed sector did not exist until 1994, when Cuba's  
communist government approved the creation of certain small 
enterprises, such as family restaurants, and the licensing of 
tradesmen, such as mechanics, plumbers and beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue held a six-hour meeting with President Fidel Castro  
Thursday, suggesting Cuba had assigned high importance to the 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Donohue said the chamber was opposed U.S. trade sanctions  
imposed at the height of the Cold War in 1962 -- a statement widely 
reported in Cuba's state-controlled press. 
</P>
<P>
	But Donohue also disagreed with many aspects of Cuba's  
political, economic and human rights policies, which the Cuban 
press did not report. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a tragedy that during one of the most exciting and  
dynamic periods of economic expansion and technological innovation, 
the Cuban people have been left out,'' Donohue said in a Wednesday 
speech at the University of Havana. ``It is the lack of private 
enterprise more than any other factor that has played the greatest 
role in holding Cuba back.''

<HEADLINE> Fed: ATM Fees Rise Substantially </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ATM fees charged by banks and savings and  
loans increased significantly from 1997 to 1998 as did the number 
of institutions offering free checking, the Federal Reserve said in 
a report to Congress released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank, which compiles a similar report on fees  
imposed by banks and savings and loans every year, found 
substantial increases by banks in: overdraft charges for checks (an 
average increase of 90 cents, to $16.65); fees that banks charge 
their customers for using another bank's automated teller machine 
(an increase of 4 cents-7 cents, to $1.10); and ATM surcharges, 
which banks charge people to use their ATMs if they are not 
customers of that bank (an increase of 6 cents, to $1.20). 
</P>
<P>
	Fees that savings and loans charge their customers for using  
another institution's ATM increased by 7 cents-8 cents to 
$1.05-$1.07, while ATM surcharges rose an average of 11 cents to 
$1.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found no significant increases by banks or thrifts  
for other kinds of fees, however, such as those on checking and 
savings accounts and for stop-payment orders on checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of banks and savings and loans offering free  
checking accounts, which don't pay interest but impose no fees, 
increased sharply over the year, the Fed found. Banks with free 
checking jumped from 3 percent in 1997 to 17 percent last year; 
thrifts increased from 7 percent to 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks continue to be a great value for consumers looking for  
the best combination of price, service and convenience,'' said 
Patricia Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed found that in 1998, as in previous years, most of the  
fees charged by big banks operating in several states -- including 
those created by mergers -- were significantly higher than those 
levied by smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, big banks charged an average $5.21 more for  
stop-payment orders on checks than smaller banks and about $4.50 
more for insufficient funds for checks and overdrafts, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes amid a wave of bank mergers, with New England  
powerhouses Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. the 
latest big institutions to announce a marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates have criticized as excessive the fees that  
banks charge consumers for accounts, ATM machines and credit cards, 
and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern over rising 
bank fees in congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank fees are still increasing and big banks are charging  
bigger fees. It's a serious problem for consumers,'' Edmund 
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank report also found:  
</P>
<P>
	-- As in the previous year, the proportion of banks and savings  
and loans with ATMs that impose ATM surcharges rose substantially. 
It increased an average 17 to 18 percentage points, to 78 percent 
of banks and 57 percent of thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Five percent of banks and 4 percent of savings and loans  
charge a fee to issue ATM cards to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The minimum balance required to open a passbook savings  
account at savings and loans, for which customers are charged no 
fee if they keep a minimum balance and one monthly fee otherwise, 
increased by an average of $33, to $114. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was based on data from about 700 banks and 350  
savings and loans. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Some figures, such as the increases in some fees charged by  
banks and savings and loans, are reported in a range because they 
represent banks in different categories such as small, medium and 
large.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Reportedly Linked to Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Handwritten notations referring to  
rewards offered following a series of synagogue fires are among 
evidence linking two brothers to the arson attacks, The Sacramento 
Bee reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes mention the name of a Sacramento businessman, Michael  
Zwebner, who offered $10,000 following the June 18 fires. Next to 
the man's name were the notations ``Yid bizman'' and ``$10,000 on 
us,'' the Bee reported, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, as a result of posting the reward, that has helped, then I  
am pleased and proud of it,'' the Israeli-born Zwebner said. ``I 
think any act of violence against any ethnic community is abhorrent 
to a civilized society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also was a reference to Sacramento bounty hunter Leonard  
Padilla, who offered a $25,000 reward in the arson case: ``Leonard 
Padilla, bounty hunter, $25,000 on us,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padilla said he's received ``heavy'' police protection from  
local law enforcement since his name turned up in the suspects' 
notebook during last week's searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The notebook was found July 8 during a search of a storage  
locker rented to Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, the newspaper 
quoted unidentified sources as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother, James Tyler Williams, 29, are being held in  
the Shasta County Jail on charges of receiving stolen property that 
investigators have linked to the murders of a gay couple. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder, were found slain  
July 1 in their home outside Redding in northern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers have not been charged with murder, although  
authorities said charges could be filed by the end of the week. 
They have pleaded innocent to the stolen property charges. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials have refused to confirm that the Williams brothers  
are suspects in the arsons, but Shasta County officials have said 
the brothers are linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Nick Rossi refused to comment on the evidence  
reported by the newspaper, criticizing the paper for potentially 
jeopardizing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a jailhouse interview with the Redding Record Searchlight  
earlier this week, Tyler Williams insisted he never met Mowder and 
Matson and doesn't know anything about the fires.

<HEADLINE> Smoltz Tests Arm in Minors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Pitcher John Smoltz got the results he  
was looking for in his first appearance for the Greenville Braves, 
Atlanta's Double-A Southern League affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, rehabilitating from an elbow injury, struck out four in  
two shutout innings in Greenville's 6-1 loss to the Jacksonville 
Suns in the first game of a doubleheader Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I'm trying to get my elbow in a position to be a  
little less stressful and still try to throw the same pitches,'' 
Smoltz said. ``I can't do some of the things I've been able to do, 
simply being I can't go eight, nine innings anymore. Not on a 
consistent basis anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, 8-3 with a 3.49 ERA and 86 strikeouts before going on  
the disabled list, is expected to throw one or two more innings in 
Jacksonville before rejoining Atlanta at Miami on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be able to throw the same way,'' Smoltz said. ``If I  
get the results, pain-wise, that's all I'm looking for. I'm not 
looking for six up, six down, or three up, three down. I'm looking 
for results on how my arm is.''

<HEADLINE>  Reid To Square Off Against Kelly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- David Reid is a fighter with a golden  
future. He gets a kick out of talking about a golden moment in his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	Mention The Punch, and both Reid and his trainer Al Mitchell  
still get emotional. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference this week at Bally's Park Place to hype his  
WBA super welterweight title defense against Australian Kevin Kelly 
Friday night, neither man paid much attention to a tape of Reid's 
fights until the third round of his 1996 156-pound Olympic final 
came on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
	That got their undivided attention.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the greatest day of my life,'' Reid said Thursday.  
Needing a knockout to win, Reid knocked out Cuban Alejandro 
Duvergel with a right to the head and won a gold medal at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	In his corner as head coach of the U.S. team was Mitchell, who  
has played such an important role in Reid's life that on Father's 
Day, Reid presented him with his WBA title belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably a year now from it will be worth something,'' said  
Mitchell, who hopes by then Reid will have added another title to 
the WBA 154-pound championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell and Reid hope to get a fight against IBF 154-pound  
champion Fernando Vargas next spring. Vargas will defend his title 
against Raul Marque Saturday night at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to win a couple more titles,'' Mitchell  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid already is scheduled defend against Keith Mullings Aug. 28  
at a site to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday night in a ballroom at the Boardwalk Convention Center,  
the 25-year-old Reid, of Philadelphia (12-0, seven knockouts), will 
be making the first defense he won on a clear-cut decision over 
Laurent Boudouani of France March 6 at Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very good fighter,'' the 29-year-old Kelly (24-5-2, 11  
knockouts) said of Reid. ``He's very athletic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said Kelly has good jab and speed, but ``the only thing  
I'm concerned about is he comes in with his head. I expect a good 
fight for seven or eight rounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight is scheduled to start at 11 p.m., EDT, and will be  
televised by FX. The telecast is set to begin at 10 p.m. and 
include a 10-round lightweight bout John John Molina (46-6, 31 
knockouts) of Puerto Rico, a former IBF junior lightweight 
champion, and James Crayton of Las Vegas (30-9-2, 19 knockouts). 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the show will be a 10-round junior welterweight match  
between Hector Camacho Jr. (22-0, 12 knockouts) and Mike Cooley

<HEADLINE> Bush Vowing To 'Earn Votes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DODGE, Iowa (AP) -- Spending more time shaking hands than  
talking, Texas Gov. George W. Bush vowed today to ``earn every 
single vote'' as he traveled across Iowa in a parade of brightly 
decorated campaign buses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's a big step going from governor to president, but  
I've had some pretty good training,'' said Bush. ``I've learned how 
to lead. I'm running for one single thing and that is to win back 
the White House in the year 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential front-runner took President Clinton  
to task for not moving faster to deal with a sagging farm economy, 
and professed himself taken aback by Clinton's criticism of what 
Bush likes to call his ``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said it's rare for a sitting president to single out  
candidates even before nominees are picked. ``I'm amazed that the 
president of the United States is spending time talking about me,'' 
he said. ``It says I must be a threat to his so-called legacy. I 
take it as a huge compliment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said Wednesday that a ``compassionate conservative'' is  
basically a Republican who would like to do things but can't and 
feels terrible about it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the president backed off those remarks.  
``Everything I said yesterday was in complete good spirits,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a veiled reference to Clinton's impeachment, Bush told  
supporters, ``Together we can show that after a time of tarnished 
ideals, politics can be higher and better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush opened his day with a rally on the banks of the Cedar  
River, and aides sketched out two days of grass-roots meetings with 
relatively small groups. ``Shaking as many hands as I can, I'd call 
that retail,'' said Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush stopped off for lunch in Webster City where he wolfed down  
a cheeseburger and fries. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best looking one we've worked for yet,'' Virginia  
Hughes squealed to a friend after giving Bush a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor announced Thursday that, with $30 million in  
the bank, he wouldn't take federal matching funds for his campaign. 
``I want to have as much flexibility as possible to get out my 
message,'' he said. ``I want to win the general election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush is well ahead in most polls for the Republican presidential  
nomination, and financially much better off than any rival except 
publisher Steve Forbes, who to a large extent is financing his own 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Bush's critics argue that he has campaigned scantily in  
important early states like Iowa and New Hampshire, and aides said 
the two-day grass-roots swing was aimed at showing that Bush can 
work a diner as well as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to earn every single vote,'' said Bush. ``I intend to  
win the Iowa caucuses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was drawing moderate-sized crowds, including many who said  
they were merely curious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to find out what all the fuss was about,'' said Dean  
Close, of Independence, an independent. ``I was wondering why 
Republicans were excited about George Bush when they weren't 
excited about him in 1992.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has come under fire from rivals who say he's vague on the  
issues, and he took care to address a sagging farm economy that's 
troubled Midwestern states like Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must recognize in the halls of Congress that we're in a  
disaster,'' said Bush. ``This Congress must provide disaster 
relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush also chided Clinton for not moving fast enough, pointing to  
a tour Clinton just completed of poverty stricken areas of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president recently has been on a poverty tour,'' said  
Bush. ``Perhaps he ought to come to farm country. If he wants to 
find some people who are hurting he ought to look right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called on Clinton to both boost crop insurance and offer  
direct aid to farmers, and to reject the use of food as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to be in Iowa on Friday. He was scheduled to  
participate in an education event and to attend a fund-raiser for 
Sen. Tom Harkin.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticized for Teachers Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools need to look for alternative ways to  
get teachers into the classroom instead of discouraging them, say 
researchers critical of calls to end so-called emergency 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Any kind of certification (standard, emergency or alternative)  
is better than no certification at all, the Thomas Fordham 
Foundation, a privately run school-reform research organization, 
concluded in a collection of reports Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education is the last remaining field in America where people  
think you can boost quality by tightening the rules and multiplying 
the regulations,'' said Chester E. Finn Jr., foundation president 
and a former Reagan administration Education Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-four states require teachers to pass a test to earn a  
license. But the tests, which vary, grant teachers credentials 
based on a range of measures from basic skills to knowledge of a 
specific subject to teaching performance. States often fill 
classroom shortages by allowing teachers to use emergency 
certificates or alternatives. The Education Department is spending 
$1 million to study how states license teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the studies show that students whose teachers possess a  
bachelor's or master's degree in math outperform other students in 
math, regardless of the teacher's certification. Finn said that and 
other findings contradict the President Clinton's proposal, 
outlined in his State of the Union Address this year, to make 
states and school districts phase out emergency-certified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports say teachers have weak verbal and math skills and  
not nearly enough have a college major or minor in the subjects 
they teach. But even some standard state credentials fall short of 
putting better teachers in the classroom, they say. In California, 
Ohio, New York and Minnesota, approved preparation programs tend to 
have very low entry requirements, no exit requirements and low 
subject content, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Licensure isn't a regulatory intrusion; it's a standard to  
protect children,'' said Bob Chase, president of the National 
Education Association, the nation's largest teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is critical for teachers to know the subject matter and  
content of what they are teaching -- and it is equally critical for 
them to understand how the brain works, how to instruct children 
with different skill levels, and how to keep a classroom full of 
kids in their seats so they can share their content knowledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the reports say, states such as Pennsylvania can  
maintain strong alternative certification programs while raising 
academic standards for teachers. Teachers there must take more 
academic courses and fewer education courses and pass licensing 
exams with higher scores, but college graduates who pass the exams 
may teach under the mentorship of a principal or master teacher 
without attending a school of education. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pennsylvania program is being challenged by a state  
teachers' union and a state teacher college association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Education interest groups have pushed misguided regulatory  
schemes that will make it even harder for our public schools to 
attract strong teachers into their ranks,'' said Finn. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers and education leaders who agree with their  
conclusions suggested alternatives that include giving would-be 
teachers more access and fewer hurdles, allowing key personnel 
decisions to be made by schools and judging teachers primarily by 
gains in student learning.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Profits Jump 172 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co., its production problems apparently  
behind it, today reported second-quarter profits up 172 percent 
over last year and well above analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended June 30, the aerospace company had net  
earnings of $701 million or 75 cents a share, compared with profits 
of $258 million or 26 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 
13 percent, from $13.39 billion to $15.13 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results far outpaced the 48 cents per share predicted in a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter figures include a one-time gain of $181  
million or 19 cents a share from a federal income tax audit 
settlement covering 1988-1991. Second-quarter earnings in 1998 were 
reduced by a non-recurring charge of $78 million or 8 cents a share 
to reflect the planned termination of the MD-11 jetliner program 
and late delivery costs associated with new-generation 737 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those one-time items, second-quarter earnings were up  
55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second-quarter results demonstrate growing momentum and  
confidence,'' said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commercial airplanes group is on plan -- delivering  
airplanes and improving margins every day. Boeing delivered 165 
commercial airplanes this quarter -- on time, and with 17 percent 
fewer employees and a 10 percentage point improvement in overtime 
from the highest levels in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing struggled with production line snarls, delayed deliveries  
and the Asian financial crisis during the past two years. It lost 
$178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of $1.1 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division had second-quarter  
operating earnings of $435 million, compared with a loss of $178 
million a year ago, when it delivered 137 planes in the quarter. 
Condit said the improvement was principally due to better cost 
control on the new 737 and 777 jetliner programs, more deliveries, 
and lower research and development spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's military aircraft and missiles segment had a 16 percent  
improvement in operating revenues, while the space and 
communications segment was down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Boeing had profits of $1.17  
billion or $1.24 a share, compared with net earnings of $308 
million or 31 cents a share in 1998. Revenues rose 12 percent, from 
$26.33 billion to $29.52 billion.

<HEADLINE> Boston Expects All-Star Windfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The economic impact of the All-Star game was more  
of a windfall than tourism officials expected, according to early 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The unanticipated success of FanFest and evidence of  
higher-than-expected retail sales have officials at the Greater 
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau predicting that spending may 
come closer to major league baseball's estimate of $62 million. 
That's well over their own prediction of $50 million to $54 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The increasing popularity of the All-Star FanFest spurred the  
strong performance. About 110,000 people attended the event in the 
Hynes Convention Center, about 38 percent more than had been 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The event set records for single-day attendance for indoor  
events Saturday, Sunday and Monday and saw sales of licensed goods 
in excess of $500,000 and concessions in excess of $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also indications that people spent more money on major  
league baseball-licensed goods than previously anticipated, said 
Patrick Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the Greater 
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Miller Says It's Not Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ray Miller gathered the Baltimore Orioles  
together before batting practice Thursday and told them the 
playoffs are not out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them we're down 12 games in the loss column, which  
means we only have to make up one game a week,'' the Orioles 
manager said. ``I haven't given up yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller delivered essentially the same speech last year after the  
Orioles reached the All-Star break with a 38-50 record. Baltimore 
proceeded to win 14 of 15 to get back in contention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles were 36-51 before Thursday's game against Montreal,  
while second-place Boston is 49-39. Baltimore won two straight over 
Philadelphia before the break, giving Miller cause for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look at the standings, the last series and the club coming  
back fresh,'' Miller noted. ``We have about a month-and-a-half to 
change things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said there won't be large changes before the July 31  
trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``The media creates much of that talk. The only time we will  
consider a trade is if it helps us win now and in the future,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it appears certain that catcher Lenny Webster will soon  
be traded, and starting pitcher Juan Guzman is likely to follow. 
Guzman is eligible to become a free agent after this season.

<HEADLINE> O'Meara Has Rough Day at the Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- The last time Mark O'Meara walked  
off the 18th green in the British Open he was holding the claret 
jug. On Thursday at Carnoustie Golf Links, he left in a state of 
shock. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not very often that a defending champion has to sign for an  
83. It was no surprise that O'Meara walked briskly past reporters 
and took a few minutes to compose himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your pride is hurt a bit when you shoot in the 80s,'' he said.  
``I mean, I'm a professional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carnoustie had a way of making everyone look like amateurs in  
the first round. In the case of O'Meara, it made a champion feel 
like a chump. 
</P>
<P>
	Fierce winds off the Firth of Tay proved to be a lethal addition  
to a course reputed as the toughest in championship golf. O'Meara 
was not the only player who had a round in the 80s, nor was his the 
worst score of those who figured to put up a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed that I shot 83, but I tried on every shot,''  
he said. ``Tomorrow, all I can do is try to play a bit better and 
restore some of my pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Meara, who had to return the claret jug to the Royal &AMP; Ancient  
when he arrived in Carnoustie, showed quickly that he had no 
intention of taking it back home with him. 
</P>
<P>
	After a nice par save on the opening hole, O'Meara was even more  
wild off the tee than Seve Ballesteros, the three-time Open 
champion who played in the same threesome. Aside from putting, 
O'Meara didn't play a shot from the fairway until the third hole -- 
and that was after taking a drop out of Jockie's Burn. 
</P>
<P>
	The exasperation began to show on No. 6, a 578-yard hole that  
played closer to 700 yards because of the prevailing wind. He hit 
his drive into the rough so thick on the right that he had no 
choice but to chop out. 
</P>
<P>
	With a 9-iron, a gust knocked down the ball, which trickled into  
a pot bunker. He blasted out into more rough, then hit a terrific 
shot left of the green, about 100 feet from the hole. Two putts 
kept him from another double bogey, although there was still 
another one of those waiting for him. 
</P>
<P>
	On No. 10, O'Meara again tried to play out of the rough only to  
have his ball roll into a burn, which resembles a nicely carved 
ditch only 3 feet wide and 4 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did that go in?'' he yelled to a marshal?  
</P>
<P>
	Disgusted, O'Meara dropped his head and then dropped another  
ball. When he hit up to the green, he smacked his iron against the 
side of the bridge. He finished a round to forget with a triple 
bogey on No. 17 and his lone birdie on No. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made three double bogeys and a triple so it was pretty much  
those four holes that hurt me most,'' O'Meara said. ``But I drove 
the ball pretty bad and felt I got the score I deserved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If O'Meara wanted to put a good spin on his round, he could have  
taken consolation in the fact his 83 was not the worst opening 
score by a defending champion -- Willie Park had a 94 in the 1876 
British Open. He finished third that year. 
</P>
<P>
	And here's more good news. A defending champion once had an 83  
in the first round of the British Open and still managed to win. Of 
course, the Open was only 36 holes when Bob Ferguson pulled that 
off in 1882. And it should be noted that Ferguson's 83 was good 
enough for a three-stroke lead. 
</P>
<P>
	At Carnoustie 117 years later, a score like that made a champion  
feel like a chump.

<HEADLINE> Greenwell Leads Little League Boots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- Former All-Star outfielder Mike  
Greenwell is again a league leader -- this time in ejections from 
Little League games. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell, coaching an all-star team of 9- and 10-year-olds, was  
thrown out of a game by volunteer umpire Steve Ward for the second 
time this year on Tuesday. No other coach has been ejected in more 
than 400 county and all-star tournament games during the past two 
months, a league administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward said Greenwell shoved him, threatened him and cursed during  
an argument over a call at second base in the latest confrontation 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell denied using obscene language and said Ward was  
jealous of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy targeted me,'' said Greenwell, a .303 career hitter  
who played for the Boston Red Sox from 1985-96. ``He gets to go to 
work and brag he threw me out of a Little League game. ... This 
umpire threw me out of a county tournament game a month ago. It's 
like he makes purposely bad calls to have this confrontation with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, a 37-year-old computer programmer, denied seeking a  
confrontation with Greenwell, 35. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I was out to get Mike or his team, why would I do that?''  
Ward said. ``I have no reason to go after Mike. What benefit would 
I have gained?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Morris, a Little League coach and former outfielder at LSU,  
witnessed Greenwell's latest outburst. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's not a good role model at all,'' Morris said. ``Mike  
Greenwell, being the player that he was, I would think that he 
would show a little more self-restraint. ... I think he was kind of 
reliving his days back in Boston. But now in Little League, you 
don't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwell and Ward likely won't see each again other for a  
while. Greenwell's team lost Tuesday 17-9, ending its season.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Aaron ``Bunny'' Lapin, who put whipped cream  
in a spray can a half-century ago and called it Reddi-wip, died 
Saturday of heart failure. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Reddi-wip was first sold in 1948 by St. Louis milkmen and  
quickly expanded throughout the United States and Canada. Lapin was 
soon dubbed the Whipped Cream King, and last year Time magazine 
listed Reddi-wip as one of the century's 100 great things for 
consumers, along with the pop-top can and Spam. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the aerosol topping bought in the United States each  
year is Reddi-wip, packaged in the familiar red, white and blue 
can. 
</P>
<P>
	Lapin moved into the food business during World War II, selling  
Sta-Whip, a wartime substitute for whipping cream. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Crown Cork and Seal Co. introduced the Spra-tainer, the  
first seamless, lined aerosol canister, and Lapin became one of 
Crown's first customers. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to packaging Reddi-wip, Lapin's Clayton Corp. also  
made and sold the valves used in the cans.

<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Sherley Ann Williams, an author who used her  
experience as a migrant farmworker to write a critically acclaimed 
novel about black slavery, died July 8 of cancer. She was 54. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams had been working on a novel and a sequel to her  
1986 historical novel, ``Dessa Rose,'' a story about a privileged 
Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave. The New York Times 
praised the novel as ``artistically brilliant, emotionally 
affecting and totally unforgettable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Williams' first book of verse, ``The Peacock Poems,'' was  
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975. 
Her second book of verse, ``Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' was 
another National Book Award nominee, and a TV performance based on 
the book won an Emmy Award. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IRS Allows Boosters' Deductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Big-time college athletics got an assist  
from an unlikely corner Thursday when the Internal Revenue Service 
ruled that boosters can deduct most of the donations they make to 
lease stadium skyboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling in the case of Nebraska businessman Rod French means  
major schools such as Nebraska, Penn State and Texas will not have 
to rethink their methods for funding their athletic departments. 
</P>
<P>
	College officials were obviously elated by the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's great news. It makes good sense,'' said Jim Meister,  
special assistant to the athletic director at Penn State. ``A 
ruling otherwise ... would have made it very, very difficult for 
college athletics to keep up with increasing costs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was whether boosters should be allowed to deduct part  
of their contribution as a charitable donation if they receive the 
right to lease a skybox in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue surfaced when the IRS audited French of Omaha, owner  
of R.L. French Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	French gave $200,000 to Iowa State University's foundation for a  
10-year skybox lease at the renovated Jack Trice Stadium. He 
claimed the contribution was intended to assist the athletic 
department at Iowa State financially and not simply to pay for a 
skybox. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS balked when he tried to deduct nearly $145,000 as a  
charitable contribution. The agency concluded French was not 
allowed any deduction for a skybox. He lost an appeal and asked the 
IRS to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud that we won this decision,'' French said. ``If  
we had lost and that donor base had been attacked ... I don't like 
to think what might have happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	French estimates that skybox arrangements account for billions  
of donated dollars to Division I universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Ward, spokeswoman for the IRS, said the agency had no  
immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch Baughman, executive director of the 112-member Division  
I-A Athletic Directors' Association, said the impact of an opposite 
ruling would have been terrible for athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The effect would have had devastating impact on Division I  
institutions and all athletic departments that ... generate 
deductible contributions for donors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Booster donations help the athletic departments pay for  
scholarships and myriad sports, many required under a federal law 
that says female athletes must be given equal opportunities to 
compete in athletics. 
</P>
<P>
	Several schools are in the process of buildings skyboxes to hep  
raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Nebraska, for example, is completing a $36  
million project at its football stadium that will include 42 
skyboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The skyboxes were leased to companies and deep-pocketed fans  
within two months of being put on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of the 20-seat skyboxes were leased for 25 years for $2  
million -- or $80,000 a year. The remaining 32 were leased for 10 
years for $750,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska Athletic Director Bill Byrne was out of the office and  
could not be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State has embarked on an $85 million expansion to Beaver  
Stadium which will include 60 skyboxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Each skybox will have 16 seats and lease for $40,000 to $65,000  
a year, plus the cost of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has spent $93 million during the past five years to  
upgrade its sports facilities, said Chris Plonsky, senior associate 
athletic director. It is paying off the project with revenue from 
64 skyboxes in its football stadium and by surcharges on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our suite revenue is what's paying off our long-term debt,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baughman said without being able to claim a deduction, most  
donors would not be willing to contribute the kind of money needed 
to meet that construction debt and occupy those leases in skyboxes.

<HEADLINE> Report: Evidence in Synagogue Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Handwritten notes and anti-Semitic  
writings are among the evidence connecting two brothers to last 
month's synagogue arsons, The Sacramento Bee reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes mention the name of a Sacramento businessman, Michael  
Zwebner, who offered $10,000 following the June 18 fires. Next to 
the man's name were the notations ``Yid bizman'' and ``$10,000 on 
us,'' the Bee reported, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``If, as a result of posting the reward, that has helped, then I  
am pleased and proud of it,'' said the Israeli-born Zwebner. ``I 
think any act of violence against any ethnic community is abhorrent 
to a civilized society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There also was a reference to Sacramento bounty hunter Leonard  
Padilla, who offered a $25,000 reward in the arson case: ``Leonard 
Padilla, bounty hunter, $25,000 on us,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Padilla said he's received ``heavy'' police protection from  
local law enforcement since his name turned up in the suspects' 
notebook during last week's searches. 
</P>
<P>
	The notebook was found July 8 during a search of a Redding  
storage locker rented to Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, sources 
told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his brother, James Tyler Williams, 29, are being held in  
the Shasta County Jail on charges of receiving stolen property that 
investigators have linked to the murders of a gay couple. The 
brothers have pleaded innocent to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI refused to comment on the evidence, denouncing how the  
information may have been obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that The Bee may have obtained information that was  
filed under seal by order of a federal court and violation of such 
a seal is illegal,'' said FBI spokesman Nick Rossi. ``The violation 
may also jeopardize our investigation, or worse, jeopardize the 
safety of others who have cooperated with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The evidence was found in a search conducted one day after the  
brothers were arrested on charges related to the July 1 slayings of 
Gary Matson and Winfield Mowder in their home outside Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the search, the brothers became the main suspects  
in the arsons, sources told The Bee. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials have refused to confirm that the Williams brothers  
are suspects in the arsons, but Shasta County officials have said 
the brothers are linked to the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers have not been charged in the murders, although  
authorities said charges could be filed by the end of the week.

<HEADLINE>  Bored Kendall Still Learning To Cope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall said  
Thursday he is bored and fidgety without baseball and even lost his 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	As he hobbled into manager Gene Lamont's office for the first  
time since dislocating his right ankle July 4, Kendall appeared to 
have lost five pounds and maybe 10. Doctors normally worry about 
athletes putting on weight during inactive times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It crushes me that I can't play baseball,'' Kendall said. ``It  
showed me how baseball isn't everything. All I've ever known is 
baseball this and baseball that, and it definitely put a change in 
my heart. It's definitely given me a different perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's injury -- his right foot was detached from the rest of  
his leg from the ankle down, held on only by skin -- is serious 
enough that his doctors still can't accurately estimate if any 
skills are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was batting .332 with 22 steals and was on pace to break  
the single-season record for a catcher of 36 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an unusual athlete for a catcher,'' said Dr. Jack  
Failla, the Pirates' orthopedist. ``The ankle will never be 100 
percent again, but it might be 95-98 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failla and Dr. Mark Langhans, who operated on Kendall within 90  
minutes of his injury, also have determined the catcher's ankle was 
not broken, even if the team still lists the injury as a 
fracture-dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
	A tiny fragment found floating in the ankle was determined to be  
a tiny piece of detached cartilage, not bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete dislocation of the ankle joint,'' Failla  
said. ``His ankle became completely disconnected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall must spend another 2-2 1/2 weeks in a solid cast, waiting  
for four detached ligaments to begin healing and scar tissue to 
form so he can start his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he began working to strengthen his upper body and  
left leg, which began to atrophy. He also gets lightheaded if he 
walks on crutches for more than several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely tough. I've always been on the move and on the  
go,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall would have preferred to start his rehabilitation the day  
after he was hurt, but he was warned by New York Mets third baseman 
Robin Ventura not to rush back. Ventura fractured and dislocated an 
ankle in a spring training accident with the Chicago White Sox in 
1997 and didn't return until that August. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the best calls I had when I was in the  
hospital. It was good to get it from the horse's mouth, because he 
had the same thing,'' Kendall said. ``A lot of it was personal, but 
he told me the rehabilitation wasn't easy. He also told me to be 
patient, and I'm not a patient person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talk made Kendall realize his hopes to return later this  
season were overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to get back this season. It is likely? Probably not.  
Could it happen? Maybe,'' Kendall said. ``If there is any way to 
get back this season, I will. But there is no reason to risk it if 
it isn't 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, a Pittsburgh-area food chain announced Thursday  
it would begin selling a cereal named after Kendall. The name 
obviously was chosen before the injury: Kendall Krunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually pretty good cereal,'' Kendall said. ``My mom  
won't have to worry about fixing me breakfast.''

	Kendall was batting .332 with 22 steals and was on pace to break  
the single-season record for a catcher of 36 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an unusual athlete for a catcher,'' said Dr. Jack  
Failla, the Pirates' orthopedist. ``The ankle will never be 100 
percent again, but it might be 95-98 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failla and Dr. Mark Langhans, who operated on Kendall within 90  
minutes of his injury, also have determined the catcher's ankle was 
not broken, even if the team still lists the injury as a 
fracture-dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
	A tiny fragment found floating in the ankle was determined to be  
a tiny piece of detached cartilage, not bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete dislocation of the ankle joint,'' Failla  
said. ``His ankle became completely disconnected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall must spend another 2-2 1/2 weeks in a solid cast, waiting  
for four detached ligaments to begin healing and scar tissue to 
form so he can start his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he began working to strengthen his upper body and  
left leg, which began to atrophy. He also gets lightheaded if he 
walks on crutches for more than several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely tough. I've always been on the move and on the  
go,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall would have preferred to start his rehabilitation the day  
after he was hurt, but he was warned by New York Mets third baseman 
Robin Ventura not to rush back. Ventura fractured and dislocated an 
ankle in a spring training accident with the Chicago White Sox in 
1997 and didn't return until that August. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the best calls I had when I was in the  
hospital. It was good to get it from the horse's mouth, because he 
had the same thing,'' Kendall said. ``A lot of it was personal, but 
he told me the rehabilitation wasn't easy. He also told me to be 
patient, and I'm not a patient person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talk made Kendall realize his hopes to return later this  
season were overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to get back this season. It is likely? Probably not.  
Could it happen? Maybe,'' Kendall said. ``If there is any way to 
get back this season, I will. But there is no reason to risk it if 
it isn't 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, a Pittsburgh-area food chain announced Thursday  
it would begin selling a cereal named after Kendall. The name 
obviously was chosen before the injury: Kendall Krunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually pretty good cereal,'' Kendall said. ``My mom  
won't have to worry about fixing me breakfast.''

<HEADLINE> New York Rangers Sign Tim Taylor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Rangers continued their free-agent  
signing blitz Thursday, agreeing to terms with center Tim Taylor on 
a four-year $5.8 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't lie to you, it's about money,'' said Taylor, who had  
four goals and seven assists in 49 games with Boston last season. 
``I understand I can't play forever. I came where the money was 
being offered.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers, who missed the NHL playoffs the last two seasons,  
have signed five free agents in the last month at a cost of $59.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Theo Fleury agreed to a three-year, $24 million deal  
last week and on Tuesday New York signed backup goalie Kirk McLean 
for two years and $1.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier the Rangers agreed on four-year deals with 33-year-old  
left wing Valeri Kamensky for $17 million and 30-year-old 
defenseman Stephane Quintal for $11.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 30, has 39 goals and 40 assists in 267 games with  
Detroit and Boston and was a member of the Red Wings 1997 Stanley 
Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I owed it to myself and my family to take the best offer,'' he  
said. ``The decision was made for me. There wasn't much to make a 
decision over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the Rangers announced the retirement of  
defenseman Jeff Beukeboom, who was unable to resume playing because 
of a series of concussions.

<HEADLINE> Profits Predicted for Nissan by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- After two weeks on the job, the  
former Renault executive charged with overhauling Nissan Motor Co. 
says the Japanese automaker needs to start turning a profit again 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan will have to come back to profit very quickly,'' Carlos  
Ghosn said. ``When I say quickly, I'm saying specifically the year 
2000. I think the year 1999 is already, unfortunately, in the 
red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn is the Renault SA vice president who became Nissan's chief  
operating officer July 1. He's on a two-week tour of Nissan's U.S. 
operations as part of his effort to develop a turnaround plan by 
late September. He spoke Thursday to auto writers at Nissan's 
research and development center outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian-born Ghosn, dubbed ``Le Cost Killer'' for his  
successful efficiency drive at French automaker Renault SA, was 
dispatched to Tokyo after Renault agreed in March to invest $5.4 
billion to gain a 36.8 percent stake in the debt-ridden Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan has lost money in seven of the last eight years. Ghosn  
noted that from 1991 to 1998, Nissan lost 1.7 percentage points of 
worldwide market share to 6.6 percent. That's the equivalent of 
800,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	He hinted that Nissan may have to close or sell plants outside  
the United States to deal with its global overcapacity if sales do 
not increase quickly. Nissan's only wholly owned U.S. plant is in 
Smyrna, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overinvested for what we sell,'' he said. ``This is a  
cost that we cannot bear, especially if this overcapacity leads to 
long-term overcapacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn (pronounced GOHN) said he was convinced after talking to  
managers and employees that the company was eager to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, people have been very open,'' he said. ``Very open,  
very candid, with a lot of sense of responsibility and a lot of 
sense that we will not have a lot of chances. We don't have a lot 
of time to fix Nissan's problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn said, ``All the people I've met, all the discussions I've  
had lead me to conclude that people have had enough of losing 
market share, people have had enough of being in the red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's U.S. sales have been improving lately; they were up 8  
percent in the first half of the year. The automaker has an 
aggressive plan to introduce a series of new models over the next 
few years, with an emphasis on light trucks -- the market's most 
profitable segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn said Nissan may even decide to enter the full-size pickup  
segment, which has been the highly profitable domain of Detroit's 
automakers. It would join Toyota Motor Corp., which recently 
introduced a large pickup built in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success in the U.S. is not important for Nissan, it's  
vital for Nissan,'' he said. ``Nissan has much more potential in 
the U.S. than what's it's delivering today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn said there is virtually no chance Renault will sell its  
cars in the United States under the Nissan badge within the next 
three years. It would take that long to design vehicles with the 
U.S. market in mind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to announce his turnaround plan in October before the  
Tokyo auto show. He said it will be based in large part on what 
Nissan employees have identified as problems and solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	A priority will be improving relations with Nissan's parts  
suppliers to cut costs and encourage more innovation and 
cooperation in developing new vehicles, Ghosn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also needs to be more innovative and create a more  
consistent design and styling theme with its new vehicles, he said. 
Once considered a trendsetter with such cars as the Datsun 240Z, 
Nissan in the last decade has been known more for blandness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made some great cars. We have made cars which are not  
so great,'' he said. ``We will have to bring back the attractive 
cars that our customers are asking us to show. And I think we have 
the potential.''

<HEADLINE> Astros' Dierker Returns to Baseball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Larry Dierker's goals will be simple at first.  
</P>
<P>
	On the day he returns as manager of the Houston Astros, all he  
wants is to drive himself to the Astrodome and to be on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker will return as manager of the Astros tonight for the  
first time since June 13, when he suffered a grand mal seizure that 
required brain surgery to remove a cluster of blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros play host to Detroit tonight through Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Looking fit and relaxed, Dierker showed up at the Astrodome on  
Wednesday for an optional team workout. His hair is beginning to 
grow back, and he feels normal except for occasional forgetfulness 
about time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strangest thing is that time seems to have no meaning. I  
find myself out of touch with time,'' Dierker said. ``It's been a 
month since this happened and it seems like two weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bothering Dierker more is the fact that he's prohibited from  
driving for another five months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not being able to drive is driving me up the wall,'' Dierker  
said. ``Every day I have the urge to get in the truck and drive 
somewhere. My wife has a busy life and she's going to get tired 
having to drive me everywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans have been asked to wear brightly colored Hawaiian shirts --  
Dierker's favorite attire -- to welcome him back. Dierker met the 
media Wednesday wearing a lei. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be delighted tomorrow, but I haven't been antsy to get  
back,'' Dierker said. ``I don't feel anything but normal. I'd say 
at no point did I worry about my recovery. I had confidence that I 
would recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros begin the second half of the season with a long  
injury list that includes two stars, third baseman Ken Caminiti and 
left fielder Moises Alou. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather have Alou back than myself and I'd rather have Camy  
back than myself,'' Dierker said. ``But what we've gotten from the 
outfielders and third basemen we have wasn't so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's No. 49 jersey came down from the dugout, where it has  
hung in his honor since his collapse in the eighth inning of a game 
against the San Diego on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans no changes in his managing style.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has affected my intellect,'' Dierker said. ``I feel  
the same and my philosophy is the same. I know what I want to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker checked out of Methodist Hospital on June 23 and has  
been recuperating at home. He has managed a few visits to the 
Astrodome and a few rounds of golf while convalescing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the energy for a stressful workout and I don't  
have permission to do it, so that doesn't matter,'' Dierker said. 
``I was able to play golf a few times and I was able to do that in 
the heat of the day so I feel pretty good about my condition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros went 13-14 under interim manager Matt Galante.  
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's collapse visibly shook his players and hushed the home  
crowd, which was never officially told what happened. He was 
treated on the field and ushered out of the stadium in an 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros, behind starting pitcher Shane Reynolds, were leading  
4-1 in the game, which was suspended and will resume when the 
Padres return to Houston on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierker's condition was diagnosed as arteriovenous malformation.  
Dr. Rob Parrish, who performed the surgery, said the mass was about 
the size of a ``really big jalapeno.'' Parrish forecast a full 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Dierker, first base coach Jose Cruz left the team  
May 10 with an irregular heart beat and hitting coach Tom McCraw 
left May 16 to begin treatment for prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz has rejoined the team. McCraw is still undergoing treatment  
in California.

<HEADLINE> Schumacher Will Probably Miss Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Two-time world champion Michael Schumacher is  
probably finished for the Formula One season after breaking his leg 
in a crash at the British Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher's manager said Thursday the Ferrari driver will need  
three months to recover from the crash last week. The season ends 
Oct. 31 in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is that he gets completely healthy  
and his leg injuries heal right. After that we will think about a 
comeback,'' manager Willi Weber said after visiting Schumacher at a 
Swiss clinic. ``A pause of three months is realistic. It will take 
that long for a full recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, whose accident is believed to have been caused by a  
loose bolt on the rear brakes, plowed into a tire wall on the 
race's first lap. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old German might heal in time to race in the  
season's final Grand Prix in Suzuka, Japan. However, he probably 
wouldn't want to take a risk after saying he was ``lucky to be 
alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surgeons inserted a foot-long pin into his leg to fix two  
breaks.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Flat for 2 Months in a Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer inflation, helped out by falling  
prices for gasoline and airline tickets, remained flat for the 
second month in a row -- the best showing in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department reported Thursday that its Consumer Price  
Index -- the most closely watched gauge of inflation -- stood still 
in June, as it did in May. Economists had expected a slight rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time prices showed no increase for two straight months  
was in 1986, when for three consecutive months the CPI actually 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those two big goose eggs will make it politically tough for  
the Fed'' to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on Aug. 24, 
said First Union economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly takes the pressure off for another increase,''  
agreed economist Sandra Shaber of the WEFA Group. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation is 2.2 percent,  
compared with a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the smallest 
increase in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets greeted the inflation report with enthusiasm.  
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 38.31 points to 
11,186.41. Broader stock indicators posted bigger gains, with the 
Nasdaq composite index and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index reaching 
new closing highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Worried that inflationary pressures could be building, the Fed  
at its last meeting, on June 30, bumped up interest rates for the 
first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's pre-emptive strike to keep inflation under control  
came after prices at the retail and wholesale level spiked in 
April, generating inflation fears. That increase was caused by a 
sharp run-up in prices for gasoline and other energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	But just as in May, the good showing on prices in June reflected  
a big drop in energy costs. Gasoline prices fell a sharp 3.2 
percent last month, the most in more than two years. Gasoline 
prices were down 2.7 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in gasoline prices contributed to an overall decline of  
1.2 percent in energy costs, which followed a 1.3 percent drop in 
May and helped reverse a part of April's huge 6.1 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	However, economists said gasoline prices in July are rising and  
if that continues overall consumers prices will probably edge up in 
the next report. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline fares also were down 4.8 percent in June, the largest  
drop in more than three years. Economists said that airlines have 
too many unfilled seats and are slashing fares to keep planes full, 
something they expect to continue in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	New car prices, meanwhile, edged down 0.3 percent, reflecting  
foreign competition and efforts by dealers to make room in 
showrooms for new models. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparel prices fell 0.4 percent last month, the fifth decline  
this year. Economists said that with so many stores for shoppers to 
choose among, retailers are cutting prices to lure them in. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices were unchanged in June, after a sharp 0.4 percent  
rise the month before. Big declines in prices of pork and fresh 
vegetables held back food prices despite a sharp rise in beef 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, price pressures  
remained tame. This ``core rate'' of inflation was up just 0.1 
percent in June, the same as May.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Clinton To Indict Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of a House panel and  
Cuban-American leaders accused the Clinton administration on 
Thursday of stalling in a long-running investigation of Cuba's 
shooting down of two civilian aircraft in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	They suggested Fidel Castro should be indicted in the inquiry.  
The episode over the Florida Straits, between Cuba and the Florida 
Keys, claimed the lives of four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Castro ordered the shoot down. We need President Clinton to  
say that Fidel Castro does not enjoy immunity as head of state for 
this crime. That's what needs to happen here,'' George Fowler, 
general counsel of the Cuban American National Foundation, told the 
House Judiciary crime subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., agreed  
that Castro should be indicted. ``I will do whatever it takes 
within my power'' to bring the case to a close, including finding 
out why U.S. fighter jets were not scrambled to intercept the Cuban 
MIGs that shot down two civilian planes in the February 1996 
incident, McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that, if necessary, Congress would issue subpoenas to  
force appearances by administration witnesses who have refused to 
appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Houlihan, a Customs radar operator in Riverside, Calif.  
who followed the incident on his screen, said he was ``startled'' 
when he saw images of the three small Cessna civilian aircraft 
being pursued by fast-moving blips he took to be Russian-built 
Cuban MiGs. 
</P>
<P>
	He told the panel he immediately made an emergency call to the  
Southeast Air Defense unit at Florida's Tyndall Air Force Base and 
was told, ``We're handling it. Don't worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houlihan told the panel he did not know why the Air Force did  
not launch its own fighter jets. A former Air Force radar 
controller, Houlihan said it was standard practice for the United 
States to put its planes in the sky whenever a Cuban fighter is 
seen heading toward the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked the Air Force -- are you seeing what I'm seeing? It  
looked like two aircraft were shot down,'' Houlihan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Basulto, the pilot of the only surviving aircraft, said two  
Cuban MiGs pursued him for 53 minutes before abandoning the chase 
about 30 miles west of Key West. 
</P>
<P>
	Basulto is the founder and president of the Miami-based Brothers  
to the Rescue, which routinely flies humanitarian missions to help 
refugees in rafts and boats. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense and Justice Department were invited but declined to  
send witnesses to the hearing, McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a December 1998 memo, the Pentagon's inspector general,  
Eleanor Hill, told lawmakers that ``national security 
classifications prohibit us from providing detailed responses,'' 
including to the question of why U.S. jets were not launched in the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who is of Cuban descent, told  
the panel, ``We know who is ultimately responsible for this blatant 
act of aggression. Yet, the Department of Justice has yet to 
conclude its investigation and issue indictments against the Castro 
regime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence King in  
Miami demanded that the Cuban government pay a bit more than $187 
million to the relatives of three Cuban-American pilots who died in 
the incident. The fourth man killed was not a U.S. citizen, and his 
relatives were not eligible to sue under the terrorism law, the 
court held. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba maintains that the planes violated Cuban airspace and even  
flew over land to scatter political pamphlets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse  
Helms, R-N.C., and House International Relations Committee Chairman 
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., jointly wrote to President Clinton 
demanding that the United States halt cooperation with Cuba in the 
war on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	They said information the U.S. was providing to Cuba on  
suspected drug planes that could prompt Cuba to shoot down civilian 
planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing such information risks exposing U.S. officials to  
criminal liability,'' Helms and Gilman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Helms met with Lazaro Betancourt Morin, a former  
bodyguard for Castro who defected to the U.S. in April during a 
trip with Castro to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Betancourt Morin, 37, said the Cuban leader has as many as 1,000  
men who serve as his security detail, including 40 or 50 ``private 
guards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic situation is very grave,'' he said, through a  
translator.

<HEADLINE> FBI Names New Sleuth in Bomb Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI named a 16-year veteran investigator  
Thursday to take over its frustrating search for Eric Rudolph, the 
32-year-old loner charged with bombing the Atlanta Olympics, two 
abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven C. McCraw, 45, who has been an inspector at FBI  
headquarters here since May 1998, was selected to take charge of 
the Southeast Bomb Task Force on Aug. 1, FBI Director Louis J. 
Freeh announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Woody Enderson, who has headed the task force since its  
inception in March 1998 and its predecessor the Atlanta Bomb Task 
Force since 1997, has announced his retirement after a 28-year 
career in the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI has been searching for Rudolph since hours after a Jan.  
29, 1998, explosion killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at the 
New Woman All Women Health Care in Birmingham, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on evidence gathered by the task force, Rudolph was  
charged in that case and later in three Atlanta-area bombings, the 
1996 Olympic park blast in which a woman died, and the 1997 
bombings of a reproductive services clinic and a gay nightclub in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Freeh credited Enderson's ``tenacious leadership'' with  
producing the evidence for those charges. ``His professionalism and 
selfless devotion to duty put a bold exclamation point to Woody 
Enderson's service to the FBI and the nation,'' Freeh said.

<HEADLINE> Bored Kendall Still Learning To Cope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Jason Kendall said  
Thursday he is bored and fidgety without baseball and even lost his 
appetite. 
</P>
<P>
	As he hobbled into manager Gene Lamont's office for the first  
time since dislocating his right ankle July 4, Kendall appeared to 
have lost five pounds and maybe 10. Doctors normally worry about 
athletes putting on weight during inactive times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It crushes me that I can't play baseball,'' Kendall said. ``It  
showed me how baseball isn't everything. All I've ever known is 
baseball this and baseball that, and it definitely put a change in 
my heart. It's definitely given me a different perspective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall's injury -- his right foot was detached from the rest of  
his leg from the ankle down, held on only by skin -- is serious 
enough that his doctors still can't accurately estimate if any 
skills are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall was batting .332 with 22 steals and was on pace to break  
the single-season record for a catcher of 36 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is an unusual athlete for a catcher,'' said Dr. Jack  
Failla, the Pirates' orthopedist. ``The ankle will never be 100 
percent again, but it might be 95-98 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Failla and Dr. Mark Langhans, who operated on Kendall within 90  
minutes of his injury, also have determined the catcher's ankle was 
not broken, even if the team still lists the injury as a 
fracture-dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
	A tiny fragment found floating in the ankle was determined to be  
a tiny piece of detached cartilage, not bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a complete dislocation of the ankle joint,'' Failla  
said. ``His ankle became completely disconnected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall must spend another 2-2 1/2 weeks in a solid cast, waiting  
for four detached ligaments to begin healing and scar tissue to 
form so he can start his rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, he began working to strengthen his upper body and  
left leg, which began to atrophy. He also gets lightheaded if he 
walks on crutches for more than several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely tough. I've always been on the move and on the  
go,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall would have preferred to start his rehabilitation the day  
after he was hurt, but he was warned by New York Mets third baseman 
Robin Ventura not to rush back. Ventura fractured and dislocated an 
ankle in a spring training accident with the Chicago White Sox in 
1997 and didn't return until that August. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the best calls I had when I was in the  
hospital. It was good to get it from the horse's mouth, because he 
had the same thing,'' Kendall said. ``A lot of it was personal, but 
he told me the rehabilitation wasn't easy. He also told me to be 
patient, and I'm not a patient person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The talk made Kendall realize his hopes to return later this  
season were overly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to get back this season. It is likely? Probably not.  
Could it happen? Maybe,'' Kendall said. ``If there is any way to 
get back this season, I will. But there is no reason to risk it if 
it isn't 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, a Pittsburgh-area food chain announced Thursday  
it would begin selling a cereal named after Kendall. The name 
obviously was chosen before the injury: Kendall Krunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's actually pretty good cereal,'' Kendall said. ``My mom  
won't have to worry about fixing me breakfast.''

<HEADLINE> Major Mexico Saltworks Plan Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leading international scientists urged Mexico  
and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. to abandon plans to build the world's 
largest salt plant on a Pacific lagoon used by gray whales for 
birthing. 
</P>
<P>
	In a full-page newspaper advertisement published Thursday in The  
New York Times, a letter signed by 33 renowned scientists said the 
project was ``an unacceptable risk'' to wildlife in and near the 
San Ignacio Lagoon on the Baja California Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
	A double-page advertisement signed by the scientists appeared  
Monday in a newspaper in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The saltworks would pump 6,600 gallons out of the lagoon each  
second and flood more than 116 square miles to create evaporation 
pools, the scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter said construction of the plant would pose three main  
risks to gray whales: loss of habitat, the threat of collisions 
with ships, and the accumulation of contaminants in the whales' 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mitsubishi needs to recognize the weight of scientific opinion  
against their plans to turn the California gray whale's last 
pristine breeding ground into a salt factory,'' whale biologist 
Roger Payne said in a separate statement. ``It makes no sense to 
threaten such a unique Mexican and global treasure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lagoon was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	Exportadora del Sal, S.A., the Mexican-Japanese corporation  
promoting the project, submitted its proposal in 1994. The Mexican 
government rejected it the next year, stating its environmental 
impact statement had not adequately addressed potential threats, 
said Alberto Szekely, spokesman for a 55-member environmental 
coalition opposing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then Exportadora del Sal, known as ESSA, has been working  
to resubmit the proposal and is expected to formally do so by this 
autumn, Szekely said. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter called on the government to uphold its original  
decision. It included signatures from nine Nobel laureates, 
including Philip Anderson, David Baltimore, Murray Gell-Man, Roger 
Guillemin, Andrew Huxley, Brian Josephson, Aaron Klug, Mario Molina 
and James Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi Corp., is a $130 billion-a-year company affiliated  
with other corporations under the Mitsubishi Group umbrella, 
including Mitsubishi Electronics, Mitsubishi Motors, Nikon Corp., 
and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Plan $864B Tax Cut Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats couldn't stop Republicans from  
sending an $864 billion tax bill to the House floor, but they did 
take every opportunity to press their claims that the tax cut 
threatens Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Through 11 hours of House Ways and Means Committee debate  
Wednesday, Democrats repeatedly forced votes on amendments intended 
to divert some of the money for tax cuts into the two huge 
retirement programs or into paying down public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Democrats also accused the GOP of drafting a huge tax  
cut designed to appeal to their political base, contending it has 
no chance of becoming law because President Clinton is promising a 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole thing is a house of cards,'' said Rep. Sander  
Levin, D-Mich. ``At some point, you're going to have to sit down 
and talk reality, instead of farce and politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But after fighting off the Democratic amendments, the GOP  
majority on the Ways and Means Committee cleared the bill on a 
23-13 vote. It moves next to the full House, possibly as early as 
next week, and a competing $792 billion Senate version is also in 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are putting together a possible  
compromise proposal that would cut taxes by no more than $300 
billion over 10 years, according to Finance Committee sources 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Although details were still in flux, the bill is expected to  
include an increase in the standard income tax deduction, relief 
from the ``marriage penalty'' that affects many two-income couples, 
tax breaks for health, the environment, agriculture and education 
and cuts in estate taxes, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would cut income taxes by 10 percent across the  
board, reduce capital gains taxes, eventually abolish estate and 
alternative minimum taxes and give people new breaks for education 
and long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insisted that the $2.9 trillion in projected budget  
surpluses over 10 years would easily provide enough money for the 
tax cuts and to ensure Medicare and Social Security are ready for 
the baby boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have plenty of money to do everything we want to do, if we  
do it smart,'' said Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La. 
</P>
<P>
	One major change approved by the panel was a proposed tax  
deduction for insurance costs paid by some senior citizens to cover 
prescription drugs. It was the GOP's first official reaction to 
Clinton's popular proposal to add a drug benefit to Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Republican plan is contingent upon a passage later this  
year of an overall reform of Medicare, including a direct drug 
subsidy for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the measure was simply political cover for  
Republicans who fear being outflanked on Medicare as they push 
their huge tax cut. They attempted to shave roughly $270 billion 
off the tax cut for a more direct Medicare prescription drug 
benefit, but that was defeated on a party-line 23-11 vote as 
important for its political symbolism as anything else. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we give tax breaks to the richest 10 percent of  
Americans, we should be willing ... to give senior citizens help 
with some of these bills,'' said Rep. Fortney ``Pete'' Stark, 
D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In Baltimore on Wednesday, Clinton said the House GOP tax bill  
``could wreck our economy'' and would consume almost all of the 
non-Social Security surplus over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would require, as our economy grows, real cuts in  
education, defense, the environment, research, technology -- the 
kinds of things we have invested more in,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	On two other symbolic party-line votes, Ways and Means  
Republicans turned back a Democratic effort to delay the entire tax 
cut until a long-term solution to Social Security is in place and 
an amendment to use 50 percent of the money to pay down public 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the American people can see through this and it all  
boils down to one thing: Who do you trust?'' said Rep. J.D. 
Hayworth, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans on the committee were able to divert some  
money intended to cut capital gains taxes for corporations into two 
programs supported by Democrats. Both moves were opposed by Archer. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., won approval of an amendment that  
would gradually raise the per capita cap on low-income housing tax 
credits from $1.25 to $1.75 at a cost of $3.8 billion over 10 
years. A similar provision is expected in a Senate GOP tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
	--Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., amended the bill to extend  
welfare-to-work tax credits for six months longer than the measure 
originally intended, at a cost of $277 million over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the panel approved an amendment by Reps. Wes  
Watkins, R-Okla., and William Jefferson, D-La., for $389 million in 
tax breaks to benefit independent domestic oil producers suffering 
from economic distress.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals Sign First-Round Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Right-hander Chance Caple, the St. Louis  
Cardinals' first pick in last month's amateur draft, agreed 
Thursday to a minor league contract with a $1.2 million signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable, and I hope to be here soon,'' he said after  
walking onto the field at Busch Stadium. ``I'm looking forward to 
the challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Caple, 20, was the 30th pick overall after going 8-5 with 125  
strikeouts in 114 innings as a junior for Texas A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	He's another promising arm in the Cardinals' system, which  
includes left-hander Rick Ankiel, who got a $2.5 million bonus in 
1997 and is now at Triple-A Memphis, and right-hander Chad 
Hutchinson, who a $3.5 million, four-year deal and is at Double-A 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've heard a lot about them,'' Caple said. ``I've just tried  
to put myself in a position where I can be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The process starts Friday when he heads for New Jersey of the  
Class A New York-Penn League. A plus is the Cardinals also drafted 
and signed his college catcher, eighth-rounder Shawn Schumacher, 
and he's already playing at New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He loves it, and he's looking forward to it,'' Caple said.  
``This makes it easier to adjust.''

<HEADLINE> Ten Commandments Seen As Cure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- Students filing into Altoona's schools are  
greeted with stern words of welcome, written in red on glass doors: 
``Metal detector in use'' and ``You are subject to search.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This 9,400-student district spends about $300,000 a year on  
security. It has its own security force and volunteers patrolling 
the halls. In this post-Columbine High summer, the schools are 
being wired for cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	All of which prompted the Rev. Gary Dull, a local minister, to  
offer a solution even more in vogue today than those airport-style 
safety precautions: Why not simply post the Ten Commandments? 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the Supreme Court took prayer and Bible reading out of  
schools in 1962, we've had a complete downgrading of morals,'' said 
Dull, the pastor of a Baptist church and a radio show host. ``Every 
school district is worried about guns and drugs. Before 1962, the 
big issue was gum and paper wads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the recent spate of school shootings that included the  
horrific slayings at Columbine High in Littleton, Colo., members of 
the clergy, elected officials and lawmakers nationwide are pushing 
the Bible as a solution to school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives recently passed a bill allowing the  
posting of the Ten Commandments in schools and state-owned or 
administered facilities. In Adams County, Ohio, a group of 
ministers paid to place tablets outside four high schools to 
counter ``moral decline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Altoona, 95 miles east of Pittsburgh, Dull and his  
parishioners asked the school board in May to hang posters of the 
commandments in all 13 schools and offer an elective course on 
biblical law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it will put some good manners into people's heads. There  
aren't many God-fearing people here,'' said Veronica Morgan, 16, a 
junior who is in her church youth group. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court in the 1960s ruled that organized prayer  
and Bible readings were not permitted in public schools; 19 years 
ago, it decided posting the Ten Commandments violated the 
Constitution's ban of government-established religion. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the decisions have been under fire.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a foundational historical document,'' said Bruce St.  
Laurent, a retiree who runs United Prayer Fellowship, a group 
trying to get the Ten Commandments placed in Tennessee courthouses 
beside the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In Waynesville, N.C., the words of the Ten Commandments are  
etched in the marble wall of its courtroom along with a bas-relief 
of Lady Justice. The county argues it's a historical display and a 
federal judge backed the county. Local atheists are appealing the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate has been somewhat sedate in Altoona, a working-class  
town of 49,200. Altoona is battling the problems of drugs, crime 
and a deteriorating downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	School board member Richard Lockard, a member of Dull's church,  
said weapons have been found in school buildings in recent years, 
though the district hasn't had any safety crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``We put up with no foolishness,'' said superintendent Dennis  
Murray, who's opposed to posting the commandments. ``You wear a 
swastika, you're gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rabbi Burt Schuman of Altoona's Temple Beth Israel, said  
religious minorities have a different take on the past than the 
Baptists. He remembers being forced to recite the Lord's Prayer at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``That didn't diminish the gang wars, it didn't stop racist  
outbursts, it didn't stop girls from being groped in the stairwell, 
it didn't stop boys from sniffing in the bathroom,'' he said. 
``Let's not be nostalgic about the good ol' days, because they 
weren't always good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this debate so divisive is that any old moral code  
won't do for advocates like Dull. He doesn't want generic musings 
like ``Be kind'' or ``Develop your spirituality,'' as the local 
YWCA suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the Ten Commandments -- not the 10 suggestions,'' agreed  
Christian Coalition president Pat Robertson. ``When the school 
board posts another code of ethics, it's a recommendation. When God 
says it, it has the moral authority of the creator of the 
universe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say it is naive to believe kids will obey Biblical rules  
just because they're posted in school. Dull said he is sure the 
results would show -- eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	``It might even take a generation to see the ultimate positive  
effect,'' Dull said. ``But the sooner we get started, the better.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Uruguay in Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A two-point victory won't do when  
the United States plays Uruguay in the Americans' first game of the 
Olympic qualifying tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole objective is to win, and to win by a large margin,''  
said Kevin Garnett, who is well aware that this American team will 
not only be judged by its success, but by its margin of success. 
</P>
<P>
	American teams have seen their average margin of victory shrink  
from 43.8 points per game in the 1992 Olympics -- the first team to 
use NBA players -- to 37.7 points in the 1994 World Championships 
and 32.3 points in the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the level of competition in this tournament a notch  
below what the United States will see in the 2000 Olympics, that 
trend could see a reversal. 
</P>
<P>
	The American players also are mindful of the reputations of the  
NBA teams that preceded them, including the 1992 team that won the 
gold medal in Barcelona, the 1996 team that won in Atlanta, and the 
1994 team that won the world championships in Toronto, but was more 
remembered for its in-your-face style of play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys tend to get on the U.S. about playing flamboyant, but  
you've got to understand the other teams are doing the same thing. 
You just don't understand what they're saying,'' Garnett said. 
``Rude in their country might be to give you an elbow. Rude in our 
country is to stick your finger up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basketball part of it is about trying to win. That's the  
way you've got to look at it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opens play tonight against Uruguay, one of the  
lesser-known and lowest-regarded teams in the 10-nation field. 
</P>
<P>
	In first round games Wednesday, Uruguay defeated Cuba 87-84 in  
overtime, Canada beat Argentina 77-70, Puerto Rico routed Venezuela 
81-56 and Brazil defeated the Dominican Republic 70-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The international style of play, with its premium on outside  
shooting and aversion to physical play, does not exactly inject 
fear into the hearts of the fourth U.S. national team made up of 
professional players. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the U.S. players insist they are not overlooking the  
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't put anything past anybody in the game of basketball,''  
Vin Baker of the Seattle SuperSonics said. ``As confident as we are 
and as good as we are, anything can happen. It can snow in San 
Juan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the second time the United States has had to  
qualify for the Olympics in men's basketball. The other time was 
1992, when the original Dream Team won the Tournament of the 
Americas in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Qualifying became necessary last summer when the U.S. team  
failed to win the world championships in Athens, Greece, after a 
league lockout forced NBA players from the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Grouped with the United States in the opening round are Cuba,  
Argentina, Canada and Uruguay. Group `B' consists of Puerto Rico, 
Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, Panama and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team is relatively young, with only three players --  
Steve Smith of Atlanta, Tim Hardaway of Miami and Gary Payton of 
Seattle -- older than 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine NBA veterans -- Allan Houston, Baker, Smith, Hardaway,  
Payton, Jason Kidd, Tim Duncan, Garnett and Tom Gugliotta -- will 
also have spots on the Olympic roster next summer. The other three 
roster spots on the qualifying team are held by three rookies -- 
Wally Szczerbiak of Minnesota, Richard Hamilton of Washington and 
Elton Brand of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta broke his nose and Hamilton sprained his ankle  
Wednesday as the U.S. team held its final practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta was elbowed in the nose by Kidd, while Hamilton  
sprained his right ankle while stepping off the practice court. 
Both are expected to be available against Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to see zone defenses, and they are going to make  
us work for 30 seconds when we're on defense,'' Kidd said. 
``They'll use a lot of the shot clock, and while we're used to 
keeping it inside, they'll throw it inside to set something up 
outside for one of their shooters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of NBA players are scattered across the rosters  
of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Nash of Dallas and Todd MacCulloch of Washington are  
playing for Canada, and Felipe Lopez of Vancouver is playing for 
the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Jackson of Indiana plans to join the Dominican team for the  
second round, which begins Monday. Four of the five teams in each 
group advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing Uruguay, the Americans play Canada on Friday,  
Argentina on Saturday and Cuba on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The most important games will be the semifinals a week from  
Saturday. The winners of those two games earn berths at the Sydney 
Olympics.

<HEADLINE>  Dierckxsens Won Tour de France Stage </HEADLINE>

<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) -- With the main contenders relaxing  
tired muscles after two days in the Alps, Belgian champion Ludo 
Dierckxsens won the 11th stage of the Tour de France on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall standings remained virtually unchanged with American  
Lance Armstrong retaining his comfortable lead at 7 minutes and 47 
seconds.

	``If Armstrong doesn't crack, the rest of us will simply be  
playing for podium places in Paris,'' said Richard Virenque of 
France, who finished sixth in Wednesday's 10th stage in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, the 27-year-old Texan making a remarkable recovery  
from testicular cancer, acknowledged he is in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two stages in the mountains, I've got to be happy,''  
Armstrong said. ``I'm in a good position. After yesterday I was 
tired, so I just tried to control my competitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a low-key atmosphere to the day as the cyclists headed  
downhill, snaking through villages, vineyards, apricot orchards and 
fields of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't take away from Dierckxsens' joy, the 35-year-old  
veteran ranking the stage victory among his best finishes ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``At last I've done it!'' he exclaimed after the race. ``I've  
fought since the first day and have been in all the breakaways, but 
I never had any luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``This time it was different.''  
</P>
<P>
	In second place was Dmitri Konyshev of Russia, 1 minute 27  
seconds behind. He narrowly edged Kazakstan's Alexandre Vinokourov. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in  
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The main pack finished more than 22 minutes later, including  
Armstrong, Virenque, and other top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th stage was a relatively flat 124-mile ride from Le Bourg  
d'Oisans in the Alps to Saint-Etienne, capital of French bicycle 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of seven riders broke away after about 62 miles and led  
for the whole race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race to control the only riders likely to eat into 
Armstrong's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	There was one notable climb, the 3,963-foot Col de la Croix de  
Chaubouret, before a descent into St. Etienne. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Virenque summed up the mood of many Tour de France  
riders after watching Armstrong extend his already commanding 
overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's race was won by Italy's Giuseppe Guerini, who  
recovered from a last-minute crash with a spectator who had jumped 
into his path to take a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour officials said Thursday that the spectator visited  
Guerini's hotel to offer his apologies. The two then shook hands, 
the officials said.

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Coldiron was blocking on the first  
play of the game, so he never saw Johnny Bright get slugged, never 
saw him go down. 
</P>
<P>
	Coldiron did see Bright sprawled on the ground, however, and  
when the powerfully built halfback did not get up right away, he 
knew something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd seen him take so many hits and he'd be back up and almost  
be the first one in the huddle,'' Coldiron said, recalling the game 
played in 1951. ``Then when he didn't get up, it really shocked 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unbeknownst to his teammates, the Drake star was hit by Oklahoma  
A&AMP;M's Wilbanks Smith and his jaw was broken, an incident revealed 
in startling detail in a photo sequence that appeared the next day 
in The Des Moines Sunday Register. 
</P>
<P>
	The photographers who shot it, Don Ultang and John Robinson, won  
a Pulitzer Prize the following year. Their photos and several 
others that won Pulitzers are featured in a documentary put 
together by Turner Network Television. 
</P>
<P>
	TNT will show the 90-minute piece, ``Moment of Impact: Stories  
of the Pulitzer Prize Photographs,'' on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The sequence had an impact because Bright, who led the nation in  
total offense the two previous years, was one of six blacks playing 
for Drake in Stillwater, Okla., on that October day in 1951. 
Oklahoma A&AMP;M, now Oklahoma State, had none. 
</P>
<P>
	In those days, blacks weren't welcome in many areas. In  
Stillwater, Drake's black players were not allowed to stay in the 
university's student union along with the whites. They had to sleep 
elsewhere the night before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Drake's fullback, Gene Macomber, recalls in the documentary the  
atmosphere at A&AMP;M. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember the day before the game on campus words to the  
effect that the black guy would not finish the game,'' Macomber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another compelling angle to the photos was that Bright was  
attacked on the first play. Had it happened much later, Ultang and 
Robinson never would have caught it on film. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology at the time did not allow photographers to transmit  
from the stadium. They shot for about 10 minutes, then hopped in 
Ultang's single-engine plane and flew back to Des Moines to develop 
their film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we were just in the right place at the right time,''  
Ultang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back at the paper, unsure of what they had, Ultang checked a  
negative and could clearly make out Smith's forearm striking Bright 
in the jaw. Ultang tells in the documentary of showing the frame to 
his editor, whose response was, ``What else have you got?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turns out they had a lot. The six-frame sequence shows Bright  
handing off to Macomber on a sweep to the left and then Smith 
making a beeline for Bright, who is standing near the 30-yard line 
watching the play. In frame No. 5, Smith is starting to bring his 
right arm around and in No. 6, both his feet have left the ground 
as his forearm crashes into Bright's jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos ran across the top of the Sunday Register. Only then  
did Coldiron and his teammates realize exactly what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played with black athletes all my life,'' said Coldiron, who  
lives in West Des Moines. ``I didn't think anybody could be that 
vicious and do the type of hit he did on Johnny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drake historian Paul Morrison, then the athletic department's  
business manager, watched the game from the press box and remembers 
turning to Register writer Maury White after the play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made the comment, `Boy, they got John,''' Morrison said.  
``Of course, when we got home and saw the next day's paper, it was 
picture perfect. But there was no doubt in our minds, mine's and 
Maury's, that they had gone after John. 
</P>
<P>
	``The funny thing is, he had played down there two years earlier  
and as far as I know, there was nothing out of line,'' Morrison 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazingly, Bright stayed in the game for a few more plays and  
even threw a 61-yard touchdown pass before being helped off the 
field after tacklers swarmed over him on a run. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, his jaw wired shut, Bright returned to run and  
pass for 204 yards in a 35-20 victory over Great Lakes Naval 
Training Station. It was Bright's final college game. He later 
played 13 years in the Canadian Football League and died in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	The photos and the fact the Missouri Valley Conference never  
punished Smith caused such a stir that Drake dropped out of the 
league for several years. Not long after that, the NCAA made face 
masks mandatory on helmets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our fans just got so upset with the conference for not taking  
any official action that we felt we had to do something to satisfy 
them,'' Morrison said. ``Bradley dropped out in sympathy with us. A 
lot of people forget that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison and Coldiron both said Bright left himself vulnerable  
because he had a habit of standing and watching a play unfold 
instead of carrying out his fake. Had Bright been faking, Morrison 
said, Smith might not have had such a clear shot at him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stood, Smith delivered his blow and Ultang and Robinson  
captured it for all to see.

	Consumer Prices Unchanged in June  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices were unchanged in June for the  
second straight month, the best showing on inflation in 13 years, 
the Labor Department said today. Energy costs dropped sharply and 
food prices held steady. The last time the Consumer Price Index was 
flat for two straight months was in 1986, when for three 
consecutive months the CPI actually fell. In other economic news, 
the Commerce Department said business inventories rose 0.3 percent 
in May. The Labor Department said new claims for jobless benefits 
rose sharply last week to 310,000, the highest level in a month. 
That was up 11,000 from the previous week.

	EPA Retracts Hewlett-Packard Deal  
</P>
<P>
	CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency has  
withdrawn a settlement with Hewlett-Packard Co. over inkjet printer 
chemicals. The Corvallis Gazette-Times reported that the deal was 
nixed partly because the world's second-largest computer maker 
refused to permit an audit of its records. Sylvia Lowrance, an EPA 
enforcement adminstrator, said the order had to be revised because 
of issues raised by an agency board reviewing the settlement and 
new concerns that have come to the agency's attention. A 
Hewlett-Packard spokeswoman said the deal was withdrawn because the 
two sides simply failed to agree on details for a government audit 
of the company's chemical records at its U.S. manufacturing plants. 
Hewlett-Packard shares were at 113, down 4 9/16.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- BP Amoco PLC announced a major oil discovery in  
the Gulf of Mexico today and also said it plans to shed $10 billion 
in underperforming assets over the next three years. And while the 
company aims to boost capital spending by $26 billion by 2001, it 
also said it would slash expenses by 20 percent over the same 
period. BP Amoco also plans to eliminate an additional 3,000 jobs 
and to shift its emphasis increasingly toward exploration and 
production and away from less profitable refinery and 
petrochemicals operations. The company's new offshore discoveries 
include the Crazy Horse prospect located in 6,000 feet of water 125 
miles southeast of New Orleans. It has estimated recoverable 
reserves of 1 billion barrels. BP Amoco has a 75 percent stake in 
the site, with Mobil holding the remaining 25 percent. BP Amoco 
shares were at 121 1/2, up 3.

	Coca-Cola Earnings Drop 21 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported its second-quarter  
earnings fell 21 percent as lingering economic problems and the 
discovery of contaminated Coke products in Europe depressed the 
soft drink maker's sales. The earnings report, which met Wall 
Street's expectations, closed out a difficult quarter for Coke. But 
analysts noted that the company nonetheless made nearly $1 billion 
in the three months ending June 30 and said the Coke brand is still 
a world power. Net income for the three months ended June 30 was 
$942 million or 38 cents per diluted share, down from $1.19 billion 
or 48 cents per share a year earlier. Net revenues for the quarter 
were up 4 percent, from $5.15 billion a year ago to $5.38 billion 
this year. Coca-Cola shares were at 64, up 2 1/8.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co., its production problems apparently

over last year and well above analysts' estimates. For the quarter 
ended June 30, the aerospace company had net earnings of $701 
million or 75 cents a share, compared with profits of $258 million 
or 26 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues rose 13 percent, from 
$13.39 billion to $15.13 billion. Boeing shares were at 46 3/4, down 
7/8.

million, or 47 cents per share, in its second quarter. The results 
did not include a $4 million pre-tax charge for expenses related to 
staff reductions at The Boston Globe. Revenues for the quarter rose

which alleged American Eagle copied Abercrombie's image and 
business practices to boost sales. Judge John D. Holschuh of the 
U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, ruled late yesterday that 
forbidding ``other clothing retailers from adopting similar methods 
of advertising would be unduly anticompetitive.'' Abercrombie

	Functions of PC Put on Single Chip  
</P>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- National Semiconductor Corp. today  
unveiled a new computer chip that puts most of the functions of a 
PC on a single chip, a move that will bring more power and 
functionality to small information devices. The new Geode SC1400 
chip will do the work of what would normally require six different 
chips, company spokeswoman Linda Ashmore said. National 
Semiconductor is targeting the chip for use in ``information 
appliances'' such as television set-top boxes, hand-held 
information devices such as the Palm Pilot, and, eventually, car 
navigation systems.

	NextCard Sues Providian Over Web Ad  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Web-based credit company NextCard sued  
credit giant Providian for copyright infringement in a case that 
could set a precedent for how the law applies to Internet 
advertising. In the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in 
San Francisco, NextCard accused Providian of copying a Web banner 
ad that features a descending thermometer to represent falling 
interest rates. NextCard said the ad is its most effective, with 
about 680,000 Web users clicking on it. ``There are no proprietary 
rights in banner ads,'' said Providian spokesman Marc Loewenthal. 
``They are attention-getting devices that do not reflect any 
original work of authorship.''

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An airline pilot who is feeling  
estranged from a wife he finds too religious suddenly has more than 
100 passengers disappear from his plane, leaving behind their 
clothes, glasses and jewelry. Rayford Steele learns later that 
millions of people around the world have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	Had his wife been right when she warned him Judgment Day was  
coming? 
</P>
<P>
	So begins ``Left Behind,'' the first in a series of apocalyptic  
novels about what happens to those bypassed by the Rapture, when 
true Christians ascend to heaven and those left behind must find 
salvation before Armageddon. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined sales of the six books by Jerry Jenkins and Tim LaHaye  
have topped 7.4 million. ``Apollyon,'' the latest in the series, 
has been on The New York Times fiction best-seller list for months. 
It is the first Christian fiction book to crack a secular 
best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
	The success of the series is indicative of the booming market  
for romance, mystery, historical fiction, juvenile novels and even 
science fiction books with a spiritual bent. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Gessner, chief executive officer of Word Publishing in  
Nashville, said the phenomenon is similar to what has occurred with 
Christian music. 
</P>
<P>
	``Years ago, Christian music meant gospel music. Today's  
Christian market is very different. You can get country, rap, R&AMP;B. 
For every kind of music found in the general culture, there is now 
a parallel in Christian music,'' Gessner said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are no figures on sales of Christian fiction,  
Phyllis Tickle, a contributing religion editor at Publishers 
Weekly, said book distributors have posted huge increases in sales 
of religious books. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram Book Group, the largest book distributor in the country,  
has seen a 500 percent increase in such sales since 1994, Tickle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since they're the largest, it's a bellwether,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	As sales have increased, publishers have devoted more time and  
money to Christian fiction. Word plans to spend $500,000 marketing 
``The Visitation,'' a thriller by Frank Peretti released in May. 
The initial printing is 600,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is about Travis Jordan, a burned-out former pastor  
struggling with doubts and disillusionment about his faith, his 
life and the death of his wife when a Messianic figure arrives in 
town to preach and heal. 
</P>
<P>
	Peretti, a former Pentecostal minister, said the marketing  
support for his new book is a far cry from that in 1986 for his 
first book, ``This Present Darkness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a leper,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, editors at Good News Crossways decided to take a  
chance and published it with almost no promotion. It went on to 
sell more than 2 million copies and is regarded by many as the book 
that proved there was a market for Christian fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Present Darkness'' is the story of a small-town newspaper  
editor who, with the help of a fundamentalist minister and 
invisible angels, battles an occult conspiracy led by a woman 
psychology professor and a legion of demons. 
</P>
<P>
	Peretti has written five adult novels and eight children's books  
that have sold a combined 8 million copies. His books have been 
compared with Stephen King's, but he said there is a major 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my books, God and angels are involved in the resolution,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peretti thinks Christian fiction has matured over the years,  
helping sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old way of writing was fairy tale. The characters were  
ideal, Joe Christian always had an answer for everything. ... Just 
pray and Jesus will solve all your problems,'' Peretti said. 
``That's why nobody read it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he said, while Christian books still generally end happily,  
there are struggles within them and bad things sometimes happen to 
good people. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Ross, president and CEO of the Evangelical Christian  
Publishers Association, said prior to Peretti, the only publisher 
with much success in the Christian fiction genre was Bethany House 
with the romances of author Janette Oke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since evangelical houses didn't see much market or demand for  
fiction, they did a poor job of producing fiction. It was pretty 
insipid,'' said Ross, whose association's 222 members include 
virtually all the Christian publishers in the United States and 
some in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Association members now project an 8 percent annual sales growth  
-- double what the American Association of Publishers projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Darren Sherkat, a Vanderbilt University professor of sociology  
who studies conservative Protestant culture, said the audience for 
Christian fiction always was there, but mainstream publishers 
decided decades ago that religion was taboo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was partly a phobia of being considered anti-Semitic that  
drove Christianity out of the marketplace,'' Sherkat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Andrew Greeley spurred some of the change in thinking  
in the 1970s and 1980s with books like ``Cardinal Sins'' about 
priests doing bad things. While some dismiss Greeley's books as 
potboilers, Sherkat said they helped show religious books could 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``Religion is an important and central issue in people's lives.  
Even if you are not evangelical, you can't identify with fiction 
story lines that have no religion, where nobody prays, nobody goes 
to church,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ETIENNE, France (AP) -- With the main contenders relaxing  
tired muscles after two days in the Alps, Belgian champion Ludo 
Dierckxsens won the 11th stage of the Tour de France on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall standings remained virtually unchanged with American  
Lance Armstrong retaining his comfortable lead at 7 minutes and 47 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Armstrong doesn't crack, the rest of us will simply be  
playing for podium places in Paris,'' said Richard Virenque of 
France, who finished sixth in Wednesday's 10th stage in the Alps.

	``This time it was different.''  
</P>
<P>
	In second place was Dmitri Konyshev of Russia, 1 minute 27  
seconds behind. He narrowly edged Kazakstan's Alexandre Vinokourov. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium had two high finishes, with Rik Verbrugghe coming in

<P>
	A group of seven riders broke away after about 62 miles and led  
for the whole race.

	Armstrong's U.S. Postal team was happy to lead the pack for much  
of the race to control the only riders likely to eat into 
Armstrong's lead.

<P>
	There was one notable climb, the 3,963-foot Col de la Croix de  
Chaubouret, before a descent into St. Etienne.

<P>
	On Wednesday, Virenque summed up the mood of many Tour de France  
riders after watching Armstrong extend his already commanding 
overall lead.

	Wednesday's race was won by Italy's Giuseppe Guerini, who  
recovered from a last-minute crash with a spectator who had jumped 
into his path to take a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Tour officials said Thursday that the spectator visited  
Guerini's hotel to offer his apologies. The two then shook hands, 
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Edwards Wins Salamanca Triple Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALAMANCA, Spain (AP) -- Four years after setting a world  
triple-jump record, Britain's Jonathan Edwards returned to Spain to 
score another impressive triumph in the Salamanca Grand Prix track 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
	With a jump of 58 feet, 1 1/4 inches, Edwards beat Cuba's Yoelbi  
Quesada by a whopping 17 1/4 inches on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago in this meet, Edwards set a world record of 59  
feet and pushed it to 60- 1/4 later the same year at Goteborg, 
Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he didn't threaten his own mark, he dominated the field  
Thursday night, leaving Quesada in arrears at 56-8. 
</P>
<P>
	With the unexplained absence of Olympic silver medalist James  
Beckford of Jamaica, Spain's Yago Lamela won the long jump at 27-2. 
Portugal's Carlos Calado was second at 26-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamela said competing without Beckford made him feel ``alone and  
without rivals,'' and put a break on the ``competitiveness needed 
for great jumps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Tatiana Grigorieva won the women's pole vault at  
14-9, then failed on two attempts to set a world-record 15-1 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain's Pedro Pablo Nolet won the men's 100 meters in a photo  
finish over countryman Venancio Jose Murcia, both in 10.26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Doug Turner took the men's 200 meters in 20.56  
seconds, .39 seconds faster than Spaniard Jordi Mayoral. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosa Akhigb of Nigeria won the women's 100 in 11.21 seconds, .16  
seconds faster than Australia's Knee Bone. The Australian won the 
200 in 22.90.

<HEADLINE> Gore Fund-raiser Targets Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In what was billed as the capital's first  
presidential fund-raiser aimed at gays and lesbians, Tipper Gore 
scooped up more than $150,000 for her husband's campaign Thursday 
and promised contributors he would ``fight for your dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All people, regardless of sexual orientation, should be able  
to be a part of a loving relationship in a family without fear of 
recrimination or discrimination,'' Mrs. Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gore administration, she pledged, would ``stand against forces  
of hatred.'' Her husband, Vice President Al Gore, ``will fight for 
your dreams. He will fight for OUR dreams,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore did not get into specifics of the gay policy agenda.  
</P>
<P>
	The wife of the vice president unflappably dealt with three AIDS  
demonstrators who, one by one, tried to disrupt her appearance 
among some 400 in a small hotel ballroom with cries of ``Gore's 
greed kills!'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters, escorted out by Secret Service agents, accused  
Al Gore of siding with pharmaceutical companies in an international 
trade dispute and trying to block South Africa's access to cheap, 
generic AIDS drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought you might be here tonight,'' Mrs. Gore said.  
``That's certainly something we all have a great deal of 
appreciation for -- free speech and a passion about issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the hotel, nine activists affiliated with the group  
called ACT-UP carried signs calling Al Gore a ``drug company 
puppet'' and mocking his campaign as ``Apartheid 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights  
Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian political group, 
attended the reception as a ``gold level'' contributor to ``Gays 
and Lesbians for Gore.'' But he said he group's presidential 
endorsements were still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Solid and deep'' is how Birch described the vice president's  
record on matters important to the gay community. Former New Jersey 
Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's only rival for the Democratic nomination, 
has voted the right way on gay issues but ``is not a stand-out,'' 
Birch said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Presidential Pay Raise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress are well on their way to a  
$4,600 pay raise in January, while the next president may find 
himself or herself earning twice what President Clinton does. 
</P>
<P>
	With virtually no debate and using an arcane procedure, the  
House quietly voted 276-147 Thursday to give representatives and 
senators a 3.4 percent pay boost to $141,300. Now that neither the 
House nor Senate have voted to block the otherwise automatic annual 
increase, it seems virtually certain to take effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
	With far more openness, the House then voted to double the next  
president's salary to $400,000 in 2001. The key vote was a 334-82 
roll call killing a conservative amendment to a Treasury Department 
spending bill that would have blocked the presidential pay boost. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be the chief executive's first pay raise since the old  
$100,000 salary was doubled in 1969. But the Senate's Treasury 
bill, approved July 1, leaves the current $200,000 salary intact, 
leaving questions about what the final House-Senate Treasury bill 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the $28 billion Treasury bill by the slimmest  
of margins, 210-209. Most Democrats opposed it, citing spending 
cuts in the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies. GOP 
opposition was largely due to language requiring most federal 
employees' health plans to cover prescription contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	In these flush economic times, lawmakers said hardly a word  
about the congressional pay raise before voting for it. That was a 
stark contrast to years past, when the congressional pay question 
often provoked heated battles. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ken Lucas, D-Ky., said in an interview that he opposed the  
pay boost because back home, ``we have so many folks having trouble 
getting by.'' But neither he nor any House member spent any time 
discussing their reasoning on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came on a procedural motion governing the debate rules  
for the Treasury bill -- which both parties' leaders had signaled 
would, in effect, be the vote on whether to allow the raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1989 law, lawmakers get an annual raise unless they vote  
to deny it, a mechanism that has at times let them avoid taking 
politically risky votes. A formula in the law links the increase to 
the boost federal workers will receive, which President Clinton has 
proposed to be 4.4 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on legislators' salaries underlined the favorable  
political climate for the first raise since January 1998 and the 
second since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Most members of Congress earn $136,700 annually, but leaders get  
more, with House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., earning a top of 
$175,400. The increase will be 3.4 percent -- by law rounded to the 
nearest $100 -- pushing most lawmakers to $141,300 and Hastert to 
$181,400. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential volatility of the issue was reflected by the votes  
of the House's most vulnerable blocks of members. The 42 freshmen 
voted 26-15 against the raise, and one did not vote. And the 44 
lawmakers elected by margins of 10 percent or less last November 
voted ``no'' by 30-13, and one didn't vote. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid a replay of past accusations that lawmakers gave  
themselves a raise in the dark of night, Hastert and House Minority 
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., agreed to the roll-call vote. Both men 
voted for the boost, and party leaders had met repeatedly to make 
sure there would be broad bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury bill is the traditional vehicle for blocking the  
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts have ruled that increases under the 1989 law do  
not violate the 27th constitutional amendment, which requires 
congressional pay raises to take effect after the next election, 
because they are triggered by a law enacted several elections ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, and Mark Sanford, R-S.C., tried to  
kill the increase in the president's pay, arguing that presidents 
are already paid enough and that their perks, like free, sumptuous 
housing and travel are worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't elect a king,'' Sanford said.  
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of an increase said presidential pay has been the  
same since it was doubled in 1969. And they said if George 
Washington's $25,000 annual salary was adjusted for inflation, it 
would now be $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the liberal Congressional Accountability Project,  
congressional salaries began at $6 a day in session in 1789. They 
hit $10,000 annually in 1925, shrank to $8,500 during the 
Depression, and reached $30,000 in 1965. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

	The Treasury bill is H.R. 2490.

<HEADLINE> New Element on Periodic Table </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Russian physicists have created a new, super-heavy element that  
lasted a surprisingly long 30 seconds before disintegrating, 
according to a report in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Using an atom smasher to bombard plutonium with calcium ions,  
the physicists created an element whose atomic number is 114, which 
refers to the number of protons in its nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest addition to the periodic table has yet to be named.  
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-four elements exist in nature. Scientists have spent 60  
years creating elements in the lab, registering 21 so far. But some 
of the more recent elements were so unstable that they 
disintegrated in milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, physicists have theorized the existence of  
super-heavy manmade elements with a much longer life. These 
elements would make up an ``island of stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear  
Research in Dubna, Russia, reported creating two atoms of element 
114 that lasted for as long as 30 seconds before flickering out. 
This, they say, is proof the island exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery, and more recent creations of even heavier  
elements, have no practical applications as far as today's 
scientists know. 
</P>
<P>
	But for academics, it's thrilling. The study of super-heavies  
could shed light on supernovas and origins of the universe. And 
chemists are interested in how they bond with compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The new manmade elements are numbered according to how many  
protons are in their nuclei, not by their order of discovery. 
Numbers 95 through 112 were created between 1944 and 1996. In the 
past year, scientists have created not just 114, but also 116 and 
118. The ones in between have not yet been created. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, scientists thought one isotope, or version, of  
element 114 -- with 114 protons and 184 neutrons -- would be very 
stable because its nucleus would have a full complement of neutrons 
and protons. No more could be squeezed inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Late last year, the Dubna scientists made an isotope of element  
114 with 175 neutrons. In March, the lab created another 114 
isotope, but it had only 173 neutrons and was therefore less stable 
than the first one they created. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, another major lab trying to create elements, Lawrence  
Berkeley National Laboratory in California, forged the heaviest 
element yet, 118, and when it decayed, it morphed into element 116, 
then an isotope of 114 with even fewer neutrons than Dubna's. It 
lasted for milliseconds. 
</P>
<P>
	These three types of 114 are just off the ``island of  
stability,'' scientists say, because they are all short of the 184 
neutrons needed. But physicists say they are in ``shallow water,'' 
and that's proof enough. 
</P>
<P>
	If they can create a 114 isotope with 184 neutrons, they would  
reach real stability: perhaps a life measured in years. 
</P>
<P>
	One physicist, Albert Ghiorso of Lawrence Berkeley, said he is  
skeptical the Russians really did create such an element. He said 
that with their setup, it is too difficult to pinpoint a single 
atom among all the collision byproducts. 
</P>
<P>
	But Neil Rowley, of the Institute for Subatomic Research in  
France, is convinced the Dubna observations are real. ``Everything 
behaves the way it ought to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Beukeboom Calls It Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom said  
Thursday he will be unable to resume his NHL career because of a 
series of concussions last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom, 34, originally was injured Nov. 19 at Los Angeles  
when he was hit by Matt Johnson. He was hurt again in December and 
his season ended with another concussion on Feb. 12 against 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been under the care of doctors since then.  
</P>
<P>
	``Since the latest episode, from day one I've been on notice  
that it was quite possible I might not be able to play again,'' 
said Beukeboom, who played on four Stanley Cup championship teams, 
three with Edmonton and one with New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that is most glaring, the thing that makes it easy  
is that the Feb. 12 knock was quite slight, something you see most 
every night in the NHL,'' Beukeboom said. ``My situation over five 
months, the symptoms have not subsided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few hours later, the Rangers signed forward Tim Taylor,  
who played for the Boston Bruins last season. He had four goals and 
seven assists in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom said he suffers from headaches and loses concentration  
in conversations. He has been unable to work out or do anything 
physical since the February injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never an easy decision to walk away, but it's easier to  
walk away because of medical problems,'' he said. ``I believe 
physically I could still compete. I know medically the risk I would 
put my family in. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a medical retirement. I'm not able to come back and  
compete in the NHL the way I'd love to. Everything in the game 
comes to your health. My body is healthy. My mind is not healthy 
right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beukeboom played in 45 games with nine assists and 60 penalty  
minutes last season. In 804 NHL games, he scored 30 goals with 129 
assists and 1,890 penalty minutes.

<HEADLINE> Affair Could Trigger Miami Retrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- A former city commissioner convicted of voter fraud  
is entitled to be retried if his lawyer acted unethically by having 
an affair with the defendant's wife, a state court of appeals 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel said Wednesday that a hearing should be  
held to determine whether a sexual relationship developed between 
Humberto Hernandez's lawyer, Jose Quinon, and Hernandez's wife, 
Esther. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hernandez claimed she had an affair with Quinon in a  
newspaper interview two months after her husband's conviction, and 
she and Quinon had been seen in public, sharing a kiss in a bar. 
State prosecutors have said the Hernandezes and Quinon may have 
made up the story of the affair and staged the public display of 
affection as a legal maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation of an affair prompted U.S. District Judge Joan  
Lenard to remove Quinon from the case and temporarily freeze the 
lawyer's accounts. Quinon faces a bar inquiry into his conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez was sentenced to nearly a year in jail after being  
convicted last year of a misdemeanor count of accessory after the 
fact to a vote fraud scheme that led to the reversal of the 1997 
Miami mayoral elections. He is serving a separate four-year federal 
prison term on bank fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Weiner, who now represents Hernandez, called a hearing  
into the purported affair ``crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to be embarrassing to everyone,'' he said.  
``It could really get out of hand.''

<HEADLINE> Report Criticizes Justice Department </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department investigation of  
campaign finance abuses was delayed but ultimately not impaired by 
mishandling of FBI intelligence on possible Chinese efforts to 
influence U.S. politics, Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	At her weekly news conference, Reno praised a report by  
Justice's inspector general, Michael Bromwich, that criticized 
department officials for showing Congress raw, uncorroborated 
intelligence but also took FBI counterspies to task for earlier 
keeping the same data from campaign finance investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was reading the 569-page top secret report ``in  
detail now, and I might quibble about some things, but I think it 
was a good, constructive report.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing a brief summary Wednesday, Bromwich found that at  
first raw data on possible Chinese attempts to influence U.S. 
politics was held too closely by the FBI for fear of revealing how 
it was obtained but later the same data was circulated too widely 
to avoid congressional criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	By rushing to meet demands from the Republican-controlled  
Congress for information about campaign finance abuses, Justice 
officials abandoned long-held standards and provided raw 
intelligence ``information of dubious quality,'' Bromwich 
concluded. He said this could endanger the investigation and the 
rights of those under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He found ``no improper intent to conceal information'' from the  
department, Congress or the National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime something is delayed, you can call that bungling. But  
... the (campaign finance) investigation itself was not impaired in 
the end,'' Reno said. ``It is important for all of us, not just the 
FBI, to make sure ... the information ... is furnished in a manner 
that will be helpful in a criminal investigation while at the same 
time protecting sources and methods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The department obtained a guilty plea from businessman Johnny  
Chung, who claims he was given $300,000 by China's military 
intelligence chief for President Clinton's 1996 re-election. 
Investigators say Chung gave only $20,000 of this to the Democratic 
Party and spent the rest on himself. They haven't corroborated who 
gave the money to Chung; China has denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI welcomed many of Bromwich's suggestions and said it has  
begun more regular meetings with other agencies and stepped up 
production of ``finished'' analyses of raw intelligence data. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno ordered Bromwich's investigation after an embarrassing  
incident on Sept. 11, 1997, before the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee. The CIA told the committee about two pieces of Chinese 
intelligence from the FBI, which FBI Director Louis Freeh said he 
had not heard until the CIA testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said that data related to whether California  
businessman Ted Sioeng acted on behalf of China in donating 
$250,000 to the Democratic National Committee and $50,000 to a 
Republican think tank. Sioeng's attorney denied the Chinese 
directed or funded the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	These two items and other FBI China intelligence actually had  
reached Freeh and Reno, but was haphazardly buried in various 
reports so ``senior officials were unaware that they had ever 
received it,'' Bromwich wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	By late 1997, all of it was given to four congressional  
committees, campaign finance investigators and the National 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither the department nor the Congress is well-served by  
replacing the careful screening of information with a headlong dash 
to supply information that results in the collapse of standards of 
quality and the provision of evidence of dubious quality,'' 
Bromwich wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, until Reno stepped in, FBI counterspies insisted on  
giving campaign finance investigators paraphrases of their data 
rather than direct access to the intelligence. Bromwich said the 
FBI counterspies ``did not strike an appropriate balance between 
(their) needs and those of the (campaign finance) task force and 
main Justice.''

<HEADLINE> White House Plays Down Bomb Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration sought to minimize  
the importance of China's announcement Thursday that it had built a 
neutron bomb, noting that intelligence reports for years have shown 
that Beijing has tested such a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	But in light of heightened tensions between China and Taiwan and  
the West, officials took care to note that the U.S. nuclear arsenal 
is vastly superior to China's. 
</P>
<P>
	``China, we know, has less than two dozen long-range nuclear  
weapons. The United States has over 6,000,'' said White House press 
secretary Joe Lockhart. ``We have no doubt that our nuclear 
deterrent is strong enough to protect our national interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through a spokeswoman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of  
the Senate Intelligence Committee, said, ``The timing of China's 
announcement could be perceived as saber rattling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., senior Democrat on the committee,  
called China's announcement ``quite serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an escalation of the proliferation problem,'' Kerrey  
said. ``They were starting to move in the right direction. It means 
they are now moving in the wrong direction. This is not in the 
world's best interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration declined to draw connections between  
the rare public announcement of China's weapons capabilities and 
Beijing's recent threat to attack Taiwan over indications that the 
island might be moving toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't see the connection on Taiwan,'' said State Department  
spokesman James Rubin, who said U.S. officials ``haven't regarded 
... as helpful'' the recent exchange between Beijing and Taipei 
over the status of Taiwan.

	``I don't think it's been as dramatic as other rhetorical  
episodes in the past, but it is significant,'' Rubin said. ``We 
don't think it's beneficial for these kind of statements to be made 
or the reactions to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement about the neutron bomb came in reaction to a  
congressional investigation led by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., 
into allegations the Chinese stole sensitive nuclear secrets from 
U.S. research labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said that from a security  
standpoint, whether China developed its own neutron bomb instead of 
stealing the technology from U.S. labs was a minor issue. He said 
the United States is more concerned about other nations gaining 
nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, returning from a European tour, said that until Congress  
completes its examination of a legislative report into losses of 
military technology to China it is premature to conclude how China 
gained its nuclear knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find it to be a particularly fruitful discussion as to  
whether they claim to have this capability internally or have 
acquired it elsewhere,'' Cohen said. ``The fact that's of concern 
to all of us is that there seems to be a proliferation of nuclear 
technology to a number of countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``China has had a nuclear capability for some time,'' he added.  
``Our concern has been that other countries not acquire it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neutron bombs are meant to produce a smaller blast than  
conventional nuclear weapons but more intense radiation, limiting 
physical damage while killing large numbers of people.

<HEADLINE>  3 Killed in Stadium Crane Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers postponed their  
game tonight in a gesture of respect to three workers who died when 
a huge crane collapsed while lifting part of the roof for the 
team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, federal and local officials gathered at Miller Field  
this morning to begin their investigation. Traffic was tangled on 
the highway surrounding the stadium as curious motorists slowed to 
look at the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other workers were injured Wednesday afternoon when the  
crane broke in half as it handled the 400-ton load. It crashed into 
the partially completed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 567-foot crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece  
of Miller Park's $400 million retractable roof into place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off,'' said Gary Craig, who lives  
nearby. ``When I went outside I looked around and saw the 
helicopters hovering over the stadium, and I could see that the 
crane was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of thee victims were not released. Only one of the  
injured -- the 64-year-old crane operator who fell up to 30 feet -- 
remained hospitalized today. He was listed in stable condition with 
a broken hip and broken shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers used dogs and searchlights to search the rubble for any  
other victims until late Wednesday, but none were found, Deputy 
Fire Chief Gerald Frank said. No one known to be at the site was 
unaccounted for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident has not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph at the time the crane fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who play in adjacent Milwaukee County Stadium and  
will move to Miller Park, postponed their scheduled game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a game, baseball,'' Mayor John Norquist said. ``What  
happened today was death, and that's horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fleming, a mayoral spokesman, said the accident caused  
significant damage to the 43,000-seat stadium, scheduled to open 
next season. He said he did not know how long it would set the 
project back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, built by Neil F. Lampson Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., is  
the largest in North America and one of four of its size in the 
world, a designer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several Miller Park workers were injured when a  
steel girder being lowered into position collided with an aerial 
basket. On May 10, a worker was hospitalized for a week after 
falling 60 feet from the roof.

<HEADLINE> Lead Paint Measures Show Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maurci Jackson's daughter was just 15 months  
old when she ate a piece of lead-based paint. Now 10, Maurissa 
Jackson is hyperactive and has problems paying attention. But her 
mother considers herself fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
	At least Maurissa told her immediately that she had eaten the  
paint so her mother could get her to a doctor, the Chicago woman 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of parents across the country are not aware when their  
children are exposed to lead poisoning and are unable to save them 
from serious harm, including diminished intelligence, hearing loss 
and, in extreme cases, death. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno called lead paint ``one of the  
biggest environmental threats facing children today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo,  
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner and 
District of Columbia Mayor Anthony Williams announced results 
Thursday from stepped-up enforcement measures aimed at protecting 
children from lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1992 Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act  
requires landlords to notify new tenants or buyers if an apartment 
or house could cause lead poisoning. The Department of Justice, HUD 
and EPA began joint enforcement of the law last August and started 
with the district, Los Angeles and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Court actions totaling more than $1 million have been filed  
against landlords across the country violating the law, Reno said. 
Four companies owning real estate in the district have agreed to 
pay penalties, and HUD has initiated 45 cases against companies in 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can eradicate this danger to our children,'' Reno said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the district, Chris Leonard, a spokesman with ACORN, the  
Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, said the 
legislation does not go far enough. He said landlords should be 
required to make the apartments safe from lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuomo called lead poisoning ``a silent enemy'' that leaves as  
many as 890,000 children per year with elevated levels of lead in 
their blood. Most of those children are from low-income families 
living in housing built before 1978, when lead-based paint was 
banned, according to information from HUD. 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare for a child to eat a piece of chipped paint, Cuomo  
said. Usually, the lead rubs off the walls when windows or doors 
are opened or closed and enters the air or falls on the floor in 
the form of dust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The child crawls on the floor, gets dust on his hands, eats a  
cookie and ingests the lead,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Railway Suspect Piques Law Queries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- More than 60 police agencies around the country  
have contacted the FBI with inquiries about unsolved cases they 
believe might be the work of the suspected railway killer, the FBI 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these state and local agencies were interested in  
checking more than one case for possible links to Angel Maturino 
Resendez and were sending their data to the railway killer task 
force in Houston for further investigation, FBI spokeswoman Angela 
Bell said in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not immediately have a count of the total number of  
cases involved. High-profile arrests typically generate a large 
volume of calls about unsolved crimes in other places, but very 
often no link is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Maturino Resendez has not confessed to any killings.  
But the 39-year-old Mexican drifter seemed resigned Wednesday after 
Harris County prosecutors described a bloody killing during a bail 
hearing on a burglary charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can all this be done very quickly so I can say I'm guilty?''  
Maturino Resendez asked District Judge William Harmon, who told him 
no plea could be taken yet and denied bond. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Maturino Resendez was specifically  
addressing the burglary charge or the more serious allegations 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Wednesday, the man who also went by the alias Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez had been charged with two slayings in Illinois and 
one in Kentucky. He was suspected of five Texas killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the hearing, however, the total reached nine when  
a sixth killing in Texas was linked to him. Cass County prosecutors 
charged him with the Oct. 2 robbery-slaying of 87-year-old Leafie 
Mason, bludgeoned in her Hughes Springs home, and said they would 
seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Until that charge was filed, the only count against him in Texas  
was burglary at the scene where Dr. Claudia Benton, 39, was killed 
Dec. 17 in the Houston enclave of West University Place. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision of whether to charge Maturino Resendez with capital  
murder in Ms. Benton's death, likely to be the first to be brought 
to trial, rests with Harris County District Attorney Johnny Holmes, 
whose county has notched the most death-penalty convictions in 
Texas. Prosecutors said DNA evidence might link him to her slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mason, who lived most of her life within 50 yards of a  
Kansas City-Southern rail line that bisects the town of 2,000, was 
beaten to death with her antique iron by someone who entered her 
home through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	Like several other victims Maturino Resendez is suspected of  
killing, her body and that of Ms. Benton were covered by blankets. 
A police crime lab said a palm print found on Ms. Mason's window 
matched that of the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez surrendered to the Texas Rangers after  
crossing the border from Mexico into El Paso on Tuesday. The 
surrender followed a six-week manhunt that made him one of the most 
wanted fugitives in America, one of the FBI's 10 Most Wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the agencies investigating Maturino Resendez seem eager  
to prosecute the man who inspired fear nationwide in people who 
live near railroad tracks -- the location of most victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care if he gets the death penalty seven times,'' said  
Lexington, Ky., police Sgt. Mark Barnard. ``I want him in 
Kentucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has executed more people -- 180 -- than any other state  
since the death penalty was declared constitutional in 1976. It 
makes it all the more unclear why the elusive Maturino Resendez 
chose to cross the border and give up. Mexico, which has no capital 
punishment, has refused to return suspects to countries where they 
may face execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have speculated that the suspect feared bounty  
hunters on his trail. A $125,000 reward had been offered for his 
capture, which family members who negotiated his surrender might 
try to claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Manuela Maturino, who brokered her brother's surrender, has been  
traumatized by the ordeal, according to the Rev. Troy Robinson, the 
pastor of her church. He said Maturino, a member of the Hope Chapel 
Foursquare Church in Albuquerque for several years, came to him 
last month with a request for prayer concerning her brother's 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a direct answer to prayer... that's been our prayer all  
along. A very peaceful and calm ending,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``She's holding up, but, of course, it's a family  
member who is involved here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendez's family in Ciudad Juarez, El Paso's neighbor  
in Mexico, appeared to have huddled inside the home of the 
suspect's mother. His uncle, from whom he borrowed the alias, spoke 
briefly to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jesus Christ is going to be in charge of him,'' said Rafael  
Resendez-Ramirez. ``We have faith in God and we are praying that 
God saves him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have said they have no idea what motivated the  
killings, which began with the Aug. 29, 1997, slaying of a 
21-year-old college student in Kentucky who was attacked while 
walking with his girlfriend along railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the killings have come since September. The most  
recent were those of a 79-year-old man and his 51-year-old 
daughter, found dead June 15 in Gorham, Ill.

<HEADLINE> Former Flyers Announcer Hart Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Gene Hart, who broadcast Philadelphia hockey  
games over radio and television for 28 years under the nickname 
``Voice of the Flyers,'' died at age 68. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart died late Wednesday afternoon at Our Lady of Lourdes  
Hospital in Camden, said Michelle Chierici, hospital director of 
public relations. He was admitted to the hospital's critical-care 
unit after he became severely dehydrated and developed an infection 
following chemotherapy to treat a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Always ending his broadcast with ``Good night and good hockey,''  
Hart was the play-by-play man for the Flyers from their inaugural 
season in 1967-68 until 1994-95, calling the team's most thrilling 
moments and helping spawn legions of devoted Flyers fans with his 
frenetic style. 
</P>
<P>
	He was best known for his call of the Flyers' Stanley  
Cup-winning 1-0 victory over the Boston Bruins on May 19, 1974, at 
the Spectrum. ``The Flyers win the Stanley Cup! The Flyers win the 
Stanley Cup!'' he exclaimed, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get goose bumps when I think of that call,'' Flyers  
chairman Ed Snider once said. ``It will go down in sports history 
as one of the greatest broadcast moments of all time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart, a public school teacher in New Jersey for 15 years,  
received a part-time salary from the Flyers at the beginning of his 
broadcasting career while he kept his job as an announcer for the 
now-defunct Aquarama. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could say they had 288 tapes and mine was the best,''  
he said. ``But it was really a matter of expediency. I was the 
right guy at the right time in the right place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's broadcasting highlights include six Stanley Cup finals,  
five NHL All-Star games and two NHL-Soviet all-star series. Hart 
was inducted into the Flyers' Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Hockey 
Hall of Fame in 1997, one of 20 broadcasters so honored. 
</P>
<P>
	In later years, the job became increasingly tough for Hart. He  
occasionally had trouble keeping up with the game's fast pace and 
he sometimes misidentified players. At the end of the 1995 season, 
the Flyers relieved Hart of his broadcasting duties and assigned 
him to a community relations post. 
</P>
<P>
	Although disappointed, he took the news gracefully.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be unhappy with 28 years. I've had a dream career,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last two seasons, he called games for the Philadelphia  
Phantoms, the Flyers' American Hockey League affiliate, on cable. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart underwent heart bypass surgery in 1985 and has been on  
kidney dialysis for almost a year due to complications from 
diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were private. A memorial was scheduled for  
1 p.m Sunday at Philadelphia's First Union Center.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Cease Use of Diarrhea Vaccine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The government is recommending that doctors  
temporarily stop giving children a diarrhea vaccine because at 
least 20 infants have developed a bowel obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday  
that RotaShield, the vaccine against rotavirus, has not been 
conclusively linked to bowel obstruction, but early studies show it 
may increase the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The obstruction occurs when one part of the bowel becomes  
enfolded within another. Symptoms include vomiting, bloody stools 
and abdominal pain. Surgery is often needed to clear the blockage 
if it isn't caught early. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC recommended suspending use of the vaccine in all  
children -- including those who have begun the three-dose series -- 
until November so health officials can conclude additional studies. 
Following the CDC's move, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued 
the same recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's enough to make us worry,'' said Dr. Melinda Wharton, head  
of the CDC's child vaccine preventable diseases branch. ``We're 
fortunate that rotavirus is a seasonal disease so we can postpone 
vaccination for a few months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rotavirus, an intestinal infection, is the leading cause of  
severe diarrhea in children under 5 in the United States. Each 
year, an estimated 3 million American children are sickened, 50,000 
are hospitalized, and 20 die. The disease primarily occurs in the 
winter and spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine's manufacturer, Philadelphia-based Wyeth-Ayerst  
Laboratories, said 1 million infants have been vaccinated with 
RotaShield since it received government approval in August. The 
three-dose series is given at ages 2 months, 4 months and 6 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Before its approval by the Food and Drug Administration, five  
cases of the bowel obstruction were reported for every 10,000 
vaccine recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the bowel obstruction was listed as a potential  
adverse reaction on the package insert. The CDC said it is still 
investigating, but based on the early findings so far, it appears 
that the bowel obstruction rate may be higher than expected.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Second-Quarter Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing's second-quarter operating earnings surged  
55 percent as the aerospace company seems to have overcome the 
production problems that hurt it over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months ended June 30, Boeing recorded operating  
income of $793 million, up from $416 million in the year-ago 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings of 56 cents per share easily surpassed forecasts by  
First Call analysts of 48 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are very pleasing results,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs  
with Ragen MacKenzie in Seattle. ``The company is showing continued 
improvements in their commercial operations, solid performance in 
the defense and space areas, and one can definitely say the worst 
of the problems are behind the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing had net earnings of $701 million or 75 cents a share,  
compared with profits of $258 million or 26 cents a share a year 
earlier. Revenues rose 13 percent, from $13.39 billion to $15.13 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	These figures include a one-time gain of $181 million from a  
federal income tax audit settlement covering 1988-1991 and charges 
of $78 million in the year-ago period to reflect the planned 
termination of the MD-11 jetliner program and late delivery costs 
associated with new-generation 737 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The second-quarter results demonstrate growing momentum and  
confidence,'' said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman and chief executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our commercial airplanes group is on plan -- delivering  
airplanes and improving margins every day. Boeing delivered 165 
commercial airplanes this quarter -- on time, and with 17 percent 
fewer employees and a 10 percentage point improvement in overtime 
from the highest levels in 1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing struggled with production line snarls, delayed deliveries  
and the Asian financial crisis during the past two years. It lost 
$178 million in 1997 and had depressed earnings of $1.1 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's Commercial Airplanes division had second-quarter  
operating income of $435 million, compared with a loss of $178 
million a year ago, when it delivered only 137 planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Condit said the improvement was principally due to better cost  
control on the new 737 and 777 jetliner programs, more deliveries, 
and lower research and development spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially key was not having to pay for huge amounts of  
overtime and extra people to get airplanes out the factory door, 
Condit told reporters in a telephone conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pure and simple,'' he said, ``it's the number of hours it  
takes to build an airplane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing is projecting revenues of $58 billion this year and $48  
billion in 2000. Next year's drop is primarily due to fewer orders 
being placed because of Asia's economic slump, Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Boeing had profits of $1.17  
billion or $1.24 a share, compared with net earnings of $308 
million or 31 cents a share in 1998. Revenues rose 12 percent, from 
$26.33 billion to $29.52 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Boeing fell 87 1/2 cents to $46.75 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange on the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs noted, however, that the stock price had risen by about  
$4 a share in the past week in anticipation of the earnings report, 
and is up about 44 percent for the year.

<HEADLINE> Euro Edges Higher Against Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro edged higher against the dollar  
Thursday, bolstered by statements from the president of the 
European Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0219, up  
from $1.0209 late Wednesday. It reclaimed ground for a second day 
after hitting a low of $1.0108 against the U.S. currency during 
trading on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,  
supported the euro in comments following the regular monthly 
meeting of the ECB and hinted at higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank council left its key interest rates unchanged Thursday,  
as widely expected, and no further changes are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether the bank was moving toward a bias in favor of  
tightening monetary policy -- meaning raising rates -- Duisenberg 
said ``you could see a tightening bias slightly creeping in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rising interest rates would make returns more attractive on  
holding assets denominated in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clear potential for a stronger'' euro, Duisenberg also  
said, citing an improving European economy and the central bank's 
anti-inflation stance. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 120.83 Japanese yen in late New  
York trading Thursday, up from 120.59 yen, and rose to 1.5739 Swiss 
francs from 1.5727, and 1.4816 Canadian dollars from 1.4810. The 
British pound rose to $1.5654 from $1.5637. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth 1.9139 German 
marks, down from 1.9152, and 6.4185 French francs, down from 
6.4250.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Farmhands Testify in Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT PIERCE, Fla. (AP) -- Two New York Mets minor leaguers  
testifying in the rape trial of a teammate said they thought the 
girl involved consented to sex with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 18, testified earlier that Vincente Rosario, 21,  
forced her to have sex with him and several others in a motel room 
in Port St. Lucie last year. Three players were convicted of sexual 
battery last October in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant State Attorney Steve Levin, who says Rosario planned  
the attack, called on two players to testify Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruddi De La Cruz, 19, said Rosario called him into the motel  
room, where the girl was naked on the bed with Rosario on one side 
and another player, Natividad Tavarez, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have gone in the room if Rosario hadn't called me  
in,'' De La Cruz said. But he said he thought the girl wanted to 
have sex with him because she never resisted. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was having normal sex with me,'' De La Cruz said. The  
state dropped charges against him in exchange for his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Brea-Tousent, already convicted in the case, testified that  
he received a phone call in his motel room to ``come and see what 
we have here.'' Brea-Tousent told police the caller was Rosario. 
</P>
<P>
	Brea-Tousent testified that went to the room and had sex with  
the girl, but he thought it was consensual because she motioned 
with her hand for him to come to her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She never tried to push me away,'' Brea-Tousent said.  
</P>
<P>
	Brea-Tousent, Tavarez and Milton Gonzalez are serving two-year  
sentences for the crime. All of the players involved are from the 
Dominican Republic and have been suspended by the Mets until the 
case is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosario, a former New York City high school star, signed with  
the Mets in August 1997.

<HEADLINE> TV Appearance Leads to Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A mayoral candidate was arrested on an  
outstanding warrant Thursday night when an officer watching TV 
recognized her from a live interview on the evening news, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorothy Joyner, 57, was arrested on a warrant charging her with  
one count of misdemeanor burglary. Details of the warrant were 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Joyner, a Republican, is one of the candidates in a field of  
25 running for mayor in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. Her 
name appears as Dorothy Jennings in filing papers. On television 
she identified herself as Dorothy Joyner-Jennings. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer who issued the warrant last year happened to be  
watching the 6:30 p.m. news, said police spokeswoman Angelique 
Cook-Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
	He alerted his supervisors and officers were waiting for Ms.  
Joyner when she left the studios of WBFF-TV in Baltimore. Cameras 
captured her leaving the station in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	During her appearance on the ``Newsmaker'' segment, Ms. Joyner  
described herself as a churchgoer with 30 years experience in 
education. She also spoke at length about crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that we need to retrain our police officers. Our  
officers need to steer clear of the abrasiveness they project. 
Instead of abrasiveness, what about courtesy? What about manners?'' 
she asked.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Wraps Up N.Y. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. (AP) -- Gun control? Yes. Patients'  
rights? Yes. Commuter tax? Um. Well. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has established an exploratory  
committee for a likely U.S. Senate campaign, wrapped up the 
suburban phase of her ``listening tour'' on Wednesday by holding 
forums on two of her favorite subjects, gun violence and health 
care reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	She reiterated her support for strict gun control and for  
changing the way health care is administered, but she did not 
always provide direct answers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether she supports repeal of a commuter tax on people  
who work in New York City but don't live there, she said: ``The 
real issue here is the high level of taxation. ... It's a fact. 
They did it. The courts have made their ruling on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commuter tax was repealed by the state Legislature.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is also  
exploring a potential Senate run, opposed the tax repeal, saying 
New York City would lose too much money. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani said Mrs. Clinton's lack of a position on the issue  
``tells me she's not a candidate yet. When she becomes a candidate, 
she'll have to answer the question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a forum in Great Neck at the headquarters of the North  
Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Mrs. Clinton was asked how 
she would help working Americans who can't afford health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will address that issue,'' Mrs. Clinton responded. ``I will  
keep addressing it. I don't know quite what we're going to do about 
it but I think it's unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The questioner, Kathy McIntyre, a self-employed certified public  
accountant, has four children and is a widow. She cannot afford 
health insurance and relies on emergency rooms for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	But She was not put off by Mrs. Clinton's lack of an easy  
answer. ``I think Mrs. Clinton should be our senator,'' Mrs. 
McIntyre said afterwards. ``I think as the first lady she has been 
thwarted in achieving her health care goals. Too bad she can't run 
for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton started her day with a discussion on gun violence  
and strongly attacked the gun lobby for blocking an effort to make 
it more difficult for people to buy weapons at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton also made an embarrassing gaffe during the  
forum when addressing a woman whose son was injured in a 1994 
shooting, telling the woman: ``You've really spent a lot of time in 
the years since your son's murder--'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mother, Alice McEnaney, interrupted her and said, ``He  
wasn't murdered. My son's alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank God,'' said Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. McEnaney then indicated  
that her son, Jason, was sitting in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton had met Mrs. McEnaney, but not Jason, prior to the  
forum. Before the first lady's blunder, Mrs. McEnaney told the 
audience, ``On Dec. 14, 1994, we got a phone call that's every 
parent's nightmare. My son was involved in a hostage-taking at 
SUNY-Albany. He disarmed a gunman, he had been shot in the 
process.'' She did not specifically say he had survived. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how the error occurred and whether Mrs. Clinton had been  
told beforehand that the young man survived, her committee 
spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said, ``Mrs. Clinton was sharing her 
concern for the mother of a gunshot victim and misspoke. That's 
it.''

<HEADLINE> NEH Grants $2.2M to Save Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Librarians try to save miles of bookshelf  
space by digitally recording the information they contain, but some 
of that information could be lost, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Endowment for the Humanities warned of the possible  
data loss in announcing a $2.2 million grant to Cornell University 
for ``Project Prism,'' to promote ``information integrity in 
digital libraries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are especially concerned that history is literally  
disappearing before our eyes,'' NEH Chairman William R. Ferris said 
in a statement. ``Many historical documents, including founding 
fathers' papers, newspapers, photographs and other documents are 
disintegrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of these documents were transferred to digital formats in  
the belief that would preserve them forever. But now we're learning 
that digital formats are very fragile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there are no common preservation processes for digital  
records, but Project Prism will help develop a strategy that can be 
applied throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Duchay, a researcher at Cornell, said digital records  
become hard to retrieve if they are preserved on software that has 
become obsolete in the rapidly changing digital world. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system you're using to write your story could be  
superseded in time and it might not be possible to recover the 
text,'' she told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The formats containing the old data might no longer be readable  
by people using today's software and hardware. It's already hard to 
find equipment to read some material digitized in the 1980s, she 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	As described by NEH, Project Prism would try to ensure that  
information is available when and where people want it, protect 
privacy and property rights and ensure the content of digital 
collections for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	Project Prism is one of six NEH efforts, in cooperation with  
universities and the National Science Foundation, to computerize 
records and make them readily available.

<HEADLINE> HMO Medicare Pullouts Threaten Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 327,000 elderly Medicare recipients  
could lose their HMO coverage next year because large health plans 
are pulling out of the Medicare market, the government said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the government has authorized other plans to enter the  
Medicare market. Subscribers losing coverage could join them or 
other plans, or opt to return to the traditional Medicare program. 
</P>
<P>
	The official tally from the Health and Human Services Department  
was collected from HMOs who had to report by July 1 on their 
business intentions for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigna HealthCare, Pacificare Health Systems, United HealthCare,  
Humana and other large health insurance providers had already 
announced they were pulling out of Medicare coverage in selected 
markets. HMOs dropping members will have to provide service through 
the end of the year and must notify affected beneficiaries by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, the American Association of Health Plans  
estimated about 250,000 people would be affected by the HMO 
pullouts. Millions of additional seniors could face higher rates 
for fewer benefits, the trade group predicted, based on figures 
from a survey it commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6.2 million of the 39 million Medicare enrollees now get  
health insurance coverage through HMOs. Many seniors sign up with 
HMOs as an alternative to Medicare's traditional fee-for-service 
coverage because the HMOs, in addition to providing Medicare 
benefits, usually offer prescription drug coverage, fewer 
co-payments and other additional benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are disappointed that some managed care plans participating  
in Medicare are making decisions that will limit the choices 
available to Medicare beneficiaries,'' said Michael Hash, 
Medicare's deputy administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Hash said the government has authorized 39 new plans to enter  
the program or expand their service areas, including four plans 
approved Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken strong steps to ensure that no matter what  
decisions plans make about their participation in the program, 
Medicare beneficiaries affected by these changes have options,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Medicare HMO members should have received notices if their plan  
intends to withdraw from Medicare, and they will either have to 
choose another health plan -- if one is available -- or choose 
traditional Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will be notified of precise benefit changes and premium  
increases in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, about 400,000 Medicare recipients had to change  
health plans when nearly 100 HMOs opted against renewing Medicare 
contracts after the government cut the growth in reimbursement 
rates. Until then, Medicare had been seen as the most lucrative 
market for HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medicare payment changes, part of the 1997 balanced-budget  
law, were in response to reports that Medicare was overpaying the 
health plans.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Workers' Illness Recognized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government acknowledged for the first time  
Thursday that thousands of workers were made sick while making 
nuclear weapons and announced a plan to compensate many of them for 
medical care and lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress must still approve the compensation, which would end  
years of litigation over claims by the workers that they became 
sick while employed by private contractors at federal nuclear 
weapons facilities during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. government is acknowledging that we made a mistake.  
... We need to right this wrong,'' Energy Secretary Bill Richardson 
said, in announcing the compensation plan after years of government 
rejection of the health claims. 
</P>
<P>
	He was joined by nine members of Congress from some of the  
regions where many of the former weapons workers live or were 
employed. They promised to wage a bipartisan campaign to get the 
legislation approved this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will not be easy to craft and will not be easy to pass,''  
Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, said. There remain disputes over how 
broad the compensation should be and how many workers should be 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan would initially limit compensation to  
workers who became ill from exposure to beryllium, a chemical 
element that was used as a strengthening alloy in atomic weapons. 
The cost of such compensation was estimated at $13 million a year 
over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But workers and their advocates have argued the program should  
be broadened to cover illnesses from other toxic and radioactive 
materials at weapons plants. They maintain that thousands of 
workers suffer from lung disease or cancers because of exposure to 
mercury, uranium, asbestos and other radioactive substances. 
</P>
<P>
	Beryllium, which causes a debilitating lung disease for which  
there is treatment but no cure, has been used historically at 20 
Energy Department sites. The workers were largely in seven states: 
Colorado, Illinois, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department and other sources estimate 20,000 to  
26,000 workers may have been exposed to beryllium at DOE sites over 
50 years. There are believed to be 500 to 1,000 cases of the 
disease, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Miller of the energy workers' union said the union will  
press Congress to broaden coverage beyond those workers exposed to 
beryllium. Several of the lawmakers at the news conference also 
said compensation needed to be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said the plan calls for the president's National  
Economic Council to examine compensation for other occupational 
illnesses related to the weapons program, including asbestosis and 
radiation-induced cancers. A report is expected next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Richardson said financial assistant for workers made  
ill from beryllium was ``long deserved and long overdue.'' Until 
now, the Energy Department had routinely opposed work-related 
illness claims from contractor employees, although several dozen 
lawsuits seeking compensation have been filed against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to reverse years of policy and make the workers  
eligible for federal compensation and marks the first time the 
federal government has acknowledged that nuclear weapons production 
caused illnesses in thousands of workers during the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It signals a new era for the Department of Energy in its  
treatment of its workers,'' said Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the men and women who helped us win the Cold War  
worked in extremely sensitive conditions and were exposed to 
extremely hazardous substances,'' he said, adding that they should 
``not be punished with health care bills they can't pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the administration's plan, workers found to eligible would  
be reimbursed medical costs, compensated for lost wages and given 
vocational assistance. As an option, they could take a $100,000 
lump-sump benefit payment. In cases in which the worker has died, 
survivors' benefits would be provided, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers union and other advocates have argued for years that  
the Energy Department and its predecessor, the Atomic Energy 
Commission, provided insufficient safeguards and inadequate safety 
standards for workers involved in the production, manufacture and 
assembly of nuclear materials and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Although private contract employees made up the vast majority of  
the work force at these facilities, they are ineligible to apply 
for federal compensation. Nor are such illnesses normally covered 
by state workmen's compensation benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the workers with chronic beryllium disease were employed  
at Rocky Flats in Colorado, the Oak Ridge weapons complex in 
Tennessee, the Hanford reservation in Washington state, Los Alamos 
National Laboratory in New Mexico and the Argonne laboratory in 
Chicago, according to the Energy Department. Many of them also 
worked for private vendors in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Springsteen Kicks Off U.S. Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Looking relaxed and fit, Bruce  
Springsteen kicked off his first U.S. tour in 11 years with the E 
Street Band before thousands of fans at New Jersey's Continental 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The Freehold native is performing 15 sold-out concerts in his  
home state before hitting other cities across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time Springsteen and his band have traveled the  
United States since a 1988 tour for Amnesty International. They 
have already finished a 17-city European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Springsteen said, ``Good evening, New Jersey,'' and  
then launched into ``My Love Will Not Let You Down,'' a song 
released late last year. The Boss quickly dove into old tunes that 
brought fans to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the last great rock 'n' roll tour of the century,'' said  
Robert Santelli, a vice president at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 
and Museum in Cleveland. ``He embodied a whole lot of New Jersey 
culture in his music. ... He gave a sense of pride to a lot of 
young people.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Associated Press is teaming up with  
RealNetworks Inc. to launch a new service offering audio and video 
news to AP's member newspapers and broadcasters for use on their 
Web sites, the news cooperative announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP already offers audio and video news as part of its  
Internet news service, The Wire, and separately to selected 
newspapers. The new service makes more of this material available 
to the cooperative's members as a separate product. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will be able to purchase some or all of the three parts  
of the new service: regular audio updates on top stories; audio and 
video clips to accompany major stories and live audio and video 
coverage of at least one event per day. 
</P>
<P>
	The audio and video clips will be produced by The AP from its  
radio and television news reports. The service will be distributed 
over the online network of Seattle-based RealNetworks, which is the 
leading provider of streaming audio and video over the Internet. 
Some 60 million people use its RealPlayer software to play audio 
and video content over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	AP, the world's oldest and largest newsgathering organization,  
is a cooperative of its member newspapers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
	Several AP members will begin using the service this summer,  
including latimes.com, the Web site of the Los Angeles Times, The 
New York Times On the Web, USAToday.com, washingtonpost.com, 
Arizona Central, the Web site of The Arizona Republic, and Tribune 
Interactive, which includes Web sites for the Chicago Tribune, The 
Orlando Sentinel, the Sun-Sentinel of South Florida, the Newport 
News Daily Press and 18 Tribune television stations.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on dry Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices rose Thursday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for hot, dry weather in 
key growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasts for weekend temperatures to rise into the 90s,  
accompanied by little moisture, boosted fears about heat stress to 
young crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio already are reporting low  
soil moisture, and prolonged dry weather through next week could 
begin to lead to yield reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat and soybean futures also were boosted by larger than  
expected export demand in the past week, which came as prices fell 
sharply amid concern about bumper production. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $2.61 1/2 a bushel;  
December corn rose 4 1/4 cents to $2.05 1/4 a bushel; December oats rose 
2 cents to $1.11 1/2 a bushel; November soybeans rose 6 1/4 cents to 
$4.27 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .23 cent to 63.42 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .60 cent to 76.65 cents a pound; August lean 
hogs rose .95 cent to 46.90 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
.75 cent to 33.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> McGraw-Hill Earnings Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The McGraw-Hill Cos. reported a 16 percent  
increase in second-quarter earnings Thursday due to gains at 
Business Week, as well as growth in its financial services and 
education businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill earned $90 million, or 45 cents per share, compared  
to $77.8 million or 39 cents a share in the same period a year ago. 
Revenues rose 5 percent to $922.7 million versus $881.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were slightly higher than the 44 cents per share  
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from financial services rose 12 percent thanks to gains  
at the company's Standard &AMP; Poor's division, which publishes 
company information and issues credit ratings. S&AMP;P posted gains 
despite a dropoff in new U.S. bond issues as the company continued 
to expand its business in overseas markets, especially Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Ad pages at Business Week increased 8.4 percent in the second  
quarter, reflecting strong advertising demand from the computer and 
communications industries. 
</P>
<P>
	McGraw-Hill's educational and professional publishing division  
posted a 5 percent gain in revenues as strong orders from 
elementary and high schools bolstered results. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, McGraw-Hill's profits rose  
17 percent to $114.5 million or 57 cents a share from $98 million, 
or 49 cents a share. Revenues rose 3.4 percent to $1.64 billion 
from $1.58 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of McGraw Hill rose 62 1/2 cents to $50.43 3/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- A doctor and two pharmacy owners have  
been charged with murder, accused of dispensing a powerful 
painkiller that resulted in five overdose deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Frank Fisher and pharmacy owners Stephen and Madeline Miller  
entered innocent pleas involving two of the deaths in Shasta County 
Superior Court on Wednesday. They had earlier pleaded innocent to 
the other three deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge has yet to determine if a trial will be held.  
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the deaths were caused by the wrongful  
prescription of oxycodone, a morphine-like painkiller. The dead 
ranged in age from 19 to 38. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have alleged the Harvard-educated Fisher ran a  
``patient mill,'' prescribing oxycodone and other drugs after only 
cursory examinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Millers are accused of filling most of Fisher's  
prescriptions at their Shasta Pharmacy in Redding in exchange for 
kickbacks from him. 
</P>
<P>
	The three also face fraud charges in connection with more than  
$2 million in medical billings. They have remained jailed on 
multimillion-dollar bails since their Feb. 18 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those raising money for Fisher's legal defense is Robert  
Stevens. His wife, Tamara Stevens, is among the five who died. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher has said he treated many poor patients with chronic pain  
who were snubbed by other doctors, and has said he wrote large 
prescriptions to ensure they could ease their suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	Treating patients in extreme pain involves risk, Fisher told The  
Sacramento Bee earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the attorney general's office understands the  
issue of chronic pain or how you treat it,'' he said. ``I feel like 
I'm being punished for behaving with good conscience and doing the 
right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners' New Ballpark Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Safe opened for business Thursday, with the  
Seattle Mariners uncertain whether they can keep Ken Griffey Jr. 
and Alex Rodriguez locked up. 
</P>
<P>
	After 22 1/2 seasons in the climate-controlled Kingdome, the  
Mariners moved into Safeco Field, which has a retractable roof but 
no heating or air conditioning. At $517 million, it is the most 
expensive baseball stadium ever. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team wants the Public Facilities District that built  
the ballpark to pay for $100 million in overruns, some fans didn't 
concern themselves with the cost. The government agreed to pay $372 
million of the original $417 million estimate. 
</P>
<P>
	Lorin Sandretzky, a 33-year-old bodyguard from suburban Burien,  
made his feelings clear as he sat in the main concourse, holding 
high a sign that read: ``Whoever Paid for It, Thanks!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's beautiful, it's 100 percent state of the art,'' he said.  
``For anybody that's complaining, I say come down here and look at 
what their money did. This is what baseball should be. I've never 
seen so many smiles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The frustrating 3-2 loss to the San Diego Padres -- caused mainly  
by Jose Mesa's four walks in the ninth inning -- was almost an 
afterthought as the Mariners celebrated the move to Safeco Field. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Mariners Alvin Davis, Harold Reynolds and Ruppert Jones  
participated in a pregame ceremony honoring the team's past. 
Mariners announcer Dave Niehaus, who has been with the team since 
its 1977 inception, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	And fans explored the ballpark, many in awe of its technological  
marvels -- particularly the retractable roof that covers the stadium 
like an umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
	Like a curtain rising on a new act, the 22-million-pound roof  
opened an hour before Seattle played the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a baseball game in Seattle was played outside a  
dome was in 1969, when the Pilots played at Sick's Stadium. After 
one season, the expansion team moved to Milwaukee and became the 
Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners say the 47,000-seat stadium, erected next to its  
utilitarian predecessor, will ensure the future of baseball in the 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	However, they may not be able to afford both the stadium and the  
high cost of keeping Griffey and Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are eligible for free agency after the 2000 season, and it  
may cost $400 million or more to keep them. Rodriguez's agent, 
Scott Boras, is expected to seek a 10-year deal averaging $20 
million per season or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans, who angst daily about the future of their superstars, set  
aside their worries for the night. They cheered as the roof opened 
to the score from the movie ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' performed by 
The Seattle Symphony Orchestra on the other side of the 
center-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is awesome. It's far beyond what I thought it would be,''  
John Bender, who drove by the stadium several days a week in the 
past month to monitor its progress. ``Who cares about the cost 
overruns?'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Alex Deccio could hardly contain his glee as he took  
his seat in the field-level section behind home plate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican was among the two-dozen Eastern Washington  
legislators who counter-balanced the opposition of many 
Seattle-area lawmakers and helped win approval of Safeco Field's 
financing package during the Mariners' 1995 playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't for Eastern Washington folks, this place wouldn't  
be here!'' he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Deccio shrugged off the Mariners' request for more money after  
pledging to cover all overruns. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the engineering marvel that this is, I'm surprised they  
didn't go over more,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-firemen Charged in Deadly Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Seven current or former firefighters  
tried to impress their chief by setting fire to a house and then 
putting out the blaze, but one got trapped inside and was killed, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	The six other men were arrested Thursday on charges of  
conspiracy, arson and burglary and could get up to 87 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who died, Daniel Neil Hixson, was a former firefighter.  
Hixson had left the department when he moved out of the area, then 
came back last month, hoping to return to duty. 
</P>
<P>
	His six colleagues apparently thought that if the chief saw him  
fighting a fire, it would help win back his job, Sheriff John Cupp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hixson, 26, poured gasoline inside the home June 26, then became  
trapped by smoke and flames and died, Cupp said. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner of the house was not home. The back of the house was  
heavily damaged.

<HEADLINE> Part of Energy Dept. Budget Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In another fallout over allegations of Chinese  
espionage, a House subcommittee today directed that $1 billion of 
the Energy Department's budget be withheld until Congress 
reorganizes the department's nuclear weapons programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., chairman of the House Appropriations  
subcommittee on energy and water, said reforms to improve nuclear 
weapons security were essential before the $1 billion in DOE 
operating funds will be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee action was taken as the panel approved the  
fiscal 2000 energy and water appropriations bill. The legislation 
will be considered by the full House in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Energy Department has a budget of about $18 billion, but  
most of that goes to contractors. The $1 billion withheld for DOE 
operations represents a large part of the department's direct, 
noncontractor spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is to be withheld until Congress restructures the  
department's national security programs or establishes an 
independent agency to oversee and manage their operations, Packard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been growing sentiment among lawmakers to create a  
largely autonomous agency within the Energy Department responsible 
for nuclear weapons programs, including operation of the three 
nuclear weapons labs and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has said he is willing to  
accept in theory creation of a semiautonomous agency as long as 
it's clear the energy secretary has authority over the agency. He 
also wants security and counterintelligence functions to be 
departmentwide and not confined to the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	A largely Republican proposal gaining momentum in the Senate  
would create a semiautonomous agency, but insulate it more from the 
rest of the department than what Richardson has been willing to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, some Republican members of the House, including  
Packard, would prefer to have the nuclear programs taken away from 
the Energy Department altogether, and create a totally independent 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	But House members are divided on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	Seven House committee and subcommittee chairmen wrote a letter  
to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., this week urging him to 
oppose any effort to restructure the Energy Department without 
further hearings and review. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., the Commerce Committee chairman, and F.  
James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., the Science Committee chairman, 
warned against trying to make ``quick fixes'' at the Energy 
Department that could harm science research programs and hinder 
safety and environmental protection at the weapons facilities.

<HEADLINE> FBI Launches Digital Fingerprinting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Local police can now take a single fingerprint  
from a suspect at a roadside arrest and find out in minutes from a 
new FBI computerized national crime data system whether that person 
is wanted, rather than waiting the hours, days or longer that the 
old FBI system took. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, the FBI launched its new National Crime Information  
Center 2000 (NCIC 2000), replacing the old NCIC computer network 
that linked the bureau to state and local police. 
</P>
<P>
	Among a series of improvements, the new system has the ability  
to automatically process fingerprints and mugshots. It also 
contains the old NCIC system's lists of wanted people, criminal 
histories, missing and deported people, stolen guns, vehicles, 
license plates, stocks, boats and other articles. 
</P>
<P>
	But the old NCIC didn't even handle fingerprints or mugshots.  
Local police had to mail or fax 10-finger print sets to the FBI, 
which checked them by hand against its 39 million sets of 
fingerprints and answered by mail, fax or, in urgent cases, by 
telephone whether there was a match. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, a police officer in a station or even in a squad car in the  
field can put a suspect's index finger into a small reader that 
transmits the print by radio to FBI NCIC 2000 computers in 
Clarksburg, W. Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Within minutes, the NCIC 2000 computer -- automatically without  
any action by FBI employees -- checks the single print against 
250,000 fingerprints in the FBI's file of fugitives and wanted 
persons. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer pops out in minutes. If the print identifies the  
suspect as someone who is wanted, the NCIC 2000 computer not only 
relays the result to local police but also sends a mugshot of the 
wanted person to a computer screen or printer in the local police 
station or even in the squad car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that NCIC 2000 will foster a revolution in law  
enforcement,'' FBI Director Louis J. Freeh said Thursday. 
Previously, ``a wanted person had sometimes already been released 
from custody before the more time-consuming record systems produced 
the needed information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few state or local police agencies already have the equipment  
needed to take full advantage of the new system, including the New 
Jersey and Michigan state police, FBI spokesman Steve Fischer said. 
``We are looking to have most of the law enforcement agencies in 
the country on board within three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI will provide the software free, but the local agencies  
have to buy their own laptop computers, fingerprint scanners and 
printers. 
</P>
<P>
	NCIC 2000 cost $183.2 million and arrived on duty four years  
later than originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	And, last Sunday's startup halted the FBI's computerized  
background checks of gun buyers for more than 24 hours. Since then, 
FBI personnel have been working to clear the backlog of checks on 
prospective gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other new capabilities, NCIC 2000 can search its files  
for: 
</P>
<P>
	--All variations of a name, such Jeff, Geoff or Jeffrey.  
</P>
<P>
	--Identifying marks like scars, tattoos and photos of  
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Lists of sexual offenders, people on probation or parole, or  
federal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	It can also link files: A query on a stolen vehicle will also  
return information on any stolen guns found in that vehicle. And it 
stores five days worth of queries and can report whether police in 
other jurisdictions are looking for the same people or property. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 28, Fischer said, the FBI's Clarksburg records center  
will take another step into the future. The old hand searches of 
10-fingerprint sets for matches in the 39 million-print files will 
become computerized with the launch of the Integrated Automated 
Fingerprint Identification System.

<HEADLINE> NAACP Wants Boycott of S. Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The NAACP is supporting a tourism boycott  
of South Carolina because the state flies the Confederate flag at 
the Statehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP voted Thursday at its national convention in New York  
to boycott the state at the urging of the South Carolina chapter. 
The resolution still must be ratified by the national board in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourism is a top industry in South Carolina and visitors spent  
$6.8 billion in the state last year, according to state figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're asking African-Americans and others who believe in  
fairness to consider relocating their family reunions, conventions, 
church groups and other meetings outside of the state as long as 
the Confederate flag is flown over the state Capitol,'' said James 
Gallman, president of the South Carolina chapter of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina is the only state that flies the flag over its  
Statehouse. Mississippi and Georgia incorporate the rebel flag in 
their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Gov. Jim Hodges supports a compromise to take down  
the flag and place it near a Confederate memorial on the Capitol 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, the political will to enact such a compromise does  
not exist today in the South Carolina Legislature,'' the 
vacationing Hodges said in a statement released by his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in 1995 passed a law giving the Legislature sole power  
to remove the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag was raised over the Statehouse in 1962 to commemorate  
the Civil War's centennial. Opponents say it is an offensive 
reminder of slavery. Supporters say it celebrates the state's 
heritage and the sacrifice of South Carolinians during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	A boycott likely wouldn't have an immediate effect on the state,  
said tourism department spokesman Lou Fontana. Less than 5 percent 
of blacks who vacationed in South Carolina attended conventions, 
which usually are planned several years in advance, he said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes Religion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today moved to restore legal  
assurances that people can practice their religious beliefs without 
undue government interference. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Religious Liberty Protection Act,'' which passed 306-118,  
is aimed at better protecting religious practices in such instances 
as schools telling Jewish boys they can't wear yarmulkes while 
playing basketball or Muslim firefighters being told they can't 
grow beards. 
</P>
<P>
	Police now can arrest a Catholic priest for serving communion to  
minors and violate Orthodox Jewish laws by carrying out autopsies, 
said Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C. ``This is wrong and it has to be 
changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure declares that state and local governments can only  
take actions that impose a ``substantial burden'' on a person's or 
group's religious practices if they can prove a ``compelling 
governmental interest.'' The full Senate has yet to consider it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day Americans are wrongfully denied an opportunity to  
practice their religion according to the dictates of conscience,'' 
said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is supported by a broad range of religious and civil  
rights groups ranging from the Christian Coalition to the Peyote 
Way Church of God. The Clinton administration, in a statement, said 
it strongly supports the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	But the measure is opposed by civil rights groups worried that  
landlords could use the religious defense to discriminate against 
potential tenants and conservatives who see it as federal 
encroachment on state and local rights. The NAACP Legal Defense and 
Education Fund said Wednesday it was concerned the act would be 
used against minorities seeking protection from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters cited such cases as a woman denied employment because  
her faith prevented her from taking a loyalty oath, a Colorado 
county that tried to limit the operating hours of a church in the 
same way it did commercial facilities and coroners trying to carry 
out autopsies over the religious objections of family members. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is a result of a decade of conflict between Congress  
and the courts. In 1990 the Supreme Court ruled that even 
relatively minor laws and regulations could be used to deny some 
religious practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress responded in 1993 by passing a measure that applied the  
compelling governmental interest principle in religious practice 
cases, but in 1997 the Supreme Court struck down that law, saying 
Congress had exceeded its constitutional authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill tries to conform to the Constitution by saying its  
provisions apply only to federally funded state and local programs 
or issues involving interstate commerce. It also applies to land 
use regulations that discriminate against houses of worship. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farris, president of the Home School Legal Defense  
Association and head of the group that wrote the 1993 bill, said he 
is against the current measure. He said it would help only big and 
powerful religious groups and that the courts would again declare 
it unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Farris said use of the interstate commerce provision would only  
extend federal controls over religious issues. ``We think that the 
rope being used to pull religious freedom out of the ditch today is 
the rope that will hang us in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Anders, legislative counsel of the American Civil  
Liberties Union, which also supported the 1993 bill, said it 
opposes the new measure because of several recent court cases in 
which landlords have used religious arguments to discriminate 
against would-be tenants. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal shield, he said, was being ``used as a sword to  
violate people's civil rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., offered an amendment that would bar  
large property owners and businesses from discriminating against 
gays, the disabled or minorities on religious grounds. It was 
defeated 234-190. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1691.

<HEADLINE> MLS All-Stars Helped by Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Soccer's next big thing, the MLS All-Star game,  
will kick off in the afterglow of the U.S. women's dramatic World 
Cup victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The men don't have much choice but to ride along on the women's  
shirttails. Jealous? No. Grateful? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I say that definitely people might be more aware of the game  
because of the women, and we're all pretty thankful for that,'' 
said Matt Jordan of the Dallas Burn, the backup goalie for the 
Eastern Conference in Saturday's game. ``We're all sort of jumping 
on their boat, their bandwagon, so to speak. So it's a very 
positive situation for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roll a soccer ball on a field these days and it's impossible not  
to talk about the women, who won the final over China on Brandi 
Chastain's penalty kick last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially in the current climate, with the wonderful  
performance by the women, soccer's on everyone's mind,'' Alexi 
Lalas, the goateed star of the Kansas City Wizards, said before a 
MLS-sponsored celebrity game Wednesday night. ``I think that it's a 
wonderful time to celebrate not just the MLS, but soccer in 
general.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lalas attended two women's games and watched the final on TV.  
He's fielded as many questions about the women as the MLS, but 
hasn't tired of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all soccer and it's all good. They deserve everything  
they're getting. Now let's see what they do with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's the catch. After the All-Star game, the men return to  
their league. There's no such thing for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Elena George, one of dozens of screaming teenagers who were at  
the celebrity game, offered a suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the women are just as good. I think they should  
definitely have a men and women matchup thing, the best women 
versus the best men. And they should have a women's professional 
league. That would really influence girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``The women got everybody pumped up to go watch soccer because  
they, like, won,'' said George, who's 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The women have a supporter in none other than pro wrestler Ken  
Shamrock, the self-professed ``World's Most Dangerous Man'' who was 
a huge hit in the celebrity game and looked downright civilized in 
a soccer uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the women winning the soccer tournament, it just goes to  
show you how women's sports have moved up and are getting exposure 
like they should,'' Shamrock said. ``You saw it was a sellout there 
(at the Rose Bowl). Most men's soccer games don't get that unless 
it's Brazil or Argentina or something like that. So the women have 
absolutely opened some eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Newman has a unique perspective. Not only is she a soccer  
mom, but her husband, Guy, is an assistant coach with the Wizards 
who watched as much of the women's tournament as possible. Her 
father-in-law, Ron Newman, coached the now-defunct San Diego 
Sockers to 10 indoor titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that women's soccer is any type of threat to the  
men's league at this point, but I think it gives women and girls 
something to strive for and I think it brings an awareness,'' 
Newman said. ``It's not just a kid's sport anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman's daughters, Gabby, 6, and Brittany, 9, wore Mia Hamm  
jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
	``That got voted over the Kansas City Wizards jersey,'' Newman  
said. ``She's worn that shirt for about a week straight. I can't 
get it off her,'' Newman said, pointing to Gabby. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's New England Revolution goalie Walter Zenga, who  
can't figure out all the talk about the women's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, they don't care about the women's soccer,'' said  
Zenga, an Italian. ``Everywhere it is a different mentality, no? I 
think it is just a little strange for one team to be on top of the 
world and they don't have a league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It remains to be seen if the women's success will help boost  
ticket sales for Saturday's game, which for the second straight 
year is being played in a non-MLS city. League officials would be 
happy to sell 30,000 tickets at 70,000-seat Qualcomm Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	A game between Chivas of Mexico and Chile's Universidad Catolica  
will follow, and officials hope for strong same-day ticket sales to 
fans from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully this sport has made friends over the course of the  
last three weeks,'' MLS commissioner Doug Logan said. ``If so, that 
would be a good thing for Major League Soccer.''

<HEADLINE> EU Body Probes Interbrew Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Commission investigators have  
raided the offices of the brewer Interbrew in an effort to 
determine if it is using anti-competitive tactics to muscle out 
rivals in the Belgian market. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission spokesman Stephen Rating said Thursday the agency is  
investigating whether Interbrew is offering pubs rewards for 
stocking its beers and excluding others, requiring wholesalers to 
carry all its beers and exclude other brewers, and cutting prices 
to drive out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors representing acting E.U. Commissioner for Competition  
Karel van Miert visited several Interbrew offices Tuesday and 
Wednesday and took documents with them, the company confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiry is limited to the Belgian market, said Rating.  
</P>
<P>
	The Leuven-based company has a 60 percent market share in  
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Under European Union competition rules, companies could be fined  
up to 10 percent of their annual sales if found to be using 
anti-competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission runs the day-to-day affairs of the 15-nation  
union, proposes EU law and enforces its implementation across 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, it imposed $6.8 million in fines against British  
Airways on Wednesday for allegedly paying British travel agents to 
direct travelers onto its flights. 
</P>
<P>
	That ruling was the result of a two-year inquiry triggered by  
two formal complaints from British Airways' archrival, Virgin 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Virgin accused British Airways of offering travel agents extra  
commissions if they could demonstrate that its ticket sales were 
going up compared to rival carriers, particularly when selling to 
corporate clients.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Reaffirms Euro Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- The chief banker of the 11-nation euro zone  
reaffirmed his faith in the sinking European currency and hinted at 
higher interest rates Thursday, sparking a small rally just as 
crisp, new euro banknotes start rolling off printing presses around 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank,  
emphasized that improvement in the European economy, along with the 
bank's anti-inflation stance, should help the euro regain some of 
the 12 percent in value it has lost against the dollar since its 
Jan. 1 introduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clear potential for a stronger (euro)'', Duisenberg  
said after the regular monthly meeting of the bank, which sets 
monetary policy for the nations that adopted the euro. 
</P>
<P>
	``Modest'' signs of recovery ``appear to confirm the outlook for  
a continued improvement in the course of this year,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of Duisenberg's comments, the euro gained about half  
a cent, finishing in London at $1.0244. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the euro's rise to a hint from Duisenberg  
that the bank's next move for interest rates -- when it comes -- will 
be to raise them. Higher rates increase demand for a currency as 
investors seek better returns compared with other currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank council left its key interest rates unchanged Thursday,  
as widely expected, and no further changes are expected this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But asked whether the bank was moving toward a bias in favor of  
tightening monetary policy -- meaning raising rates -- Duisenberg 
said ``you could see a tightening bias slightly creeping in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much the euro's weakness has been attributed to the booming  
economy in the United States and the resulting higher interest 
rates, which make investments in dollars more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve in Washington this month raised its key rate  
to 5 percent to keep inflation under control. The European Central 
Bank's last action was to cut rates to 2.5 percent in April to help 
spur Europe's sluggish economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While governments and corporations use the euro for financial  
transactions, bills and coins won't enter circulation until the 
euro becomes legal tender on Jan. 1, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	To prepare for that, mints in Belgium, Germany, Italy,  
Netherlands and Spain this month began or will soon begin printing 
euro banknotes, the bank announced. Plants in other countries will 
start production in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen billion euro notes will be printed in denominations of  
5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 euros. The designs -- bridges, 
gateways and windows in styles ranging from classical to modern -- 
are common across the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Minting of the eight different euro coins -- 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and  
50 cents and 1- and 2-euros -- began in May 1998 and is proceeding 
on schedule, the bank said. Some 448 million, 8 percent of the 
total to be put into circulation, have already been minted. 
</P>
<P>
	The design on one side is standard, while the reverse has the  
profile of a monarch or national symbol.

<HEADLINE> Davis Cup Returns to Longwood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- With the impeccably manicured grass  
courts still spreading out from the classic Longwood Cricket Club, 
Dwight Davis' baby has returned to its roots. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1900 when Davis, then a senior at nearby Harvard  
University, purchased a silver bowl and invited a British team to 
tea and tennis. This weekend, the two winningest nations in Davis 
Cup history -- the United States and Australia -- return to Longwood 
to celebrate that occasion with a centennial match. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing on the grass in front of the clubhouse, the Americans  
won that first competition 3-0. This time, the best-of-5 matches 
will be contested on a hard court in a corner of the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The matches in 1900 were contested by gentlemen of means.  
</P>
<P>
	Davis, whose father was rumored to be the richest man in  
Missouri, went on to become Secretary of War under President Calvin 
Coolidge and governor-general of the Philippines under President 
Herbert Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's matches will be played by the top professionals in  
the game, including six-time Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras and 
1997-98 U.S. Open winner Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the site of  
the Wimbledon championships, the Longwood Cricket Club's name is a 
connection with the past. Cricket has not been played in this 
enclave in suburban Boston since 1933. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longwood estate, where the club was first organized in 1877  
by two dozen cricket players in search of playing fields, was named 
for the house where Napoleon lived in exile on the island of St. 
Helena off the coast of Africa. In 1878, the club acquired two sets 
of tennis rackets, laid out a grass tennis court and became an 
early hotbed of the new sport of lawn tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the first members was Richard D. Sears, who won the U.S.  
Championships, now the U.S. Open, a record seven consecutive years. 
The first tournament was held in May 1882 and the Eastern Doubles 
Championship began in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve other Longwood members have won national titles,  
including Hall of Famer Hazel Wightman, while Dr. James Dwight was 
founder of the United States National Lawn Tennis Association, now 
the USTA. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1891 -- the same year the Nationals tournament began at the  
Newport Casino in Newport, R.I. -- the Longwood Bowl tournament, 
which attracted all the ranking American players of the day, was 
started by the club. The Longwood Bowl was played until 1942. 
</P>
<P>
	For nearly the first half of this century, the most prestigious  
tournaments in the United States were the Nationals, the Longwood 
Bowl and the Eastern Doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1935 until 1968, with the exception of the war years --  
1942-45 -- the National Women's Doubles was contested at Longwood. 
In 1968, it moved back to New York where it became part of the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1964, Longwood staged the U.S. Professional Tennis  
Championships. On the strength of the club's willingness to host 
the event, Jack Kramer began a pro touring group, the International 
Professional Tennis Player Association, that played an eight-city 
circuit leading up to Longwood. This became a major factor in 
helping professional tennis take root, culminating in open tennis 
beginning in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Longwood still stages the U.S. Pro Championships, which at 72 is  
the oldest professional tennis tournament in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the club has 41 courts -- 25 grass, 13 clay and three  
hard. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve times since Dwight Davis began his international team  
competition, the Davis Cup has returned to the Longwood Cricket 
Club. Surprisingly, Australia has played more ties at Longwood 
(eight) than the United States (four). 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, teams played during major competitions, not  
necessarily on home grounds as now. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first Davis Cup played at Longwood since 1959, when  
Australia defeated India 4-1.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Taking Tax Deduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. says a $17 million  
pretax loss on the sale of its Miracle Ear hearing aid business 
will be offset by a tax deduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The eye-care company erroneously reported Monday that the loss  
would be covered by gains from the recent sale of its sunglass 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the company said the loss from the sale will be offset  
by a benefit from a tax deduction recorded in the fourth quarter of 
1998 when Bausch &AMP; Lomb reduced the value of the hearing aid 
business on its books. The tax deduction could not be taken until 
the business was sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The after-tax gain on the Miracle Ear sale will be $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Miracle Ear, headquartered in Golden Valley, Minn., makes and  
sells hearing aids and related products. It is being sold to 
Amplifon SpA of Italy, a leading distributor and retailer of 
hearing aids in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Sampras To Sit Out Davis Cup Singles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Pete Sampras, the No. 3 singles player  
in the world, will play only doubles for the United States in its 
Davis Cup quarterfinal against Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's draw for the matches Friday through Sunday set the  
lineup, which cannot be changed except in case of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. captain Tom Gullikson had said all along that he would not  
use Sampras for singles, even though the team would be stronger 
that way. Sampras had joined the team late and expressed concern 
about upsetting the chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	But few expected that Gullikson's comments were anything more  
than gamesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect him to come all this way to sit on the  
sidelines and watch,'' Australian foe Patrick Rafter said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sampras won't watch. He'll play doubles with Alex O'Brien on  
Saturday against Sandon Stolle and Mark Woodforde. The singles 
matches Friday will be Todd Martin against Lleyton Hewitt and Jim 
Courier against Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	The singles matchups will be reversed on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	The quarterfinal tie is being played at the Longwood Cricket  
club to commemorate the Davis Cup centennial. The first matches 
were played here in 1900 after founder Dwight Davis purchased the 
trophy and issued a challenge to the international tennis 
community.

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Suits Against HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Turning to one of the most contentious issues  
in the weeklong debate over health maintenance organizations, the 
Senate today killed a Democratic provision that would have enabled 
patients to sue their health plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Health plans that fall under federal regulations cannot now be  
sued. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 53-47 against the provision, which Democrats  
had argued would force insurers to put a patient's health before 
the company bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he was bewildered by the rejection of the  
provision and lashed out at Republicans, who control the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health insurers won't let them do it,'' Clinton said.  
``It's a sad day for health care in America. But we're not done yet 
and this won't die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsor of the doomed amendment, Sen. Richard Durbin,  
D-Ill., said: ``This is the heart of the debate. This is what the 
patients' bill of rights is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans countered by saying patients would actually suffer  
because of the cost and expense of lengthy court fights. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a terrible idea,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala.  
``It will add expense throughout the system and will not benefit 
patients who need it when they need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senators also adopted, 54-46, a four-part amendment by Sen.  
Susan Collins, R-Maine, covering the areas of long-term and 
emergency room care, access to medical specialists and 
obstetrician-gynecologists. Democrats claimed these provisions were 
weaker than their own and would exclude millions of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins' amendment would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Create a new tax deduction for long-term care, though  
Republicans gave no details on how they would pay for the $5.4 
billion, five-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
	--Strengthen a GOP provision on emergency room care by ensuring  
that sick people would not pay more for visiting a hospital that is 
outside the health plan's network. It also would require coverage 
for follow-up care after the patient's condition has been 
stabilized. But it would apply only to the 48 million people 
covered by federally regulated plans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require ``timely'' access to medical specialists, but not those  
outside a plan's network. It also only applies to the 48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	--Assure unfettered access to obstetricians for pregnant women,  
but only allow direct access to gynecologists for unspecified 
``routine care.'' Covers 48 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was expected to pass the GOP bill today.  
</P>
<P>
	But as the White House again signaled President Clinton's  
intention to veto the Republican bill, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., 
continued to work with a handful of Democrats to forge an 
acceptable compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee noted that both bills were doomed, since the Senate was  
expected to defeat the Democratic version. ``And the American 
people won't be one bit better off than they were when we started 
this,'' he said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said most of the negotiations have  
centered on the liability issue. The compromise bill would allow 
lawsuits in federal courts, but not in state courts as the 
Democrats would. It would ban punitive damages and, in an effort to 
win more GOP support, would cap damages for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a classic congressional moment,'' said Sen. Joseph  
Lieberman, D-Conn. ``Are we going to adopt the 70 percent we agree 
on or are we going to just leave it where it is and do nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In action Wednesday, the Senate refused, 52-48, to extend new  
rules for health maintenance organizations to some 161 million 
people with private insurance regulated by the states. The result 
is that many of the new Senate provisions would apply only to the 
48 million people covered by federally regulated insurance plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The point ... is that the states have acted. They've acted  
without any mandate or prod from Washington and they've acted in a 
way to tailor their laws to their marketplace,'' said Sen. Susan 
Collins, R-Maine. ``One size does not fit all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats disagreed. ``On every single amendment the people lose  
and the HMOs win,'' complained Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a physician who is helping to lead the  
GOP effort, said some ``very good'' Democratic ideas would be 
folded into the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll deliver,'' he told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also rejected, 53-47, a Democratic proposal to  
require HMOs to pay for treatment by specialists, even those 
outside of a plan's network. The GOP version would require 
``timely'' specialist care, but not from outside doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	It approved, 55-45, a GOP measure requiring coverage of  
doctor-recommended overnight hospitalization for women treated for 
breast cancer. Democrats support the idea, but voted against the 
proposal because it eliminated one of their provisions easing 
access to clinical trials for the dying or seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have offered new federal rights for patients in  
HMOs or other managed care plans, but Republicans are more modest 
on virtually every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accuse Republicans of turning their backs on millions  
of Americans who are frustrated by how their health care is 
delivered; Republicans argue that Democrats would increase costs so 
much that even more people would be forced to go without health 
insurance.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows Strong Push on Farm Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration promises to make  
elimination of foreign barriers to American farm exports the 
centerpiece of upcoming world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony Wednesday before a Senate Finance subcommittee on  
trade, administration witnesses said European efforts to sidetrack 
the upcoming round of global trade talks will not work. 
</P>
<P>
	David Aaron, under secretary of commerce for international  
trade, called Europe's tactics the ``ABA strategy -- anything but 
agriculture,'' hoping to include so many issues for negotiators to 
tackle that nothing gets accomplished in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to reach a deal would preserve current European  
agriculture trade policies, which include high barriers blocking 
sales of many American farm products and trade-distorting 
production subsidies for their domestic crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make agriculture the centerpiece for progress in  
the round,'' Aaron told the senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher said European  
farmers are the most protected in the world with EU programs 
accounting for 85 percent of total world spending on farm 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said U.S. negotiators will push for significant cuts in  
agricultural tariffs and the total elimination of export subsidies, 
which distort trade by driving down global prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is the host for a meeting of trade ministers  
from the 134 nations that belong to the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO conference in Seattle in late November and early December 
is the expected formal launch of a new round of talks with a goal 
of further lowering barriers to trade in manufactured goods, 
services and agriculture.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Navajo reservation is a vast and remote place

	In a few months, the tribe will begin managing its own welfare

they'll use satellite laptops that will help caseworkers in 12 
different centers keep track of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each caseworker will have instant information about people who  
have come in before,'' said Rick Gayoso, a project manager for 
MultiLogic, a Minnesota firm that developed the system for the 
tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes three years after the federal government gave  
Indian tribes a chance to design welfare programs suited to their 
own needs. Several tribes are already managing their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona program was not helping the Navajo, said Alex Yazza,  
who heads the Navajo welfare effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our people are rug weavers or silver smiths,'' he  
said. ``But under state regulations, this wasn't considered work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inflexibility left many Navajo listed as unemployed,  
jeopardizing their welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the reservation's 130,000 residents are listed  
as unemployed. Thousands receive federal welfare assistance, and 
their numbers are increasing, according to the state Department of 
Economic Security. 
</P>
<P>
	In designing their own program, Navajos could define cultural  
activities as work, Yazza said. People who regularly perform 
traditional ceremonies or teach the Navajo language could be 
considered employed. That will keep federal funds coming in, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite computers will allow caseworkers to update welfare  
database each time a client returns. After answering a few 
questions, people will know exactly how much aid they're eligible 
to receive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted something interactive -- something that would allow  
us to be creative and develop something culturally relevant,'' 
Yazza said. 
</P>
<P>
	The change is drastic when compared to other states, where  
recipients must plow through stacks of paperwork, and caseworkers 
often have no idea who they are serving, Gayoso said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about being self-sufficient,'' said Teddy Nez, a tribal  
systems analyst. ``Hope is not the word I use for this. It's going 
to work.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Crafting Tax Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as they criticize huge Republican tax  
cuts as irresponsible, Democrats are putting together alternatives 
of nearly $300 billion that could form the basis of an eventual 
compromise between the GOP-led Congress and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as important for many Democrats is a tax package they can  
support to protect against GOP attacks on the issue in the 2000 
congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., predicted that few  
Democrats would support the House GOP's 10-year, $864 billion tax 
cut, particularly since Clinton is vowing to veto it as a threat to 
the long-term viability of Social Security, Medicare and key 
spending programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key element here is are you going to save Social Security  
and Medicare, are you going to be fiscally responsible?'' Gephardt 
said Thursday. ``Most Democrats feel you can do a tax cut ... of 
about $250 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt met Thursday with moderate Democrats to discuss an  
emerging plan that could include cuts in estate taxes aimed at 
farmers and small business operators, permanent extension of the 
research and development tax credit, tax breaks for long term 
health care and relief from the ``marriage penalty'' that hits 
millions of two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Senate Democrats reached tentative agreement on a  
plan cutting taxes a net $295 billion that would touch on many of 
the same issues but would also include a broader tax cut by 
increasing the standard deduction for both single and married 
filers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure also would likely ensure the alternative  
minimum tax does not affect so many middle-class people and include 
unspecified breaks for struggling farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's designed to be broad-based and responsible,'' said Sen.  
Max Baucus, D-Mont., a senior member of the Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats would reserve $1.9 trillion of the 10-year  
projected budget surplus for Social Security and allow the 
remaining $1 trillion to be divided between Medicare, tax cuts and 
government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the pieces fit together,'' he said. ``Even with the  
surplus, there's not a lot of wiggle room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee,  
was briefing committee members behind closed doors Thursday night 
on the final details of his plan. Elements released earlier would 
lower the bottom income tax bracket from 15 percent to 14 percent 
in 2001, expand individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s and 
provide breaks for estate taxes, married couples, education and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a staff draft, Roth's bill also would permanently  
ensure that personal tax credits do not cause people to fall under 
the alternative minimum tax, allow the self-employed to fully 
deduct health insurance premiums beginning in 2000 and increase 
breaks for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh off Ways and Means Committee approval of their tax bill,  
House Republicans worked Thursday to shore up support among GOP 
moderates who are concerned that it is much too large and is skewed 
toward the wealthy. GOP leaders were seen in intense negotiations 
on the House floor with Reps. Michael Castle, R-Del., and Fred 
Upton, R-Mich., among others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are satisfied that we have the votes to pass this bill,''  
said Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. ``In 
the end, we'll come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House leaders also decided Thursday to allocate $5 billion of  
the non-Social Security surplus for 2000 for tax relief, which 
would ensure that any 10-year tax cut could begin next year. The 
House is scheduled to consider its tax bill, which features a 10 
percent across-the-board income tax cut, as early as next week.

<HEADLINE> Judge Congratulates Tommy Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- With ex-wife Pamela Anderson Lee and his  
toddler son looking on, tattooed rocker Tommy Lee was congratulated 
by a judge for behaving while on probation for spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Municipal Court Judge Lawrence Mira told the former Motley Crue  
drummer Thursday that he was ``entitled to more confidence than I 
have had in the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge refused a plea by Lee's lawyer to dismiss  
probation restrictions entirely, though he did loosen some rules. 
Lee will now be allowed to be in stores that sell alcohol and he 
can perform in places where alcohol is served. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Lee or the actress spoke to reporters as they left the  
courthouse with 18-month-old Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee was placed on three years' probation after pleading no  
contest in April 1998 to kicking his wife several times during a 
fight while she held their son. The couple split, but have 
reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Lee was on probation for attacking a photographer  
in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Multiplex Creator Durwood Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Stan Durwood, movie theater entrepreneur  
credited with inventing the multiplex theaters that now dot every 
suburban mall, has died. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Durwood, chief executive officer of AMC Entertainment Inc., died  
Wednesday night at his Kansas City home after a long battle with 
esophageal cancer, the company said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City-based AMC has grown into one of the nation's  
largest-grossing theater chains, operating 218 theaters with 2,729 
screens in 23 states and the District of Columbia as well as in 
Hong Kong, Japan, Portugal, Spain and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal,'' Durwood told The Associated Press in a 1996  
interview, ``is to say to the consumer, `We love ya. We really 
appreciate your business. We want to make your stay pleasant and 
fun.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Durwood, whose father and uncle began the business with a few  
theaters in Kansas City, stumbled onto the multiplex idea when he 
tried to open a theater in what is now a Kansas City mall. 
</P>
<P>
	The developer said support columns would not allow a large  
theater. So Durwood came up with the idea of building two small 
theaters next to each other. They opened in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear he didn't quite have the multiplex figured out yet:  
Both screens played the same movie, ``The Great Escape,'' starring 
Steve McQueen and James Garner. But the idea was born, and 
according to AMC, Durwood coined the multiplex name at that time, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
	Durwood's company first built a four-plex in 1966. In 1969 came  
a six-plex. Now, they range up to 30 screens, and the biggest ones 
are known as megaplexes, with amenities such as stadium-style 
seating, large seats with cup holders, and deluxe sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that Stan is an exhibition mogul no different  
than in the times of Jack Warner,'' Tom Sherak, distribution head 
for 20th Century Fox, once said. 
</P>
<P>
	Durwood's father, Edward Dubinsky, and an uncle, Maurice  
Dubinsky, crisscrossed the Midwest near the turn of the century, 
performing melodramas in tent shows. 
</P>
<P>
	They finally settled in Kansas City and opened about a dozen  
movie houses. The family later changed its name to Durwood. Stan 
Durwood joined the family business after returning from military 
service in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	After his father's death in 1960, Durwood steered the growth of  
the company to become today's AMC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	Durwood also was the leading backer of a big redevelopment  
project approved by voters in his hometown last year. The Power &AMP; 
Light District, named for the historic art deco power company 
building in the area, would encompass about 12 square blocks and 
would feature a 30-screen AMC theater, restaurants, live-theater 
venues, shops, hotels, apartments, offices and parking.

<HEADLINE> House Upholds Bill on Mining Limits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats and moderate Republicans are  
winning some battles as Congress moves toward shaping Interior 
Department programs for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 377-47 shortly after midnight this morning to  
approve a $14 billion measure financing federal land and cultural 
programs for the coming fiscal year. The bill fell about $1.2 
billion short of the amount President Clinton requested, cutting 
his requests for land purchases and energy conservation, but 
Democrats and their moderate GOP allies managed a few wins. 
</P>
<P>
	In a victory for environmentalists over Western mining  
interests, the House voted 273-151 to require hard-rock mining 
companies using public lands to obey a 1997 Interior Department 
ruling limiting the size of their waste dumps to five acres per 
20-acre claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is no limitation,'' said Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., of  
pro-mining lawmakers' claims that companies could legally operate 
additional dumps. ``That would be a bad joke on America 
taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the amendment said it was based on a  
misinterpretation of law by overzealous bureaucrats that would hurt 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need these jobs,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont. ``Our  
communities need these jobs, our families need these jobs, our 
schools need these jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-eight Republicans joined 194 Democrats and one  
independent in upholding the limits on waste sites. Voting no were 
eight Democrats and 143 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	A version of the legislation approved by the Senate  
Appropriations Committee would let companies ignore the Interior 
Department ruling, an interpretation of the 1872 law that governs 
mining for gold and other hard-rock minerals on federal lands. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry supporters say the five-acre limitation on waste sites  
is too small for modern techniques, which use chemicals like 
cyanide on vast piles of rock from open-pit mines. Opponents say 
the provision is the only pro-environmental one in the entire 
127-year-old law, which lets companies purchase federal lands for 
$2.50 an acre or lease them for $100 annually per 20-acre claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The House also voted 259-166 to ban the use of steel-jaw traps  
or neck snares for commercial or recreational purposes at the 520 
national wildlife refuges. The Senate bill has no similar language. 
</P>
<P>
	It voted 243-180 to add $13 million to a program that helps  
low-income people insulate and otherwise winterize their homes, 
bringing it to $133 million, the same as this year. It also voted 
225-198 against eliminating a new requirement that states provide 
$1 for every $3 they receive from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the House trimmed $140 million from the  
legislation, part of a continuing effort by Republican leaders to 
satisfy conservatives demanding spending cuts. The reductions would 
come from clean coal and land acquisition programs plus a 0.48 
percent cut in the entire measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts are what ``we have to do to get where we have to be,''  
said House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., chided Republicans for yielding to  
conservatives ``who detest government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other votes Wednesday, the House:  
</P>
<P>
	--By 217-207, rejected an attempt by Democrats and moderate  
Republicans to add $10 million each for the National Endowment for 
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The House 
also defeated a conservative effort to cut the arts endowment by $2 
million by 300-124. The bill would provide NEA with $98 million 
next year, the same as this year and $52 million less than Clinton 
wanted. The NEH would get $111 million, the same as this year and 
$39 million below Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to block new federal regulations that would help Indian  
tribes open gambling casinos over objections by their states. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ordered the National Park Service to redraw its plans for a new  
visitors center at the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania.

	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The United Church of Christ has  
restructured its ministries, but new officers say the changes won't 
affect the liberal church's mission to embrace diversity and preach 
tolerance of differences among its 1.4 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1957, about 600 people have had seats on 10 administrative  
boards. Now there will be about 200 people on four boards called 
ministries, according to Andy Lang, a church spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most significant change ... is the very existence of a  
collegium of offices who together will look at the whole ministry 
of the church,'' said Dale L. Bishop, executive minister of Wider 
Church Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. John H. Thomas was elected general minister and  
president. Edith A. Guffey was elected associate general minister. 
Executive ministers in addition to Bishop are the Rev. Jose A. 
``Joe'' Malayang, Local Church Ministries, and Bernice Powell 
Jackson, Justice and Witness Ministries.

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Membership in the United Methodist  
Church dropped by 38,477 last year, the smallest decline since a 
gradual erosion began three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership now stands at 8.4 million, United Methodist News  
Service reported, down from 11 million when the denomination was 
formed in a two-way merger in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Methodist Church is America's third-biggest  
denomination, behind the Roman Catholic Church and Southern Baptist 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Methodists' annual membership losses varied from 42,761 to  
76,568 in the period from 1989 to 1997.

same basis as physical ailments in insuring its 45,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill gave a ``religious  
advocacy award'' because the church is one of the first U.S. 
denominations to provide such comprehensive coverage. The church 
changed its policy as of Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``The LDS church has provided significant moral leadership,''

	YANKTON, S.D. (AP) -- A man who lost a son to acute alcoholism is  
giving $213,000 in land to a church he doesn't attend. The Rev. 
Jeff Mantz said the First Assembly of God would build a larger 
church on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantz said he and other church members had approached the man  
with the idea of buying some of his land in a growing part of town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sat down for the first 15 minutes, and we answered his  
questions about our need for land,'' Mantz said. ``The rest of the 
time, he asked about our vision and plans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the delegation asked to buy, the landowner said he'd  
donate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The couple had a son who died of acute alcoholism. The man  
said, 'If you can help to win one back from the edge, I will be 
more than repaid,''' Mantz said.

<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Some 50 Roman Catholics, members of the  
National Association of Priest Pilots, flew into Dayton for their 
annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them was the Rev. Jim Kelley, who ministers to 20 Alaskan  
villages and part of the Aleutian Islands. He drops in on each 
village twice a month, landing in fields cleared by locals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether there's one Catholic there or 20 or 50 or 100, I  
stop,'' the 70-year-old pilot-priest said. 
</P>
<P>
	The association was founded in 1964 by two Kentucky priests to  
promote the use of the airplane in evangelical and missionary work. 
Most of its 140 members fly single-engine Pipers or Cessnas. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, the pilots make a financial contribution to someone  
who uses a plane in missionary work, according to the Rev. Mel 
Hemann of Cedar Falls, Iowa. This year, it goes to a priest in the 
Congo, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley, a former Navy chaplain, began flying just after he was  
ordained. He usually flies solo, but he doesn't feel alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``God's there,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Battle Begins for NATO Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- British Aerospace PLC and Saab AB of  
Sweden fired the first salvo Thursday in what is sure to be a 
fierce battle for a $1.5 billion-defense contract from NATO's 
expansion into Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The British-Swedish consortium announced the offer to sell 60  
Gripen jet fighters to Poland just hours before a French delegation 
of defense contractors and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin flew in for 
talks likely to include the airplane deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Such high-level lobbying is part of a European push to make its  
defense industries more competitive against U.S. giants such as 
Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., whose equipment supplied 
NATO's air campaign in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Loath to be trumped on their own continent, European contractors  
are taking on the Americans for the business of NATO's three newest 
members -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- former Warsaw 
Pact nations that need to upgrade their military hardware to NATO 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake are the contracts, along with a major foothold in the  
former Soviet bloc a decade after the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's big money we're talking about,'' said U.S. Embassy  
spokesman Tom Delaney. ``It's highly competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Poles would like to buy 150 aircraft, but lack the money to  
pay now. Their aged fleet of Soviet MiGs requires major 
renovations, and making them compatible with NATO standards is both 
economically and politically unfeasible. 
</P>
<P>
	So Poland asked British Aerospace-Saab, Boeing, Lockheed Martin,  
Dassault of France and DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG of Germany for 
preliminary sales pitches by Wednesday on an initial order of 60 
advanced jet fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace and Saab spoke about their $1.5-billion offer  
Thursday in Poland and Sweden. That offer included 60 new Gripens, 
which normally cost $30 million each or $1.6 billion, and the loan 
of a squadron of 18 Swedish Air Force Gripens to enable Poland to 
make what British Aerospace promised would be a smooth transition 
to NATO-required air power. 
</P>
<P>
	Julian Scopes, the British Aerospace vice president for Central  
Europe, also emphasized that Polish companies would be given 
contracts and training of that matched the value of the jet fighter 
contract. The deal, he said, would ``bring Polish aerospace into 
the heart of European (defense industry) activity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Thursday, Jospin opened a two-day official visit  
accompanied by representatives of Dassault, which makes the Mirage 
fighter and leads a consortium producing the Eurofighter. Boeing 
offers the F-18 and Lockheed Martin the F-16. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. planes have long been the front-runners for the Polish  
contract, but Poland's economic constraints delayed the bidding 
process as has the political issue of choosing a U.S. or European 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	A Warsaw conference on the NATO policy views of the alliance's  
three new members was postponed last week after U.S. objections 
that it would give British Aerospace -- one of the sponsors -- an 
unfair lobbying advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	British Aerospace chief executive officer John Weston and  
British Defense Minister George Robertson were to participate in 
roundtable discussions on NATO policy and European defense issues -- 
without U.S. or Western Europe representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to be sure that it's a transparent process,''  
said Delaney of the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference organizer, Janusz Reiter of the independent  
Center for International Relations in Warsaw, called suggestions 
that the conference was for lobbying ``completely groundless.''

range in Puerto Rico is ``extremely regrettable,'' but live-fire 
training exercises there must continue, Navy Secretary Richard 
Danzig said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The target range on the island of Vieques is uniquely situated  
for the full gamut of Navy and Marine training operations -- far 
superior to 18 alternative sites studied by the Navy since the 
accident, Danzig said at a briefing for reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a national security standpoint, this is an important and  
not replaceable site,'' Danzig said as he presented a Navy study 
that backs continued use of the range. 
</P>
<P>
	David Sanes Rodriguez, a security guard who worked for the Navy,  
was killed April 19, when two 500-pound bombs dropped by a Navy 
FA-18 fighter-bomber missed their target by 1 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Since his death, a small band of protesters has occupied a  
scrubby, pockmarked outcrop of the Vieques range, which is littered 
with dozens of unexploded bombs, artillery shells and grenades. The 
Navy has let the protesters stay, hoping to avoid arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico wants the Navy to stop shelling the 51-square-mile  
island, where 9,000 people live. The Navy controls about two-thirds 
of the island, which lies eight miles east of the main island of 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello was the first witness last week  
before a special four-member Pentagon commission examining the 
Navy's use of the island. Rossello's spokesman, Pedro Rosario 
Urdaz, said Thursday that Puerto Rico will continue its efforts to 
get the Navy out of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``That ( the Navy report's conclusion) was predictable, and it's  
clear that our government is not in agreement with that position,'' 
he said. ``The governor has complete faith that the public policy 
of the government of Puerto Rico will prevail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Navy officials are to present the sea service's position to the  
special commission on July 23. The commission's recommendations to 
Defense Secretary William Cohen are due in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Danzig and the senior Navy and Marine officers who prepared the  
study stressed no civilian has been killed around the range in 
about 50 years of training operations at Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although we had an extremely regrettable (accident) on the  
range, it was on the range and it was a Navy employee,'' Danzig 
said. ``That is, in my standpoint, an important reassurance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the island ``will not put up with one more bullet,'' said  
Alba Encarnacion, director of Vieques Protests, an anti-Navy group 
in Vieques. ``These poor people are not going to continue carrying 
the entire weight of the national defense. We have given 60 years 
and we will give no more. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the people of the Navy were objective people and conscious  
of the damage that they have done to the island of Vieques they 
would leave. ... There have to be hundreds and hundreds of 
uninhabited islands in the world, but this has turned into a matter 
of pride for them.''

<HEADLINE> Gillette Earnings Drop 19 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Shaving giant Gillette Co. blamed overseas  
troubles for a 19 percent drop in second-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which also makes Duracell batteries, saw net income  
drop to $300 million, or 26 cents a share from $372 million, or 33 
cents a share in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the three-month period ending June 30 were $2.41  
billion, a 4 percent increase from the $2.33 billion in sales from 
the second quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said sales would have climbed 9 percent had it not  
been for adverse exchange rates and the divestiture of a cosmetics 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Everett Howe, Gillette's vice president for investor relations,  
called the international markets where Gillette does about 
two-thirds of its business a ``problem area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we're starting to see what I would call a progressive  
improvement around the world,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe also said increased marketing and advertising costs for new  
shaving products and batteries contributed to the earnings drop. 
</P>
<P>
	The report matched the expectations of analysts surveyed by  
First Call Corp., but last month Gillette warned of a sharp 
earnings drop. At the time, Wall Street had been predicting 
earnings of 29 cents-per-share. 
</P>
<P>
	Long known as a steady moneymaker for blue-chip investors,  
Gillette announced in September it would lay off 4,700 employees 
worldwide, or 11 percent of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings announcement was made after the close of the market  
Thursday. Gillette's stock closed at $44.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, up $1.25.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David H. Tomlin has been appointed assistant to  
the president of The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis D. Boccardi, president and chief executive officer of the  
news cooperative, announced Thursday that Tomlin would succeed 
Kelly Tunney, who was named assistant to the president and director 
of corporate communications earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, currently a general executive in the AP's Newspaper  
Membership department, joined the AP as a newsman in Columbus, 
Ohio, in 1970. He later worked in the Raleigh, N.C., and Pittsburgh 
bureaus before being named chief of bureau for South Carolina in 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later he moved to Des Moines, Iowa, as chief of  
bureau for Iowa and Nebraska. In 1988 he transferred to AP 
headquarters in New York, where he has held a variety of executive 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomlin, 53, has also been a reporter and editor at the Newport  
News, Va., Daily Press, and the San Antonio Express-News. A native 
of Providence, R.I., he holds bachelor's and master's degrees in 
international relations from Johns Hopkins University and its

<HEADLINE> Wrigley Field: Shrine Amid Glitz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Whenever a team announces plans to build a new  
ballpark, Chicago Cubs president Andy MacPhail knows his telephone 
will be ringing soon. 
</P>
<P>
	With baseball's new, domed superstructures costing hundreds of  
millions of dollars, planners have to get them right. So what 
better place to start than Wrigley Field, a monument to the game's 
good old days and a case study in aging gracefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever designed it back in 1914 must have possessed a little  
genius,'' MacPhail said. ``There was something about this original 
design that has separated it from some of the older ballparks that 
really, in my view, do need to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are emotional things, too, that make this place  
special,'' he said. ``Its history, its appearance, its proximity to 
a neighborhood and the roots and the people that come around. The 
businesses that surround it outside. The activities that surround 
it outside. The fact that the `L' goes right by right field. The 
fact that you're three or four blocks from Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very unique place on a multitude of levels.''  
</P>
<P>
	Retro ballparks with a high-tech twist are all the rage these  
days. Jacobs Field. Camden Yards. Coors Field. Seattle's Safeco 
Field is the latest state-of-the-art addition, one more piece of 
evidence testifying to Wrigley's distinctiveness. The stadium, 
which opens today for a Mariners-Padres game, has a retractable 
roof and a $517 million price tag, the costliest ballpark ever 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	But while teams try and imitate the nostalgia, Wrigley Field  
remains the real thing. Tucked into a neighborhood on Chicago's 
North Side, it is surrounded by brownstones and neighborhood bars. 
Fans gather on rooftops overlooking right and left field to watch 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The brick walls are covered with ivy, not billboards. The  
scoreboard is still changed by hand. Games are played almost 
exclusively during the day, and fans fill the park no matter how 
the Cubs are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's baseball,'' the Cardinals' Eric Davis said. ``That's  
about as good as it gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Wrigley's charm is its history. Only Fenway Park and  
Tiger Stadium, which both opened on April 20, 1912, are older, and 
there have been countless memorable moments inside the Friendly 
Confines. 
</P>
<P>
	Babe Ruth's called shot in the 1932 World Series. Ernie Banks'  
500th home run. Pete Rose getting his 4,191st hit to match Ty Cobb. 
Jim Vaughn and the Reds' Fred Toney both throwing no-hitters for 
nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lore about the ballpark,'' the Mets' Mike Piazza  
said. ``You hear certain things and you've seen certain things on 
tape that it is kind of neat to actually get to play there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while Tiger Stadium and Fenway Park both are likely to soon  
follow the ghosts of the greats who once played there, any talk of 
touching Wrigley would be heresy. The Cubs and the Tribune Co., 
which owns the team, spend millions each year to maintain the 
structure and feel of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh, sure, there have been some alterations over the years. The  
current scoreboard and bleachers were built in 1937 when the 
outfield was renovated. The clubhouses have been redone. Mezzanine 
boxes were added in 1989, but they were tucked under the upper deck 
and don't stand out like most luxury boxes. And, after much debate, 
lights were added in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wrigley looks and feels pretty much the same as it did when  
Banks and Billy Williams were roaming the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``This place is like a cathedral. It's the baseball version of  
St. Patrick's Cathedral,'' said Ed Lynch, the team's general 
manager and a former Cubs pitcher. ``It's something people have 
seen and been to and have been associated with for not only their 
lifetime but their parents' lifetimes, too. You just cannot replace 
this type of ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs are so protective of Wrigley's pristine image they've  
resisted the advertising frenzy that's consumed most other 
ballparks, even though it means passing up millions in potential 
revenue each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really interested in putting up some jumbo sign in  
right field to get an extra $2 million to devote to the payroll,'' 
MacPhail said. ``I don't think we have to do that to win, and I 
think if you do that, you lessen the uniqueness of Wrigley Field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And taking anything away from Wrigley would be taking away from  
all of baseball. Watching a game there is a window into what 
baseball -- and life -- was like in time gone by. Simple. 
Uncluttered. A respite from reality. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a magic to it, if only for a few hours.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been my favorite place to go to. Always.  
Forever,'' Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``This is a little 
different for me than Tiger, Comiskey and Fenway. It stands out a 
little more. It's the head of the class for some reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put my finger on it, it just seems like it should  
never be touched. It's too much of a treasure.''

<HEADLINE> Two Warner Studio Chiefs Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The curtain will close on the co-leaders of  
Warner Bros.' movie, television and music divisions, ending one of 
Hollywood's longest-running success stories and leaving a huge 
management void for parent Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel, chairmen and co-chief executives  
of Warner Bros. and Warner Music Group, said Thursday they will 
stay until Dec. 31, when their current contracts expire. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men said they wanted to pursue new ventures, but declined  
in an interview to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	They are leaving at a time when Time Warner appears to be on a  
roll, with recent box office successes of films such as ``The 
Matrix'' and the ``Austin Powers'' sequel. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Kubrick's final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' debuts Friday  
and is expected to do well. Earnings for Time Warner were up 8 
percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept asking myself if I wouldn't like to have one more  
challenge in my life,'' said Semel. ``If I was going to do that, 
this is the right time for both my company and myself to take that 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``At what point in your life do you decide you can, if you want,  
to try something else? For me it was when the company was healthy 
and things were going well,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair did, however, suffer a blow at the box office recently  
with the big-budget film ``Wild, Wild West,'' which received poor 
reviews and may make a negligible profit despite a No. 1 opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's music division also has been plagued by slumping  
holdings in recent years, although the first-quarter earnings 
showed a comeback for the division with a 10 percent rise in cash 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
	News of their departure worried Wall Street. Shares of Time  
Warner fell $1.43 3/4, or nearly 2 percent, to $75.87 1/2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's negative,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst  
with Merrill Lynch. ``I think Bob and Terry are the most stable 
management team in entertainment history. They've had a long and 
successful run, but the company is very large and has a great 
breadth of management talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their partnership is unique in the broad scope of their  
responsibilities, which include movies, television and music, and 
that they operate as equals. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two started with the company 20 years ago, the film and  
television group had revenues of less than $1 billion. By the end 
of 1998, it reported revenues of approximately $6 billion. The film 
and television division and Warner Music Group reported combined 
revenues of an estimated $10 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Other successful films during the Daly-Semel era have included  
the ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``Batman'' movies, ``The Killing 
Fields,'' ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Unforgiven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Daly and Semel were successful partly because they  
avoided the infighting and ego conflicts that often mark Hollywood 
business relationships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty rare to have co-chairmen of a major entity, which  
in itself is part of an even larger entity, and not have their own 
egos get in the way of being partners and managing others,'' said 
James Goss, an analyst with Barrington Research Associates. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman and chief executive,  
denied reports of friction over concerns that their 
responsibilities were too broad. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's just not the case. There's never been any friction  
between or amongst us, I can state that clearly,'' said Levin.

<HEADLINE> Approval of Infant Vaccine Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A British drugmaker sought U.S. approval  
Thursday for a new combination vaccine for five childhood diseases 
-- diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, polio and hepatitis B. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham asked the federal government for an expedited  
review for its combination vaccine, which already is available in 
Europe. An expedited review means the government would have six 
months to approve the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that reduces the number of injections will be welcome  
by medical providers and parents,'' said Dr. Melinda Wharton, chief 
of child vaccines at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Infants now need nine shots during their first 12 months of life  
to gain protection against the five diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus are already combined in  
one vaccine, while polio and hepatitis B vaccinations are given 
separately. Each of the vaccinations is given three times in the 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
	With SmithKline's new combination vaccine, year-old infants  
would only need a total of three shots to be protected against the 
five diseases. Other shots would still be necessary to protect 
children against measles, mumps and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pharmaceutical companies are working on combination  
infant immunizations, though SmithKline is the only company seeking 
U.S. approval for a vaccine that protects against five diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trauma of the shots (for parents) is one of the reasons  
people do not show up for vaccines,'' said John Jabara, a 
SmithKline Beecham vice president. ``The introduction of this 
vaccine can really have a positive impact on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline and Merck are also working on a vaccine that would  
combine the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with the shot for 
chicken pox.

<HEADLINE>  Australians Happy As Sampras Sits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Pete Sampras wasn't kidding, after all.  
</P>
<P>
	The Australians barely suppressed their glee Thursday when U.S.  
captain Tom Gullikson made it official at the Davis Cup draw: 
Sampras, arguably the greatest singles player in history, will play 
only doubles in the quarterfinal duel starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras chose team camaraderie over the common sense that his  
presence in singles would make the U.S. team stronger. Gullikson, 
forced to accept that decision, wore the worried look of a man who 
knew he would face a lifetime of second guesses if the gamble 
fails. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a few skeptics expected Gullikson to announce that  
Sampras had changed his mind, or had been persuaded by his 
teammates, to join the singles fray. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Gullikson submitted his lineup at noon -- which cannot  
be changed except for injury -- Sampras was posted in the doubles 
with Alex O'Brien, and Todd Martin and Jim Courier were posted for 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
	After tennis balls bearing the players' names were drawn from  
the magnificent silver Davis Cup, Martin was set to open against 
fast-rising 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt on the hardcourt of the 
Longwood Cricket Club. That match will be followed by Courier vs. 
two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's doubles, Sampras and O'Brien will take on Mark  
Woodforde and Sandon Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Martin is scheduled to play Rafter before Courier  
takes on Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sensitive as far as being here this week,'' said  
Sampras, who originally hadn't planned on playing Davis Cup this 
year, but changed his mind after being inspired by the U.S. team's 
victory over Britain in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what Jim and Todd did in England, the last thing I  
wanted to do was kind of come along and jump on the bandwagon. That 
is why I have said for the past couple of months that I was just 
going to play doubles. Jim and Todd deserve to play singles. They 
have shown, not only this year but the past couple of years, their 
commitment to Davis Cup. I haven't been in the same boat. ... I 
just never felt comfortable, two months ago, a month ago. I don't 
feel comfortable now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the decision was made by ``consensus'' of all the  
players and himself. Martin said he would have stepped aside if 
Gullikson thought that would make the team better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have come to a decision that I think most of the  
guys are very comfortable with, and we will make the most of it,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel good about it,'' Gullikson said, not very  
convincingly. ``I feel good about it. The players feel good about 
it. If other people don't feel good about it, that is their 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians certainly feel good about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Australian captain John Newcombe said if he had been in  
Gullikson's shoes with, say, Rafter making a decision like Sampras, 
he would never have considered benching Rafter in singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't like to be in Gully's shoes if we win, either,''  
Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde, one of the world's best doubles players, thought  
Sampras would have a difficult time adjusting to doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he is one of the best singles players around at the  
moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to be a 
great doubles player,'' Woodforde said. ``I think, given the 
opportunity to play more matches, sure, he definitely could be with 
that serve. It is a big, big plus. I just can't see how he can just 
walk out there and believe he can play good doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde's regular doubles partner, Todd Woodbridge, is  
injured, but Stolle has plenty of experience playing doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras didn't seem too worried about not having played doubles  
much. He's won only two doubles titles in his career -- in 1995 with 
Martin on the grass at Queen's Club, and in 1989 with Courier on 
clay in Rome. He's 3-1 in Davis Cup doubles, the loss coming with 
Martin against Woodforde and Woodbridge on hardcourt in Washington 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still the same sport out there -- keep it in the lines  
and serve big and return well,'' Sampras said. ``I have practiced 
quite a bit with Alex this week, and I think we feel pretty good. I 
can play good doubles. I know I can. So I think we are going to be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-five match format will put a lot of pressure on  
Sampras and O'Brien if the opening singles are split. But Newcombe 
thought the opening match -- Martin vs. Hewitt -- would be the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the draw came out very well for us,'' Newcombe said.  
``It is a must-win situation for them in that first match, which 
puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Todd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will have the added pressure knowing that he is on the  
court instead of Sampras, who is fresh from winning his sixth 
Wimbledon title, and that, on paper, he is expected to beat Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some anxious moments for them in that first  
match,'' Newcombe said. ``If we lose the first match, we are not 
going to be as worried as they will be if they lose the first 
match.''

fast-rising 18-year-old Lleyton Hewitt on the hardcourt of the 
Longwood Cricket Club. That match will be followed by Courier vs. 
two-time U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday's doubles, Sampras and O'Brien will take on Mark  
Woodforde and Sandon Stolle. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Martin is scheduled to play Rafter before Courier  
takes on Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very sensitive as far as being here this week,'' said  
Sampras, who originally hadn't planned on playing Davis Cup this 
year, but changed his mind after being inspired by the U.S. team's 
victory over Britain in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``After what Jim and Todd did in England, the last thing I  
wanted to do was kind of come along and jump on the bandwagon. That 
is why I have said for the past couple of months that I was just 
going to play doubles. Jim and Todd deserve to play singles. They 
have shown, not only this year but the past couple of years, their 
commitment to Davis Cup. I haven't been in the same boat. ... I 
just never felt comfortable, two months ago, a month ago. I don't 
feel comfortable now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullikson said the decision was made by ``consensus'' of all the  
players and himself. Martin said he would have stepped aside if 
Gullikson thought that would make the team better. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we have come to a decision that I think most of the  
guys are very comfortable with, and we will make the most of it,'' 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all feel good about it,'' Gullikson said, not very  
convincingly. ``I feel good about it. The players feel good about 
it. If other people don't feel good about it, that is their 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Australians certainly feel good about it.  
</P>
<P>
	Australian captain John Newcombe said if he had been in  
Gullikson's shoes with, say, Rafter making a decision like Sampras, 
he would never have considered benching Rafter in singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't like to be in Gully's shoes if we win, either,''  
Newcombe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde, one of the world's best doubles players, thought  
Sampras would have a difficult time adjusting to doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously he is one of the best singles players around at the  
moment, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is going to be a 
great doubles player,'' Woodforde said. ``I think, given the 
opportunity to play more matches, sure, he definitely could be with 
that serve. It is a big, big plus. I just can't see how he can just 
walk out there and believe he can play good doubles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodforde's regular doubles partner, Todd Woodbridge, is  
injured, but Stolle has plenty of experience playing doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras didn't seem too worried about not having played doubles  
much. He's won only two doubles titles in his career -- in 1995 with 
Martin on the grass at Queen's Club, and in 1989 with Courier on 
clay in Rome. He's 3-1 in Davis Cup doubles, the loss coming with 
Martin against Woodforde and Woodbridge on hardcourt in Washington 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still the same sport out there -- keep it in the lines  
and serve big and return well,'' Sampras said. ``I have practiced 
quite a bit with Alex this week, and I think we feel pretty good. I 
can play good doubles. I know I can. So I think we are going to be 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-five match format will put a lot of pressure on  
Sampras and O'Brien if the opening singles are split. But Newcombe 
thought the opening match -- Martin vs. Hewitt -- would be the key. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the draw came out very well for us,'' Newcombe said.  
``It is a must-win situation for them in that first match, which 
puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Todd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin will have the added pressure knowing that he is on the  
court instead of Sampras, who is fresh from winning his sixth 
Wimbledon title, and that, on paper, he is expected to beat Hewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be some anxious moments for them in that first  
match,'' Newcombe said. ``If we lose the first match, we are not 
going to be as worried as they will be if they lose the first 
match.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Co. Guilty in Toothbrush Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- A Texas company has been found guilty of  
illegally selling pesticides used to sanitize floors and silverware 
for use in disinfecting toothbrushes used by American Indian 
children in a Head Start program. 
</P>
<P>
	Friendly Systems Inc. of Irving, Texas, was found guilty in  
federal court Wednesday of three counts of selling products with 
claims they could be used for purposes different than those stated 
on its EPA-approved labels. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty is $200,000 on each count. Asked about an  
appeal, Mark Werbner, a lawyer for Friendly Systems, said: ``We'll 
have to discuss that. I'm not sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the sales happened three times between November  
1995 and March 1997. The pesticides, Tisan and DDS-164, were being 
used to sanitize children's toothbrushes at the Rosebud Sioux 
Tribe's Head Start centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The products are approved for sanitizing floors, walls, tables  
and kitchen items such as glasses and silverware, but they are not 
registered for killing germs on toothbrushes. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents have said 100 or more children were exposed to the  
chemicals and many have developed medical problems such as 
nosebleeds, excessive fatigue, chest and joint pains, headaches, 
tooth decay and blisters around the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Head Start programs are meant to benefit preschool children  
whose parents are on public assistance or whose income is below the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Randy Seiler characterized the company  
and its saleswoman as too intent on making a sale to worry about 
the safety of children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does it make sense that a product that is used for cleaning  
urinals is safe for cleaning toothbrushes for children in South 
Dakota?'' he asked. ``These claims substantially differ from the 
registration and the label.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Werbner said the government had not proven a substantial  
difference between the pesticides' approved use of cleaning 
silverware, for instance, and toothbrushes, which also go in the 
mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann said sentencing won't  
happen until at least Oct. 4.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Rise on West Coast Woes Oil Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Crude oil futures finished above $20 a barrel  
for the second time in three days on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange amid concern about new refinery problems in the important 
West Coast market. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors said cargos were being shifted to California as  
Chevron made heavy cash purchases because of problems at its 
Richmond, Calif., refinery near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron's 65,000 barrel-a-day gas-making unit was shut down over  
the weekend because of mechanical trouble. A fire in March also 
reduced gasoline production at the plant. The new problem means 
production now has been reduced by about 70 percent, Chevron said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The California market, which is the single-busiest for  
consumption of cleaner-burning gasoline, has been hit by a spate of 
refinery problems this year that has sent prices soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	August crude rose 24 cents to $20.16 a barrel; August unleaded  
gasoline rose 2.19 cents to 61.70 cents a gallon; August heating 
oil rose 1 cent to 51.73 cents a gallon; August natural gas rose 
3.3 cents to $2.179 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in  
August rose 9 cents to $19.03 a barrel at the International 
Petroleum Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Brewers Postpone Game After Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE, Wis. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Brewers postponed their  
game tonight in a gesture of respect to three workers who died when 
a huge crane collapsed while handling a portion of the roof for the 
team's new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Five others were injured Wednesday afternoon when the crane  
broke in half as it lifted the 400-ton load. It crumbled into the 
partially completed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The 567-foot crane, nicknamed ``Big Blue,'' was lowering a piece  
of Miller Park's $400 million retractable roof into place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like two bombs going off,'' said Gary Craig, who lives  
nearby. ``When I went outside I looked around and saw the 
helicopters hovering over the stadium, and I could see that the 
crane was gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The names of thee victims were not released. Only one of the  
injured -- the 64-year-old crane operator who fell up to 30 feet -- 
remained hospitalized today. He was listed in stable condition with 
a broken hip and broken shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers used used dogs and searchlights to search the rubble  
for any other victims until late Wednesday, but none were found, 
Deputy Fire Chief Gerald Frank said. No one known to be at the site 
was unaccounted for, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cause of the accident has not been determined, winds  
were gusting to 26 mph at the time the crane fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers, who play in adjacent Milwaukee County Stadium and  
will move to Miller Park, postponed their scheduled game against 
the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a game, baseball,'' Mayor John Norquist said. ``What  
happened today was death, and that's horrible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Fleming, a mayoral spokesman, said the accident caused  
significant damage to the 43,000-seat stadium, scheduled to open 
next season. He said he did not know how long it would set the 
project back. 
</P>
<P>
	The crane, built by Neil F. Lampson Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., is  
the largest in North America and one of four of its size in the 
world, a designer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, several Miller Park workers were injured when a  
steel girder being lowered into position collided with an aerial 
basket. On May 10, a worker was hospitalized for a week after 
falling 60 feet from the roof.

<HEADLINE> ValuJet Suspects Surrender to FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The three men indicted in the deadly 1996 ValuJet  
crash in the Everglades surrendered Thursday, with one defendant 
again saying he was ordered to sign forms allowing mislabeled 
oxygen canisters onto the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't our call. It wasn't my responsibility,'' said Mauro  
Valenzuela, who was a mechanic with the airline maintenance company 
SabreTech Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela, SabreTech mechanic Eugene Florence and Daniel  
Gonzalez, SabreTech's former vice president of maintenance, arrived 
at FBI headquarters, accompanied by their lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three later appeared in federal court and were released on  
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The men are charged with conspiracy and making false statements  
that led to the crash that killed 110 people. Investigators say the 
oxygen canisters, mislabeled as empty, started a fire in the cargo 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	``They never thought those used generators would get on an  
airplane. They should not have gotten on an airplane. They took 
steps to keep them off airplanes,'' said Jane Moscowitz, the lawyer 
for the two mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	She did not elaborate on what steps they took.  
</P>
<P>
	Valenzuela reiterated previous assertions that he had been told  
to sign the document that allowed the canisters to be loaded onto 
the flight by ValuJet employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't my intent (to falsify documents). I was told to,''  
he said before disappearing into the FBI building. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, SabreTech has been charged with murder and  
manslaughter for illegally packaging the oxygen canisters, which 
also were missing the required yellow safety caps. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three men could be sentenced to up to 55 years in  
prison and fined $2.7 million if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	This is believed to be the first time that criminal charges have  
been filed against maintenance workers over a U.S. plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscowitz called the crash ``a terrible tragedy'' but said no  
crime was committed. ``The important thing is they made no 
intentional false statement,'' she said. ``There was a whole system 
of terrible errors here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez's lawyer, Robert Dunlap, said: ``We have faith in the  
system. We look forward to being exonerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ValuJet changed its name to AirTran after the crash. SabreTech  
is no longer in the aircraft maintenance business. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, 54, recently has been working as a maintenance  
supervisor for American Airlines in Tulsa, Okla. He has been placed 
on leave pending resolution of his case, Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence and Valenzuela lost their mechanic certificates in 1997  
as a result of the FAA's review of the crash of Flight 592. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence, 37, regained his certification in 1998 and recently  
left a job as a mechanic in Georgia, Moscowitz said, although she 
refused to say whether it involved work on airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said they have no record to indicate Valenzuela,  
30, had applied to have his license reinstated.

<HEADLINE> Fed: ATM Fees Rise Substantially </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More and more banks are offering free  
checking. But they're making up for the lost revenue through higher 
ATM fees, according to a new report to Congress by the Federal 
Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank, which compiles a similar report on bank fees  
every year, found that automated teller machine fees charged by 
banks and savings and loans increased significantly from 1997 to 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of banks and savings and loans offering free  
checking accounts, which don't pay interest but impose no fees, 
also increased sharply over the year, the Fed noted in the report 
released Thursday. Banks with free checking jumped from 3 percent 
in 1997 to 17 percent last year; thrifts increased from 7 percent 
to 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found substantial increases by banks in: overdraft  
charges for checks (an average increase of 90 cents, to $16.65); 
fees that banks charge their customers for using another bank's ATM 
(an increase of 4 cents-7 cents, to $1.10); and ATM surcharges, 
which banks charge people to use their ATMs if they are not 
customers of that bank (an increase of 6 cents, to $1.20). 
</P>
<P>
	Fees that savings and loans charge their customers for using  
another institution's ATM increased by 7 cents-8 cents to 
$1.05-$1.07, while ATM surcharges rose an average of 11 cents to 
$1.15. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found no significant increases by banks or thrifts  
for other kinds of fees, however, such as those on checking and 
savings accounts and for stop-payment orders on checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks continue to be a great value for consumers looking for  
the best combination of price, service and convenience,'' said 
Patricia Boerger, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed also found that in 1998, as in previous years, most of  
the fees charged by big banks operating in several states -- 
including those created by mergers -- were significantly higher than 
those levied by smaller banks. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, big banks charged an average $5.21 more for  
stop-payment orders on checks than smaller banks and about $4.50 
more for insufficient funds for checks and overdrafts, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes amid a wave of bank mergers, with New England  
powerhouses Fleet Financial Group Inc. and BankBoston Corp. the 
latest big institutions to announce a marriage. It would create the 
nation's eighth-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates have criticized as excessive the fees that  
banks charge consumers for accounts, ATM machines and credit cards, 
and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has expressed concern over rising 
bank fees in congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bank fees are still increasing and big banks are charging  
bigger fees. It's a serious problem for consumers,'' Edmund 
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer group has found similar increases in ATM fees in  
its recent surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's report also found:  
</P>
<P>
	-- As in the previous year, the proportion of banks and savings  
and loans with ATMs that impose ATM surcharges rose substantially. 
It increased an average 17 to 18 percentage points, to 78 percent 
of banks and 57 percent of thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Only 5 percent of banks and 4 percent of savings and loans  
charge a fee to issue ATM cards to customers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The minimum balance required to open a passbook savings  
account at savings and loans, for which customers are charged no 
fee if they keep a minimum balance and one monthly fee otherwise, 
increased by an average of $33, to $114. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was based on data from about 700 banks and 350  
savings and loans. The margin of error was plus or minus 5 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Some figures, such as the increases in some fees charged by  
banks and savings and loans, are reported in a range because they 
represent banks in different categories such as small, medium and 
large.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Earnings Drop 21 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. reported Thursday its  
second-quarter earnings fell 21 percent as lingering economic 
problems and the discovery of contaminated Coke products in Europe 
depressed the soft drink maker's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings report, which met Wall Street's expectations,  
closed out a difficult quarter for Coke. But analysts noted that 
the company nonetheless made nearly $1 billion in the three months 
ending June 30 and said the Coke brand is still a world power. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all be so lucky to have Coke's problems,'' said John  
Sicher, editor-publisher of Beverage Digest in Greenwich, Conn. 
``And as economic conditions in many of these markets improve, 
there is no doubt in my mind that Coke will return to healthy 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the three months came to $942 million, or 38  
cents per share, down from $1.19 billion, or 48 cents per share, in 
the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors responded positively, boosting Coke's stock price  
$2.12 1/2 to $64 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's really going on is that people are beginning to look  
ahead,'' said Skip Carpenter, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette in New York. ``Clearly, the business was hit hard ... but 
the stock market tends to look a year off, and the markets are 
starting to stabilize and the company is poised to be in a stronger 
position than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola's quarterly revenue rose to $5.38 billion, up 4  
percent from $5.15 billion a year earlier, even though worldwide 
unit case volume -- a standard industry measure representing 24 
eight-ounce servings -- dropped 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The revenue figures are actually higher than expected, and  
that is pleasing,'' said Bank of America Securities analyst David 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke had earlier warned that sales would be off during the  
quarter because of continuing economic problems overseas. 
Thursday's report said that while second-quarter unit case volume 
declined 2 percent in the Middle and Far East, economic conditions 
appear to have leveled off or shown improvement in many parts of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	In Latin America, case volume was even with year-earlier  
numbers. Case volume fell 1 percent in both North America and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke also attributed the drop in earnings to the withdrawal of  
its products from markets in Belgium and France after hundreds of 
people complained of illness from drinking its beverages. Coke 
recalled its products in those countries and faced restrictions on 
sales elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also recalled nearly 8 million bottles of its  
beverages after a consumer in Poland discovered mold in a bottle of 
Bonaqa mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been criticized for a slow response to the  
contamination in Europe. Coke took out newspaper ads to apologize 
and chairman and chief executive officer M. Douglas Ivester went to 
Europe to reassure customers. On Friday, the company planned to 
give away free products in Belgian supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
	The apologies continued in Thursday's earnings announcement,  
with Ivester saying, ``the Coca-Cola system is diligently working 
to rebuild the trust of our customers and consumers, and we remain 
very optimistic about the future of our business in Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivester and several Coke executives plan a trip to New York next  
week to meet with investors and stock analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company is still very profitable, very strong and a very  
sound organization,'' Carpenter said. ``And it has never been in a 
stronger strategic and competitive standpoint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Coca-Cola's net income was  
$1.69 billion, or 68 cents per share, down 18 percent from $2.05 
billion, or 82 cents per share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month revenues were up 2 percent from $9.6 billion last year  
to $9.8 billion.

<HEADLINE> Profits Predicted for Nissan by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The former Renault executive in  
charge of reviving Nissan Motor Co. said Thursday that he hopes to 
have the ailing Japanese automaker profitable again next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Ghosn, who took over the turnaround effort July 1 as  
Nissan's new chief operating officer, is on a two-week tour of the 
company's U.S. operations as part of his effort to develop a 
revival plan by late September. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nissan will have to come back to profit very quickly,'' he  
told a group of auto writers at Nissan's U.S. research and 
development center near Detroit. ``When I say quickly, I'm saying 
specifically the year 2000. I think the year 1999 is already, 
unfortunately, in the red.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brazilian-born Ghosn (pronounced GOHN), dubbed ``Le Cost  
Killer'' for his successful efficiency drive at French automaker 
Renault SA, was dispatched to Tokyo after Renault agreed in March 
to invest $5.4 billion to gain a 36.8 percent stake in the 
debt-ridden Nissan. After two weeks on the job, he said he was 
convinced the company is eager to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, people have been very open,'' he said. ``Very open,  
very candid, with a lot of sense of responsibility and a lot of 
sense that we will not have a lot of chances. We don't have a lot 
of time to fix Nissan's problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan's U.S. sales have been improving lately; sales were up 8  
percent in the first half of the year. The automaker has an 
aggressive plan to introduce a series of new models over the next 
few years, with an emphasis on light trucks -- the market's most 
profitable segment. 
</P>

	Ghosn said Nissan may even decide to enter the full-size pickup  
segment, which has been the highly profitable domain of Detroit's 
automakers. It would join Toyota Motor Corp., which recently 
introduced a large pickup built in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success in the U.S. is not important for Nissan, it's  
vital for Nissan,'' he said. ``Nissan has much more potential in 
the U.S. than what's it's delivering today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ghosn plans to announce his turnaround plan in October before  
the Tokyo auto show. He said it will be based in large part on what 
Nissan employees have identified as problems and solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	He hinted that Nissan may have to close or sell plants outside  
the United States if sales do not increase quickly. Nissan's only 
wholly owned U.S. plant is in Smyrna, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have overinvested for what we sell,'' he said. ``This is a  
cost that we cannot bear, especially if this overcapacity leads to 
long-term overcapacity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A priority will be improving relations with Nissan's parts  
suppliers to cut costs and encourage more innovation and 
cooperation in developing new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also needs to be more innovative and create a more  
consistent design and styling theme with its new vehicles, he said. 
Once considered a trendsetter with such cars as the Datsun 240Z, 
Nissan in the last decade has been known more for blandness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made some great cars. We have made cars which are not  
so great,'' he said. ``We will have to bring back the attractive 
cars that our customers are asking us to show. And I think we have 
the potential.''
