<HEADLINE> US, Britain Not Allow Nationals back to Afghanistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Britain
are reluctant to send their nationals who work with the United
Nations back to Afghanistan because of bad security conditions
there, according to a report by the News Network International
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British governments fear that these people would
be the targets of attacks by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi billionaire
who was accused by Washington of masterminding the bombings of its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August, in which more than
200 people were killed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bombings triggered U.S. cruise missile attacks on the
alleged terrorist camps run by Laden in the Afghan province of
Khost on August 20 last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pulled out all of its international staff
from the war-torn country the day after the U.S. strike.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban said on February 13 that Laden had left Afghanistan
and his whereabouts remained unknown. However, the U.S. government
said this was doubtful.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. office here announced last Saturday that the U.N.
international staff will soon return to Afghanistan to continue
their work.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Taliban signed a security protocol
on October 24, 1998 and have met to discuss security issues in the
Afghan cities of Kandahar and Kabul, as well as the Pakistani
capital of Islamabad.

The U.S. and British governments were not satisfied with the

<HEADLINE> Germany Rejects Naming Caretaker EU Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The German government on Thursday
expressed its backing for naming a new European Union (EU)
Commission serving a full five-year term in stead of appointing a
caretaker executive body.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, in a statement to the
parliament, said it was of little sense to appoint a new
commission to stay in office until next year.
</P>
<P>
"If the EU doesn't do its homework in the current situation, it
would appear incapable of acting and politically split, and this
would lead to a regression into national selfishness," added the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed that Germany's top priority was to request the
EU members to pass Agenda 2000, a reform package covering the EU's
budget, and farm and development aid spending for the years from
2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
Fischer believed that a compromise on reforms, the top issue at
next week's EU summit, is "now more urgent than ever." "This is a
historic challenge, and a failure would be a disastrous signal,"
said the minister, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.

<HEADLINE> Pak Urges Thailand to Support Its Bid for ASEAN's Full Dialogue Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Thursday sought
support of Thailand to secure status of full dialogue partner of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Siddique Khan Kanju said
that Pakistan wanted to graduate from its present status of
sectoral dialogue partner to a full dialogue partner of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan can contribute and benefit from the great interaction
with ASEAN countries, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony of a bilateral agreement with
visiting Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra, Kanju
said, "We feel we can contribute and also benefit from great
interaction with our partners in Southeast Asia through active
participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum."
</P>
<P>
He said trade between Pakistan and Thailand at present is
limited to a few items in spite of the availability of a wide
range of exportable products on both sides.
</P>
<P>
There is also a large imbalance between bilateral exports and
imports which would require adjustments "as we move to expand our
bilateral trade and strengthen economic cooperation," said Kanju.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is satisfied that the two sides have agreed to
diversify and further expand the bilateral trade by encouraging
interaction between the business communities of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to sign an agreement between our respective
chambers of commerce and industry would further bolster the
existing commercial links," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kanju said Pakistan welcomed joint investment and joint
ventures in the private as well as public sectors which could draw
upon the relative strengths of both economies.
</P>
<P>
The signing of an agreement for promotion and protection of
investment between the two countries would go a long way in
boosting the bilateral investment activity in each other's
country.
</P>
<P>
Kanju said that since the two economies face similar challenges
in the wake of globalization, Pakistan will welcome coordination
and consultation between the two countries on the whole range of
trade and economic issues at international fora such as World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan can serve as a bridgehead between the ASEAN region and
Central and South Asia, Kanju said, adding that "we can provide
the most feasible route between the resource-rich Central Asia and
the economic powerhouses of Southeast Asia."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, Pakistan can provide access to the
large markets of South Asia both for trade and investment.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Gives Priority to Children: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will always
give priority to the development of children though the country is
now facing with its most severe economic crisis in decades, Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After presiding over a meeting to outline government policies
on the development of Thai children toward the year 2000, Chuan
said that the government will not put the economic crisis as an
excuse to reduce children's opportunities to develop themselves,
especially in education and health.
</P>
<P>
The government has not and will not cut budgets earmarked for
the development of children, namely, a program to purchase milk
for school children, the prime minister pledged.
</P>
<P>
The government will introduce and implement rules and
regulations that will always facilitate the development and
protection of children, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chuan urged parents to fully play their role in
inculcating their children to understand and appreciate values of
Thai culture and traditions and in training them to realize proper
duties and responsibilities so that they would grow up as mentally
strong and mature adults in the future.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the government had drafted an action plan
on the development of Thai children and youth for the year
2000-2001, which will serve as a new policy guideline for
government agencies and private organizations involved.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan emphasizes two main areas, including contingent
programs to ease negative impacts on children and youth caused by
the ongoing economic crisis such as stress and drug addictions,
and continual programs on sustainable development of children and
youth.
</P>
<P>
Initiatives, namely, campaigns to promote happiness and warm
understanding among family members, as well as plans to promote
unity, harmony and strength within communities were also included
in the action plan.

<P>
BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Vice-premier Li Lanqing has urged
government offices at all levels to make an effort to ensure that
there are no outbreaks of epidemic diseases in China as a result
of last summer's severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came today at a Beijing tele-conference where Li
warned that China faces a serious challenge from epidemic diseases
in spite of its great victory in the struggle against floodwaters
in the Yangtze, Nenjiang, and Songhua river valleys.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, he said, all epidemic diseases reported in
flooded areas had been brought under control and no further
serious outbreaks were reported.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that special attention should be paid to clean water
and food supplies in the formerly flooded areas and that health
authorities must keep a close look-out for any signs of outbreaks.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Thailand Thursday
signed an agreement to promote investment between the two
countries here at the conclusion of the first meeting of the
Pak-Thai Joint Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra, who
led the Thai delegation, termed the joint commission's first
meeting here "a big milestone" in Thai-Pak relations in his
opening statement at the signing ceremony of the Agreement for
Promotion and Protection of Investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement is "another effective mechanism" in
strengthening bilateral investment cooperation between Thailand
and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is keen to invest in deep sea fisheries, tourism,
education, science and technology in Pakistan, the Thai minister
said, adding that it is particularly interested in undertaking
some "meaningful projects" in the field of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Noting the volume of trade between the two sides is far below
the existing potential, Sukhumbhand also stressed the need for
"more trade and close cooperation" to tap the existing avenues.
</P>
<P>
He said his country wants to export electric goods, synthetic
garments, footwear, rubber, textile and food products to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand arrived here Tuesday to attend the first meeting of
the joint commission, which was set up in 1997 in a bid to promote
bilateral economic relations, and held talks with the Pakistani
delegation headed by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs
Siddique Khan Kanju.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Eyes Increasing Trade Ties with Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan
William B. Milam stressed here Thursday that Pakistani-U.S.
bilateral trade should be increased.
</P>
<P>
Private sectors in the two countries should accelerate their
efforts for promoting two-way trade, the U.S. envoy said during
his visit to the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Interaction between the business communities should be
increased through exchange of delegations and participation in
trade fairs and exhibitions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Baser Daud, President of Islamabad Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (ICCI) said that trade volume between Pakistan and
the United States at present was about 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the bilateral trade should be increased
through more active interaction between the businessmen of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the key problem blocking the economic recovery of
Pakistan is the enormous foreign and domestic debts which are
consuming up to 95 percent of the country's GDP for debt-servicing.
</P>
<P>
Daud urged the United States to help Islamabad by writing off
its external debts.

<HEADLINE> UK Pledges Elimination of Child Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Thursday pledged to wipe out child poverty within 20 years by
reforming the welfare system.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech aimed at putting welfare reform back on
top of his political agenda, the prime minister said he wants to
make the welfare state popular again.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his Labor Party has "a historic aim" to be the
first generation to end child poverty for ever through "a 20-year
mission."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the government has embarked on a process of
radical welfare reform which has already seen major changes.
</P>
<P>
The way to reform welfare is "not to dismantle it, or to
protect it unchanged, but to reform it radically -- taking its
core values and applying them to the modern world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said government spending on children is rising by
more than 6 billion pounds (10 billion U.S. dollars) over this
Parliament period and 700,000 children will be lifted out of
poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said the changes already introduced by the government --
including the working families tax credit and the new deal for the
jobless -- has been hugely successful.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Reporters Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Five Zambian local reporters of
the Post newspaper appeared in the Lusaka Magistrate Court
Thursday before principal resident magistrate Edward Zulu on
charge of espionage. They have been granted bail.
</P>
<P>
Another reporter failed to appear in court due to illness.
</P>
<P>
Defense Counsel, Sakwiba Sikota, applied for bail, saying the
reporters were compliant to the law by their appearance in court.
</P>
<P>
Sikota pleaded with Zulu not to send the reporters into
custody, saying doing so would be tantamount to reversing the High
Court ruling in which the six reporters were released following a
successful habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
Espionage is a criminal offense and non-bailable. The reporters
could be jailed up to over 20 years if found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Divisional prosecution officer, John katongo, did not object to
the application for bail.
</P>
<P>
He said while the police had powers to arrest the reporters
even without a warrant of arrest, the state had decided to send
summons to them so that they could appear in court on their own.
</P>
<P>
However, Katongo said the outcome of the habeas corpus had no
bearing on the current proceedings in the magistrate court as the
accused persons had been charged afresh.
</P>
<P>
The six reporters were arrested last week over the publication
of an article in the Post issue 1183 of Tuesday, March 9, 1999 --
Angola worries Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The article said Zambia is in no position to withstand a
military attack from Angola, and that in the story there are some
details on the country's military force.
</P>
<P>
The six reporters were initially arrested on March 9 before the
High Court which set them free after the habeas corpus
application.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the police service released in Lusaka
Wednesday said the six reporters have been issued and served with
summons requiring them to appear before the court.

<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people paid their
respects on Thursday at the funeral of Catholic human rights
lawyer Rosemary Nelson in the Northern Irish town of Lurgan.
</P>
<P>
Among the mourners were Irish President Mary McAleese, comedian
Jeremy Hardy, and British lawyers Michael Mansfield and Gareth
Peirce.
</P>
<P>
Nelson died in a car-bomb blast near her home in Lurgan, Co
Armagh, on Monday. The Red Hand Defenders, a Protestant
paramilitary group, later claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Nelson had helped Catholic residents of Portadown stop
traditionalist Protestants marching through their enclave of
Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
Black flags flew from a nationalist housing estate close to the
town center, where many residents revered Nelson as a champion of
their rights, BBC television reported.
</P>
<P>
The funeral followed a night of violence between loyalists and
nationalists in nearby Portadown on Wednesday. There were reports
saying 38 police officers were injured after police intervened to
stop the rioting. The clashes died down early Thursday morning.

KIEV, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ukrainian official Thursday
rejected the allegation that Ukraine will soon become a member of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), describing it as a
"provocation."
</P>
<P>
The rumor had been concocted to mislead Ukraine's balance-

He quoted President Leonid Danilovich Kuchma as saying that at

</P>
<P>
However, Gorbulin noted that Ukraine, under the United Nations
Charter, has the right to become a member of any military or
political organization though it has not yet presented an official
application for NATO membership so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on NATO to take into consideration the
interests and concerns of all European countries in its expansion
process, saying that Ukraine supports the establishment of a new
European security system.

PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo Albanian delegates will
sign at 18:30 local time the peace agreement presented by the
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, said the French Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegates will leave Paris after signing the

</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Albanian delegation, Veton Surroi, said
that after the delegates signs the agreement, they would consider

Some members of the delegation will go to Washington to meet

meet with NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Serb delegation still refuses to sign this
agreement, which expects the deployment of up to 28,000 NATO
troops in Kosovo to guarantee the implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group is expected to give the Serbs two or three
more days for ``reflexion,'' said Western diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the talks with Serbs could resume either
on Tuesday or in the middle of next week in Paris, and the Serb
delegation is expected to come only for the purpose of signing the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, are expected to
announce the prolonging of talks with the Serbs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States State Department spokesman James Rubin said
on Thursday that the use of force against the Serbs is not the
objective of the international community, even though Belgrade
should bear consequences for the failure of the talks.
</P>
<P>
``Nobody wants to use military force, this is nobody's
objective. The objective is to have a peace agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has
talked on the phone with the chief members of the Albanian
delegation, encouraging them to ``stay united through this
difficult period.''

<HEADLINE> German Corporate Tax to Cut to 35 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 18 (xinhua)--Germany's corporate tax rate will be
cut to 35 per cent from year 2000, Economics Minister and acting
Finance Minister Werner Mueller told the parliament on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mueller expected German business to " definitely prepare for
corporate taxes next year which will be 35 per cent at the
highest,"
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is cutting the tax rate from 45
per cent to 40 per cent under the first stage of his tax reform
this year.
</P>
<P>
After the resignation of ex-Finance Minister Oscar Lafontaine,
who insisted cutting tax rate should depend on the tax revenue
development, calls for cutting corporate tax rate are growing
within Schroeder's coalition.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Clement, North Rhine-Westphalia state premier and an
important role in Schroeder's governing Social Democratic Party
(SPD), has called for slashing corporate tax rate to 28 per cent.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was backed by the Greens Party, junior partner in
Bonn's coalition which also favors deeper cuts for personal income
taxes.

<HEADLINE> Proteins in Tears, Saliva And Urine Kills HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A team of scientists from New
York University said that tears, saliva and urine of pregnant
women all contain proteins that may kill AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
Reporting in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences, they said that a protein, called lysozyme they isolated,
was able to kill the AIDS virus quickly in laboratory conditions.
</P>
<P>
They also isolated another protein called ribonucleases, this
protein could work by breaking down the outer membrane of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
The scientists speculated that pregnancy prompts a woman's body
to make more virus-killing proteins to protect the developing baby
from viruses and bacteria. However the exact reasons why they kill
AIDS virus still need further study, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The same proteins may be found in mother's milk, white blood
cells and chicken egg white, and the lysozyme was found in saliva
and tears. This may explain why HIV is not transmitted by casual
kissing.

<HEADLINE> U.S.Trade Deficit Hits Record High in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit soared
to a record 17 billion dollars in January from 14.06 dollars in
December as imports were climbing to record highs, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the trade deficit shot up 21 percent
from December's level and surpassed the old monthly record of 16.7
billion dollars set last August.
</P>
<P>
With the loss of markets for U.S. exporters, the plunge in
currency values and recessions overseas triggered a flood of
products into the United States, which has continued to post
strong economic growth despite the global troubles.
</P>
<P>
In January, U.S. exports dropped 1.4 percent to 76.8 billion
dollars, the lowest level since August. The weakness reflected
declines in sales of farm products, including corn, cotton and
wheat, civilian aircraft and autos.
</P>
<P>
Imports soared 2 percent to 93.8 billion dollars last month as
demand for autos and auto parts, consumer products and food all
rose to all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
In a rebuke to the administration's free trade policies, the
House on Wednesday passed by a lopsided 289-141 vote a bill that
would clamp tight limits on the amount of steel that could be
imported into the country.
</P>
<P>
The steel quota bill faces an uncertain future in the Senate,
but its passage in the House sends a signal that protectionist
pressures are growing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the deficit with Japan narrowed by 22
percent in January to 4.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. deficit with Pacific Rim countries, the epicenter of the
global crisis, rose by 7.8 percent in January to 12.6 billion
dollars. Deficits with U.S. North American Free Trade Agreement
partners also rose, the Department said. But the deficit with the
European Union fell to 1.12 billion dollars in January from 3.24
billion dollars in December, the lowest deficit since February
1998.
</P>
<P>
Economists believe that with one-third of the globe in
recession, the U.S. deficit in 1999 will easily surpass the record
169.3 billion dollars imbalance set last year. Many believe that
the key to a global recovery lies in Japan, the world's second
largest economy, adopting policies to halt its worst downturn in
50 years.

<HEADLINE> WB to Train African Journalists On Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank will spend about 10
million U.S. dollars on training African journalists on
educational issues, a World Bank official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director of Human Development for African Region of the World
Bank Birger Fredriksen told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana that
there was need to develop good communication for the development
of education in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to assist in training the communication
officers to improve their understanding of education issues as we
believe that education is important for development in Africa," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Fredriksen said the training would be done at both regional and
national levels.
</P>
<P>
"We are in the process of finding the journalists who are
interested in the program before we start," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his organization would also engage ministers of
education in discussions on communication to help in the promotion
of education in their countries.
</P>
<P>
"There would also be the need to increase Africa's capacity
building in education so we will have a program on that,"
Fredriksen said.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity in 1996 declared the period
1997 to 2006 a Decade for Education in Africa with the aim of
removing obstacles toward education for all.

<HEADLINE> UK's Retail Sales Fall Back Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON March 18 (Xinhua) - High Street sales in Britain fell
back again last month after their post-Christmas recovery,
according to official figures released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales were down 0.3 percent by volume compared with
January, although they were still up 1.3 percent on the year, said
the office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
Taking the three months to February, volumes were up 0.2
percent on the previous quarter and 1 percent up on the year - the
lowest annual increase for three years.
</P>
<P>
The official sales figures confirm a British Retail Consortium
survey which showed that trading conditions were still difficult,
and retailers were forced to compete heavily on price.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in the City believe that the weak sales figures
increase the chances of the Bank of England cutting interest rates
next month.
</P>
<P>
There had been hopes that five cuts in interest rates in six
months would help revive sales sector and relieve the pain for
struggling retailers.

<HEADLINE> No Laws To Protect Consumers In Africa: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Most African countries still lack
comprehensive consumer protection laws, Consumers International
Regional Director for Africa Tadesse Gessesse said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said in commemoration of the World Consumer Rights Day
(March 15) that some of the law provisions were scattered in
diverse commercial and civil codes, making reference for immediate
action difficult.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, he said, had shown interest in consumer rights
protection as indicated by the setting up of the Small Claims
Court but more needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
He said poverty was growing rapidly in the region in general
and Zimbabwe in particular and there was a need to build strong
awareness between the civil society and the government in
safeguarding consumer rights.
</P>
<P>
The right to safety, he said, was being violated by most
African countries as goods which had expired, particularly
foodstuffs and medicines, were being sold at the black market.
</P>
<P>
"Consumers should also be educated not to destroy resources
during demonstrations as they are the ones to suffer in the end,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
World Consumer Rights Day was first observed in 1983 and this
year Zimbabwe is celebrating it until March 27 in various parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> PKK Under Control in Turkey, Says Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry said
here on Thursday the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) has
been taken under control by the Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement Turkey has adequate power and
opportunities to provide absolute security and peace on its
territories.
</P>
<P>
"Demonstrations, broadcastings and publications of the
terrorist organization targeting Turkey are blackmails against the
travelling freedom of European nations," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It added the PKK intends to creat a wrong impression about
Turkey by launching brutal attacks against defenseless and
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorists could not reach neither to touristic places nor to
other settlement centers due to tight security measures taken by
the security forces," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched in Turkey in
protest against the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is
now being jailed on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's
western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 13 people including many women and six others
were killed in a bomb blast in a "Blue Market" in Goztepe
district in Kadikoy of Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Later, Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir announced new security
measures in the city, saying the doors of stadiums, movie
theaters and similar buildings will be equipped with metal
detectors within three months.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said "terrorists are being captured or
surrendered to justice on every occasion. Therefore, no one
should take into consideration such menaces and propaganda of
terrorists."
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerrilla war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed over 37,000 lives in conflicts since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Genetically Modified Food to Be Labeled in The UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government Thursday
introduced new tough rules on the labeling of genetically
modified (GM) food.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations provide for the enforcement of a European
Union directive last September which required all food containing
GM soya or maize ingredients to be clearly labeled, and penalties
on non compliance.
</P>
<P>
In a move in which the UK leads the way in Europe, the new
controls will also apply to restaurants, cafes, bakers and
delicatessens.
</P>
<P>
The new rules mean that outlets selling foods containing GM
material that is not properly labeled may be prosecuted and fined
up to 5,000 pounds (8,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined that consumers should be able to
choose whether or not to eat genetically-modified foods," the
British Safety Minister Jeff Rooker said in a written
parliamentary answer.
</P>
<P>
"The UK is the first member state in Europe to take steps to
ensure that consumers eating out will have the same right to
choose whether or not to consume foods containing GM ingredients
as those buying from shops," Rooker said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy on Root Causes of World Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Olara Otunnu, the special
representative of the U.N. secretary-general for children and
armed conflict, said on Thursday that the breakdown of state and
uneven development pattern are among major factors contributing to
the breakout of armed conflict in the world.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua here on Thursday morning,
Otunnu said, "the general political and economic breakdown" and
"the weakening of the state, sometimes the collapse of the state"
are among major factors leading to the emergence of armed conflict
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts are most likely to break out in a country where
"the pattern of socio-economic development is highly uneven," he
said, the imbalanced distribution of resources in the society also
contributes to the breakout of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The primary factor is the sense of exclusion, of imbalance and
of alienation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, the former Ugandan foreign minister, just returned form
his trip to Rwanda, Burundi and Sudan, where he collected the
first-hand information on the status of children affected by armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, conflicts broke out in some African and Asian
countries, such as Afghanistan, Angola, Congo (K), Liberia, Sierra
Leone and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
This brutal reality has been exacerbated by a qualitative
change in the nature and scope of conflict in recent times.
"Today's conflicts are primarily internal, often fought by
multiple, semi-autonomous armed groups within existing State
boundaries," he said.
</P>
<P>
In today's internecine warfare, the village has become the
battlefield and civilian populations the primary target, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In the First World War, civilians accounted for some 5 percent
of casualties. In the Second World War, that figure rose to 48
percent. Today, up to 90 percent of conflict casualties around the
world are civilians, a large and increasing number of these
children and women," he said. "This is the world upside down."
</P>
<P>
An alarming rend in recent years is the increasing
participation, direct or indirect, of children in armed conflict,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that up to 300,000 children under the age of 18
are serving as combatants in government troops or armed opposition
groups in ongoing conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
Millions of children and women, those most vulnerable and least
responsible for conflict, today represent the vast majority of
casualties in armed conflicts worldwide. About 90 percent of all
victims today are civilians, mostly children and women and mostly
in the wars, said Otunnu in his first report to the General
Assembly in late 1998.
</P>
<P>
In about 50 countries worldwide, millions of children today are
either swept up in armed conflicts of suffering in their
aftermath, the report said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has appointed Otunnu as his
special representative for children in armed conflict in August
last year, and effective on September 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since his appointment, Otunnu has personally visited Kosovo, a
province in the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia, Liberia, Sierra
Leone, Sri Lanka, and Sudan, not to mention his recent trips to
the three African countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Plane Carrying Pilgrims Breaks Air Ban Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi plane carrying 124
elderly pilgrims on Thursday afternoon took off from Baghdad for
the third time, heading for Mecca, Saudi Arabia to perform rituals
of hajj.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman in the Ministry of Transport said the
third flight is also the last one, adding a total of 345 Iraqi
pilgrims have been flown to Mecca this year.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday and Wednesday, a total of 221 elderly pilgrims were
flown to Mecca by the same plane.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, an Iraqi plane carrying Iraq's elderly pilgrims flew
to Jeddah airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, nearly 2,000 Iraqi pilgrims left for Saudi Arabia
for the hajj by buses, the first group from Iraq to perform the
annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca this year. On Tuesday, another
2,000 pilgrims left Baghdad for Mecca by buses.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, with a population of over 22 million, can send up to
22,000 pilgrims to Mecca under quotas set by the Organization of
the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions, which have impoverished most ordinary
Iraqis, have made it impossible for all but the wealthiest to
afford the pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Sunday accused the U.S. and
British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
impeding efforts aimed at helping Iraqis to perform their
pilgrimage by rejecting the Iraqi proposal of using its frozen
assets in foreign countries to finance its pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 3,000 Iraqi pilgrims made the trip to Mecca to
perform hajj. In 1997, Iraq flew a planeload of pilgrims to
Mecca, other pilgrims were flown by helicopters to the
Iraqi-Saudi border despite a ban on flights over Iraq enforced by
the U.S. and Britain.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Calls for Halt to Anti-Iraq Acts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries on Thursday
called for a halt to any action against Iraq outside the framework
of the U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the two-day 111th session
of the Arab League Council, Arab foreign ministers underscored
keenness on Iraq's unity and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
But the statement did satisfy Iraq's demand that the Arab
League condemns the U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraq. It
neither mention the airstrikes nor name the United States and
Britain due to opposition of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Talks behind the closed-doors on Wednesday and Thursday failed
to persuade Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to agree to Iraq's demands.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-December, U.S. and British warplanes have bombarded
Iraqi sites on a regular basis to punish what the two countries
said are Iraqi violation of the southern and northern "no-fly"
zones.
</P>
<P>
The zones, set up by the U.S. and Britain after the 1991 Gulf
War, prohibit Iraqi warplanes from flying over much of it airspace
to protect local opposition groups. Iraq has not recognized the
"no-fly" zones and considers Western patrol planes as intruders.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League statement called on the concerned parties,
including Iraq, to carry out the U.N. Security Council resolutions
both in words and spirit.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid told reporters
that the compromise statement is the best that the ministers
could reach in view of their sharp differences.
</P>
<P>
"What is the most important during the meeting was to maintain
Arab solidarity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers meet twice a year in March and September
to coordinate their countries' foreign policies and iron out
differences.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls for U.N. Actions Against Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 18 (Xinhua) --General secretary of the ruling
People's Movement for Liberation of Angola (MPLA) Joao Lourenco
Thursday appealed to the United Nations to take actions against
some neighbors which have grossly violated the country's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco made the appeal at a session of the MPLA's
parliamentary group in the capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
He charged that some neighbors disregarded U.N. resolutions and
continue to supply arms and military materials to the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), once
again dragging the country into the abyss of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco was apparently referring to Zambia, although he did
not gave their names.
</P>
<P>
Of late the relationship between Angola and Zambia has strained
after the Angolan government repeatedly blasted Zambia's military
support for UNITA while the Zambian government has flatly denied
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general called on the Committee of Sanctions of
the U.N. Security Council to prevent these countries from further
selling arms unpunished.
</P>
<P>
He said the Angola government wrote to the committee this week
a letter providing evidences of some countries' interference with
Angola's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Zambia's former defense minister, Benjamin
Yoran Mwila, who is allegedly a relative of Savimbi, has played a
key role in supplying arms and logistics to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
It charged that Mwila has taken advantage of an estate some 90
kilometers away from the Zambia-Angola border and built a runway
for large transport planes. In that place, military materials
South Africa were downloaded and then airlifted by small planes to
UNITA-controlled cities like Andulo in central Angola.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lourenco criticized President of Burkina Faso Blaise
 Campaore for trying to hold a special summit, saying this is an
attempt by some African politicians to make the international
community recognize the status of UNITA chairman Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Campoare, the current OAU chairman, recently suggested holding
a summit to resolve the conflicts in Angola and the Democratic
Republic of Congo, among others, and invited Savimbi and a DRC
rebel leader to attend. However, the meeting was cancelled as few
countries would take part in.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco stressed that Savimbi is a "war criminal" whose travel
abroad has been barred by the United Nations. He said if Savimbi
is allowed to attend, the fame of the OAU would be stained.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Hopes A Window is Opening in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Thursday voiced its hope that a window of
opportunity might finally be opening for the war-torn West African
nation, despite Sierra Leone's recent history of brutality against
children, and the existence of daunting obstacles to the delivery
of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF executive director, said she has been
encouraged by the consistent and apparently growing flow of
children who have been released to the children's agency by rebel
forces.
</P>
<P>
"Last week, there were two releases of 31 and 20 abducted
children," she said, "including a one-month-old baby and the
baby's mother. Just last month, 34 children were released through
the auspices of ECOMOG (the West African peacekeeping forces). We
have reason to hope that more children will be freed in the
future."
</P>
<P>
The recent releases give some indication of how concern for
children can bring unlikely groups together. the handover of the
20 children to United Nations workers last Friday, which took
place on a road east of the capital Freetown, following an unusual
meeting which included rebel officers, representatives of
Government-supported ECOMOG peacekeeping forces and
representatives of an inter-religious group, UNICEF said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During much of the conflict in Sierra Leone, there has been an
almost total disregard of international conventions designed to
protect civilians, women and children in particular, from the
horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy expressed her hope that a changed environment might
lead to increased access to presently closed areas of the country
so that humanitarian assistance might be delivered and, at the
same time, called for the release of even more children from the
areas affected by the conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing confidence creates the stage for more direct access
to women and children caught behind frontlines," Bellamy said, "We
desperately need safe corridors. Over 600 new causes of measles
have been recorded in Kennema, Bo and other communities."
</P>
<P>
"This is also the cholera season and already there are several
hundred reported cases of the diarrhoea which often precedes
cholera outbreaks," she said.
</P>
<P>
Despite ongoing dangers, Bellamy said that UNICEF has been able
to continue to operate within Sierra Leone and has provided
humanitarian assistance where possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
The agency has distributed vaccines, basic medical supplies,
safe water and nutritional supplies wherever it has been given
access to populous and, as well, has participated in interim-care
programs for dislocated children and for those children released
by the security forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi plane carrying elderly
pilgrims was detained by the Saudi authorities on Thursday, the
Iraqi News Agency INA reported
</P>
<P>
INA quoted news from Riyad as saying that Saudi authorities
wanted to ask for instructions from the U.N. Sanctions Committee
on whether this Iraqi plane should be allowed to fly back to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.S. and Britain have asked the Saudi
authorities to detain the Iraqi plane after the U.N. Sanctions
Committee failed to reach consensus on condemning the flights.
</P>
<P>
The detained Iraqi plane on Thursday afternoon just flown
the third batch of 124 Iraqi elderly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia
to perform rituals of pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
A total of 345 Iraqi pilgrims had been flown to Saudi Arabia
this year. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the same plane had flown 221
elderly pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
INA said the Iraqi plane did not fly back to Iraq on Wednesday
on the same day after it flown 111 elderly pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia. Instead, it returned to Iraq on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's flight is the fourth time that Iraq broke the air
ban imposed on the country after the 1991 Gulf War. In 1997, an
Iraqi plane carrying Iraq's elderly pilgrims flew to Jeddah
airport in southwestern Saudi Arabia
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Sunday accused the U.S. and
British representatives in the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
impeding efforts to try to help Iraqis to perform their pilgrimage
by rejecting the Iraqi proposal for using its frozen assets in
foreign countries to finance its pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Iraq flew a planeload of elderly pilgrims to Mecca,
other pilgrims were flown by helicopters to the Iraqi-Saudi border
despite a ban on flights over Iraq enforced by the U.S. and
Britain.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) Thursday sharply condemned the U.S. Congress for its
opposition to creating an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress made "a void decision" and it was nothing but
a policy of robbing the Palestinians of their rights of
self-determination, Tayeb Abdel Rahim, Secretary-General of PNA,
told the Voice of Palestine on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 380 to 24 on Tuesday
in favor of a resolution approved by the Senate last week which
called for U.S. President Bill Clinton to oppose any unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian State.
</P>
<P>
Several senior Palestinian officials on Wednesday criticized
the resolution and urged Clinton not to be affected by it in his
decision-making concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We called on the U.S. administration, which sponsored the
peace process, to take objective decisions concerning a sensitive
issue," PNA Parliamentary Affairs Minister Nabil Mir had said.
</P>
<P>
The Congress approved the resolution regardless of the
U.S. government's policy on the peace process, said Hannan
Ashrawi, member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Thursday
in East Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Supports UAE's Claim on Gulf Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Thursday reiterated
its support for the claims of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on
three disputed islands in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the two-day 111th session
of the Arab League Council, Arab foreign ministers stressed that
the UAE enjoys the sovereignty over the islands of Abu Musa,
Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
The statement condemned Iran for its moves, including staging
war games in the waters off the islands and building facilities on
them.
</P>
<P>
It accused Iran of "violating UAE's sovereignty" over the
islands, which are situated at the mouth of the strategic Strait
of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
It urged Iran to withdraw its forces from the three islands, on
which Iran deployed troops in 1971 after Britain pulled back from
them.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries called for Iran to stop its facilities
construction projects on the islands aimed at changing the
islands' status and altering their demographical structure.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim sovereignty over the three
islands. The two countries have expressed readiness to resolve
their disputes through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has proposed to refer the issue to international
arbitration while Iran insists on holding direct negotiations to
solve the problem.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Angered by Release of a Genocide Suspect by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
''The investigations later carried out by Rwandan intelligence
services on his role in the genocide have highlighted the
existence of irrefutable proofs of his guilt,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan Foreign Ministry called for the arrest of
Ntuyahaga and extradition to Rwanda where he should be judged.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Rwanda News Agency, Rwanda Minister
of Justice, Jean de Dieu Mucyo said that Ntuyahaga should be
brought to Rwanda where he was involved in the slaughter of over
one million people, instead of extraditing him to Belgium for the
killing of 10 of their paratroopers.
</P>
<P>
Mucyo suspected that a plot was concocted between Belgium and
the U.N. Tribunal to drop charges against Ntuyahaga so that he can
be handed him over to the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
''The UN Tribunal for Rwanda has always been characterized by a
similar attitude against Rwandan genocide criminals which it
seems to support openly,'' Mucyo highlighted.
</P>
<P>
The release of Ntuyahaga occurred only about a month after
another genocide criminal, Omar Serushago, was handed down a light
sentence of 15 years by the ICTR because he confessed to his
crimes and accepted to collaborate with the tribunal. This
had sent waves of shock in Rwanda which questioned the seriousness
of the U.N. Tribunal, and its total disregard of crimes committed
in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Human rights organisations and associations of genocide
survivors have expressed disappointment in the U.N. Tribunal
which they charge of sluggishness, poor performance.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Arms Dealers Crowd UAE for Bigger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 18 (Xinhua) -- After five days of displaying
and showing, the 4th International Defense Exhibition closed here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
What is most striking on the event is not the number of deals,
which fell some due to the depressed oil market, but the number of
companies and official delegations attracted to the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
A total of 848 defense companies, many world famous, and over
50 official delegations, with some led by defense ministers and
army chiefs, from 41 countries took part in the IDEX '99.
</P>
<P>
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has proudly announced that it
has hosted the biggest defense show of this century.
</P>
<P>
Why so many companies and delegations crowded the defense
show? Consolidating existing weapons market shares and seeking
new opportunities were apparently their purpose.
</P>
<P>
Britain sent a record number of 120 companies to the show,
followed by France, the U.S. and Germany, each with over 50
companies.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the UAE Military Committee
for International Exhibitions and Conferences, the Gulf defense
procument grows 10 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In the coming few years, members of the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC), which groups Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia and Bahrain, are expected to spend 60-80 billion U.S.
dollars on military equipments.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War in 1991, set off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, GCC countries launched ambitious defense programs. So far,
some neighbors of Iraq still viewed Baghdad as a threat to their
security.
</P>
<P>
The turbulent and complicated situation in the region are
accelerating these programs. Some analysts even say there is an
arms race.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Gulf Business monthly pointed out that
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have bought weapons in bulk after the Gulf
War and the UAE has emerged as the largest potential arms market
in the region as it is making efforts to upgrade its deterrent
defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
At the IDEX '99, the UAE has sought increased military
cooperation with all big weapons exporters, including Britain,
France, the U.S., Russia, Germany, Italy to diversify its sources
of arms.
</P>
<P>
"Militarily speaking, this is called operational requirements.
The proof of that is that we have Russian personnel carriers,
South African artillery, French tanks and aircrafts from an
assortment of suppliers," Chief of Staff of the UAE Armed Forces
Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
France's Dassault Aviation announced during the exhibition that
it will deliver 30 Mirage 2000-9s to the UAE in 2002 according to
a contract signed in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The UAE said that negotiations were continuing on its
purchasing 80 advanced F-16 warplanes built by U.S. Lockheed
Martin Corp. for about 6 billion dollars. British and French
companies are also trying to get the deal.
</P>
<P>
The curtain of the bi-annual IDEX '99 has fallen. But two
questions remain open: Why defense needs are so difficult to
meet? When can the world live free of threats so that defense is
no longer a need?

<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the World Bank have
largely reached an agreement on terms for providing Russia a third
loan to finance the country's economic restructuring, Russian
Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vyugin and First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov held
talks with the World Bank Mission earlier in the day, Itar-Tass
reported.
</P>
<P>
A Russia-World Bank joint statement on Russian economic
restructuring is "almost ready" and there are only several
outstanding issues that need to be coordinated with the ministries
of finance, fuel and power engineering, Vyugin said.
</P>
<P>
Of the World Bank's third loan of 1.5 billion dollars, Russia
has already received 300 million dollars in the first tranche. It
is trying to secure the second and third tranches of 500 million
and 700 million dollars respectively, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Carter, the head of the World Bank's Moscow office, is
expected to submit the coordinated version of the joint statement
to the bank's Board of Directors next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Carter, for his part, described the Thursday talks as very good
and constructive, adding that certain progress were reached.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue their meeting Friday to iron out
the remaining issues such as increasing cash proceeds from
payments for electricity and gas in Russia and regulating prices
for natural monopolies' products, Russian Minister of Fuel and
Power Engineering Sergei Generalov said.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait will start to cut its
oil production from April 1, the state-owned Kuwait Petroleum
Corporation (KPC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait "will fully implement the newly-agreed production cut,"
Kuwait News Agency cited a KPC press release as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the press release did not mention the exact cutbacks
on oil production for the Gulf state.
</P>

Last Saturday, Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah
said Kuwait would introduce an output cut of around 140,000
barrels per day (bpd) from its current level of 1.98 million bpd,
said
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti move is in response to a decision made by major oil
producing countries to cut production in a bid to boost the
sagging oil prices in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Member states of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), except Iraq, reached an agreement with two
non-OPEC members last week to reduce overall production by
2 million bpd.

UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) --The U.N. Security Council
on Thursday called upon Ethiopia and Eritrea to put an end to the
hostilities, and expressed its hope that U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan to "redouble his efforts" to bring the parties to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press, the president of the

members of the Council call for an immediate cessation of
hostilities" between the two Horn of Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the Security Council express their serious

<P>
"The members of the Council welcome the efforts of the
Secretary-General and encourage him to redouble his efforts in
cooperation with the OAU (Organization of African Unity) in order

<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea has been locked in a border war which
began in May last year with a month of fighting and, after another
eight months of rising tension and troop reinforcements along the
border, the second round began in early February this year.

<HEADLINE> UN Tribunal Grants Rwandan Genocide Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- In an unprecedented move,
the United Nations Court for Rwanda granted Thursday the
withdrawal of indictment against a genocide suspect accused of
involving killing 10 Belgian soldiers on U.N. mission and the then
Rwandan Prime Minister in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), based in
Tanzania' s northern town Arusha, ordered an immediate release of
Bernard Ntuyahaga, a former Major in the Rwandan Armed Forces, an
ICTR press release said.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from Arusha said Ntuyahaga's handcuffs were
removed in the Trial Chamber One of ICTR, but he was immediately
taken to the U.N. special detention facilities on the outskirts of
Arusha for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
The Trial Chamber, presided by Judge Navanethem Pillay of South
Africa, declined to grant the Prosecutor's additional request to
order the release of Ntuyahaga from the Tribunal's custody to the
Tanzanian authorities.
</P>
<P>
"The Tribunal held that it did not have jurisdiction to order
the release of a person who was no longer under indictment into
the custody of any given state," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The chamber also dismissed the counter claim of the defense
that the accused should be declared innocent and acquitted.
</P>
<P>
"The motion to withdraw the indictment was fundamentally
different from an acquittal, in that it was not based on lack of
evidence against the accused," read the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Trial Chamber instructed the registrar to take all the
necessary measures to execute the present decision, if need be
with the cooperation of authorities of the host state, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Natuyahaga, 47, surrendered himself to the Tribunal on July 10,
1998 and was indicted on September 29 with one count, namely
crimes against humanity (murder).
</P>
<P>
He was allegedly responsible for disarming and arresting the
ten Belgian soldiers who were sent to escort former Rwandan Prime
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana before they were killed.
</P>
<P>
Ntuyahaga's release is a result of the bid by his prosecutor,
Othman Chande who argued that the withdrawal will promote the
exercise of concurrent jurisdiction by a state as contained in
Article 8 of the Statute of the Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the prosecutor's motion followed a request by the
Belgian government which has tried to transfer the trial of
Ntuyahaga to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Kingdom, Professor Eric David from the
University of Belgium told Trial Chamber One Tuesday that if the
withdrawal application is granted, the court should order the
direct transfer of the accused to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
He said as the second choice, Natuyahaga should be handed over
to the Tanzanian authorities and then be extradited to Belgium
that has already investigated the case.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian investigating magistrate issued in 1995 an
international warrant of arrest of Natuyahaga, accusing him of
involving in the death of ten Belgian peacekeeping soldiers in the
United Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) on April 7,
1994 as well as the former Rwandan Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
However, Natuyahaga's defense counsel Georges Amegadjie from
Togo opposed the motion by the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was no provision in the Statute or Rules
of the ICTR empowering the International Tribunal to hand over an
accused person to a national jurisdiction if the prosecutor seeks
to withdraw charges as in the present case.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution should not act as a rubber stamp for some
national jurisdictions. It is a United Nations body," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he added, the Tribunal should request the
Belgian government to hand over all the documents and evidence
against the accused to the Tribunal to facilitate the case.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Committee Reaches No Consensus on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council's Sanctions Committee on Thursday failed to reach
consensus on Iraq's flights taking pilgrims to Mecca in Saudi
Arabia without its permission.
</P>
<P>
"There was no consensus among members on this matter," U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said at noon briefing.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia on Wednesday held an Iraqi plane that flew
pilgrims to Mecca. Saudi Arabia's U.N. mission sent a letter to
the Sanctions Committee Thursday, seeking advice on how to deal
with the plane. The country expected a reply within 24 hours or it
would allow the aircraft to fly back to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was briefed this morning on the incident
after obtaining advice from U.N. counsel Hans Corell on whether
Iraq's flights to the Mecca violated sanctions, which was imposed
on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. diplomats, the members of the Sanctions
Committee differed about whether a Security Council resolution
adopted in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait actually amounted
to an air embargo.
</P>
<P>
The members agreeed with Corell that U.N. resolutions demanded
notification of flights and barred any commercial transactions
but took no action, the diplomats said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Ruble Plunge Breaks Psychological Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian ruble broke the
psychological barrier of 24 to the U.S. dollar Thursday amid
concerns over monetary expansion and greater bank liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Banks were buying dollars for as much as 24.05-24.1 rubles in
the afternoon trading session on the Moscow Interbank Currency
Exchange (MICEX), Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
That is believed to the ruble's lowest rate since last
September, when the dollar hit its all-time high on the MICEX as
banks bought dollars for 30.15 rubles.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the dollar averaged 23.6506 rubles in the morning
session on MICEX and 23.9514 rubles in the afternoon, down from
the previous day's close of 23.4118.
</P>
<P>
The ruble's tumble was attributed largely to the expansion of
the monetary base, which grew by 7 billion rubles in the first
week of March, and has expanded by 13.5 billion rubles since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Looming coupon payments on Eurobonds combined with the fact
that the Central Bank is unlikely to be able to build up its
foreign reserves in the near-term also fuelled the ruble's
downturn, Interfax quoted dealers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Igor Kononko, deputy head of foreign market operations at RNKB
bank, said the ruble's steep slide Thursday may have been a
reaction to news that the Finance Ministry had ordered
Vnesheconombank to pay the coupons of two Eurobond issues totaling
about DM 300 million.
</P>
<P>
Another banker, Ruslan Vlasenko, who heads the foreign exchange
department of the Rosbank, said despite signs that Russia and the
International Monetary Fund might strike a deal in the near
future, the deal would at best only allow Russia to refinance part
of its foreign debt, rather than give fresh loans to the country,
a scenario unlikely to have much positive impact on the ruble.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Administrative measures to control the exchange
rate will not increase demand for the ruble, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bank liquidity also helped force down the ruble, as balances on
banks' correspondent accounts with the Central Bank grew by 2
billion rubles Thursday to 34.638 billion rubles, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The stronger dollar spurred trading in the MICEX, with volumes
in the afternoon session more than doubled to 41.7 million billion
dollars. Thursday's total volume was 185 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Interfax quoted dealers as saying that the ruble will continue
to slide against the dollar in the long run, although it could
firm temporarily.

MOSCOW, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. envoy for Afghanistan,
Lakhdar Brahimi, and the commander of the Afghan Northern Alliance
forces, Ahmad Shah Masoud, met Thursday in Dushanbe, Tajikistan,
and considered speeding up the Afghan peace process, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi and Masoud discussed ways to make talks in Ashgabat,
Turkmenistan, between the Alliance and the Taliban Islamic
movement more effective.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed planned humanitarian relief for the
population of northern Afghanistan, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations will continue, because we did not come to a
final decision in Ashgabat on a ceasefire," Masoud told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"However, we reached an agreement to release 20 prisoners of
war on each side. For example, due to the next religious festival,
we will release 20 Taliban members who were taken prisoner. At the
next round of the negotiation process, we intend to follow the
example of our Tajik brothers, who have been able to stop the
war."
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said the next round of talks will focus on a planned
ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Meets Foreign Diplomats in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Days after Israel exchanged
harsh words with the European Union over the status of Jerusalem,
dozens of foreign diplomats held talks with a senior Palestinian
official in Jerusalem on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in the Oriental House in East Jerusalem,
which is serving as a representative office of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from France, Holland and other European countries
took part in the talks. Other diplomats were from Canada, Jordan
and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks, Faisal al-Husseini, the top PNA official
on Jerusalem affairs, told reporters that the PNA rejected
Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem. He said
Jerusalem is the capital of the Palestinians in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
Husseini stressed Israel could not determine the fate of
Jerusalem without taking into account the Muslim and Christian
residents in the city.
</P>
<P>
He also said the foreign diplomats will continue to visit the
Oriental House despite Israel's rejection.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Foreign Ministry called the talks "a
Palestinian deception," adding they did not have diplomatic
significance.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, senior adviser of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, told Israel Radio that Israel insists the
Oriental House can not serve as the foreign ministry of the
PNA.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Illan said the PNA's activities in the Oriental House
contradict the sovereignty of Israel in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that since Netanyahu came to power in June
1996, the prime minister has stopped the meetings between the
PNA officials and high-ranking foreign officials such as heads
of governments and foreign ministers in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Germany, which is currently president of the EU, sent
a letter to Israeli Foreign Ministry, reconfirming the EU's
support for the internationalization of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected the EU's position, saying Jerusalem is the
eternal capital of Israel and any attempt to undermine Israel's
position on the issue will be rejected outright.
</P>
<P>
Israel also demanded the foreign diplomats refrain from
visiting the Oriental House and meeting the Palestinian officials
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and later annexed it. The Palestinians want to establish an
independent nation with East Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accord signed by the two sides in 1993, the
status of Jerusalem should be determined in the final phase of
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Support Palestinians on Statehood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Council said in a
statement Thursday that "the Palestinians have every right" to
declare an independent state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
The council made the statement at the end of its 111th session,
saying the council has earlier adopted resolutions to show its
support for the Mideast peace process and the Palestinians' right
to self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Angered by Israel's freeze of the latest peace deal, the Wye
River accord, signed in Washington last October, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has announced he will declare an independent
state on May 4, when the five-year interim self-rule term
envisaged in the 1993 Oslo Accord expires, regardless of the
results of the negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Wye River accord, which was suspended by Israel early
December, stipulates that Israel should have pulled out its troops
from another 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is striving to rally support for the palestinian
statehood proclamation from Arab countries, Europe and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The council urged support for the Palestinians against the
schemes of the Israeli government to freeze the peace process.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the U.S. administration to press Israel into
implementing the signed agreements.

LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Europe's main stock markets
slipped further Thursday after a disappointing day for Asian stock
markets and an indifferent start on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 ended the session off its lows, closing 26
points down at 6,114.3.
</P>
<P>
The index earlier had fallen below the 6,100 mark but staged a
small recovery as selling pressure eased on Wall Street moving
into the black.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth consecutive fall in London after the
benchmark index hit record highs last Thursday. However, some
dealers were more optimistic about the future for London shares.
</P>
<P>
"I can see the FTSE going higher in the medium term after
today's U.S. inflation data, which suggest the Federal Reserve won't
raise interest rates in March," said one dealer.

<P>
In Frankfurt, the electronically-traded Xetra Dax was saved
from ending below the psychologically important 5,000 mark by a

The German blue chips closed 37 points lower at 5,025.79, a

Paris CAC 40 was up 0.65 percent around midday but a lack of

<HEADLINE> UN Not to Send US, British Relief Staff to Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Americans and Britons
would not be included in the gradual return of U.N. relief staff
members to Afghanistan, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations decided to resume humanitarian aid work last
Friday after assessing the security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and Britain objected their nationals
returning amid the fear that their nationals might be attacked by
Saudi Arabia dissident Osama bin Laden, whom the U.S. had accused
of being responsible for the bombings of its embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania last August.
</P>
<P>
"We did our assessment and we decided that the situation
warranted the return of our staff to Afghanistan," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"Subsequently, the U.K. and U.S. governments came to us to
say that they had reason to believe that their nationals could
be at risk," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"We said we would study that. Certainly, we do not want to
take any unnecessary risks. So, as a provisional measure, we
said we would not be sending U.S. and U.K. nationals back to
Afghanistan until we can assess the information provided to us
by those governments," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations pulled all of its international staff out
of Afghanistan last August after three of them were murdered in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations decided to resume humanitarian aid work
in the country after Afghanistan's warring faction the Taleban
promised to guarantee the safety of all relief workers.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says NATO Ready to Act Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Thursday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
that NATO was ready to act against his force if he still refused
to sign a U.S.-drafted peace deal on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to remind President Milosevic that NATO stands
ready to take whatever measures are necessary," Albright said
before addressing Congressional leaders on the situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovar Albanians signed the peace accord for the Serbian
province Thursday in Paris but Milosevic has so far rejected the
U.S.-drafted initiative, which involves sending NATO troops to
enforce the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the Serbian negotiators have gone backward. They
have refused to engage in discussions of civilian and military
implementation," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now there is no sign the Serbs will agree. So the
situation is as clear as it could be. The Albanians are saying yes
to the accords and the Serbs are saying no," she said.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened tough military action against the Serbs if
they do not sign the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Chaos in Kosovo Talks After Albanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A total chaos emerged in the talks
on Kosovo in Paris on Thursday after the Kosovo Albanian
delegation signed the draft peace proposal presented by Western
countries while the Serbs continue to reject it.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said that the conference of Paris on
Kosovo would be suspended for a few days more by the co-chairmen
of the talks, France and Britain, to let the Yugoslav side
"reflect" on the consequences of a failure of the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook are expected to announce on Friday the
decision to suspend the conference after consulting with four
other member countries of the Contact Group on Yugoslavia -- the
United States, Russia, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation is expected to come back on Tuesday or in
the middle of next week, but only for signing the agreement, said
Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation announced Thursday evening that it has
presented to the Contact Group its own version of a draft peace
agreement on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Since no political agreement has been found during this
meeting and the Albanians of Kosovo have signed a document which
is not an agreement, the Serb delegation has drawn up a draft
agreement which takes into account its remarks, and has submitted
it to the Contact Group,"' said an official source close to the
Serb delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Serb side not only rejects the military wing of the draft
agreement presented by the Contact Group, which calls for the
deployment of up to 28,000 NATO troops in Kosovo, but also has
demanded that some 20 amendments be made in the political part of
the peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Serb President Milan Milutinovic, who has accompanied the Serb
delegation to the talks in Paris, said on Thursday that the Serb
side did not recognize the agreement signed by the Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the Contact Group has denied having
received a Serb version of agreement.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany met on
Thursday on Kosovo in Bonn, but did not make any declaration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States has once again warned Yugoslavia
against possible air strikes by NATO against Serb military targets
in Kosovo, if Belgrade persists in rejecting the peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Thursday
that the NATO is ready to take all measures necessary, while the
Pentagon announced that the warplanes and warships of NATO
equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles are in place and ready to
launch attacks if the NATO Secretary General Javier Solonna issues
order.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has appealed to the United Nations Security Council
to help stop the NATO from making such threats, while vowing to
defend its own territory.

<P>
MAPUTO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi said here Thursday that great stride has been made in the
modernization of the country's telephone network in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
The telephone users have increased by 23 percent nationwide,
130 percent in the rural areas, Mocumbi said at the opening of a
two-day forum on the reform of Mozambique's telecommunication
sector.
</P>
<P>
He said about 1,500 telephone booths have been set up around
the whole country in the recent five years while the
digitalization of the national telephone network is nearly
completed.
</P>
<P>
Mobile telephone network which has also been set up along some
major highways in the south, is expected to expand to the north
and central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister admitted that many people still
don't have access to telephone and it will take an investment of
at least 500 million U.S. dollars in the coming seven years to
achieve the goal that every one hundred people owe two telephones
as compared to the current rate of 0.46 telephones for 100 people.

<HEADLINE> A Unique Farewell To The Bygone World Of A Chinese Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A sea-blue curtain, arrangements
of red roses, and a tape recording of the sound of waves and cries
of gulls provided the backdrop today at a mourning hall where the
prominent Chinese writer Bing Xin who died of heart failure on Feb.
28 at the age of 99 lay.
</P>
<P>
She was born October 5, 1900 to a cultured family in south
China's Fujian province, near the sea, and was fond of the ocean's
profundity. Another prominent Chinese writer, Ba Jin, spoke of
following her "to love starry nights and ocean waves" and readers
of all ages can find something touching in these works.
</P>
<P>
She enjoyed success among the literati in her early twenties,
writing novels that pointed to social inequity, essays, and short
lyrical melancholy verse that meditated on universal themes of
love, nostalgia, and other aspects of life.
</P>
<P>
In today's chilly spring weather, people started gathering as
early as 7 a.m. at the gate of a mourning hall to get a chance to
say good-bye to the writer. Her coffin was carried into the hall
at 8:45 a.m. as her son, two daughters, and other relatives held
red roses, her favorite.
</P>
<P>
At 9:00, to the soft tones of a piano, they spread the rose
petals over her small body and said their good-byes by kissing
their mother and grandmother on the forehead.
</P>
<P>
The people waiting outside with roses in hand entered the hall
at 10:00.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin lay there peacefully, covered with red rose petals.
the photo above her showed her looking out and bore a quotation: "
If there is love, there is everything."
</P>
<P>
A 12-year-old girl, Peng Xuan, who attends the same middle
school Bing Xin did, said she loves the restrained and beautiful
sentiments in Bing Xin's essays.
</P>
<P>
Isabel Crook, who has devoted herself to teaching English in
China with her husband David Crook, since 1948, told Xinhua that
they are colleagues of Bing Xin's daughters Wu Qing and Wu Bing,
professors at Beijing Foreign Studies University. She says she can
sense that Bing Xin was a great educator because her daughters are
both academically excellent and public-spirited.
</P>
<P>
Isabel's son Michael found Bing Xin's English translations of
the work of the Chinese poetess Li Qing-zhao of over 800 years ago,
when he was teaching Chinese literature at Wellesley College,
where Bing Xin got her MA in 1926.
</P>
<P>
"Her translations are really excellent. She is a soulmate of Li
in that both these two poets are gifted and deeply concerned with
the fate of the nation in their late years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bing Xin long regarded death as a natural process. "Death is a
release better than living with pains," she once said. "The
mourning ceremony on earth is a marriage banquet in heaven," she
once told a friend.
</P>
<P>
And that was why today's farewell was plain and without any of
the traditional funeral music, according to her children.
</P>
<P>
Minoru Takeuchi, a Japanese writer who translated Bing Xin's
essays into Japanese said that he was deeply saddened by her death
because she had taught him Chinese literature at the University of
Tokyo in the late 1940s and had been a great influence on him and
many of his contemporaries. She was "like a star in the sky of
Chinese literature, with a brilliant light never faded."

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Reaffirms Stance on Trial of KR leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen Friday reiterated his stance on the trial of Khmer Rouge (KR)
leaders, again ruling out the possibility of international trial.
</P>
<P>
In a communique broadcast by Television Bayon, Hun Sen said
that in order to uphold justice for the Cambodian people, the
trial of the KR leader must be carried out in Cambodia and by
Cambodian present courts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it concerns Cambodia's independence,
sovereignty, peace and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He said Cambodia's present courts will begin its investigation
into and trial of the captured KR leader Ta Mok. As for other
former KR leaders, only the courts have the right to decide
whether to charge them or not, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody, neither I nor any other person, has the right to
decide who or how many people should be tried," Hun Sen said,
adding that he had not guaranteed anyone exemption from charges to
be leveled by the courts.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also said foreign countries were welcome to offer
assistance including legal experts to help Cambodia in
establishing a national court that meets international standards.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Rescheduled Elections in Guinea-Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday called for the rescheduling of elections in
Guinea-Bissau in order to complete the peace process in the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council on the situation
in Guinea-Bissau, Annan said the government and the
self-proclaimed military junta have taken significant steps to
implement the Abuja Agreement, signed in the Nigerian capital of
Abuja on November 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja Agreement was the first formal framework to which the
leaders of the ex-belligerent forces, President Joao Bernardo
Vieira and Genral Asnumane Mane, personally committed themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said that the planned deadline of the end of
March for the holding of elections would be now impossible to meet
"owing largely to accumulated delays in the implementation of the
peace accords."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that notwithstanding some delay in the
peace process caused by the resumption of fighting on January 31,
the Government of National Unity was subsequently installed on
February 20. The effective functioning of the Government, however,
has been hampered by a number of obstacles, including lack of
adequate facilities and personnel.
</P>
<P>
On the military and security front, Annan said that the parties
have committed themselves never again to resort to arms. He also
points out that the West African peacekeeping forces, known as the
ECOMOG, has deployed 600 troops, comprising contingents from
Benin, Gambia, Niger and Togo, and that Mali has announced its
intention to send a contingent of 125 soldiers.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia had released
an Iraqi haj plane it seized on Wednesday, a U.N. diplomat said
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said Saudi Arabia made the decision after the
United Nations sanctions committee failed to reach consensus on
whether such flights of religious pilgrims violate United Nations
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council's
Sanctions Committee Thursday, saying that it had held an Iraqi
plane that took pilgrims to Mecca without its permission.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Saudi Arabia sought U.N. advice on how to heal
with the plane and expected to get answer within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council was briefed in the incident after
obtaining advice from a U.N. legal counsel on whether Iraq's
flights to the Mecca violateed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard, members of the
Council reached no consensus on this matter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under UN sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. Iraq is barred from any commercial transactions.

<HEADLINE> S. African Bank to Buy out Lesotho Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Standard Bank of South
Africa is to buy the majority share-holding of 70 percent in the
ailing Lesotho Bank, giving it the control over Lesotho Bank.
</P>
<P>
The deal will cost the Standard Bank, the second largest South
African bank, about 350 million rand (58.3 million U.S. dollars),
South African Press Association reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the 70 percent share-holding would be capitalized at 500
million rand (83.3 million dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho government, which has been the sole owner of
Lesotho Bank, will continue to hold the remaining 30 percent
share-holding until the shares are sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's Finance Minister Leketekete Ketso said the deal
salvaged the ailing bank without resorting to the drastic step of
closure.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the privatization unit of Lesotho's Finance
Ministry said Friday that the agreement followed protracted
negotiations for the privatization of the bank.
</P>
<P>
He said the Standard Bank and the Lesotho government had also
agreed on a three-month management contract, and the take-over of
Lesotho Bank was set for July 1.

<HEADLINE> Congolese Refugees Continue Entering Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The influx of Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) refugees into Zambia continues at a rate of 200-300
people per day, a report from United Nations High Commissioner
Refugees (UNHCR) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report reaching here said that a joint assessment mission,
comprising the Representatives of UNHCR, United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Food Program (WFP) as well as the
Commissioner for Refugees and other officials visited the Kaputa
area in Northern Province on March 17-18.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has accordingly revised the total number of new arrivals
who entered Zambia since the beginning of the influx on March 4 to
10,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
In recent history, this is probably the largest refugee influx
Zambia has witnessed over such a short space of time, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,500 refugees are now concentrated in Kaputa town while
the remainder is located in villages in the surrounding areas, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The general humanitarian situation is still considered to be
adequate although the infrastructure in Kaputa is clearly
stretched to its limits. Two water bowsers together with
chlorination equipment have been sent to Kaputa to ease water
problems in the town.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR expressed concern about the road conditions in the area
which have caused delays in the delivery of assistance and it is
understood that the provincial authorities are presently
conducting an assessment to prioritize the operation of available
graders.
</P>
<P>
A number of Non Governmental Organizations have joined hands
with the Zambian authorities, UNHCR and the Red Cross in providing
emergency assistance to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR indicated that preparations are underway to respond to a
further influx from the DRC.

<HEADLINE> 80 Illegal Immigrants Trapped in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of more than 80
illegal immigrants arriving in Cyprus from Lebanon Thursday have
been trapped in a boat at Larnaca port, waiting for decision of
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Most of these illegal immigrants come from Iraq, others from
Egypt, Syria, Palestine, Somalia and Sierra Leone. Thirty-five of
them are women and children and all of them arrived at Larnaca
port, on the south coast of Cyprus, from Tripoli, Lebanon, the
police spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is in the hands of the Foreign Ministry now," the
spokesman told the Cyprus News Agency (CNA).
</P>
<P>
The Authorities of Cyprus and Lebanon were in consultations on
the issue as none of immigrants had any travel documents or
passport with them.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the charge d'affaires of the Lebanese embassy in
Nicosia Halil El Hambre, to persuade them to return to Lebanon
did not yield any results.
</P>
<P>
Police are guarding the boat and the press have no access
to it. Cyprus' senior police officers have been meeting this
morning to discuss the issue and see how best to handle it.
</P>
<P>
Illegal immigrants have become a major concern for the Cypriot
government, with increasing numbers arriving here in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four of 113 Arab and African boat people rescued off
Cyprus last June are still being housed at a Cyprus' Hotel.
Twenty-three of the 113 have been given asylum and 66 others have
been deported or repatriated.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government to Settle Allowances to Soccer Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will settle
the allowances owed by the cash-strapped Football Association of
Zambia (FAZ to the members of the Zambia under-20 soccer team
going to the World Youth Cup finals to be held in Nigeria next
month.
</P>
<P>
Sport Minister William Harrington was quoted as saying here
Thursday that the money will be paid directly to the players to
keep morale high and each of them will get 4.5 million Kwacha (
about 2,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said the government is concerned by the press reports that
the players who have brought glory to the country by qualifying
for the World Cup finals have not been paid their dues.
</P>
<P>
The money is for camping allowances going back to November of
last year and bonuses for qualifying for the World Cup. This will
be Zambia's first ever appearance in a world soccer championship,
according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"The players should not be victims of the crisis in the
association. The distinction should be made about the FAZ and the
national teams," Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
he called on the players to be patient and to report for camp
when asked as the government is doing everything possible to keep
morale high.
</P>
<P>
The FAZ has been going though financial difficulties since the
government withdrew support to show its displeasure with the
association's national executive led by Teddy Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Following Zambia's poor performance at the Africa Cup finals in
Burkina Faso in February of 1998 the FAZ executive was removed on
the charge of misapplication of more than 500 million Kwacha (over
200,000 U.S. dollars) the government released for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international soccer activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Later the government allowed Mulonga and his team back in
office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the association in a
bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
The estrangement of the FAZ executive has cast a shadow on the
future of Zambian soccer given the fact the association is
dependent on the government financial support to fulfill its
various international engagements.

ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel is to visit Bulgaria on March 22-23 to further bilateral
ties, an official statement said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that Demirel
and his Bulgarian counterpart Petar Stoyanov will hold talks on
developing the existing friendly ties and cooperation in many
fields as well as regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Ambassador to Turkey Stoyan Stayev has said that
Demirel's visit will improve the relations in economy and politics

Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two leaders will discuss regional problems,

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The NBA will stage two regular
season games in Japan for the fifth time this decade, NBA
commissioner David Stern announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Minnesota Timberwolves and San Antonio Spurs will open the
1999-2000 season with two games at the Tokyo Dome on Saturday,
November 6 and Sunday, November 7.
</P>
<P>
"The NBA Japan Games have become a highlight of our calendar, "
Stern said. "Our Japanese fans are among the most enthusiastic,
and we are pleased to continue our tradition of playing regular
season games at Tokyo Dome where two of the NBA's most exciting
teams will compete in this year's games."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the NBA became the first American professional sports
league to stage regular season games outside of North America when
the Phoenix Sunds and Utah Jazz opened the 1990-91 season with two
games in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Houston Rockets and Seattle SuperSonics opened the
season with two games in Yokohama, as did the Los Angeles Clippers
and the Portland Trail Blazers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the event moved to the larger Tokyo Dome, where the
two games between the New Jersey Nets and Orlando Magic drew over
75,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
The Japan games will be televised globally in over 150
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
OSLO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) will withdraw its monitors from
Kosovo on Saturday, the OSCE chairman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek said the decision
was made due to the deterioration of the peace and order situation
in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the breakdown of the peace talks in
France between the Serbs and ethnic Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks seeking a political solution to the conflict
in Kosovo broke down Friday, plunging the Yugoslav province into a
darker perspective of bloodshed and war and increasing the risk of
a NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
"As OSCE chairman-in-office, I am responsible for the safety
of approximately 1,400 verifiers from many different countries in
Kosovo. I have no other choice in the present situation than to
withdraw the OSCE personnel," Vollebaek said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Britain Friday urged all British
nationals to leave Yugoslavia immediately.

Blair, together with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Irish
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, issued a joint statement to urge the
implementation of a key peace agreement reached on April 10 last
year, also known as Good Friday, to stop bloodshed in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement was issued following talks in Washington
earlier this week between Clinton, Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams on the peace
process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, people said it was hopeless ... But the people and
political parties in Northern Ireland proved them wrong," they
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It has rightly been acknowledged as an example of the rest of
the world on how dialog can bring an end to conflict," they said.
</P>
<P>
A row erupted after Trimble said his party would not sit down
with Sinn Fein in a Protestant-Catholic government unless the
Ireland Republican Army, the military wing of Sinn Fein, agreed to
hand over arms.
</P>
<P>
Adams, however, has argued that there is no mention in the Good
Friday agreement of weapons being handed over before the executive
had met, calling Trimble's demand a step designed to obstruct the
peace process.

MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market will
perform much better in the third quarter of this year with
increases in foreign investments, an official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Trinidad Kalaw, chairperson of the Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE), told reporters that local stocks are expected to be up as
the market is slowly stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, she said, the effects of the currency
contagion were sowing chaos in the Asian region, thus affecting
the local financial market as well.
</P>
<P>
Kalaw said the PSE composite index already reached the 2,000
level at the start of the first quarter when foreign investors
increased purchase of stocks.
</P>
<P>
But she said the losses of the market may continue until May.
</P>
<P>
After then, she said, the market performance will return to
normal around the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
She welcomed the move by the government to introduce treasury
bonds in the local stock market, which could mean another boost to
generate more revenues for the economy.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders, in their
coming visit to Moscow, are expected to officially ask Russia to
halt the transfer of nuclear weapons technology to Iran, Israel
Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon are due to pay a visit to Russia on
Sunday and held meetings with Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov,
Netanyahu is expected to present new information received by
Israel over the Russian technological aid to Iran on nuclear
weapons development.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it has evidence that Russian firms are
providing nuclear weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia insists that all its government agencies are
in compliance with rules designed to prevent the spread of
nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Jerusalem told Israel Radio that the
visit of Netanyahu and Sharon will be an important one since
Primakov is due to meet United States leaders days after his talks
with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration has pressured Russia to tighten
controls on the export of nuclear technology.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Threatens to Renew Uprising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on Friday threatened that he would renew uprising if he was
not permitted to declare an independent Palestinian state in the
coming May, according to the Voice of Palestine (VOP).
</P>
<P>
Addressing activists of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
in Ramallah, West Bank, Arafat said an independent Palestinian
state will be definitely established with East Jerusalem as the
capital and no body can stop that.
</P>
<P>
"If the Israelis don't like it, they can drink water in the
dead sea," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Although Arafat did not say that he will definitely declare
Palestinian statehood in May, his remarks have been the strongest
reaction ever to the Israeli as well as the U.S. congressional
rejection of his next move in this direction.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has repeatedly stated that he will declare an
independent state on May 4 when the five year transitional period
of the Oslo Accords expires.
</P>
<P>
But Israel opposes such an idea, threatening to annex parts of
the West Bank now under its control.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday voted in favor of
a resolution which passed through the Senate, calling on President
Bill Clinton to object Arafat's intention in announcing statehood.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has to give Arafat something in return if asking him
to delay the statehood announcement, but the U.S. side has done
nothing so far, not to say to help move the stalled peace process
forward, observers pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians regarded the May 4 as their legitimate date
under Oslo in declaring an independent state in the territories
and Arafat has recently visited a number of Gulf and European
states to seek their support in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat asked: "Israel stopped
implementing the Wye peace agreement last December, and why the
U.S. Congress has not passed a resolution to ask Israel to change
its position?"
</P>
<P>
As asked by Clinton, Arafat will visit Washington next Tuesday
and the statehood issue will dominate their talks.
</P>
<P>
Before that, Arafat will visit France to discuss this issue
with the French leaders.

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S.'s IBM provided its first
scholarships for Chinese university students here today.
</P>
<P>
The IBM Outstanding Chinese Student Scholarship was given to 84
students today who were selected from more than 200 applicants
from 30 Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
Li Dongxiang, the director-general of the Education Ministry's
Department of International Cooperation and Exchange, says that
cooperation between foreign companies and Chinese education
institutes is increasing and that IBM has become a major company
pushing this cooperation.
</P>
<P>
IBM signed an agreement with the Ministry of Education in March,
1995 to provide 4.5 million yuan (540,000 US dollars) worth of
scholarships for Chinese universities over a 5-year period,
starting in 1998. Today's scholarship were on the 1998 list.
</P>
<P>
IBM has also given more than 85 million US dollars worth of
computers, equipment, and software to Chinese universities and
free staff training.
</P>
<P>
T.C. Chang, an executive with the human resources section of
IBM Greater China Group, said at the scholarship ceremony that IBM
has technological strength that suits China's computer development
needs for the next century.
</P>
<P>
Li said that cooperation between Chinese universities and
American companies has proven beneficial to both sides and that
American companies can introduce their products to Chinese
consumers through this cooperation, and Chinese universities need
the money and technology of the American companies to improve
training standards.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, China has sent 110,000 students to the
U.S. to study, more than a third of the total number of Chinese
students studying abroad. The U.S. has also become the third
largest source of overseas students studying in China.
</P>
<P>
Universities in the two countries have established regular
links and major courses of study. Harvard cooperates with Beijing
University and the Wharton School of the University of
Pennsylvania has links with China's National School of
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Li says he expects this cooperation to continue to grow in the
next few years.

LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) - Britain Friday urged all British

"In view of the increasingly volatile situation in the Federal

statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that there would only be an emergency consular service

</P>
<P>
The statement was issued shortly after the ethnic Albanians in
the Serbian province of Kosovo signed the peace treaty initiated
by the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government refused to sign the treaty, saying it
violated its sovereignty by pushing troops into the region to "
monitor peace implementation".

<HEADLINE> Australia to Lodge Objection With WTO on Japan's Rice Tariff Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia is to lodge an
objection with the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva
regarding Japan's proposed 390 percent rice tariff despite fears
the move could spark a damaging trade war, Australian Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is also trade minister, admitted Australia was
risking retaliation by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, Japan was forced to
open a small segment of its previously closed rice market and
Australia grabbed a 42 million U.S. dollar a year slice of the
lucrative trade.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said Australia's plan to lodge the objection follows
Japan's decision last December to abolish its previous quota
arrangements for rice imports and to instead apply a new
tariff-based regime to take effect on April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the regime, a tariff of almost 3 U.S. dollars a kilogram,
or 390 percent, will be imposed on the remaining 92 percent of the
rice market.
</P>
<P>
Fischer has spent the past two days meeting rice growers
discussing the government's position. He admitted there were no
assurances Australia's existing rice trade will not be hurt by
Friday's move.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday, Fischer said he will discuss
the rice tariff row in Canberra on Monday with Japan's
International Trade and Industry Minister Kaoru Yosano.
</P>
<P>
Under the minimum access arrangements between Australia and
Japan, Australia's annual quota for rice export to Japan is
606,400 tons, and under existing WTO commitments it will grow to
644,300 tons from April 1, 1999 and 682,000 tons from next year.

have highly infectious forms. TB hits at least 1.13 million people
annually, Vice-minister of Health Yin Dakui told a meeting here
today to mark World TB Day on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vulnerability of AIDS patients and the emergence
of drug resistant strains make the epidemic more serious, Yin said.
</P>
<P>
Controls on TB have not been successful in recent years in
areas like Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Yunnan,
he said. Frequent migrations from rural to urban areas have also
posed risks to metropolises like Shanghai and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The MOH will hand out 100,000 pamphlets and put up 100,000
posters with information on TB soon. It will also sponsor a
nationwide contest via newspapers to draw attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has recommended a treatment known as "directly observed
treatment, short course", or DOTS, which gives TB patients daily
drug doses over a six-month period.
</P>
<P>
But, half the population is not covered by the DOTS program,
especially in remote, poor regions where people are caught in a
vicious circle of disease and poverty, warns Professor Zhang
Lixing, vice president of China's Tuberculosis Association.
</P>
<P>
Yin says that the Health Ministry will begin a national
epidemiology survey of TB next year to improve control efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Global 2000 Coordinating Group
Chairman Tim Shepheard-Walwyn said here Friday that there is "very
clear evidence of progress" in China in its bid to address the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of a three-day
meeting of the Global 2000 Coordinating Group, Shepheard-Walwyn

</P>
<P>
Shepheard-Walwyn said he was in Beijing at the beginning of
this week before the Singapore meeting, discussing precisely the
issues with officials of the People's Bank of China and the
Ministry of Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
From the meeting and presentation the representative of the
People's Bank made here, he said, it was clear that the
information about real work in China was not widely available
"prior to our discussions. "We agreed to follow up on a continuing
basis to make sure that their information will be well understood
and to make sure the international community is available to
assist banks in China."
</P>
<P>
"The level of understanding is getting better and the level of
involvement commitment is exactly declared," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sao Tome Govt Plan Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of the Sao Tome &AMP;
Principe unanimously passed Prime Minister Guilherme Posser da
Costa's government work plan aimed at fighting poverty and
stabilizing national economy in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Angolan News Agency Angog Friday,
further decreasing inflation for gradual national economy growth,
invigorating agriculture and fishery through a diversified farming
strategy, streamlining the government and privatizing the state
enterprises are all outlined in Costa's plan.
</P>
<P>
Despite some "reserved suggestions" to parts of the content of
the plan, all opposition MPs voted in favor of the plan.
</P>
<P>
The new government, ruled solely by the majority Liberation
Movement -- Social Democratic Party of the Atlantic island
country was formed on January 5.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that its smooth approval will guarantee
an efficient and strict implementation of the plan in the future.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that parliament will start to discuss the
financial budget for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, Edgar Neves, leader of the Democratic Independent
Action Party, the biggest opposition party, pointed out that the
government work plan lacks clear and specific measures for
different stages of social development.
</P>
<P>
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe is one of the most underdeveloped countries
in the world. Its main cash crop is cocoa.
</P>
<P>
The island country was stricken by serious social and economic
crisis in the early 90s. But things are changing for the better
with inflation reduced from 81 percent in 1997 to 20 percent in
1998.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Nigeria to Take Steps to Revive Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director of International
Monetary Fund (IMF), Michel Camdessus, has suggested steps which
Nigeria should take to revive its crippling economy.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus was speaking in Nigerian capital Abuja Thursday at a
forum organized by the Vision 2010, the Nigerian Economic Summit
Group and the Federal Ministry of Finance, This Day newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF chief, who is on a three-day visit to
Nigeria, the step for good governance includes a democratically
elected government, an uncompromising respect for the rule of law,
a renewed emphasis on transparency and accountability, as well as
clear and unambiguous commitment to equality in society.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is in support of Nigerian President-elect
General Olusegun Obasanjo's call for an anti-corruption agency in
the country, adding such an agency "should be independent and
directed by a person of high repute".
</P>
<P>
Camdessus who arrived in Nigeria Wednesday noted that "the
corruption that you have acknowledged plagues Nigerian society is
a symptom of a deep-rooted disease that you are determined to
bring to an end."
</P>
<P>
"This is a truly formidable task and means fundamental reform
at all levels of the economy, society and government," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The second step consists of changes in economic structure and
institutions that are needed to build a competitive and efficient
economy opening to the outside world, the IMF chief pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The changes, he added, are aimed at allowing the private sector
to become the engine of growth through diversification which would
lessen Nigeria's dependence on the oil sector for foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted that the third step is to build the foundations
of rapid sustainable economic growth through a fair, credible set
of macro-economic policies designed to establish and maintain
stability of Nigeria's economy.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in the west African country, he noted that
unless Nigeria resolved its external debt question including a
better approach in its dealings with the Paris Club, Nigeria may
continue to run into difficulties in its efforts to get debt
relief.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with some non-governmental organizations on
Thursday, he stated that Nigeria would not in the immediate future
benefit from any loan administered by IMF.
</P>
<P>
Unless Nigeria completes the IMF's staff-monitored economic
program signed in January with the Nigerian government, the
country would not get any loan from the fund, he added.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is scheduled to meet Obasanjo and hold a press
briefing on his visit before his departure on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Optimistic About Solving Lockerbie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has expressed optimism over the prospects of reaching a
final resolution to the Lockerbie issue, said a Libyan newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Al Arab daily on Friday quoted Mandela, who arrived in
Libyan capital Tripoli Thursday night, as saying that he was
confident that "(Libyan leader Muammar) Gaddafi will take a step."
</P>
<P>
The Libyan news agency reporteded that Mandela would hold talks
Friday with Gaddafi on the developments of the Lockerbie issue,
and would attend with Gaddafi a popular rally in Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had obtained a permission from the United Nations to
fly directly to Libya, despite the international air ban imposed
against Libya in 1992 for its refusal to turn over two suspects in
blowing up a passenger plane in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is visiting Libya following a tour of five European
countries, including the Netherlands, where the two suspected
Libyans agents are supposed to be tried by Scottish judges under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Britain accused the two Libyans of
involvement in the bombing and agreed to try them in the
Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Libya is demanding further guarantees for the safety of the
suspects and a fair trial pending handing them over.

<HEADLINE> WHO: Western Pacific Free From Polio for 2 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Polio eradication has reached a
major landmark with the two-year anniversary of the last case of
polio in the Western Pacific Region, said the World Health
Organization (WHO) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Since the last case of polio was found in Cambodia on March 19,
1997, there has been no trace of wild polio virus in the region,
said WHO, which is leading the international effort to eradicate
the disease.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, polio is unlikely to ever occur again in the
most heavily populated WHO region which includes China.
</P>
<P>
"We are out of the critical phase in this region," said Dr
Bruce Aylward, Global Coordinator of WHO's Polio Eradication
Initiative. "Today we celebrate this important date in the war
against polio," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seven out of 30 countries in the Western Pacific Region were
polio-endemic: Cambodia, China, Malaysia, Mongolia, Papua New
Guinea, Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
WHO is spearheading the international effort to eradicate polio
by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Only three major areas of transmission remain in the world,
namely South Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India), West Africa (
mainly Nigeria) and Central Africa (mainly the Democratic Republic
of the Congo).
</P>
<P>
As a result of mass immunization campaigns that reach hundreds
of millions of children, the number of cases worldwide has fallen
from 35,000 a year ten years ago to 5,000 cases nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The highly infectious disease most commonly affects children
under five and can cause paralysis in a matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
Interrupting the spread of wild polio virus among the
population is key to the global eradication effort. Just a few
vaccine drops guarantee a child life-long protection against the
disease.

<HEADLINE> Lewis: Mandela to Sponsor "Clean" Boxing Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela has reportedly offered to set up a new world boxing
organization in the wake of the debacle over the Lewis-Holyfield
heavyweight unification bout last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It has also been confirmed that the International Boxing
Federation judge Jean Williams - who favored Evander Holyfield -
filed a bankruptcy petition on 25 January.
</P>
<P>
The developments were revealed at Lennox Lewis's first news
conference on his return to the UK on Thursday following his
controversially drawn bout with Holyfield in New York.
</P>
<P>
The match at Madison Square Gardens went the full 12 rounds,
but the British fighter dominated and seemed certain of a points
decision to add the American's WBA and IBF belts to his own WBC
title. The drawn result provoked accusations of a fix.
</P>
<P>
Promoter Panos Eliades held up a picture of a proposed "Mandela
belt", which he said was made of 22 carat gold and worth three
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Eliades, the South African president is keen to "
clean up" the murky world of heavyweight boxing with a new single
organization - dubbed the Mandela Organization - to replace the
three major governing bodies that currently exist.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, has denied Mr.
Mandela had offered to fund a rematch in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But he said the president was a keen boxing fan who would
welcome the championship to South Africa if a deal could be
arranged.
</P>
<P>
Lewis's manager Frank Maloney, who introduced his fighter as "
the uncrowned, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world", said
that the new Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was a possible venue.
</P>
<P>
Wembley Stadium in London, the 60,000-seater Yankee Stadium in
New York and venues in Las Vegas have also been suggested.
</P>
<P>
Lewis's management team discussed the possibility of a rematch,
although Eliades said it would go ahead only if Don King - who
promoted the last fight - was not involved.
</P>
<P>
"We want to remove Don King because of the aggravation caused
by his promotion of this fight," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If he is involved it might affect the popularity of the fight
because it may be again a biased decision. Madison Square Garden
have accepted to promote the next fight."
</P>
<P>
Lewis's team also said that the British fighter would only
fight on "equal terms" - earning the same money as Holyfield. The
New York bout earned the American boxer approximately two-thirds
of the 30 million dollars purse with the remainder going to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
Elaides said they were seeking to "mandate" Holyfield to
prevent him fighting anyone else before a rematch.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions surrounding the result of Saturday's match are such
that a rematch within six months was immediately ordered by the
presidents of the International Boxing Federation, World Boxing
Association and World Boxing Council.
</P>
<P>
And a New York grand jury is to be convened for just one of
four investigations into whether illegal payments were made to the
judges of the fight.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- On Chinese Lunar New Year, 1979,
a Shanghai TV commercial in English caught the eye of Chen Guoping,
a young merchant, but he could hardly understand it.
</P>
<P>
The advertisement, it turned out, was the first by a foreign
company in China since 1949, and it caught his attention not
because of the strange language, but because of its Swiss watch
that would "never wear out". Chen was a passionate watch lover.
</P>
<P>
Chen has a shiny Rado watch he bought in March 1982 for 1,055
yuan (about 293 US dollars at the exchange rate then). He has
changed watches several times over the past 20 years, since
China's reforms and opening up began and says that his life
represents the great changes that have taken place in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen was born in Shanghai in 1948 and speaks Putonghua with a
strong Shanghai accent, leaving people with the impression that
he's a smart Shanghai businessman.
</P>
<P>
He was, in fact, one of the first to quit his job at a state-
owned factory, the Shanghai Textile Machinery Plant, after Deng
Xiaoping initiated the reform and opening-up drive in 1979 and
start his own business by selling fashionable garments. At a time
when a college-graduate was making 60 yuan a month at a government
job, Chen was making more than 1,000 yuan.

<P>
Most watches in Shanghai were selling for 300 or 400 yuan in
Shanghai in the early 1980s, but his "never wear out" watch made
him feel good and he could make bets with friends about whether
his watch could cut glass. "When you make money, you should spend
it," he says, "I like spending money and I like fashionable things,
that's why I chose the most expensive watch in Shanghai at that
time."
</P>
<P>
Later in the 1980s, the Rado became a symbol of personal status
in China, as was the case with many of Chen's friends.
</P>
<P>
But that was in the past. Chen and his wife now wear Rolexes
and they run a medium-sized Chinese restaurant on Zapo Road, which
is famous for its restaurants, and many of his business friends
now wear high-priced imported watches, he told Xinhua. The most
fashionable watches now are Rolex, Omega, Rado, Tissot, Swatch,
and Longine.
</P>
<P>
This is confirmed by Jiang Guoqiang, the director of the
Shanghai Hengdali Watch Company, one of the two leading watch
shops in Shanghai, who says that famous foreign brands sell best.
They account for about 90 percent of the monthly sales of 4
million yuan (about 484,000 US dollars). They sell at least 120
Rados each month.
</P>
<P>
Eric Steiner, vice president of the Sales and Marketing
Department of Swatch Group (H.K.) Ltd., says that his company has
sold about 500,000 Rado watches in China since it entered the
Chinese market 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Chen says, "Life can only be meaningful if you can make money
and spend it on something you like. In the past I liked watch but
didn't have money. Today I have money and I can buy anything I
like. I am a direct beneficiary of Deng Xiaoping's reforms."

<HEADLINE> India Should Sign CTBT: UK High Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain Friday reiterated its
stand that India should sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
"We (Britain) are keen to see India sign CTBT and go on the
road of non-proliferation," British High Commissioner to India Sir
Rob Young said at a function here.
</P>
<P>
On India's nuclear tests in May last year, he said British
people "were surprised and disappointed with the act." The British
government also made known its displeasure, he added.
</P>
<P>
Young acknowledged that there were certain issues where New
Delhi and London did not share similar views.
</P>
<P>
Turning to economic cooperation between the two countries, he
said bilateral economic relations had a bright future and
bilateral trade had trebled since 1993, a positive outcome of
Indo-British partnership created in the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Ensure only NZ TV Programs Count </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Communications
Minister Richard Alston said Friday the country's broadcasting
laws would be changed to ensure that only New Zealand could have
its television programs counted as local.
</P>
<P>
The move follows last year's High Court judgment that New
Zealand programs could be counted in local content quotas under
the Closer Economic Relations (CER) trade agreement signed in 1983
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries extend special treatment
to each other in trade.
</P>
<P>
Alston said the Australian Broadcasting Services Act amendment
would limit the decision to New Zealand to ensure there was no
flow-on to other countries from present or future treaties.
</P>
<P>
Australian television actors and producers feared NZ programs,
which cost Australian networks less than paying for drama,
documentaries and children's programs to be made locally, would
flood screens and cut the amount of work available.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Friday, the minister congratulated the
Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) for striking an
appropriate balance between trade and cultural objectives in its
revised standard for free-to-air TV.
</P>
<P>
The new standard, which came into effect this month, provides
safeguards for categories of Australian programs considered
vulnerable to substitution by cheaper New Zealand products while
complying with CER obligations.
</P>
<P>
Alston said the government would enforce a 10-percent
Australian content expenditure quota for pay TV.
</P>
<P>
"This should result in increased opportunities for the
Australian production industry over and above any effect of
admitting New Zealand programs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar drifted
backwards Friday, finishing weaker in light trading as the gold
price and a leading commodity index slipped.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank Treasury Manager Nick Volanakis said the
domestic currency also fell against the Japanese yen, adding
weight to its weaker performance against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the Australian dollar was buying 62.82
U.S. cents from 63.05 U.S. cents Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local unit was also buying 73.63 Japanese yen from 74.71
yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar suffers when commodity and gold prices
fall because raw materials make up two-thirds of the country's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 0.5716 euro from 0.5711 euro
Thursday, while the euro was trading at 1.0991 U.S. dollars from
1.1040 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Swazi King Calls for Peace keeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Swazi King Mswati III has
called for the establishment of a peace-keeping force for the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
King Mswati made the plea when he opened a two-day inter-state
defense and security meeting Thursday in Mbabane, the national
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates from 14 SADC countries, Mswati said a
peace-keeping force would be the most effective way to promote and
maintain peace in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The force would however need to show complete impartiality in
any country to which it was deployed.
</P>
<P>
He said the inter-state defense and security committee of the
SADC had a vital role in ensuring that peace and harmony prevailed
in the region. Regular meetings would create trust among SADC
members and together they could prevent future conflict
situations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Angola's escalating civil war and the conflict in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the king said he was confident
that SADC member countries could work together to restore peace,
law and order there. These were essential for foreign investment,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was time SADC countries used their limited resources to
create a climate for investment which would improve the economic
well-being of ordinary people, he said.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Pilgrims Plane Breaking Air Ban Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan plane which carried 125
Libyans to Saudi Arabia to perform pilgrimage in Mecca Thursday
morning has returned Tripoli airport.
</P>
<P>
A Libyan news agency report monitored here Friday said the
flight was piloted by a woman, Aisha Abdul Qadir Famu.
</P>
<P>
This flight constituted a further breaking of the air ban
imposed by the U.N. since 1992 for Libya's refusal to surrender
two suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyan intelligence agents were accused by the U.S. and
Britain of planting a bomb that blow up a Pan Am passenger plane,
killing 270 people over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan authorities termed the pilgrims plane as a
"challenge flight". Libya had earlier challenged the air embargo
by sending a pilgrims plane to Saudi Arabia in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks Break Down in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks seeking a political
solution to the conflict in Kosovo broke down on Friday, plunging
the Yugoslav province into a darker perspective of bloodshed and
war and increasing the risk of a NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the peace talks, French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, announced
that there is no more reason to continue the talks unless the
Serbs agree to sign the peace agreement presented by the six-
nation Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said in a statement that
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic should hold the "entire
responsibility" for the failure of the talks.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the press at the Elysee presidential
palace following a meeting with visiting German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, Chirac said that it is from now up to NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana to decide "in what conditions the
consequences should be drawn" from the failure of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said that measures should be taken not to leave the
observers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) in the field.
</P>
<P>
The risk of a NATO military action against Serb forces in
Kosovo is now becoming more real, as both the United States and
NATO have renewed their threat to bomb the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary
Cook said they will immediately start consultations with other
Western allies on the actions to be taken after the collapse of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
They regretted that the Serbs did not "seize the chance" for
peace in the post-Rambouillet talks held since Monday in Paris.
</P>
<P>
"There is no more reason to continue the talks. They are
suspended. There will not be resumption of the talks unless the
Serb side expresses its adherence to the agreements," said the co-
chairmen.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanian delegation signed the peace agreement on
Thursday unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic Thursday described the
agreement as a "fake" fabricated by the Kosovo Albanians and "
their American friends".
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have also been reinforcing troop deployment in Kosovo,
especially at the border with Macedonia, in preparation for an
attack by NATO troops stationed in the neighboring country.

NUWARA ELIYA, Sri Lanka, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The prevailing
political will to move forward in the South Asian was very marked
and clear, said Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing a media conference held here at the
conclusion of the 21st session of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Council of Ministers and preceding
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the manner in which difficulties were encountered
in finalizing the report of the Standing Committee, Kadirgamar
said, "it was a plain fact that there is a great deal of residual
good will and good sense that prevailed with SAARC. "
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan Thursday night finally reached an agreement
to include the Lahore Declaration in the report of the Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan insisted that the Declaration be included for
its historic significance in the bilateral relationship between
the two countries, India was of the view that SAARC should only
cover issues of multilateral interests.
</P>
<P>
Minister Kadirgamar observed that there was no change in
SAARC's position in not including issues of a bilateral or
contentious nature in its agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the Standing Committee "noted with
appreciation the reaffirmation of the SAARC goals and objects in
the Lahore Declaration adopted last month by the prime ministers
of India and Pakistan, with a view to promoting the welfare of the
peoples of South Asia."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Reduce Interest Rates by 0.125 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Board of the
Philippine central bank approved a 0.125 percent reduction in its
overnight borrowing and lending rates on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by central bank governor Gabriel C. Singson
who said that the overnight borrowing rate would drop to 12
percent from 12.125 percent and the overnight lending rate would
move down to 14 percent from 14.125 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rates would take effect on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Singson explained that the Monetary Board only decided to bring
down the overnight rates because the foreign exchange rate
continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
Following the reduction in the central bank's key overnight
rates, Singson is confident that Treasury bill rates would move
down on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In last Monday's auction, the 91-day bellwether T-bill rate had
moved down to 12.171 percent. Singson noted that a
17.1-basis-point reduction is possible on Monday as the previous
decrease in the past two weeks were around that much.
</P>
<P>
He is confident that even with the lower interest rate, the
excess liquidity would not find its way to the forex market.
</P>
<P>
Local banks, Singson said, do not foresee the peso value
dropping substantially. Even then, the central bank is keeping a
close eye on the forex market.
</P>
<P>
Singson had pointed out earlier that the forex market seemed to
be tracking the Japanese yen which in the past few days has
stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The central banks' decision to reduce its overnight rates and
the Bureau of Treasury's decision to reduce the weekly offering
volume by 500 million pesos (about 12.5 million U.S. dollars)
would have some banks scrambling for alternative investment
outlets.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that with less government securities to
invest in, the banks would finally loosen up in their funds and
start lending out more.
</P>
<P>
But local banks argued that the process is two-way, while the
banks admit that they are now more cautious in lending out money,
they also argue that credit demand is not there.
</P>
<P>
With the downturn in the economy, borrowers are reluctant to
borrow fearing another spike in interest rates or in the forex
rates that would make their borrowed funds more expensive.
</P>
<P>
The government is thus exerting all its efforts to bring down
and keep the interest rates low.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Still Leads in WTO's Top Post Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi still has the highest level of support among
133 member countries of the World Trade Organization (WTO) for his
bid to win its top post, Thai News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted WTO's ruling General Council Chairman Ali
Said Mchumo as saying that Supachai, also commerce minister,
maintained his position as the front runner of the on-going race
for the WTO's new directorship in the latest soundings.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo said however, that support for former New Zealand prime
minister Michael Moore was gaining significant ground, now just
slightly behind Supachai.
</P>
<P>
Support for former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub also
gained ground, while that of Canadian High Commissioner to London
Roy Mclaren was apparently transferred to the other three
candidates, the Tanzanian chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Mchumo earlier proposed that the Canadian candidate withdraw
from the race because he had no chance to garner unanimous support
and his support had been far behind other candidates.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the United States had indicated its
support for Maclaren as its first preference, to be followed by
Moore. However, it raised no objection to other candidates.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
The term of the current WTO chief, Italy's Renato Ruggiero,
expires at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
Supachai had pledged that he, once elected, would bridge the
gap between rich and poor countries to unite the world, enhance
trade liberalization globally and promote concrete discussions on
such key issues as textiles, labor movement and commodities.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Draft Censure Motion Against VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan MPs Thursday night
drafted a motion to censure Vice President Specioza Kazibwe for
incompetence and misconduct, the New Vision daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Parliament Spokesman Kagole Kivumbi told Xinhua in a
telephone interview Friday morning that he could not confirm
whether or not the censure motion was already drafted.
</P>
<P>
"I also read the report but I cannot tell you whether they did
it or not. It is concerning the MPs," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Parliament has had a report from the select committee on
agriculture responsible for the probe into the valley dams
scandal. But the vice president and two other ministers in the
Ministry of Agriculture have not yet responded to it. The
parliament may have recommendations on the basis of the report
next week," he added.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision report said that some MPs got very angry at
Kazibwe's attitude toward the report and the Parliament. She did
not appear before the Parliament to defend herself as she was
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, who is also the Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries, was also blamed for having no respect for
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
MPs said that they will get enough signatures to censure

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- State Councilor Wu Yi has urged
relevant trade departments to make all possible efforts to expand
the export of mechanical and electrical products.
</P>
<P>
Export expansion in this sector should be considered a major
task this year and next, Wu said in a letter to the national
meeting on the import and export of mechanical and electrical that
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China exported more than 36.5 billion U.S.
dollars worth of mechanical and electrical goods in 1998,
accounting for over 36 percent of all exports. The increase of
exports in this sector was 12.2 percent, 11.7 percent higher than
the overall export growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Wu described the export of mechanical and electrical products
as the hope of China's foreign trade, saying that at a time when

expansion of exports in this sphere is fundamental to the growth
of exports overall this year.
</P>
<P>
She also called for the upgrading of the quality of these
products, the expansion of large-scale production, the
introduction of high-technology and name brands, the upgrading of
overall quality and after-sale services, and the exploration of
new markets.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Outline of Deng's Thoughts on Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Outline of Deng Xiaoping's
Thoughts on Population, which was compiled by the State Family
Planning Commission, has been published by the People's Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
The outline introduces the major content of Deng's thoughts on
population, which include his views on China's national situation,
population and economic and social development strategies, family
planning policy, the improvement of the quality of the population,
and the human rights struggle in family planning.
</P>
<P>
"The book will help readers understand family planning through
a general background which focuses on the economy, society,
resources and environment," said Zhang Weiqing, minister in charge
of the State Family Planning Commission, today at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He added that the book also provides a detailed introduction of
the important role of family planning in controlling the rapid
population growth, improving the quality of the population and
realizing strategic goals for the country's social and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"The outline is not only a reference book for family planning
departments, but also for Party and government officials at all
levels, who are expected to study Deng Xiaoping's Theory and know
more about the population problem and family planning policy in
China," Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the outline should be studied along with the
principles put forward by a central government's symposium on
population, resources and environment earlier this month.
Population control as the No.1 issue for sustainable development
was highlighted at the symposium and is actually a reiteration of
Deng's thought on the issue.

<HEADLINE> HK Official Describes 1999 Budget as People's Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang Friday described the 1999 budget he revealed not long
ago as "a people's budget" and "a budget for jobs."
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the joint business community luncheon,
Tsang exploded several myths on the budget with powerful facts.
</P>
<P>
On the first myth that the budget does nothing for the
grassroots, Tsang said that the government's total recurrent
spending in the coming financial year will grow by 6.5 percent in
real terms.
</P>
<P>
The main areas of growth are social welfare, up 13.6 percent to
29 billion HK dollars (3.72 billion U.S. dollars); education, up 5.
1 percent to 44 billion HK dollars (5.64 billion U.S. dollars);
health, up 3.5 percent to 30 billion HK dollars (3.84 billion U.S.
dollars); and security, up 4.1 percent to 25 billion HK dollars (3.
2 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
All of these growth figures are "clearest evidence that the
1999 budget is a people's budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to another myth that he exploded is the idea that the
budget does nothing for the unemployed, Tsang said that the
proposals he announced will lead to creation of some 32,000 jobs
in the local labor market in the near to medium term.
</P>
<P>
These new opportunities will be in addition to the 122,000 new
jobs to be generated by major initiatives, infrastructure projects
and public works program of the government in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The cyberport alone will create some 4,000 jobs during
construction, and 12,000 jobs in the information and technology
related fields and other supporting services on completion.
</P>
<P>
The shipping industry will generate 16,000 jobs in the next
three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "The fact of the matter is: this is a budget for
jobs."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is vital that "we maintain our reputation
for prudent fiscal policies."
</P>
<P>
"To try to achieve these conflicting objectives we have put
forward a carefully balanced package. The package provides short
term relief but also sows the seeds for long term recovery," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon was sponsored by the 19 Hong Kong and foreign
chambers of commerce.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Auctions Loans Worth Billions of Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand on Friday auctioned off
business loans worth 6.2 billion U.S. dollars, with a great
portion of the assets sized up by several large overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Bidding closed at 1:00 p.m. (06:00 GMT) in a second auction of
assets owned by finance companies reeling under the financial
crisis, the Financial Sector Restructuring Authority (FRA) said.
</P>
<P>
Results of the auction, however, are not expected until late
Friday or over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Up for sale were 46 lots containing a total of more than 7,000
loans worth 226,494 billion baht (6.2 billion dollars). Overseas
investors, including Lehman Brothers and the Pavilion Fund, are
reported to be big buyers of the assets.
</P>
<P>
FRA said earlier that 35 investors had applied for data on
batches of loans.
</P>
<P>
Winning bidders will be required to pay 80 percent of their
bids up front, with the rest paid later out of the cashflow
received from serving the assets.
</P>
<P>
Friday's sale was deemed more successful than the first
10-billion-dollar auction in December last year, in which only
nine of the 45 lots on offer were cleared.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the recent passage of bankruptcy and foreclosure
laws by parliament paved the way for Friday's smooth sale.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea claimed Friday to have
shot down one Ethiopian MI-35 helicopter Thursday on the
Mereb-Setit front near Badme as the fierce fighting continued
between the two countries.
</P>

According to a press release from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry

tanks, three vehicles carrying anti-aircraft guns and captured
two tanks intact Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Housing Starts Plunge in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel's housing starts
totaled 42,920 in 1998, 16 percent lower than 50,930 in 1997,
said a Central Bureau of Statistics report here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report is the latest indicator to the ongoing slowdown in
Israel's housing market. The Housing Ministry has stated that
50,000 building starts a year are needed to meet demand, and once
they fall bellow this figure, real estate prices will rise.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that of the total apartments whose construction
began last year, 33,200 were built by private contractors and
9,720 by the government, a 38 percent decrease in both private and
public housing starts.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that the recovery of the property market
may still take a while, as housing starts continued to decline in
the last quarter of 1998 to 10,660 from 11,030 a year earlier. The
decline was mainly due to a 25 percent decrease in state-sponsored
building.
</P>
<P>
Building completions also declined during 1998, down 21 percent
to 50,600. The report showed that the public sector dropped 21
percent, the private sector 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel's mortgage banks also agreed that 1998 was
terrible for them. They saw bleak hope that things will go any
better this year.
</P>
<P>
The aggregate net profit of all the eight mortgage banks in
Israel was 102 million U.S. dollars in 1998, a 20.7 percent drop
from 128.7 million dollars in 1997, according to figures issued by
the Mortgage Banking Society.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in the real estate market and the rising risk
level in the construction sector has led the banks to cut credit
to the sector.
</P>
<P>
The mortgage banks' credit to households totaled 5.1 billion
dollars in 1998, a drop of 11 percent compared with 1997.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Credit Ratings Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thailand's credit ratings were up from lower grades to the
current BI foreign currency country ceiling for bonds and notes,
BI foreign currency country ceiling for bank deposits, and BaaI
for baht denominated government securities, according to Moody's,
a U.S. leading credit rating agency.
</P>
<P>
This reflected the country's improved status in terms of the
stabilization of the balance of payment, local currency and
foreign exchange rate, Moody's said in a statement available here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The improvement would also serve as a firm fundamental base
for structural reforms in the country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The ratings also reflected Thailand's progress in its efforts
to pull the economy out of the recession, compared with a
precarious position a year ago when it was first hit by the
economic turmoil, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement indicated that there were no signs that Thailand
would have to ask for any moratorium for external debt payments.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out, however, that the country's future ratings
would depend on the government's ability to push ahead more
vigorously and effectively its financial and corporate
restructuring programs, which are crucial for the country's
economic revival.

<HEADLINE> France to Offer Preferential Loans for Shanghai Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The French Government is to offer
two loans on favorable terms to the Chinese government to help
complete the No. 3 Line of Shanghai's Subway project and a water
plant project in the city.
</P>
<P>
The deals were signed today by Chinese Trade Minister Shi
Guangsheng.
</P>
<P>
They will be counter-signed soon by the French Minister of
Finance, Economics and Industry Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Paris.
The contracts stipulate that the French Government will provide
preferential credit as high as 1.08 billion French Francs (about
181 million US dollars) for the subway project.
</P>
<P>
And a loan of 164.21 million French Francs (about 24.51 million
US dollars) will be used to build the Longxi Water Plant in
Shanghai. The money will be used to buy water purification
technology, power supplies and silt treatment equipment as well as
water pumps.

The Shanghai subway is one the leading cooperative projects
between China and France. During French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's visit to China last year, Chinese and French companies
signed a letter of intent for the manufacture and supply of subway
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed the draft protocol on February 10 this
year which confirmed French plans for extending the loan.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post
</P>
<P>
-- Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, spiritual leader of Israeli Shas Party,
Thursday attacked the judiciary over the conviction of Shas
political leader Aryeh Deri.
</P>
<P>
Yosef said that the verdict by the secular judges of Jerusalem
District Court came from hatred, not justice. Deri was convicted
early this week of bribe-taking, fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's El Al air line Thursday canceled a flight to Turkey
scheduled for Friday because of a credible warning about a
possible terrorist attack on Israeli tourists.
</P>
<P>
But a senior adviser of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu stated that neither the Prime Minister's Office nor the
Israeli security forces was involved in El Al's decision to cancel
the flight.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot
</P>
<P>
-- Israel Thursday revoked the VIP card of Palestinian
official Ziad Abu Zayad, as well as special travel permits and
privileges given to Faisal Husseini and Hanan Ashrawi, in
response to their participation in a meeting with foreign
diplomats at the Orient House in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Security sources also said that the Israeli government will
order the close of the Orient House if the Palestinian officials
continue political activities there.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sounds Alarm on Unsafe Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Every eight seconds, a child dies
from a water-related disease in the world; unsafe water causes 3.3
billion illnesses and 5.3 million deaths yearly; and one-fifth of
world's freshwater fish species have been pushed to the edge of
extinction owing to contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
The alarming figures are not fictions, but the reality revealed
by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis by UNEP and the U.N. University, half
of population in developing countries are suffering from diseases
caused either directly by infection through consumptions of
contaminated water or food, or indirectly by vectors, such as
mosquitoes that breed in water.
</P>
<P>
These diseases include diarrhea, cholera, dengue fever,
malaria, river blindness and trachoma which alone causes six
million cases of blindness or severe complications annually.
</P>
<P>
The UN warns that unless action is stepped up, the number of
people without access to safe water will increase to 2.3 billion
by 2025, with number of those die from unsafe water expected to
rise sharply as well.
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost to provide safe water in rural areas is 50
U.S. dollars per person and 105 U.S. dollars per person in cities,
the U.N. says. Providing sanitation needs an additional 30 U.S.
dollars per person in rural areas and 145 U.S. dollars in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
At present, 20 percent of the world's population in 30
countries face water shortage, a figure that will rise to 30
percent of the world's population in 50 countries by 2025,
according to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
The theme of World Water Day on March 22 of this year is
"Everyone lives downstream", which is meant that problems in one
part of a watershed, or in one country, can affect people great
distances away.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Regions Faces Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The southern and central provinces
of Mozambique are facing shortage of food in the coming three
months due to the heavy rains which have flooded many of the farm
lands, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
Carlos do Rosario, Agriculture and Fishery Minister, made the
prediction Thursday when he presented his flood report to the
parliament after his tour to the flooded regions, the Noticias
daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rosario said about 70,000 hectares of farm land, especially in
the southern provinces suffer from the heavy rains, adding that
the country may not face too serious food problems if a harvest
can be expected in the north.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that farmers in the north should be taught to
increase production in a bid to help the flood-ridden southerners.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country as a whole may expect a record high
grain production, if the northern provinces have a good harvest in
the agricultural year which starts from July 1 to June 30 the next
year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique harvested a record high of 1.69 million tons of
grain last year.

<HEADLINE> Three Arrested Americans in Zimbabwe Not Tortured: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Medical reports on the three
Americans in custody on allegations of attempting to carry out
acts of sabotage in Zimbabwe have ruled out torture or the use of
force during their interrogation, the daily Herald reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prisons doctor and an independent specialist agreed in
their reports that there was nothing alarming in the condition of
the three. No swelling was observed during physical examinations.
 Nothing abnormal was detected during X-ray examinations.
</P>
<P>
When the three -- John Lamonte Dixon, Joseph Wendell Petijohn
and Garry Blanchard -- appeared on initial remand at the
magistrates' court last weekend, they complained of the use of
force and torture by the multi- agency investigating team looking
at their case.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that they be sent for medical examinations to
determine the validity of their claims.
</P>
<P>
All three were examined by a prison medical practitioner M.
Madhombiro and specialist general surgeon in the department of
surgery at the Medical School A.C. Harid.
</P>
<P>
The reports cited normal functioning of body organs. No
internal bleeding or evidence of such injuries were detected.
</P>
<P>
Their clergy claim has been strongly rejected by Zimbabwe's
investigating officers who said there was nothing to substantiate
it.
</P>
<P>
The Herald also quoted President Robert Mugabe as saying that
the arrest of the three Americans should be viewed with concern as
the country did not condone acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The three Americans were arrested at the Harare International
Airport on March 7 for illegal possession of offensive weapons and
other war materials.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities, Colleges Welcome Return of Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- With the date for the return of
Macao approaching, some Chinese universities and colleges have
increased their Macao research, and also made efforts to train
teachers and other professionals ready for the transition period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao students in Beijing University staged a
photographic and postcard exhibition this week to highlight the
return of Macao to the motherland. The show, the first of its kind
in any Chinese university, aims to highlight Macao's history,
current situation and bright future.
</P>
<P>
Joan Ma, the initiator of the exhibition, said that all Macao
students studying in China's interior areas are looking forward to
Macao's return to the motherland which will take place on December
20 this year.
</P>
<P>
"We collected the available information and materials related
to Macao during the winter holiday, and wanted to present a real
and vivid Macao to the people," she added.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xuan, a third-year history student at Beijing University
said, "I felt affinity with Macao through this exhibition and want
to do further research if I have the opportunities,"
</P>
<P>
The Philosophy Department of the Remin (People's) University of
China set up a Macao Research Association in 1998 and the head of
the association says that it helps both teachers and students to
understand Macao more thoroughly and further increase their
confidence in the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Experts on Macao in Beijing University recently submitted a
report on the future economic development of Macao, and held a
related seminar on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade universities and colleges in south China's
Guangdong Province have made efforts to train teachers and other
professionals about Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Teachers' University of South China set up a branch in
Macao and opened a variety of four-year and two-year higher
education programs 12 years ago and so far more than 1,000 on-job
teachers in Macao have received advanced training in the fields of
teaching and the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
Yan Zexian, president of the university disclosed that the
Teachers' University of South China has established Bachelor
Degree curriculums in Macao, which include land measurement and
administration, which have attracted over forty Macao civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of other prestigious higher-learning
institutions in the province such as Jinan University and
Zhongshan University have introduced diversified educational
programs for Macao residents, majoring in enterprise management,
sociology, land planning, accounting and public administration.

<HEADLINE> China Accuses U.S. of Clinging to Cold War Mentality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- China Thursday rejected the
allegations that it had stolen nuclear weapons designs from a
United States laboratory, and accused the United States of
clinging to a "Cold War" mentality in dealing with China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, He Yafei, minister-counselor at
the Chinese Embassy here, said that the espionage charges were "
completely groundless and irresponsible".
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-U.S. relations have become the victim of party
politics in the United States," said He, who added that this grew
particularly evident as the 2000 U.S. presidential election nears.
</P>
<P>
He said that the allegations would harm the improving relations
between the two countries, and that some Chinese scientists were
doubting whether to continue exchanges with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to name any names but there are some people in
the States who don't want to see any progress in U.S.-China ties,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the forthcoming visit to the United States by
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, He said the visit, the first by a
Chinese premier in 15 years, will be a very important event in
Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"The visit itself is an important event. As you know, summits
between heads of state and heads of government are extremely
important because they will increase each other's understanding,"
He said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese diplomat said waves of anti-China sentiment and
undercurrents related to human rights, nuclear issues and some
others would certainly surface in the United States whenever the
Sino-U.S. relations saw an improvement and whenever the two
countries were preparing for an important summit.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the alleged nuclear espionage and theft, He replied
that "nothing of this sort has ever happened."
</P>
<P>
"China has never benefited from anything illegal," the diplomat
said. "We have normal exchange programs. Of course each side will
benefit from these exchange programs, otherwise it will be
meaningless. But it has nothing to do with nuclear military
technology."
</P>
<P>
He said the China-U.S. ties and scientific cooperation in
particular were jeopardized by those opposed to progress of
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Don't let the Sino-U.S. relations fall victim to that," the
Chinese diplomat asked.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand Imports of Mechano-Electrical Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China will expand its imports of
high-tech mechanical and electrical equipment to meet the needs of
massive infrastructure construction, an official with the Chinese
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted an increased demand for energy,
transportation, communications and other areas as the country
continues to expand domestic need and pour more money into
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
China's Customs statistics show that China's mechanical and
electrical equipment imports have been increasing since the latter
half of last year. Imports of appliance and electronics products
increased 33.4 percent in the first two months this year, as
against a slight fall in exports.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the increase to the country's effective
crackdown on smuggling and its new tax-exemption policies for the
import of high-tech products and overseas-funded firms.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the yuan will also benefit imports of
mechanical and electrical products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that imports of such products will
mainly be high-tech ones that cannot be manufactured in China but
are urgently needed for the country's construction.
</P>
<P>
Such imports will vigorously promote technical upgrading in
Chinese enterprises and improve the quality of domestic electrical
products, which will in turn eventually boost exports of
mechanical and electrical equipment, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China will continue to restrict the
importation of those products that can be manufactured here, and
consumer goods that are piled up in stock in the country, and
reduce redundant imports.
</P>
<P>
The offices in charge of importing mechanical and electrical
products around the country will be able to receive timely
information from Customs services and foreign exchange and tax
departments via the Internet to serve the state's macro-control of
imports, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Some new regulations concerning the reform of import quotas and
registration are also anticipated, the official said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Last year, China's tax revenue
from overseas-funded companies surged 26.2 percent over the 1997
figure to 123.3 billion yuan, a rise of 25.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
This figure indicates that this type of tax revenue accounted
for 14.42 percent of all industrial and commercial tax revenue
nationwide, according to today's China Taxation News.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, added value and consumption tax revenue grew 23.
29 percent over 1997 to 81.8 billion yuan, income tax revenue grew

<HEADLINE> Romanian Central Banker: Be Confident in National Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Romanian central banker Mugur
Isarescu said here Thursday that the national bank was capable of
maintaining its grip on the foreign exchange market and called on
the people to remain confident in the national currency, the leu,
and not to rush for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a time when the foreign exchange market
experienced strong swings despite a fixed exchange rate set by the
central bank between the dollar and the leu.
</P>
<P>
The dollar, officially set at the level of 15,115 lei, surged
to 20,000 before retreating to 14,000, and then crawled back to 17,
000 at the close of trading on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu said the exchange market would soon restore its
stability, and the central bank was monitoring the foreign
exchange market every day.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, Chairman of the Senate
Pettrre Romanas and the government spokesman have voiced their
confidence in the central bank's capability of curbing the turmoil
in the exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Experts here have ruled out the possibility of sharp
fluctuations in the exchange market in the following days.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the leu has touched off remarkable social
disturbances, and a financial crisis as the media here put it.
</P>
<P>
As people rush to buy the dollar and commodities, wholesalers
and retailers either repeatedly raise the selling prices or adopt
a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
Observers have attributed the devaluation of the leu to a
continued economic recession in the country and serious trade
deficits in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Western Pacific Region may be
certified as polio-free next year as no new cases have been found
for the second consecutive year, Dr. Julian Bilous, a member of
the polio team of the WHO for the Western Pacific region, said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks to the efforts of the countries concerned, we are out
of the critical phase in the Region," Dr. Julian Bilous said this
afternoon at a press conference in Manila.
</P>
<P>
The Region will be able to be certified as polio-free next
year, after three consecutive years with no new cases. But
countries are still on the alert. Polio immunization and
surveillance will continue at high levels until the world is
polio-free.
</P>
<P>
The last case in this Region, a little girl aged 15 months, was
found in Cambodia on March 19, 1997. Since then, even though there
has been very good surveillance in every country of the Western
Pacific region, no new case of polio has been reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of Chinese
commodities are oversupplied despite a real 9.6 percent real
growth in total retail sales last year.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the State Administration of Internal Trade
showed that out of 605 major retail products available in China
only palm oil was in short supply in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The administration attributed the situation to redundant
production that gained prominence in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Another survey conducted by the administration in 250 shopping
centers in China's major cities show that sales of 15 commodities
last year grew by more than 50 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
Such items as cold and hot water dispensers, which provide
purified drinking water, have rocketed 543.4 percent year on year.
</P>
<P>
Other hugely popular products include wines, VCD (video compact
disk) players, personal computers, large screen color TV sets, air-
conditioners and micro-wave ovens.
</P>
<P>
The improved sales of these products indicate that Chinese
citizens are enjoying a better and more comfortable life.

<HEADLINE> 4 Wounded in Bomb Blast in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Four people were wounded in a bomb
blast late Thursday night in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey,
local daily Milliyet reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that unidentified assailants threw a bomb which
exploded at the building of Erzincan Citizen Association at the
Ihlamurkuyu Fevzi Cakmak Street in Samandira district of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been
fighting a 15-year-old war for independence in southeastern
Turkey, was again blamed for the blast.
</P>
<P>
The report said all the wounded were discharged from hospital
soon after being taken to, adding that an investigation into the
explosion is underway.
</P>
<P>
A series of bombing attacks have been launched in Turkey in
protest against the capture of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is
now being jailed on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's
western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 13 people were killed in a bomb blast in a "Blue
Market" in Goztepe district in Kadikoy of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Later, Istanbul Governor Erol Cakir announced new security
measures in the city, saying that the doors of stadiums, movie
theaters and similar buildings will be equipped with metal
detectors within three months.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between the PKK, accused as a "terrorist group",
and the Turkish government have claimed over 37,000 lives since
August 1984.

<HEADLINE> International Tourism Surges in First Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Both overseas tourist arrivals
and tourism foreign exchange earnings surged in China in the first
month of this year, according to figures released by the National
Tourism Administration today.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates China's international tourism is gradually
coming out of the shadow of the Asian financial crisis," an
official of the administration commented.
</P>
<P>
Using the present statistical analysis, "overseas tourists"
include foreign visitors, overseas Chinese, and compatriots from
Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In January, overseas visitor arrivals totaled 5.46 million, a
year-on-year rise of 7.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 529,300 were foreign visitors, up 14.88 percent; 9,
800 overseas Chinese, down 27.23 percent; 4.75 million Hong Kong
and Macao tourists, an increase of 6.35 percent; and 173,900
tourists from Taiwan, up 19.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that arrivals from Japan, the largest
market, recorded a significant rise of 27.52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among 14 other major markets, those of the Republic of Korea,
Indonesia, the United States, France and Britain scored increases
ranging from 20 to over 70 percent. However, those from Singapore
and Russia dropped substantially.
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 1.032 billion U.S. dollars from
tourism in January, rising 11.75 percent year-on-year. Those
staying overnight spent a total of 883 million dollars, making up
85.57 percent of the total; and day-trippers spent 149 million
dollars, accounting for 14.43 percent.

<HEADLINE> NATO May Strike to End Kosovo Conflict: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization Secretary-General Javier Solana said he had sent a
sharp warning to the Serbian authorities, indicating a possible
NATO strike to end the conflict in troubled Kosovo in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Solana made the remark a press conference in here Thursday
night. He said that "I'd like to make a very clear appeal to the
Serbian authorities: If an agreement (on Kosovo) is not reached,
NATO is ready to take all responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not want to go into the specifics of a NATO
operation, but NATO is ready to deploy its troops to preserve the
agreement, if signed, between both sides of the Kosovo dispute,
"in order to prevent any humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo, which
is ethnically dominated by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to play with dates, but time is running out for
sure," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that Turkey
supports its enlargement and revival, adding the expansion should
take place with the "equal participation" of all European
countries.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Cem, Solana, who arrived here for a
one-day working visit, also met with Turkish Defense Minister
Hikmet Sami Turk, Parliament Speaker Hikmet Cetin and was received
by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-Austrian Trade Enjoys Smooth Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China and Austria have maintained
smooth cooperation in trade, investment, finance and technology
exchange since the two sides established diplomatic relations in
1971.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese President Jiang Zemin prepares for his state visit
to Austria next week, Sino-Austrian trade and economic cooperation
is expected to get a further boost, according to some analysts

</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume hit 483 million U.S. dollars in 1998, up
6.2 percent from 1997. China's exports to Austria reached 211
million U.S. dollars, up 5.8 percent. The major export commodities

Austrian-invested projects with a contractual investment of 452
million U.S. dollars worth had been established in China. Most of

In the financial sector, since the loan granted to China by the
Austria government in 1985, China had received a total of 9.6
billion Austrian schillings (about 890 million U.S. dollars) in
contractual volume by the end of 1995, and arrived loans amounted
to 8.75 billion schillings (about 800 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that those loans have been used for
hydro-electric and thermal power plants, metallurgy, automobiles,
and other heavy industries, as well as chemicals, infrastructure,
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Austria is one of China's major technology suppliers, and since
China began importing technology from Austria in 1978, there has
been a total of 376 technology-transfer contracts, involving 1.64
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC officials said that in the areas of metallurgy, heavy-
duty vehicles, railways, urban construction, electric power,
foodstuff and plastics, Austria enjoys technological advantages,
and China has bought many of these products.
</P>
<P>
"China and the west European nations, including Austria, are
quite complementary in their respective economies, and there is a
still great potential for cooperation in trade and investment,"
said a MOFTEC official during a recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Austria, the official
said, will greatly enhance cooperation between the enterprises of
the two nations, and bring trade and economic cooperation to a new

"The old higher figures for assessing blood pressure levels are
not suitable for contemporary life as people in China are more
prone these days to suffer from hypertension," said Ge Hong at the
China Hypertension League, which monitors the situation.

"We will be able to detect hypertension much more easily with
these lower figures for systolic and diastolic pressure," he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Carwashes Popular Places These Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Automobiles squeezed into
Beijing's carwashes today with the clearing after six days of
overcast skies and occasional drizzle.
</P>
<P>
The rain of last few days was especially dirty with suspended
particles and smoke contained in the thick cloud cover, according
to the city's Meteorology Bureau, making cars parked outside grimy
fast.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has about 100 carwashes and more than 1.35 million
automobiles, and when the beautiful day came, cars began lining up
around 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
"I have about 40 cars already," said one owner of a carwash in
the southeastern part of the city, with 20 or so cars waiting to
be cleaned. If things continued like this, he estimated, he could
wash 300 cars today.
</P>
<P>
Some owners were expecting the change of weather and were well
prepared, but drivers were still complaining about the long lines.
At a regular carwash, they had to wait at least 15 minutes to be
served.
</P>
<P>
Other people saw the chance to earn some pocket money and
gathered around parking lots and along streets to clean cars whose
drivers could not afford the wait at a carwash. But, because of a
lack of confidence in their ability to properly handle luxury
autos, few Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo or Honda owners could be seen
using their services, even though a better carwash costs as much
as 50 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Anticipates Bright Future for Chinese Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- A Swiss tourism office opened
this week in Beijing heralded the first European presence in
China's tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
"One of the major goal's of the office is to prepare for
opening Switzerland to Chinese tourists," according to Zhang
Wenjia, chief representative of the Switzerland Tourism Office in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland is not as yet a primary destination for Chinese
tourists. However, Switzerland is well aware of the vast
potential of the Chinese market and is fully cognizant of the fact
that reform and opening will enable more Chinese to afford foreign
travel," according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She noted the Switzerland, a country with only seven million
people, initiated the development of tourism some 200 years ago
and has since emerged as a leading European tourism destination.
The travel industry has developed into one of the country's
economic pillars, ranking closely behind the machine-building and
chemical industries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said she is currently contacting Chinese travel agencies
and local media sources to provide more about Swiss tour
itineraries and provide Chinese tourists with a good image of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Tourism cooperation between China and Switzerland has developed
rapidly over the past two years, according to Zhang. She noted
that the two nations signed a memorandum of understanding on
tourism cooperation in 1998, and added that the China National
Tourism Administration opened an office in Zurich in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang pointed out that Chinese President Jiang Zemin will visit
Switzerland at the end of this month, with tourism expected to be
a major topic under discussion.
</P>
<P>
"Switzerland hopes to an open destination for Chinese tourists,
" said Zhang.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Champion Diver Shows Little Rust at Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, SOUTH CHINA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Three-time Olympic
champion Fu Mingxia showed little sign of inactivity with an
impressive comeback at China's national diving championship
qualifier here on Wednesday, after two years without a single dive.
</P>
<P>
Fu, Olympic champion in the 1992 and 1996 Games, led throughout
the competition and took the three-meter springboard event, which
qualified her for the national championships next month.
</P>
<P>
Fu capped her comeback as she posted a total of 306.75 points
in the finals after she totaled 508 points, 70 ahead of the
nearest rival in the preliminaries and play-offs.
</P>
<P>
The Nanning stadium fell silent when Fu scaled the springboard,
stretched her arms, somersaulted, twisted and splashed neatly,
inviting a resounding applause mixed with surprising acclamation.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jihong, coach of the national squad, said that it was not
easy for Fu to be in such a good shape after an absence from sport
for over two years.
</P>
<P>
"The main problem for her now is just the entry, which was not
as perfect as ever. It will be up to how she trains later," said
Zhou, a former Olympic champion diver.
</P>
<P>
Diving judge Hu Demei echoed Zhou's views, saying she fell
short of enough power when diving and her entry into water remains
to be polished. But she was still impressed by Fu's swift return
to her form.
</P>
<P>
"She has made an amazing, speedy recovery. Last time I saw
her dive in July, it was really incredible for her diving belied
her reputation as Olympic champion."
</P>
<P>
"She was a little overweight at that time, but now she has shed
much weight," said Hu, who coached Fu since she began her diving
career as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
Fu, 21, made Olympic history by becoming the first woman to
sweep both springboard and platform titles in the 1996 Games.
Physically and mentally exhausted after that, Fu announced her
retirement and enrolled in prestigious Beijing-based Qinghua
University.
</P>
<P>
But she returned to the pool last July, joining the
university's newly-formed diving team guided by Yu Fen, the former
national coach who led Fu to Olympic stardom.
</P>
<P>
At Nanning, Fu scored her highest score of 65.1 points in the
preliminaries and 69.75 in the final, on a highly-difficult dive
termed 107B, a dive she had failed to execute well during the
preliminary round at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Yu was little surprised with the performance by the former
Olympic champion, who represented the Qinghua University team in
the national qualifiers, saying Fu is characterized with
consistence especially in dives with high degrees of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Fu, however, kept sober-minded, saying a lot yet to be done. "
I won for I am kind of in better form and took the upper hands
capitalizing my experience," she said.
</P>
<P>
"But I have to begin from zero," she added.
</P>
<P>
Fu had said that she would train for the World University Games
in 1999 and 2001 and was considering competing at the 2000 Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
If she competes in Sydney and once again makes it a "golden
double", she will become the most decorated Olympic champion diver
with five titles to her credit.

apparently referring to the opening of bus service between India

South Asian countries are among the poorest in the world, and
"this has to be changed," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Considering More T-Bond Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance is
considering issuing more treasury bonds to meet increasing demand
following the positive response from private investors to the 50-
billion-yuan certificate treasury bonds issued on March 10.
</P>
<P>
A ministry official said here today that this year's first-
batch treasury bond issue is expected to be sold far sooner than
scheduled, and in some places the allotted bonds already have been
sold out.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the public's enthusiasm mainly to confidence in
the central government's macroeconomic control measures and
proactive fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
Private investors' awareness of investment risks has been
dramatically raised along with China's reform and market economy,
the official said, adding that interest rates higher than those
for bank deposits, as well as the bond's new authorization to
serve as collateral for banks loans, are also attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
The ministry began issuing certificate bonds in 1994, and has
been doing so successfully for the past five years. In 1998, China
issued 220 billion yuan worth of such bonds.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond issues are an important component of the
country's proactive financial policy, and the ministry will take
into full consideration the various demands of private investors
when they determine the timing and scale of new bond issues, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Blamed for Blocking Access of N.Z. Honey Bees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Minister for
International Trade Lockwood Smith Friday criticized the United
States for blocking the access of New Zealand honey bees to the
country.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the Sanitary-Phyto-Sanitary Agreement
(SPS) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) here, Smith said that
since 1978, the apiary industry of New Zealand has been seeking
access to export its honey bees to the United States, and so far,
"I can't report success."
</P>
<P>
"Our honey bees have been locked out of the U.S., and we don't
know why," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the SPS Agreement, Smith said, the U.S. response must be
based upon an adequate scientific justification.
</P>
<P>
"If we aren't satisfied at this stage, we have the option to
enter formal consultations, and if that failed, we'd have the
option of taking the honey bee case to the trade equivalent of
the World Court -- a WTO disputes panel.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to win that case, and the U.S. still wouldn't
accept our honey bees, we'd be entitled to slap trade sanctions on
the U.S.," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Gunboat diplomacy is not a realistic option, nor would an
economy as small as New Zealand be likely to win a trade war with
an economy as big as the U.S.," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. can't show us any real risk, then we'll use our
best diplomatic efforts to insist the SPS Agreement be honored,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's apiary industry is a small but successful export
earner, with approximately 2,000 employees and 12 million N.Z.
dollars (6.4 million U.S. dollars) in foreign exchange earnings
last year. New Zealand's honey is exported to Japan, Saudi Arabia
and Germany.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Finance Ministers Open Meeting in Hanoi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hanoi, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The Third ASEAN Finance Ministers
Meeting (AFMM) opened here this morning with the main theme of
cooperation in finance in the region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are finance ministers from the nine ASEAN
member countries -- Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- and ASEAN
Secretary-General Rodolfo Severino. The finance minister of
Cambodia also is also attending the meeting as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Finance Minister Nguyen Sinh Hung, chairman of the
meeting, said in his opening speech, "The main objective of the
meeting is further enhancing and strengthening cooperation in
finance within ASEAN and between ASEAN and the dialogue partners
and international financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
"Since the end of 1998," he said, "signs and conditions have
emerged for the recovery of economic growth in the region though
the magnitude varies from country to country."
</P>
<P>
However, Hung continued, "the developments in the money and
finance sector in the region as well as globally will be extremely
complicated that require bolder and more efficient economic reform
measures, particularly cooperation measures in the money and
finance sector."
</P>
<P>
He said this meeting will focus its discussions first on
approaches and a timetable to implement the main finance-related
elements in the decisions made by the leaders of ASEAN governments
at the Sixth ASEAN Summit.
</P>
<P>
Second, he said, the ministers will consider the first report
of the ASEAN Surveillance Process prepared by the ASEAN Select
Committee and third, they will discuss ASEAN joint approaches to
international and regional financial issues, such as a common
ASEAN stand in international fora and the reform of the
international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said in his keynote
speech at the opening ceremony that this meeting "will help
increase our understanding and confidence and will bring about
efficient and effective cooperation for a strong ASEAN and for a
world of peace, stability and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The first AFMM was held in March 1997 in Thailand and the
second in February 1998 in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Raps U.S. Over Establishment of Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a commentary, Rodong Sinmun charged that the United States'
pursuit of the TMD is intended to establish its military
domination and monopoly of the world.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the TMD system which also covers the
Korean Peninsula in addition to the nuclear systems in east Asia
would undoubtedly seriously damage the balance of strategic
weapons in the region, and lead to a complicated structure of
confrontation and the menace of war, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Running contrary to the global trend of establishing
partnerships for peace, the United States was seeking to establish
its military dominance and monopoly of the world by deploying
missile defense systems in Japan, South Korea and other areas in
the world, it said.
</P>
<P>
So far, the creation of the TMD system has drawn sharp
criticism both in the United States and from other countries, with
critics charging that it is in violation of the 1972 Anti-
Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty signed between the United States
and the former Soviet Union. The ABM is designed to limit both
sides' ability to deploy anti-missile systems.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Stresses Trust, Understanding Within SAARC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NUWARA ELIYA, Sri Lanka, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Promotion of
mutual trust and understanding is essential to the prosperity of
South Asian countries, Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said
in a speech available here Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Council of Ministers of South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Thursday, Minister
Aziz believed that good neighborly relations, relief of tensions
and confidence building is the way to peace, stability and amity
and accelerated socioeconomic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Only by resolving our differences will we be able to ensure
peace, security and economic development in the region, which has
become imperative not only as a result of the nuclearization of
South Asia but owing to the pressing need for economic development
and social progress in the SAARC region on the eve of the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
While highlighting the recent development between Pakistan and
India by the historic Lahore Declaration, Aziz also pointed out
that the SAARC region still abounds in strife and political
tensions and has now come under the shadow of a possible nuclear
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"An environment of peace and security is in the supreme
national interest for both sides and that resolution of all
outstanding issues is essential for this purpose," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Standing Committee Thursday night finally reached an
agreement to include the Lahore Declaration in its report after
long hours of discussions.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Council of Ministers' meeting was postponed Thursday
for four hours due to the disagreement between India and Pakistan
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan insisted that the declaration be included in the
report for its historic significance for the relationship between
the two countries, India was of the view that SAARC should only
cover issues of multilateral interests within the region.
</P>
<P>
The report, discussed at the standing committee's special
meeting from noon till late in the evening was to be submitted to
the SAARC Council of Ministers for approval.

<HEADLINE> US-DPRK Deal Worth Applauding, DPRK Spokesman Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The signing of an agreement
between the U.S. and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on
a suspected underground nuclear facility is worth applauding for
the United States, said a DPRK foreign ministry spokesman on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Korean Central News Agency,
the spokesman reiterated that Kumchang-ri underground facility was
established for military purposes, but has no nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
As the United States acknowledged Pyongyang's position on the
site, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided to allow U.
S. "visits" to the site at its invitation, instead of "inspections,
" he noted.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached agreement on the fees for the visits,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that if the United States raised any new
suspicions about its facilities, it would act immediately.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the deal will depend on whether the
United States can keep its promises, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord reached on Tuesday in New York, the DPRK
agreed to allow U.S. officials to visit the underground facility
at Kumchang-ri, about 90 kilometers north of Pyongyang, in May.
</P>
<P>
In return, the United States will help the DPRK to increase
potato yields.
</P>
<P>
But Washington has said any food donations are humanitarian aid,
not part of any deal.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Myanmar Gems Emporium Draws Large Crowds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's 36th annual gems
emporium being held here has successfully attracted hundreds of
gems merchants from nearly a dozen countries and regions to join
its 17.52-million-U.S.-dollar sale of gems, jade, pearls and
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
The state-sponsored gems emporium, which opened here Tuesday
and closes on Sunday, started Thursday its sale of jade under a
tender system or competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Sale of gems and pearls will follow at this weekend.
</P>
<P>
About 300 merchants of 177 companies from 11 countries and
regions as well as about 100 local merchants from 52 companies had
forwarded bidding forms two days before the sale commenced.
</P>
<P>
Of the merchants participating in the emporium, one-third are
from China, especially its Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region.
</P>
<P>
The majority of other merchants are from Thailand, Japan and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
About 3.37 million dollars' worth of gems, jade and pearls and
12.76 million dollars' worth of other items are on sale through
tender and competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, items worth 1.38 million dollars will be sold at
fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
Among the items for competitive bidding, the fixed price of the
biggest sapphire on show was lowered from 500,000 dollars at the
last annual emporium to 400,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
A ruby, which is valued at 200,000 dollars, is also put on
sale.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the emporium said there are more items on sale
this year than last year and the quality is also higher. The
emporium also draws new comers from the Netherlands and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
As in the previous events, private gems enterprises or
individuals are allowed to entrust their items for sale at the
emporium on condition that they pay a 10-percent service charge.
</P>
<P>
To promote the sale of gemstones, the government has been
giving awards of manufactured items to those merchants who have
been taking part in the emporium for consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, which is rich in gemstones such as ruby, sapphire and
jade, has been striving to create a systematic gem market in line
with its market-oriented economic system introduced in late 1988.
</P>
<P>
In early 1976, Myanmar formed the state-run Gems Enterprise
under the Ministry of Mines, which solely undertakes the country's
gems mining services including extraction, production and sale.
</P>
<P>
Beginning 1990, the government has been cooperating with local
private individuals and firms in gemstones mining and production
under a sharing system of 40-percent ownership for the state and
60 percent for the private entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
The share of ownership was later changed to 25 percent for the
state and 75 percent for the private entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
The country enacted the New Gemstone Law in September 1995,
with the aim to establish a domestic gem market with such a system
in which foreign gem trading can only be carried out through
national entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The law allows national entrepreneurs to mine, produce,
transport and sell finished gemstones and manufactured jewelry at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to promote gems sale, Myanmar has been sponsoring
annual gems emporiums in the capital since early 1964.
</P>
<P>
The country has earned a total of 265 million dollars from the
last 35 annual and seven mid-year emporiums.
</P>
<P>
In addition to permitting the local private sector to mine and
process gems in the country, the government has also set up joint
ventures with companies from Thailand, Malaysia and Israel to
carry out gems extraction and processing.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the output value of Myanmar's
mining sector, which includes gems and jade, rose by 1.5 percent
in the 1997-98 fiscal year and the production of gems and jade in
the fiscal year reached 24.7 million carats and 2.7 million
kilograms respectively.

<HEADLINE> More Japanese Opposed to Proposed Defense Bills, Poll Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- More Japanese are opposed to a set
of bills to implement the updated Japan-U.S. defense cooperation
guidelines, according to a poll conducted by a leading Japanese
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun, which released the survey Friday, said only
37 percent of respondents of its poll supported the government-
proposed bills, while 43 percent were against them.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that many Japanese think the draft bills
should be revised to sufficiently limit Japan's cooperation with
the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The Asahi Shimbun conducted the poll Sunday and Monday, with 3,
000 eligible voters randomly selected and interviewed across the
country. Of those polled, 73 percent responded.
</P>
<P>
Of the people who were opposed to the bills, 51 percent said
the bills would draw Japan into a conflict, while 16 percent
responded the bills violate the country's pacifist Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fifty-five percent said Japan should focus on
diplomatic efforts to prevent conflicts in Asia, while only 11
percent said Japan should strengthen security arrangements with
the United States to prevent such conflicts.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a special panel in Japan's House of
Representatives began discussing details of the package of three
defense bills, which would allow Self-Defense Forces (SDF) to
provide logistic support to the U.S. military in emergencies in
unspecified "areas surrounding Japan," under the new defense
guidelines updated by the two countries in 1997.

QINGDAO, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Qingdao, a major port city in
east China's Shandong Province, plans to allocate 8.9 billion yuan

</P>
<P>
Mayor Wang Jiarui said that figure will account for 1.58
percent of the city's gross domestic product (GDP) during the

</P>
<P>
Government regulations stipulate that environmental spending in
model environmental protection cities must reach a proportion
equivalent to at least 1.5 percent of their annual GDP.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the planned allocations will be used to curb
industrial, air and noise pollution, renovate sewage treatment
facilities and increase afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Some 130 factories currently discharging heavy pollutants will
undergo major improvements and additional 26 will be closed.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has placed priority on the development of new and high-
tech industries, including the biological engineering, electronic
information and household appliance sectors, over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
An improved environment will enable the city open further to
the outside world and achieve sustained, rapid and healthy
economic growth, according to the mayor.

are strictly adhered to, the vice-premier said, Macao will have a
brighter future with the joint efforts of all Macao compatriots,

3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"As the (Japanese Encephalitis) outbreak in Malaysia has
escalated, PPD is taking additional precautions to restrict the
import of pigs from Malaysia in order to protect the workers in
our abattoirs," it said.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin also said four men working in the abattoirs in
Singapore have been hospitalized over the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Of these four cases, one has been diagnosed to be pneumonia and
another bacterial meningitis while the causes of the other two
cases are still under investigation, the bulletin added.
</P>
<P>
"So far, evidence indicates that victims in the outbreak in
Malaysia had close contact with pigs. Thus the general public who
do not come into contact with live pigs are not in danger," the
bulletin affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"Pork in Singapore is safe for consumption as the disease is
not transmitted through eating pork," it added.
</P>
<P>
Local media have reported that more than 40 people have died
from the outbreak of Japanese Encephalitis in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Is to Implement Consumer Protection Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Government officials will have
unrestricted access to commercial firms and have the right to
request documents under the Consumer Protection and Trade Rules
Act which was passed on Thursday by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The new law will be enforced by the Committee on Trade and
Consumer Protection (CTCP) and its regional branches of the
Ministry of Trade and Tourism, as well as municipal departments.
</P>
<P>
The officials from the committee have the right to unlimited
access to commercial sites and are authorized to request documents,
take samples for laboratory examinations, and draw up citations.
</P>
<P>
Violation of such directives will result in fines of 2 million
leva, or 1,124 U.S. dollars. Civil servants that fail to enforce
the law will be fined the same amount.
</P>
<P>
Other sections of the new law say that retailers who sell
dangerous products will be fined 1 million to 15 million leva (562
- 8,429 dollars). Fines for misleading and unfair advertisements
were set at a maximum of 15 million leva (8,429 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Trade in unlicensed goods will risk fines of 2 million to 20
million (1,124 to 11,240 dollars). Fines from 500,000 to 3 million
leva ((280 to 1,685 dollars) will be imposed on traders whose
products do not list the required information, such as contents
and instructions for use and price, written in Bulgarian. The name
of the firm or owner and working hours must also be displayed in
Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
Penalties will be assessed by the Chairman of the CTCP or by
municipality mayors.
</P>
<P>
The law will go into force three months after its promulgation
in the State Gazette. Thus, it will replace the previous Prices
Act, the Profiteering Control Act and several texts in the
additional provisions of the Formation of Wholly State-Owned
Single-Member Commercial Partnerships Act.

SOFIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov and his visiting Czech counterpart Milos Zeman have urged
the international community to continue its pursuit to find a
peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference on Thursday, the two prime
ministers expressed their concerns over the current situation in
Kosovo and expressed the wish that the international community
continue to bear the responsibility for solving the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The party which has so far refused to sign the peaceful
agreement, should bear all responsibility for the consequences
that result from the failure to sign, said the two prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian representatives have signed the peace plan
brokered by the international mediators. The Yugoslav Serbs,
however, who are strongly opposed to allowing NATO troops into
Kosovo, believe the plan jeopardizes the integrity of the
country's territory and sovereignty, and have refused to sign the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo resumed their
talks in Paris on March 15 after their first round of negotiations
failed in Rambouillet near Paris between February 6-23.

<HEADLINE> Germany, Spain Hope for Quick Solution to EU Resignation Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Thursday jointly
voiced their hope for a quick solution to the crisis over Monday's
resignation of the entire European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with Schroeder, Aznar told reporters
that the mass resignation of the European Union's executive body
had brought about an "unfavorable situation". But he said he hoped
every commissioner would stay on till June.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said he fully agreed that the crisis should be resolved
quickly, but he believed the most pressing tasks for the EU were
the Agenda 2000 and the June election for a new European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said
he would try his utmost to end the crisis as soon as possible, but
he did not specify how.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who is on a tour of EU capitals, said that leaders
of the 15-nation bloc will discuss the issue at the Berlin summit
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders refused to disclose the names of candidates to
succeed the outgoing Commission President Jacques Santer, who
resigned together with his 19 fellow commissioners on Monday after
an independent report accused them of mismanagement and failure to
stamp out corruption and cronyism.
</P>
<P>
But they agreed that Santer's successor should have experience
in politics and executive administration, economic knowledge and
decision-making abilities.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the Middle East peace process
and the summit between the EU and Latin American countries
scheduled for the end of June.

<P>
SKOPJE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO troops are standing ready to
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia, NATO commander General
Wesley Clark said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Clark, who arrived in the Macedonian capital to visit 10,000
NATO servicemen stationed there, criticized Belgrade for breaking
its promise to NATO by continuing military activities and
deploying troops and heavy weapons in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Belgrade against reprisals against NATO troops
in Macedonia or against Macedonia itself.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a grave mistake for them to attempt to threaten
these forces here and try to also threaten this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Such a move would be intolerable to the international community,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade should be held responsible for the safety of some 1,
400 international verifiers who are now in Kosovo to monitor the
situation on the ground, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
Some 12,000 NATO troops are stationed in Macedonia in
preparation for a possible NATO-led peace mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But Belgrade has continued to reject the deployment of NATO

<HEADLINE> Consumers Urged to Be Careful in Using Decorative Panels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- China Consumers Association (CCA)
Thursday advised consumers to be more careful when buying
decorative panels, saying that substandard ones may constitute a
health risk, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Decorative panels are varnished or painted segment of wood
glued to the surface of the furniture and doors for better
decorative effect.
</P>
<P>
However, the result of a recent inspection shows that more than
70 percent of the 21 brands of decorative panels examined were
found to emit a larger amount of formaldehyde than that permitted

<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The International
Olympic Committee (IOC) released here on Thursday its Interim
Financial Report for the 27th Olympiad (1997-2000) during the IOC
108th session.
</P>
<P>
"We have always made our television and sponsorship contracts
and financial terms available to the general public," said IOC
President Juan Samaranch. "However, we recognize we need to be
more aggressive in releasing these reports to the public."
</P>
<P>
To further show transparency of its work, the IOC also made the
financial report available on its website, www.olympic.org.
</P>
<P>
The final report for this period will be issued at the end of
the Olympiad in late 2000, after the Summer Games in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The biannual report, an initiative that responds to the call
for additional transparency of the IOC, presents a comprehensive
financial overview to demonstrate the full extent of the IOC's
commitment to sport.
</P>
<P>
Like the annual IOC Finance Statements, the Interim Financial
Report is in line with international accounting standards. The
auditor's report, together with the detailed financial statements,
were submitted to the IOC's Executive Board and to the Session for
approval.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Petroleum Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The average price of Venezuelan
crudes rose this week to 10.70 U.S. dollars per barrel, an
increase of 79 cents over last week, Venezuelan Minister of Energy
and Mines Ali Rodriguez said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on national television, Rodriguez said that the rise
came about after the reaching of an agreement on production cuts
among oil producing countries on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Energy Ministry said last week that the cold
wave in the United States generated a bigger volume of purchases,
mainly of fuels for heating, which has also driven oil prices up.
</P>
<P>
It revealed that from April 1, Venezuela will reduce its
production by 125,000 barrels a day and will lower its daily
production to 2.72 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
So far this month, the average price of Venezuelan crudes has
recovered by 21 percent, or 2.28 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the price fell to 5.69 dollars per barrel, equal to a
reduction of 43.5 percent, or six billion dollars, in government
revenue.
</P>
<P>
The price in 1998 was 10.63 dollars per barrel, compared with
16.32 dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> First Auto Works Records Surging January Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The First Auto Works Group (FAWG),
China's leading automobile manufacturer, continued to enjoy upbeat
growth momentum in January, according to today's Economic Times.
</P>
<P>
The Changchun-based auto giant's output grew by a hefty 99.9
percent, with the January sales volume growing by 102.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's overall automobile output for the period jumped 29.95
percent, with the total sales volume growing by 42.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry observers attribute the surge, at least in part, to
external factors such as government financial and monetary
policies designed to stimulate domestic demand and efforts in
stifling smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
FAWG's introduction of internal reform also contributed to the
achievement. The group carried out a restructuring program to
downsize a number of its subsidiaries in order to improve
competitiveness and ensure their survival in the market.
</P>
<P>
First Auto Works also accelerated efforts to upgrade technology
and improve efficiency to ensure its survival in the highly
competitive auto market.
</P>
<P>
FAWG has led the nation in automobile production and sales for
six straight years.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 18 (Xinhua)-- Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano,
which is 80 kilometers from the capital, erupted Thursday and
belched ashes and flaming materials into the surrounding areas,
the National Center of Disaster Prevention announced today.
</P>
<P>
The center said the volcano, which is 5,452 meters high and
lies in Puebla city of Puebla State, erupted violently Thursday
morning and spewed molten materials, smoke and ashes for 90
seconds, while slight quakes persisted in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
Ramon Pena, director of Popocatepetl Operation Plan in Puebla
State, said that a "thick volcanic rain of ashes" was seen at 6 a.
m. Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said it was probable that ashes will continue to fall in
three communities in addition to Puebla city, due to the northeast
wind.
</P>
<P>
The National Center for Disaster Prevention advised people not
travel within seven kilometers of the crater while the volcanic
alert is still in effect, in the event more eruptions occur.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have advised civil protection authorities to
reinforce vigilance around Popocatepetl and attempt to keep people

<HEADLINE> Dozens Killed in Unrest in Three Indonesian Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Fresh violence has broken out in
the provinces of West Kalimantan, Riau and Aceh in Indonesia and
has claimed dozens of lives, national newspapers reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The papers quoted West Kalimantan Police chief Col. Chaerul
Rasjidi as saying 43 people had been killed in the Tebas and
Pemangkat districts in Sambas, West Kalimantan, after clashes
broke out on Tuesday between the indigenous Malays and migrants
from the island of Madura.
</P>
<P>
The rival ethnic groups were armed with knives and swords.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 migrant Madurese in Pemangkat district have fled
their villages to avoid more clashes, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Rasjidi Thursday said the situation in Pemangkat was under
control, and he urged the local population to mount a night watch
in their respective neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a number of Madurese and Malay locals were killed
in sporadic clashes in Sambas regency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one person was killed and at least 25 houses were
torched in Dalu-dalu village of Kampar regency, Riau, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Villagers started fleeing Dalu-dalu to the nearest town of
Pasir Pangairan.
</P>
<P>
The security personnel were investigating the cause of the
riots, Maj. S. Pandiangan from the local police's information
service said.
</P>
<P>
"However, according to initial reports the incident was caused
by conflicts between workers of a company in the district and
local people," Pandiangan said.
</P>
<P>
In Aceh, a crowd ran amok in response to distribution of bibles
in the local language by four Americans and one Singaporean in the
town of Peurelak on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners handed out bibles in the local Acehnese language
and cassettes. When the crowd realized what the things were, they
began chasing the four, who ran into the police station.
</P>
<P>
Aceh is a predominantly Muslim province.
</P>
<P>
"A crowd of hundreds stoned a police station where the
foreigners took refuge and burned a vehicle," the Indonesian
Observer quoted Lieut. Murtianto as saying.

<HEADLINE> North China's Hebei to Remove 223,000 Spindles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 19 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
will abolish 223,000 cotton spindles this year, according to
information from a recent provincial meeting on spindle reduction
and structural adjustment held in Shijiazhuang, the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry in China is at a critical moment in its
attempt to pull its debt-ridden state-owed enterprises out of
difficulty. By the end of the century, the government plans to
cut 10 million spindles and re-employ 1.2 million laid-off workers,
and expects to eliminate all deficits in the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Province is expected to reduce 830,000 spindles from 1998
through the year 2000. Last year, 596,000 spindles were removed,
and about 50,000 workers were laid off and diverted to other
services.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the state-owned textile industry in the province
saw an increase of 90 million yuan in economic efficiency in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While having worked out a wide range of policies to properly
place workers laid off from the textile sector, the province
decided to accelerate technical upgrading in the textile industry
and improve its enterprises' capacity to function independently,
so that the entire textile industry may escape its difficult
situation by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> IOC Establishes Commission to Evaluate Bidding Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 108th session
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed here on
Thursday to set up the IOC 2000 Commission made up of both IOC
members and leading personalities who understand sport.
</P>
<P>
The IOC 2000 Commission, approved unanimously at the session,
will consist of 20 to 24 people, half IOC members and the other
half from those outside the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibilities of the commission will be to study
and make recommendations on the host city selection process after
the 2006 bid city selection process, and the IOC membership
including how members are elected, term limits, structure and
number of members of the Executive Board and further roles for
Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also look at revenue sharing within the
Olympic Movement and how the Games themselves should evolve.
</P>
<P>
"This week, the IOC has taken quick, decisive and unanimous
action to put the activities of the past few months behind us,"
said IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch at the end of the two-
day meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have embraced the need to reform our operations including
the bid city process and better communicate our activities to the
public at large," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the second and final day of the 108th session, the IOC also
approved the formation of the IOC Ethics Commission and the 2006
bid city selection process reform proposal, and accepted the
Lausanne Declaration in Doping and Sports as an IOC anti-doping
policy.
</P>
<P>
The interim bid city selection proposal calls for the creation
of an election college comprised of: the IOC president, Joao
Havelange of Brazil, eight additional IOC members, the chairman of
the Evaluation Commission, a representative of the winter sports
international federations, a national Olympic committee
representative, and three athletes elected by the athletes at the
18th Olympic Winter Games in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Non-eligible participants include nationals of a country
involved in one of the candidate cities or members of the IOC
Executive Board, except the IOC president and the chairman of the
Evaluation Commission. Visits by IOC members to bid cities are
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The reform applies only to the 2006 bid city selection process
while the IOC awaits recommendations from the IOC 2000 Commission,
which was announced as part of the sweeping reform being made by
the IOC this week in Lansanne.
</P>
<P>
The six bid cities on the 2006 Winter Games include Helsinki of
Finland, Klagenfurt of Austria, Poprad-Tatry of Slovakia, Sion of
Switzerland, Turin of Italy and Zakopane of Poland.
</P>
<P>
All six candidates will make their presentations to IOC's 109th
session on June 18, 1999 in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The election and appointment of the members of the college will
take place on the morning of June 19 and that college will
deliberate and choose two finalist cities to be voted on by all of
the IOC members.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 19 (Xinhua) -- The China Coal Industry
Association (CCIA) was officially launched Thursday in Beijing,
China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
With the former China Coal Industrial Enterprise Management
Association as its core, the CCIA is a result of a merger with 11
other associations, aiming to cover all fields of the coal
industry.
</P>
<P>
CCIA is registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs and is
under the guidance of the State Coal Industry Bureau, said Wu
Rongkang, executive vice-chairman and secretary-general of the
association.
</P>
<P>
The association will play an increasingly important role in
promoting scientific management, rectifying market order and
expanding foreign cooperation and exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
CCIA will also give priority to drafting a series of industrial
regulations concerning quality, technology and management
standards to improve the management of the coal sector and to make
it conform with the market economy, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the central government's institutional restructuring
last year, the Ministry of Coal Industry was replaced by the State
Coal Industry Bureau, which is under the State Economic and Trade
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Council has transferred supervision rights
for 94 state key coal mines from the central government to
provinces since last August.
</P>
<P>
Local coal administrations are expected to be closed and their
administrative functions merged into comprehensive management
authorities, when the provincial-level institutional restructuring
will be launched in the second half this year.

<HEADLINE> UN Urged to End NATO Military Threats Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic Thursday called for a U.N. Security Council
emergency meeting to pressure the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) to end threats of military strikes against
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia over the current crisis in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the presidency of the Security Council, which
is currently held by Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun, Jovanovic
complained that NATO was massing more than 10,000 troops, as well
as equipment including tanks, armored vehicles and helicopters, in
neighboring Macedonia and ``issuing ultimatums on their readiness
for armed attacks.''
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders also made it clear that they planned to increase
NATO's military presence in Macedonia to some 30,000 troops. They
also say they will set up more military bases in other countries
neighboring Yugoslavia, Albania in particular, Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Such a massing of foreign troops and armaments and open threats
of NATO aggression on an independent sovereign state not only
worries the Yugoslav government and people but also poses a danger
to peace and security in the region, Jovanovic said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Security Council to hold an emergency meeting and
urged the withdrawal of NATO troops so as to ease the tense
situation in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Rodman to be Fined by Lakers for Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman will be fined by
his club the LA Lakers because of the length of time he has been
away.
</P>
<P>
The NBA rebounding king, on a paid leave from the Lakers for
unspecified personal reasons, has missed two games of a six-game
road trip over nine days. He was not at a morning practice in
Cleveland on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He first missed a practice last Saturday, and after meeting
with coach Kurt Rambis was granted the indefinite leave to handle
his personal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Rambis said on Thursday the fine "just a general practice of
the team, you're allowed certain leniencies with some things, but
you're still responsible for being with the team. I think the
difference lies in how long an absence is."
</P>
<P>
While the Lakers were losing in Scaramento Sunday, Rodman
reportedly was gambling in Las Vegas, but Rambis said the fine has
nothing to do with Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Rodman is being paid about 500,000 U.S. dollars for this season.
The Lakers won 10 straight games after Rodamn joined the team.
The 37-year-old forward reportedly had an elbow injury which
forced him on the bench in the second half of the last game he
played.

<HEADLINE> Italy, Russia Urge Ample Autonomy in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Russia have agreed that
the absolute priority in the Kosovo crisis is to achieve a
political agreement granting the Yugoslav province "ample autonomy
", Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing a cabinet meeting on his visit to Moscow this week,
Dini said Italy and Russia are committed to a political
negotiating process which will stave off international military
action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
His briefing coincided with a further stiffening of Yugoslav
resistance against signing the agreement proposed by the six-
nation Contact Group for the former Yugoslavia at the Rambouillet
peace conference near Paris last month.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo ample
autonomy. In return, the Albanian Kosovar militia would lay down
their arms and also waive a demand for a referendum on
independence at the end of a planned three-year transition period.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported by the Italian news agency ANSA that when
Dini was in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday, Russian leaders told him
that Russia would be prepared to contribute to an international
force for Kosovo if Yugoslavia invited it to do so.
</P>
<P>
Because of its traditionally close relations with Yugoslavia,
the Russian position remains a key factor in achieving a political
solution to the crisis, rather than ordering a NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
Dini's visit to Moscow was originally intended for a session of
the Italian-Russian economic cooperation council. He met with
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov, Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and other senior officials during his visit.

<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The net foreign debt of
Uruguay's public sector reached 2.548 billion U.S. dollars on
December 31, 1988, an increase of 132 million dollars, or 5.5
percent, over the previous year, the Uruguayan Central Bank
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase of liabilities in 1998 was mainly due to the
increase in the use of loans from international organizations for
development in the non-financial public sector, the central bank
said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the gross foreign debt of the country's
public sector increased to 6.116 billion dollars, while gross
foreign exchange reserves of the official banking system stood at
3.291 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Allows Young Boxers Turn Professional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives of
Thailand has passed a bill which allows boys 15 years of age or,
in some cases, younger to take up professional Thai boxing, local
newspaper Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the Professional Boxing Bill drafted by an
extraordinary House committee for the legislation primarily
designed to constitute rules of justice in the interest of boxers
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the first of its kind in the country,
professional boxers may be 15 years old or even younger. Boxers
under the age of 15 need written permission from their parents or
guardians before becoming a pro boxer.
</P>
<P>
The House approved the protective bill due to the fact that
Thai boxers have always been exploited and forced to throw bouts
by boxing organizers and camp managers.
</P>
<P>
Boxers judged by Muay Thai (Thai boxing) rules will be entitled
to take at least half of the rewards while boxers judged by
international rules will be entitled to no less than one-fourth of
the rewards.
</P>
<P>
Failing to give the boxer that much of the reward, the boxing
organizer or camp manager will be liable to a maximum of three
years in jail or a maximum of 60,000 baht (1,621 U.S. dollars) in
fines or both.
</P>
<P>
Throwing bouts are prohibited under the bill, or the boxer, the
boxing organizer and the camp manager will face a maximum of five
years in jail or 100,000 baht (2,702 dollars) fine or both.
</P>
<P>
The articles of the bill have triggered criticism from child
right activists, who fear that loopholes will be opened for child
abuse.
</P>
<P>
Some said that for a young boxer aged under 15, only permission
from a representative is not sufficient. What is more important
is safety measures to protect them from small and severe injuries.
</P>
<P>
Some others argued that the contents of the bill need to be
interpreted if they go against the Labor Protection Act which
prohibits a child under 18 from certain kinds of jobs which are
likely to damage their health.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria, Czech Republic Agree to Cooperate in Joining EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and the Czech Republic
Thursday agreed to cooperate in their efforts to join the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was contained in a joint declaration signed by
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov and Czech Prime Minister
Milos Zeman, who is on an official two-day visit to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The document says that the different pace of the EU enlargement
should not create new dividing lines.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria hails the admission of the Czech Republic to NATO and
the Czech Republic backs Bulgaria's bid to join the western
alliance, it says.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic will propose a broad membership program for
the active applicants like Bulgaria at the April NATO summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Zeman said that Bulgaria should be named as a serious candidate
at the NATO summit.
</P>
<P>
The government leaders and Foreign Ministry officials of the
two countries will hold meetings and consultations on an annual
basis.
</P>
<P>
The two countries believe that cooperation between them on
European issues is an expression of their common will to build up
a united Europe.
</P>
<P>
Their cooperation will focus on issues related to the Central
European Free Trade Agreement and the Central European Initiative.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the two sides also signed agreements on organized
crime control and promotion and mutual protection of investments.
</P>
<P>
Through strengthening measures against illegal migration and
organized crime, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic will make efforts
in avoiding the imposition of restrictions on citizens' travels
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to promote trade in the metallurgy, chemicals,
light and food industries, transport, construction and environment.
</P>
<P>
During his first visit to Bulgaria since 1989, Zeman also met
with Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova and National Assembly
Chairman Yordan Sokolov in turn.
</P>
<P>
Zeman described his talks with Bulgarian leaders as to the
point and business-like and voiced hope that the two sides will
further promote their contacts.

<HEADLINE> Manila Backtracks on Petrochem Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 19 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to pressure from
businessmen and legislators, the Philippine government is set to
defang recently formed Petrochemicals and Plastics Mobilization
Task Force (PPMTF) by clipping its powers to regulate imports.
</P>
<P>
Trade Secretary Jose T. Pardo was quoted by newspapers Friday
as saying the government erred in approving Administrative Order
(AO) No. 58, which formed the task force.
</P>
<P>
"There was a mistake. We have no choice but to recall the AO
and make the necessary refinements," Pardo said. The proposed
changes, however, would have to wait until President Joseph
Estrada, who is the only person authorized to revise the AO,
returns during the weekend from his U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
Pardo said the task force would not be authorized to withhold
any imports of petrochemical and plastic products which it
believes are being sold at dumping prices and either misdeclared
or undervalued.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force would be limited to monitoring and
formulating policy measures that would make the petrochemical
industry more competitive.
</P>
<P>
Pardo admitted that he was surprised when the AO surfaced last
March 12 in a public announcement, eight days after it was signed
by President Estrada and Executive Secretary Ranaldo Zamora.

Municipal Water Resources Bureau sources say that the work is
one of the major projects for 1999 approved by the municipal
government and will involve improving 26 sections of flood walls
measuring 2,655 meters in all by making them higher and stronger.
</P>
<P>
The project will be completed by April to make sure that there
is a safe flood season for the 3 million people living along the
river, the sources say.
</P>
<P>
The renovated wall will also help keep waste from going into
the river. The government is determined to have a cleaner river by
the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Dow Crosses 10,000 Mark For Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average Thursday crossed 10,000 mark for the second day
this week.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stock index shot to 10,001.51 at 3:51 p.m.
EST, and pulled back after reaching the high. The Dow closed up
118.21 at 9,997.62, less than 3 points away from 10,000.
</P>
<P>
The Dow cracked the 10,000 mark six times but pulled back
each time before the close of trading. The index broke the
five digit milestone, reaching the record intraday high of
10,001.78 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow's rise was driven by a positive report on inflation.
The U.S. Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose
only a 0.1 percent last month, signaling that inflation is under
control and the Federal Reserve has no reason to raise interest
rates to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 18.73 at 1,316.55 and the technology
heavy Nasdaq index was up 33.99 at 2,462.96.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Africa Agree to Improve Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The three-day U.S.-Africa
ministerial meeting ended here on Thursday with an agreement
between ministers from 46 African countries and U.S. government
calling for further strengthening of economic cooperation between
Africa and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a wide ranging blueprint, the officials from both sides also
pledged to cooperate more closely in areas ranging from education
to treatment and prevention of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Closing the conference, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman
said the 13-page document adopted by the participants provides "a
path for the future. The issue now is follow up and follow
through. I am confident we will do both."
</P>
<P>
He said the three days of meetings opened possibilities for "a
seamless web of cooperation -- not through paternalism but
fraternalism."
</P>
<P>
The document said long-term trends throughout Africa were
encouraging and mentioned economic reforms, progress in
consolidating democracy and creating more inclusive societies.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership is committed to bolstering these positive
developments and nurturing hope where turmoil has impeded their
growth," the Blueprint for the U.S.-Africa Partnership for the
21st Century said.
</P>
<P>
The African participants called for the rapid passage by U.S.
Congress of the African Growth and Opportunity Act as a symbol of
U.S. engagement with the continent and evidence of U.S. support
for African efforts to grow through increased openness to trade
and investment.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which would provide African nations with more access
to U.S. markets for their products, passed the House of
Representatives last year but was stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, in the
keynote speech at the closing session of the conference, said
African countries shared the Clinton Administration's concern
about delays in passing the bill and urged Congress to approve it.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the opening session on Tuesday in which he urged
"deeper and faster" debt relief for African nations, President
Bill Clinton also urged the Congress to pass the African bill.
</P>
<P>
U.S. exports including goods and services to all of Africa
total about 10 billion U.S. dollars a year, while imports are 13
billion dollars, made up mainly of oil, according to U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Generals Warn of Danger in Attacking Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Pentagon's top military
commanders on Thursday warned that NATO possible air strikes on
Yugoslav targets could bring casualties to the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Michael Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, told the
Senate Armed Services Committee in a hearing that foul weather
along with Yugoslavia's integrated force of radar and
Russian-made missiles would present major hurdles for U.S. and
allied pilots.
</P>
<P>
"Taking this on with air power will not be easy, There is a
distinct possibility that we will lose aircraft," he warned
senators.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that snowy winter weather would make it much
more difficult to attack targets in Yugoslavia, where some
pilots could be forced to fly low under clouds to see the
ground.
</P>
<P>
"It is going to be tremendously dangerous," Marine Corps
Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak agreed. "Serbian air defense
systems "are mobile. The terrain is very tough. And the weather
cannot be underestimated," Krulak added.
</P>
<P>
He said there were some "bottom-line question" that still
need to be answered: "What is the end game? How long will the
strike go on? Will our allies stay with us?"
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said at a briefing that Serb
military targets had already been selected for initial raids
that could be ordered by NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. and British cruise missiles were likely to be
part of any initial strike to lessen danger to pilots.
</P>
<P>
Bacon echoed generals' comment on Yugoslavia's sophisticated
air defense system, saying: "This is a robust,
highly-integrated, well-equipped air defense system."
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia had deployed dozens of SA-2, S-3 and
longer range Sa-6 air defense missiles along with shoulder-fired
missiles and over 2,000 anti-aircraft guns in Kosovo and
elsewhere in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Americans to Leave Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department on
Thursday issued a travel warning, advising American citizens to
leave Burundi because of regional extremist groups that might
cause danger to them.
</P>
<P>
The travel warning "recommends that all U.S. citizens in
Burundi leave the country because of the uncertain security
situation."
</P>
<P>
It noted that extremist groups operate throughout the Great
Lakes region of Africa and some have committed or threatened
violence against U.S. citizens and interests.
</P>
<P>
The warning specifically referred to the extremist group
operating out of the northeastern section of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo that "targeted and killed" the Americans
in southwestern Uganda at the Bwindi National Park.
</P>
<P>
The warning also noted that the U.S. embassy in Burundi
reduces its staff and restricts U.S. government personnel from
travelling outside Bujumbura, the capital, due to "unpredictable
incidents of violence throughout Burundi."

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Passes Missile Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives Thursday voted 317-105 to approve a bill
committing the United States to a nationwide defense against
ballistic missiles, one day after the Senate gave strong
bipartisan support to similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
The final vote came after the House turned back Democratic
attempts to make the legislation more like the Senate bill, which
has been endorsed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday' Senate bill, approved 97-3, commits the U.S. to
deploy a defense system as soon as "technologically possible", but
does not specify a time frame for doing so, the costs or the
specifics of the system.
</P>
<P>
The House turned to its version of the missile-defense bill --
long a top Republican policy initiative -- after hearing the
missile threat to the United States outlined in a rare closed-door
national security briefing by members of a commission that studied
the threat.
</P>
<P>
Although the measure had considerable support in both parties,
not all Democrats were ready to give the measure their backing.
Democratic Representative Dennis J. Kucinich said the bill
"threatens years of progress in nuclear arms reduction
agreements."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton has opposed legislation to commit the
military to deploying a national missile defense. He vetoed an
earlier version in 1995, and Senate Democrats had kept the measure
from coming to a floor vote since. But Democrats and the president
relented this time.
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued a statement applauding Wednesday's Senate vote.
"We are committed to meeting the growing danger that outlaw
nations will develop and deploy long-range missiles that could
deliver weapons of mass destruction against us," he said.
</P>
<P>
The House bill states that "It is the official policy of the
United States to deploy a national missile defense." It does note
specify which type of system or set a timetable.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the legislation have said it would violate terms of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which severely restricts
the kind of missile defense either the United States or Russia can
develop.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the U.S. legislation or deployment of a
national missile defense system will not only aggravate
international arms race, but also affect world peace and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Top Aides Brief Congress on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Thursday sent his top national security aides to brief Congress on
his plans for Kosovo as the Kosovo Albanians signed a U.S.-backed
peace accord while Yugoslavia refused to do so for the
encroachment of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Henry
Shelton and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger are now
briefing senators behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
Before addressing Congressional leaders on the situation in
Kosovo, Albright told reporters that NATO was ready to act against
Yugoslav forces if the last hope of peace would evaporate because
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic' refusal to sign the
peace accord, which involves sending NATO troops to enforce the
implementation of peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately the Serbian negotiators have gone backward. They
have refused to engage in discussion of civilian and military
implementation," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now there is no sign the Serbs will agree. So the
situation is as clear as it could be. The Albanians are saying yes
to the accords and the Serbs are saying no," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright told Milosevic that "NATO stands ready to take
whatever measures are necessary."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the crisis
on Kosovo had entered a "decisive phase" and military planning for
possible strikes against Serbian targets was complete. "The goal
will be to attack and degrade (the Serbs') ability to press the
Kosovar Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"NATO will act if President Milosevic and the Serbs, through
their intransigence at the talks or through further aggression,
resists finding some political settlement," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said mediators at the Kosovo peace talks in Paris
would be talking Thursday with negotiators from both sides "to try
to come to some conclusion whether there's any real purpose to
continue these talks."
</P>
<P>
"We will await their decision and that announcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said he knew of the new fixed deadline for Milosevic
to meet U.S. demands that Yugoslavia agree to the U.S.-backed
peace deal for Kosovo, but said if he did not, "NATO will act."
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said six U.S. warships armed with long-range
Tomahawk cruise missiles -- including two submarines -- were on
alert in the Mediterranean and Adriatic and that nearly 200 U.S.
attack and support jets were standing by for possible Kosovo
operations in a force of some 400 NATO aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Defense officials said additional U.S. F-15E attack jets could
also be quickly ordered closer to Kosovo from bases in Europe but
that no decision had been made to do so.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials said any initial attack against Serb
military targets was likely to involve dozens of U.S. naval cruise
missiles and that could be followed with bombing strikes if the
Serbs did not agree to sign the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Still Faces Financial Difficulties, Connor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
still facing financial difficulties despite the improvement in the
cash flow, and the United States is the largest debtor which owes
1.69 billion U.S. dollars for past and current assessments, a
senior U.N. official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, U.N. under-secretary-general for management,
told a press conference, "The U.N. is so strapped for cash that in
order to cover its regular budget expenses, it has been
periodically forced to borrow from peacekeeping funds."
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the Organization is unable to reimburse promptly
those countries that provide peacekeeping troops and equipment. At
the end of 1998, the U.N. owed 73 countries a total of 872 million
U.S. dollars for troops and equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis, which has long haunted the world body,
originated from the U.S. reluctance to pay its back dues.
</P>
<P>
"The largest debtor, the United States, owes the United Nations
1.69 billion U.S. dollars for past and current assessments,
two-thirds of the total due," he said. "The debt includes 620
million U.S. dollars for the regular budget and 1.07 billion U.S.
dollars for peacekeeping and international tribunals."
</P>
<P>
"We have no capital, we have no reserves, we borrow form some
Member States to make up for the income we do not get from other
Member States," Connor said.
</P>
<P>
"The improved cash position is most importantly due to
increased payments by the United States in 1998," he said. "This
good news for 1998 could become bad news in 1999 if the extent and
pattern of United States payments reverts to that of 1997 and
earlier years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many Member States, including some of its Western allies, have
frequently lashed out at Washington for its reluctance to pay its
back dues, repeatedly urging the United States to fulfill its
obligations under the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
However, because there have been fewer peacekeeping operations
in recent years, there is less and less cash in the peacekeeping
account to cover the regular budget deficit. Peacekeeping
assessments have fallen from 3 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 to 907
million U.S. dollars in 1998, and are projected to drop to 650
million U.S. dollars in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cash in the peacekeeping account fell to 768 million U.S.
dollars by the end of 1998, the lowest in five years, and is
expected to decline by another 30 million U.S. dollars this year,
leaving a shrinking financial cushion for the world body, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Connor told a meeting of the Administrative and
Budgetary Committee, also known as the Fifth Committee of the
General Assembly, that for the first time in four years, the
Organization was borrowing less from peacekeeping funds to cover
regular budget activities, and cash balances were higher.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the level of unpaid regular budget assessments was
decreasing substantially, Connor said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, unpaid regular budget assessments had been 564 million
U.S. dollars while at the end of 1998, they came to 417 million
U.S. dollars and the deficit in the regular budget cash was down.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, more Member States are paying their
regular budget assessments in full each year -- 117 countries out
of 185 had paid up at the end of 1998, compared with 75 nations in
1994, although only 32 paid their current bill on time by 31
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 19 of the U.N. Charter, if at the beginning of
the year a country owes the same or more than its total gross
assessments for the previous two years, it automatically loses its
right to vote in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"The United States paid just enough by the end of 1998 to avoid
this scenario," he said. "The amount the U.S. will have to pay by
the end of 1999 to retain its voting privileges will be calculated
in November."

<HEADLINE> IOC to Establish 2000 Commission to Evaluate 2006 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The 108th session
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) agreed here Thursday
to set up the IOC 2000 Commission made up of both IOC members and
leading personalities who understand sport.
</P>
<P>
The IOC 2000 Commission, approved unanimously at the session,
will consist of 20 to 24 people, half IOC members and the other
half from those outside the IOC.
</P>
<P>
The primary responsibilities of the commission will be to study
and make recommendations on the host city selection process after
the 2006 bid city selection process, and the IOC membership
including how members are elected, term limits, structure and
number of members of the Executive Board and further roles for
Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also look at revenue sharing within the
Olympic Movement and how the Games themselves should evolve.
</P>
<P>
"This week, the IOC has taken quick, decisive and unanimous
action to put the activities of the past few months behind us,"
said IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch at the end of the
two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have embraced the need to reform our operations including
the bid city process and better communicate our activities to the
public at large," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the second and final day of the 108th session, the IOC also
approved the formation of the IOC Ethics Commission and the 2006
bid city selection process reform proposal, and accepted the
Lausanne Declaration in Doping and Sports as an IOC anti-doping
policy.
</P>
<P>
The interim bid city selection proposal calls for the creation
of an election college comprised of: the IOC president, IOC Doyen
Jean Marie Faustin Godefroid Havelange of Brazil, eight additional
IOC members, the chairman of the Evaluation Commission, a
representative of the Winter sports international federations, a
national olympic committee representative, and three athletes
elected by the athletes at the 18th Olympic Winter Games in
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Non-eligible participants include nationals of a country
involved in one of the candidate cities or members of the IOC
Executive Board, except the IOC president and the chairman of the
Evaluation Commission. Visits by IOC members to bid cities are
strictly prohibited.
</P>
<P>
The reform applies only to the 2006 bid city selection process
while the IOC awaits recommendations from the IOC 2000 Commission,
which was announced as part of the sweeping reform being made by
the IOC this week in Lansanne.
</P>
<P>
The six bid cities on the 2006 Winter Games include Helsinki of
Finland, Klagenfurt of Austria, Poprad-Tatry of Slovakia, Sion of
Switzerland, Turin of Italy, and Zakopane of Poland.
</P>
<P>
All six candidates will make their presentations to the 109th
session on June 18, 1999, in Seoul, Korea.
</P>
<P>
The election and appointment of the members of the college will
take place on the morning of June 19 and that college will
deliberate and choose two finalist cities to be voted on by the
full IOC. The announcement of the host city of the 20th Olympic
Winter Games in 2006 will be June 19.

<HEADLINE> New Rioting Flares Up in N.Irish Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- New violence erupted in the
Northern Irish town of Portadown Thursday night with several
vehicles being torched.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Independent Television News reported the violence
flared just hours after the funeral in the nearby town of Lurgan
of a Catholic human rights lawyer killed by Protestant guerrillas.
This was the second night of clashes in the town.
</P>
<P>
A bus was among the vehicles set ablaze by rioters, the
television said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, thousands of mourners lined the streets of
Lurgan for solicitor Rosemary Nelson's funeral.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Catholics and Protestants clashed by throwing

when they tried to break up the rioting. A Catholic leader and 38
police officers were injured.

<HEADLINE> Persons Suspected of Financing Terrorism Should Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Persons suspected of
financing terrorism should be extradited and punished if the
international community really wanted to make a contribution
towards ending their activities, a Cuban representative said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Rodriguez Parrilia, the Cuban representative, said that
his country has been the victim of various acts of terrorism
which had caused significant material and other damage.
</P>
<P>
There are different forms of terrorism, some of which were
pursued while others were ignored, he said, adding that the
Government of Cuba was determined to negotiate and reach agreement
with all governments on the definition of international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee of
the General Assembly. Since the beginning of its third session on
Monday, the committee, established by the General Assembly on
December 17, 1996, has been giving a first reading to the text of
a draft international convention for the suppression of the
financing of terrorism, sponsored by France.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban representative said his delegation hoped that the
instrument being drafted by the Ad Hoc Committee would eventually
lead to a method of punishing those who made available to
mercenaries the means to perpetrate actions directed at hurting
the economy of U.N. Member States.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: NATO Completes Planning for Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The White House said Thursday
that the crisis on Kosovo had entered "a decisive phase" and
military planning for possible strikes against Serbian targets was
complete.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic faced a choice between peace and
"further bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
"President Milosevic knows what he needs to do, and it's time
for him to make his decision," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The warning came when Kosovo Albanians signed a U.S.-backed
peace accord on Kosovo Thursday while the Yugoslav delegation so
far rejected the deal as they believe the so-called peace accord
would let foreign troops enter their sovereign territory of
Kosovo, obviously a violation of the international laws.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said mediators at the Kosovo peace talks in Paris
would be talking Thursday with negotiators from both sides "to try
to come to some conclusion whether there's any real purpose to
continue these talks."
</P>
<P>
"We will await their decision and that announcement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said he knew of no fixed deadline for Milosevic to
meet U.S. demands that Yugoslavia agree to the U.S.-backed peace
deal for Kosovo, but said if he did not, "NATO will act."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Court Dismisses Bid to Stop Probe of Starr </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal appeals court
cleared the way Thursday for the Justice Department to investigate
the official conduct of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
The special three-judge dismissed a challenge by Landmark Legal
Foundation, a conservative group that sought an order to block the
Justice Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
The court, which names independent counsels, said it had
limited jurisdiction and could not go beyond the powers set out in
the Ethics In Government Act or review the attorney general's
actions involving an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
The judges also said that Landmark could not legally sustain
its case because the organization has not "suffered a concrete and
actual or imminent injury" by the Justice Department's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"We find nothing in Landmark's motion that could even remotely
be considered an injury to itself," the court said.
</P>
<P>
Both the Justice Department and Starr's office opposed
Landmark's request, arguing that the court was without authority
to act on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The department is investigating allegations of irregularities
by Starr's office, including the initial handling of information
on the Monica Lewinsky matter; Starr's request to the department
for jurisdiction to investigate Lewinsky's relationship with
President Bill Clinton; and his conduct during the investigation,
including the initial meetings between the counsel's office and
Lewinsky in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
Starr has denied any impropriety in his office's dealings with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Starr's investigation of Clinton's affair with Lewinsky led to
impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice against
the president. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate on February 12
this year.

<HEADLINE> Abubakar Appeals for Relief of Nigeria's Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar Thursday appealed for relief of the country's
30-billion-U.S. dollar foreign debt to enable the incoming
civilian administration to meet its electoral promise.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here with Michel Camdessus, visiting managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Abubakar
pledged to continue to work toward satisfying the quarterly
benchmarks agreed under a staff- monitored economic program signed
in January with IMF.
</P>
<P>
The program was aimed at providing the framework for resumed
relations between Nigeria and IMF which was suspended during the
regime of late Head of State Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
"If the on-going staff-monitored program's performance is
satisfactory, we will be ready to give financial assistance for
some development projects, " Camdessus said in response.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here Wednesday for a three-day visit , he said
that his organization is aware of the enormous economic problems
confronting Nigeria, assuring that the IMF is ready to assist the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner held Wednesday in honor of Camdessus, Nigerian
Chief of General Staff Vice-Admiral Okhai Akhigbe told the
visiting IMF chief that Nigeria would not withdraw from its plans
to privatize its parastatals.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe, chairman of the national council on privatization,
noted that privatization becomes a firm option for his government.
</P>
<P>
Proceeds of the 96 organizations being privatized under the
second phase of privatization program would be spent on the
rehabilitation of the country's crumbling infrastructure and
poverty alleviation programs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is scheduled to meet Nigerian president-elect
Olusegun Obasanjo Friday in Abuja, when the latter would cut short
his world-wide tour.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise, Jobless Rates Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices rose just 0.1
percent in February despite a bigger increase in meat, oranges and
airline fares, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive monthly rise of that tiny
magnitude in the Consumer Price Index, the department said. And it
left the seasonally adjusted inflation rate for the first two
months of the year at just 1.1 percent, compared with a 12-year
low of 1.6 percent for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report confirms anecdotal evidence, released Wednesday in
the Federal Reserve's survey of regional economic conditions,
showing "prices of most goods remained little changed" so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this means the Fed's monetary policy-makers
probably will feel comfortable leaving short-term interest rates
unchanged when they meet next on March 30.
</P>
<P>
After the figures were released, yields on long-term government
bonds fell to 5.48 percent from 5.50 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said energy costs last month were unchanged, with
declines of 1.4 percent for fuel oil and 0.5 percent for gasoline
offsetting increases of 0.6 percent for electricity and 0.1
percent for natural gas.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, food prices surged only 0.1 percent after a
substantial 0.5 percent increase in January. Fruit costs were up
0.6 percent with oranges jumping 5.3 percent on top of a 24.1
percent gain in January. Largely due to a December freeze in
California's Central Valley, oranges were 48 percent more
expensive than a year earlier. Beef rose 1.3 percent, the most in
six years, and pork, 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices excluding the volatile food and energy components edged
up 0.1 percent in February. Airline fares jumped 2.4 percent,
hospital services rose 0.5 percent and textbook and school
supplies, 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, clothing and cars, which were heavily influenced by
competition from imports, fell 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent
respectively. Computer prices declined 2.8 percent and were 34.6
percent lower than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Also, tobacco costs declined 1.4 percent but were still 33.5
percent higher than a year earlier, reflecting tobacco companies'
efforts to recoup the cost of multimillion-dollar liability
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the strong economic growth has also sent U.S.
unemployment to its lowest level in three decades despite the fact
that manufacturing has eliminated 337,000 jobs over the past year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report Thursday, the Labor Department said the
exceptionally good labor conditions are continuing with the number
of first-time applications for unemployment benefits holding under
300,000 for the seventh consecutive week, the longest such streak
since 1974. Claims last week were 298,000, up 6,000 from the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Exports Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's exports increased
significantly in January as imports made a sharp decline, leaving
the country's trade balance to make a jump from 1.6 billion
Canadian dollars(1 billion U.S. dollars) in December to 2.7
billion Canadian dollars (1.8 billion U.S. dollars) a month later.
</P>
<P>
The trade balance in January stood at its highest level since
February 1997, Statistics Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency said although most sectors showed gains, the
increase was chiefly in the machinery and equipment sector, where
exports were mainly driven by major aircraft contracts to the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The recent weakness in imports continued in January. After
reaching a record high of nearly 27 billion Canadian dollars(18
billion U.S. dollars) in October, imports were relatively stable
in November and December before dropping 2.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
All sectors fell except automotive products and special
transactions trade, with the sharpest drops in imports of
machinery and equipment, and industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
Statistics Canada said a robust American economy, Canada's low
interest rates and the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years were
behind the strong export numbers.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Feature: Let Human Beings Remain Humane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ORAHOVAC, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Outside on
the village street blew gusts of chilly wind with no one around;
inside a farm house was a brownish chihuahua wagging his furry
tail at some visitors while a tiger parrot was pruning its
yellowish feather inside the cage.
</P>
<P>
It was the residence of the village priest who for weeks has
finally exposed his inner feelings about what has been happening
in and around the village located in western Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The village is called Velika Hoca, where two Serbian brothers
went missing, and it was finally found one had been killed and the
other seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
Village priest Milenko Dragicevic Protojerej fetched from an
ancient-looking wooden case a list of 33 missing Serbians recorded
from the village and its surrounding area in the past eight
months. None ever showed up again, according to the priest, who
was soon joined by three of his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said that they had to go to sleep with firearms
at hand and one of them went up to tap on the inside shield of the
window of the house.
</P>
<P>
It was pure iron to serve as a bullet-proof shield to fend off
sniper shots at night from the hills outside the village, from
where terrorists would often come to harass the Serbian villagers.
</P>
<P>
Velika Hoca is a small village with some 350 households in the
Orahovac municipality and is surrounded by villages of Albanian
residents.
</P>
<P>
The Serbians and Albanians used to be friendly neighbors but
when disputes to the right to live in Kosovo broke out in the
Yugoslav province, things went from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
First they started to dislike each other; then they started to
hate each other, and before long they started to harass each
other.
</P>
<P>
When brothers Dobrivoje and Novica Savelic went to cut
fuel-wood in the woods the village ancestors bought in 1288 as
recorded by the village church registration book, they disappeared
only to leave their axes where they supposed to have worked on
February 27.
</P>
<P>
When the brothers were finally returned by terrorists after
three days via the mediation of the Kosovo Verification Mission of
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Dobrivoje
was dead and Novica was injured by torture.
</P>
<P>
The villagers feel more anxiety than anguish in that they are
outnumbered and surrounded by the Albanians in the region which
has made itself a name through the production of quality red wine.
</P>
<P>
When asked why the Velika Hoca villagers would not move to
places where there are more of their compatriots, the priest said
that it is their native land and their ancestors started to live
here since the eighth century and the 14 churches surrounding the
village were built from the 12th to 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
From the same old church registration book, of which the papers
had long turned flimsy and crispy, the priest carefully turned a
couple of pages and pointed to a villager who was born in 1856 in
the village and then showed the guests a religious painting made
in 1545 by the villagers.
</P>
<P>
"See, even the painting is older than the United States," said
the priest and his words drew timid laughter inside the cosy house
which was heated by maze-like chimneys immediately under its clay
floor.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old priest said that the Serbs have lived in Velika
Hoca for so long that they have even stuffed a village museum with
exhibits of ancient pots, scales, lamps, thread twisting machines
and villager costumes for women and children.
</P>
<P>
"We Serbs take Velika Hoca as the heart of Kosovo and take
Kosovo as the heart of Serbia," said the priest who later added
that the villagers will never leave their native land for
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
"With a firm belief in God, we are brave enough to stay," said
Priest Milenko Dragicevic Protojerej, "and we sincerely hope that
truth will win through in the end so that all neighbors can live
peacefully like long before."
</P>
<P>
When seeing off the guests, the priest had to stop his eager
pet dog from going outside to shun unexpected happenings while
quoting Patrijarh Pavle, the first Christian priest in Serbia, to
the visitors from afar by saying: "Let human beings remain humane
and hope for a better tomorrow."

<HEADLINE> Romanian Central Bank Governor Confident of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The main target of Romania's
Central Bank is to have the Romanian currency regain credibility,
by containing the depreciation trend and achieving a reversal of
the trend, the bank's Governor Mugur Isarescu stressed on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Invited to the Senate to give explanations regarding the
Romanian national currency's situation, Isarescu said that the
strong depreciation of the national currency leu was due to the
tensions mainly triggered off by factors of a psychological
nature, but it also mirrored the state of Romania's economy.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu avoided forecasting the leu' ratings, saying that it
would be better that people not take any chances against the
background of the tensions generated by the yawning gap between
the sale and purchase prices traded on the hard currency market.
</P>
<P>
The Governor stressed he had reasons to believe that this
pressure put on the Romanian national currency had mostly a
psychological element, and it was to be appeased, as in his
opinion, "We were to witness leu's appreciation trend in a few
days".
</P>
<P>
Isarescu also said that at present he had in view the
restructuring of the monetary policy so that the interest rates
may drop by mid-April, which would relieve the state budget of
paying expenditures entailed by the credits disbursement.
</P>
<P>
Leu depreciated severely this week. On Tuesday the rate broke
through the 14,000 lei to the U.S. dollar. On Wednesday it was of
14,900 lei per dollar and on Thursday one dollar reached 15,115
lei.
</P>
<P>
The leu's weakening by about 6 percent in one day only and by
26 percent since the beginning of the year can be considered to
sound the alarm again concerning the state of the Romanian
economy, says the Romanian press.
</P>
<P>
The effects of the successive depreciation of the Romanian leu
currency against the foreign currencies will be the rise in all
prices and some rises in taxes.
