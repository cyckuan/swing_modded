<P>
HANOI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,900 people were
killed and 21,700 others injured in traffic accidents throughout
Vietnam in 1996, according to the General Department of Police.
</P>
<P>
There were about 20,000 traffic accidents nationwide in 1996,
up 22 percent over 1995.

speeding. Some of the accidents resulted from poor quality of
vehicles, sidewalks re-occupation and traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
Though governments at all levels have been urged to restore
traffic order, road safety remains a public concern.
</P>
<P>
The number of cars and motorbikes grew 17 percent in 1996 over

<HEADLINE> 460,000 Rwandan Refugees Return From Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half a million
refugees have returned to rwanda from tanzania before a tanzanian
deadline of Tuesday for all 540,000 to leave, a report from
Kigali quoted a UNHCR official as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Stromberg, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said more than 21,500 refugees crossed from
northwestern Tanzania into Rwanda on Friday, most of them on
trucks.
</P>
<P>
``This takes the total in December to about 460,000. Today we
expect them to continue with the last big group of refugees from
the Karagwe camps crossing either today or on Sunday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Troops and police stopped hundreds of thousands of refugees
from fleeing deeper into Tanzania. U.N. officials said they had
reports some refugees were treated roughly to force them home.
</P>
<P>
The December 31 deadline set by the Tanzanian government for
all 540,000 Rwandan refugees to leave followed the return of an
estimated 600,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees from eastern Zaire after
they were forced out of their camps in October and November.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu refugees in Tanzania and Zaire fled from Rwanda in
1994 after some took part in the genocide of about 500,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Large numbers of refugees in eastern Zaire fled deeper into
the country rather than return to Rwanda. The number might amount
to 270,000, a U.N. official said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Keep Inflation Low in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam vowed today to keep its
inflation rate in single digit in 1997, after it dropped to a
10-year low of 4.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
At its year-end conference today, the government set a ceiling
of 7-8 percent for inflation control in 1997 and worked on ways to
fulfil the target.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai praised the government's
efforts to stabilize market prices in 1996, which contributed to
the country's socio-economic growth.
</P>
<P>
But he warned against excessive deflation, reminding of the
sharp decline in rice and sugar production in early 1996, caused
by excessively low prices.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has seen a dramatic drop in inflation since it began
moving towards a market-oriented economy in the late 1980s, when
the country suffered hyperinflation of more than 100
percent. Inflation fell to 14.4 percent in 1994 and 12.7 percent
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Days Lost in UK to Strikes Highest Since 1990 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain is heading for
its most strike-hit year since the end of the 1980s after a
series of industrial actions in the Summer, according to
British officials.
</P>
<P>
The Government officials expect the final count of days
lost through strikes this year to be about 1.25 million,
some three times higher than the total number lost in 1995,
when the figure was 415,000 days.
</P>
<P>
The figures, due to be published in the New Year, will
confirm that Britain's strike record for 1996 will be the
worst since 1990, when a long-running dispute in the
engineering industry over shorter working hours pushed the
overall number of working days lost through strikes up to
1.9 million.
</P>
<P>
While the increase in strike activity does not
necessarily imply any long-term return of union militancy
or strikes, the sharp rise in Britain's strike record shows
that though dormant, union activity and poor industrial
relations are far from dead, said industrial relation experts.
</P>
<P>
Strikes this year in the Post Office, on the London
Underground, in the fire service and in a range of regional
rail companies have prompted Ian Lange, President of the
Board of Trade, to issue a consultative green paper aimed at
outlawing such strikes where they have a "disproportionate"
effect.
</P>
<P>
The total days lost for 1996 will push the average for
the 1990s up to some 1.5 million. Yet this still compares
well with previous decades, the experts believe.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Britain lost on average annually some 3.3
million working days through strikes, rising to 4.9 million
in the 1960s and peaking at 20.2 million in the 1970s,
affected heavily by the two miners' strikes of 1972 and
1974, and the winter of discontent of 1978-1979.
</P>
<P>
Strikes then fell back in the 1980s to an annual average
of 8.1 million working days lost.

<HEADLINE> France Urges Yugoslavia to Avoid Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- France today urged the Yugoslav
authorities "with the most pressing way" to "see to the avoiding
of all confrontation" with the opposition.
</P>
<P>
France made the appeal as thousands of Serbian opposition
supporters held a funeral this afternoon in Belgrade for a
39-year-old opposition member who died in clashes with government
supporters on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Serbian
government should recognize "without delay" the victory of the
opposition coalition in elections held last month in the 14
Serbian cities designated by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Only this can "lead to a peaceful and democratic solution (to
the conflict), for which we have not ceased to appeal for almost
five weeks," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The French ambassador in Belgrade had a meeting with Yugoslav
Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic today to convey the message to
the Yugoslav government, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The confrontation this week has made one victim already and
wounded about 100 others. The renewal of such incidents would make
up a dangerous escalation for which no one can know a way out,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that the "fracture between the
authorities of the country and its population risks to become
definitive if the former does not rapidly make the gestures of
appeasement and a necessary opening."
</P>
<P>
This would lead to stability in the whole country of
Yugoslavia, as well as help it reintegrate into the international
community, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
France also has proposed to its European Union partners to
contact Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic and Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to discuss how to find a peaceful way out of
the present crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official: Egypt Not to Guarantee Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said today that Egypt will not guarantee the implementation of
Israeli troop pullback from most parts of the West Bank town of
Hebron, when a deal is sealed within "three to four days."
</P>
<P>
Member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization Executive
Committee Mahmoud Abbas told reporters that the Palestinians and
Israelis have agreed on "basic issues" in their efforts to
complete their Marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
"The signing (of the deal) will be within three or four days"
when security concerns are cleared, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides Friday are negotiating on certain details
pertaining to "the outstanding issues related to the security."
</P>
<P>
The PLO official said the Palestinian side has called for
forming a joint patrol to be stationed at the Ibrahim Mosque,
sacred to Moslems and Jews alike. But Israel is strongly opposed
to any Palestinian presence.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli redeployment should
have been completed by last March. The pullback was later delayed
by the former Labor government due to a series of suicide bombings
in Israel
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has insisted on
better security for the 450 Jews living amid 200,000 Arabs in
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In case of signing the deal, he said, the Egyptians are not a
neutral party to give guarantees for its implementation. Egypt's
presence at the signing ceremony will be discussed later, he added.
</P>
<P>
"They are an Arab-Palestinian party. However, the Americans
could do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel in
1979, has been a pillar in the Middle East peace process and a
strong supporter of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured that Egypt is "fully aware of the tiny
details of the negotiations and the agreements" between the
Palestinian and Israeli sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is U.S. guarantees or protocol letter on mutual
commitments, he said, adding that such protocol means that
Washington will send each party a letter, he clarified.
</P>
<P>
On timetables for implementing the pullback, he stressed the
timetables are an integral part of the agreement itself.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official, who arrived here Friday night, made
the remarks at a press conference following meeting with Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa today.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Moussa on the outcome of the recent
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the summit meeting between
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Arafat To Visit Egypt for Consultation with Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
is due here Sunday on a one-day visit to Egypt to consult
President Hosni Mubarak when a deal on Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank city of Hebron is just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al-Qodra told Egypt's
MENA news agency today that Arafat will brief Mubarak on the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the Hebron
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The visit falls within the framework of continuous consultations
between the two leaders, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat hailed Egypt's pioneering role in the
region and in serving the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been a strong supporter f the Palestinian cause and a pillar in
the peace process initiated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat said the Hebron deal could be signed
within days.
</P>
<P>
The deal on Hebron would be the first major progress in the peace
process since the new Israeli government took office in June and
could open the door for peace talks with Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli pullback from 80
percent of Hebron should have completed by March 28. But Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu insisted on better security for
the 400 Jews living amid 200,000 Palestinians in the city.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a senior Palestinian official said
here today that the deal could be expected "within three to four
days" if security concerns are cleared.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas, member of the Palestinian Liberation
Organization Executive Committee, told a press conference that
Egypt is not in a neutral position to give guarantee for
implementing the deal.
</P>
<P>
"They are an Arab-Palestinian party. However, the Americans
could do that," said the PLO official, better known as Abu Mazen.

<HEADLINE> Hebron University Reopens After 10-Month Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Hebron University reopened
today after being shut by Israel for a span of 10 months.
</P>
<P>
Only a few hundred of the 1,700 registered students came
to class this morning while the overwhelming majority was
unaware of the reopening.
</P>
<P>
Students milled around in the campus to express their
delight in the resumption of their studies.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli military authorities closed the university after
four suicide bombings in late February and early March,
contending that in so doing they could prevent the militant
Islamic group, or Hamas, from using the campus as its
stronghold. Several other universities in the West Bank were also
closed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, students at the university have protested
outside its gates and held classes in the street.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman said that the decision on the
reopening of the university was made after the university
officials signed a pledge promising to maintain law and order
in the university.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nabil Abu Zneid, spokesman of the university, said that
the opening of the university was a good step in the peace
process. But he refuted Israeli perception of Hebron University
as an Islamic hotbed, noting that not a single one of the
university students had been arrested in connection with the
suicide bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
Two of the bombers were from the Fawwar Refugee Camp,
south of Hebron, and had nothing to do with the university.
</P>
<P>
The university will come under the rule of the Palestinian
Authority after Israel's pullback from the city under an
agreement, which appears to be just around the corner. The
Israeli army will thus not be able to close the university
again.

<HEADLINE> Striking Workers Try to Stop S.A. Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Striking workers
belonging to a medical service company in South Africa have begun
to destroy property in various hospitals, informed sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The striking people at Lifecare, which runs several hospitals
in the country, have vandalized property in hospitals they belong
to and threatened others who have not joined them, the sources
who asked not to be identified, said.
</P>
<P>
The strikers, who stopped working 11 days ago, have been
demanding better payment from Lifecare leaders.
</P>
<P>
Some of strikers packed stones in front of hospitals to
prevent vehicles entering, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni said earlier he rejected the way
that some strikers disturbed hospital operations by destroying
property, interfering with patients and threatening non-strikers.
</P>
<P>
"Such behaviora is totally against both the letter and the
spirit of the new Labor Relations Law, Mboweni said.
</P>
<P>
"The right to strike and picket should be accompanied by
responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted Lifecare Managing Director Louis Moolman as
saying on Friday that the medical service company had decided to
take the strike issue to the Commission for Conciliation,
Mediation and Arbitration.

BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng paid a
working visit to Russia on December 26-28. During the 43-hour
trip, Li held an important meeting with President Boris Yeltsin
and fruitful talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The
two sides signed important agreements on energy, finance and
military technology.

toward the implementation of the policy statement issued by the
two presidents and marked the official start of a regular meeting
mechanism between the heads of government of the two
countries. His visit also made preparations for Jiang's state
visit to Russia next April.
</P>
<P>
The visit, whose agenda was packed virtually for one working
day, was brief indeed. However, it scored fruitful achievements
and had a great significance. It attracted the close attention of
international media as well as the press circles of both China and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
It is bitingly cold in Moscow in late December, but Li and his
entourage felt the warmth of the Russian leaders and people
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
Li was the first visiting foreign leader that President Yeltsin
has met after his recovery from a heart surgery. The two leaders
talked for one hour, doubling the time length scheduled beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the meeting centered on the guidelines governing
the bilateral relations and key international issues. The two
leaders have achieved a broad consensus.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yeltsin said he was looking forward to Jiang's
visit and stressed repeatedly that the two nations should pass on
friendship from generation to generation. He expressed support for
and placed hopes on cooperation in various fields between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The president reiterated that his country will stick to its
"One China" policy and promised to complete the demarcation work
at the eastern section of the Russian-Chinese border as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that Jiang's visit to Russia next spring will be
of great importance to the further development of the bilateral
relations, and his visit was a preparation for President Jiang's
state visit.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that the development of a strategic partnership
with Russia is by no means an expedient, but a long-term policy of
China.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders have not only reached a strategic consensus on
bilateral relations, but also conducted in-depth discussions over
important international issues, such as the formation of a
multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that both China and Russia are two important poles
of the world and that cooperation between the two sides is
conducive to world peace and development and to the formation of a
multi-polar world.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the two premiers, conducted in a warm,
pragmatic and positive atmosphere, were substantial and fruitful.
In order to ensure the smooth operation of the regular meeting
mechanism between the two heads of government, Li and Chernomyrdin
agreed to set up a preparatory commission to be co-chaired by the
two countries' deputy heads of government.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers worked out specific measures to increase
bilateral trade and examined the possibility of cooperation in
large-scale projects in the fields of energy, machine building,
aviation, transport, agriculture and military technology. They
also held fruitful discussions over the cooperation in Su-27
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers also presided over the signing of agreements
on nuclear power plant and banking cooperation.

<HEADLINE> More Companies to Be Listed on Overseas Securities Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China has announced a
preliminary selection of another 38 companies whose shares will be
listed on overseas securities markets, the Securities Committee of
the State Council has announced.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth time that the committee has approved the
listing of Chinese companies on securities markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
Prior to approval this time, the committee had selected 38
companies in three groups for overseas listing. Up to now, 26 of
them have been listed on overseas securities markets, with 24
listed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The newly selected 38 companies do not include the 12 companies
from earlier selections awaiting listings.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the listed companies have raised a total
of 4.9 billion US dollars over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the committee said overseas listings are
successful, helping large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
to raise more overseas funds, and improve their operation
mechanisms, promoting the standardization and development of China's
securities markets, and helping maintain the status of Hong Kong
as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The fourth batch of primarily selected companies are better
representative geographically and in terms of trades and reflect
China's overall economic expansion and potentials for future
growth.
</P>
<P>
They include enterprises in coastal areas in southeastern
China, traditional industrial businesses in northeastern China, as
well as fledging companies in the central and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The companies cover a wide-range of fields including electric
power, energy, transportation, metallurgy, non-ferrous metals,
building materials, chemicals, machinery, electronics, medicine,
and domestic appliances.
</P>
<P>
The Securities Committee will make good preparations for their
overseas listing, officials at the committee said.
</P>
<P>
Further improvement and development of the securities market is
a basic principle during China's Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000),
and an important policy for the raising of overseas funds through
securities markets, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas listing helps standardize China's securities markets,
and Chinese companies can also have a better understanding of
international securities markets, while having their shares listed
both on domestic and overseas markets, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
With their exemplary role, more Chinese enterprises with
outstanding operations will go to international financial markets,
sources with the committee said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Folk Songs Drawing Chinese Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Old popular Russian folk songs
have found many Chinese fans, who are keenly appreciative of the
beautiful melodies.
</P>
<P>
A Russian song concert held in Beijing today has attracted
hundreds of Chinese music lovers to enjoy listening and even
joining in the singing. The event was held to mark the first
anniversary of a Russian music program launched by Beijing Music
Radio, the most popular radio station in the Chinese capital area.
</P>
<P>
The audience appreciated opuses played by a five-person band
from Russia's Yakutsk City, and enthusiastically applauded the
band's successful performances.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very surprised and excited to see so many Chinese
people loving our music," said vocalist Aleksei.
</P>
<P>
An amateur chorus entirely composed of Chinese people also
performed Russian folk songs, and former Soviet Union songs, which
were very popular in China in the 1950s and 60s.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Music Radio airs Russian music programs three times
a week, and has had a growing audience.
</P>
<P>
Cassette tapes and CDs about Russian music and songs are also
listed among best sellers in record shops. Most buyers are
middle-aged and olderly people, who experienced the period when
China and former Soviet Union had special ties of friendship and
mutual assistance in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
"Those songs remind me of the past, and I very much like the
inspiring melodies of the songs," said a middle-aged Chinese man
who once worked in the former Soviet Union for a decade.

<P>
SHANGHAI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branch of the
Communications Bank of China is to start a new service which will
enable individual clients to trade in foreign currencies by
telephone from January.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jiasheng, director of the bank, announced the move on
Saturday, saying it means that its clients just need to call the
bank, no matter where they are, if they want to buy or sell foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
No Chinese banks have offered such a banking service
before. And it will just take no more than a minute for a client
to finish a transaction.
</P>
<P>
Nine major foreign currencies can be traded by telephone,
including US dollars, Japanese yan, Hong Kong dollars, British
sterling, Deutsche mark, French franc, Swedish franc, Canadian
dollars, and Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
But customers can only deal in cash, and the minimum trading
volume is 300 US dollars.

The bank started to provide individual foreign exchange trading
services three years ago, and has bought and sold a total of 300
million US dollars.

The PA leader arrived here earlier today on a brief visit to
Egypt to consult Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "To overcome the difficulties, Egypt is
exerting efforts and the U.S. is giving a push."
</P>
<P>
Describing the present situation as "quite sensitive and
critical," Arafat said it is necessary to come to Egypt to
exchange views with Mubarak on the present situation.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties, he said, involve issues of hot pursuit of
suspects inside the West Bank city of Hebron, arms allowed to the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Other troubled issues are the setting of a buffer zone to
separate the Jewish settlers and the Palestinian residents, and
the resumption of negotiations over pending matters, mainly
Israeli troops redeployment and final phase negotiations.

NEW DELHI -- Five persons were burnt to death and 20 others

Unofficial sources have, however, put the death figure at

SEOUL -- The South Korean government today welcomed the
statement of regret made by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) for the submarine incident in September this year.
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate that the DPRK's "apology," although belated,
promises efforts to prevent recurrence of a similar incident, said
Kang Ho-yang, spokesman of the National Unification Board (NUB),
in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
Kang said that Seoul hopes that Pyongyang will fully implement
its promise and thus contribute to the confidence building and to
easing tension on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said that the DPRK's
"apology" does have its shortcomings, but fulfills Seoul's basic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang's "apology statement is short and has indirect
expressions, not answering fully to the damage and pain caused to
South Korean people," Yoo told reporters, "but it has the three
key points of demand -- acknowledgement, apology, and promise to
prevent recurrence."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's statement of regret was announced in Korean through
Radio Pyongyang and in English through the Central News Agency of
the DPRK in the name of Foreign Ministry spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
"The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK
is authorized to express deep regret for the submarine incident in
the coastal waters of Kangnung, South Korea, in September 1996
that caused the tragic loss of human lives," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK will make efforts to ensure that such an incident
will not recur and will work with others for durable peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula," it added.

<HEADLINE> 1996: Reform Year for China's Education (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Another reform action taken in 1996 was China's reform of the
teaching contents and curriculum arrangement in its higher
education this year, and for the rest of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) period.
</P>
<P>
The reform was actually launched last year by the SEC. Chinese
educationalists came to aware what was being taught in colleges
was out of step with the growth of the market economy, and the
development of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Textbooks used by Chinese college students today were compiled
in 1950s and 1960s, and do not include the most significant
developments in science and technology in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The reform plan attracted some 20,000 professors and scholars
across the country, who applied to participate in research work
for the reform.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has organized a group of experts to work cautiously in
coordination with the reform. It has also allocated a large sum of
money for the task.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand educational experts, under the SEC guidance,
are compiling 300 to 500 new textbooks for Chinese college
students, the number of whom is expected to reach 9.5 million in
2010.
</P>
<P>
It means that by the end of the century, 80 percent to 90
percent of all textbooks on basic subjects will be replaced or
thrown out.
</P>
<P>
While this reform is being carried out, the SEC announced in
November a reform on the teaching contents and curriculum
arrangements in high school education.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has worked out the first curriculum plan on an
experimental basis for senior middle school education, since new
China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The new plan offers high school students in China, for the
first time, with choices of courses they themselves select. It
also shows flexibility in allowing different schools to keep their
own unique characteristics in education.
</P>
<P>
High schools majoring in preparatory education for colleges, or
preparatory education for jobs or special schools, are allowed to
differ from each other, under a pre-condition of meeting a unified
basic level raised by the new plan.
</P>
<P>
China practises a unified education system throughout the
country. A primary school student living in its northwestern part
is reading the same stories in literary textbooks as another
student of the same grade living in its southeastern area. It is
the same with high school students, no matter where they go to
school.
</P>
<P>
The same textbook makes it possible to give a unified
examination at city or provincial levels. A unified entrance
examination for college is offered nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The new plan on high school curriculum arrangements was cited
as a major step that the country took to change the mode of its
personnel training. It was said to be conducive to turning China's
test-oriented education to a more quality-focused system of
schooling.
</P>
<P>
A New syllabus and textbooks will be promoted throughout the
country in the year 2000. Tianjin, north China's Shanxi and east
China's Jiangxi provinces will take the lead by adopting the new
textbooks in the fall of next year.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Launches Air Raids on Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban alliance
has launched three air raids on the Taliban-controlled Kabul since
Saturday night, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the anti-Taliban warplanes dropped a 500
kg and two 250 kg bombs near the Kabul International Airport,
causing minor structural damage.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no casualties or damage to the Taliban
aircraft and the airport was operational today.
</P>
<P>
The second raid targeted the Presidential Palace in central
Kabul and two bombs were dropped.
</P>
<P>
The third attack came near the Khair Khana Pass, a key point on
the supply route to the frontlines north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The results of the latter two air raids have not been disclosed
yet.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia unleashed a major offensive on the
anti-Taliban alliance north of Kabul Friday, capturing several
strategic points and inflicting heavy casualties on the rival
forces.
</P>
<P>
The alliance including the Uzbek militia led by Rashid Dostum,
the ousted government troops loyal to Ahmad Shah Masood and
Hezb-i-Wahdat (Khalili group) had ever declared to beef up defense
line near Kabul to harass the Taliban in Winter.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Taliban troops were said to be preparing for an
offensive against Charikar, the capital city of Parwan province
which is about 65 kilometers north of Kabul.

<HEADLINE> 1996: Reform Year for China's Education (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reform of higher education is the most striking among all
others. The system of running schools, management, investment,
tuition fee charging, and job assignment, have all come under
reform.
</P>
<P>
Since China started to charge college tuition fees in 1994, 661
colleges and universities have introduced the pay-to-learn scheme
arrangement. Nearly two thirds of all of China's colleges and
universities have now began to charge tuition fees. The reform
pace is faster than it was scheduled earlier this year when the
SEC had expected 500 colleges and universities to join in.
</P>
<P>
College education in China used to be covered for by the
government, which then assigned jobs to students when they
graduated. The reform means students getting a greater say in
choosing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
The goal is for most colleges and universities to enroll
students according to the new system by 1997. All students will
have to pay for their college education, and find jobs under the
guidance of the government by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
With more institutions of higher learning becoming co-managed
by the ministries or departments of the central government and
local governments, the old system is fading away under which all
colleges and universities solely relied on a state budget.
</P>
<P>
A new framework is being formed during the reform process,
under which the mainstream of China's colleges and universities
will be state-run higher-education institutions, supplemented by
non-state-run colleges and universities. Colleges and universities
are jointly managed by the central government and provincial
governments, with the latter playing the main role.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, 58 colleges and universities have been run jointly
by central and local governments. Co-management not only makes
better use of educational resources, and perfects educational
structures, but eases fund shortage faced by colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
By transferring part of the management of higher education
institutions from ministries to local governments, colleges and
universities have become positively involved more in local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Provisional statistics show that local governments have
invested more than 600 million yuan (about 72.3 million
U.S. dollars) in such co-management. Co-managed schools, in turn,
have trained more professionals for local development.
</P>
<P>
China now has 1,035 institutions of higher learning. About one
third of them are under the direct jurisdiction of various
ministries. The trend is to let them gradually be co-managed by
local governments.
</P>
<P>
A national working conference on sending scholars abroad at
state expense opened last Wednesday, and decided to continue the
reform on selecting 1,500 scholars for study overseas.
</P>
<P>
The reform, launched in April, gives more opportunities to
individuals by encouraging them to apply to the study
program. Experts from across China are given a bigger say in who
should go overseas for study, and to which country the student
should be sent.
</P>
<P>
Those who win in the competition must sign a contract, and pay
an amount of earnest money to the China Scholarship Council, who
cover expenses abroad and international travel tickets. The money,
along with accrued interest, is to be returned when the students
return in China as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The new method was approved "a success" in northeast China's
Jilin and east China's Jiangsu provinces, and then introduced
nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Iran To Back Domestic Industry, Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Parliament today voted
to approve a bill that would create institutional backing for
the domestic industries and firms as well as labor.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the bill would also
maximize the presence of Iranian firms while weakening the
chances of foreign firms in the economic opportunities in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which is called Maximization of the Utilization of
the Country's Executive, Productive and Industrial Potentials,
requires Iran's Central Bank to extend letter of credit through
commercial banks to Iranian companies to joint ventures
including Iranian and non-Iranian firms.
</P>
<P>
According to Article III of the bill, the relevant executive
manager can hire foreign companies only when the Iranian
companies can not answer the needs in consultation and after it
receives the permission from Iran's influential Economic
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Iranian companies that enter partnership for such projects
with foreign companies must own 51 percent of the shares in the
joint operation, according to the bill.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms are also required to buy or lease the equipment
or use the services that they need for their operation from the
Iranian companies.
</P>
<P>
The bill also requires Iran's social welfare organizations to
insure all Iranian workers before they are sent outside of Iran
for employment to such countries as Japan where thousands of
Iranian migrant laborers reside.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Interior Ministry today announced a one-week
deadline to Iranian government organizations and business firms
to replace their foreign employees with Iranian nationals or
obtain valid employment permission from the Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Interior Ministry said that there are
presently some 1 million foreign nationals working in Iran in
various industrial, agricultural and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many of them came to Iran and work without
valid visas or employment permits.
</P>
<P>
The report said that those who ignore the deadline would face
legal charges, including cash fines or the closure of their
companies.

<HEADLINE> Reform Year for China's Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1996 will be
remembered as the year of reform for education in China. The word
"reform" became one of the most popular words in the country in
1996, particularly in education.
</P>
<P>
A ranking official in the State Education Commission (SEC)
said China's educational course has achieved "significant success"
in 1996, the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
which maps out guidelines for the country's comprehensive
development during 1996-2000.
</P>
<P>
From primary schools to universities and colleges across China,
reforms have been carried out without exception. Primary school
pupils, carrying heavier schoolbags, have finally won the sympathy
of adults.
</P>
<P>
Education committees of Shanghai, and some other big and
medium-sized cities, began to relieve students from the
overburdened school work. Some asked schools to hold fewer exams,
even to cancel entrance examinations for junior middle school.
</P>
<P>
For the Chinese students who aspire to go to college, there are
three essential exams that they can never ignore: the entrance
exams to junior and senior middle schools, and the most important
-- the entrance examination to college.
</P>
<P>
The giving up of the first entrance examination was considered
an effective measure taken to take place the traditional
examination-oriented school education with quality education.
</P>
<P>
The best gift that students in northeast China's Benxi city
receive at the turn of 1996 and 1997 might be that they will no
longer have any more mid-term exams. A decision by the city's
education committee asked schools to give up mid-term exams, as
well as evaluating students' study by marks.
</P>
<P>
The 100- out-of-100 mark has been dreamed about by millions of
Chinese students tens of thousands of times in various tests and
exams. The top 100-mark shows that a student excels in study.
</P>
<P>
The decision made by Benxi city also required school teachers
not to arrange name orders for students according to their
performance in the exams. School principals are also urged not to
appraise teachers' working capabilities according to the marks
their students received in examinations.
</P>
<P>
The decision sounds less great than it really is. It challenges
a tradition lasting for several thousand years in China. A
doggerel being popular among Chinese students describes giving
exams as "the Sutras" of the teachers, and marks as the very apple
of the students' eyes.
</P>
<P>
The Benxi City Education Committee received some 50 phone calls
from students' parents soon after the decision was made
public. Most welcomed, though some oppose the measures. It takes
time to sooth these worried parents that quality is far more
important than just marks, commented a media report.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Market Liberalization to Draw Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A liberalized market has helped
Jordan in attracting a growing foreign investment, a survey
published on today's newspapers showed.
</P>
<P>
The EU-financed survey, which covered 90 potential investors,
said there is a trend that more and more foreign investors,
especially Europeans, have selected Jordan as a good place for
their investment in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It said Jordan's liberalization of the internal market has
played an essential role in the increasing trend.
</P>
<P>
The growth of gross national product (GNP), and diversification
in the geographic coverage of the firms, have provided
opportunity to foreign investors, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted recently by Jordan's Investment
Promotion Corporation (IPC), GMA Capital Markets Ltd, and was
financed by the Overseas Development Administration of the United
Kingdom, and the European Commission, the executive arm of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now the biggest investor in Jordan, followed by the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The positive investment trend would serve to boost the volume
of the investment in Jordan which is still little so far due to
the limited size of the market, said to a Jordan Times analysis.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Talks With Israel Face Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority (PA)
leader Yasser Arafat said here today that Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations are facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The PA leader arrived here this morning on a brief visit to
Egypt to consult Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the talks
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that "To overcome the difficulties, Egypt is
exerting efforts and the U.S. is giving a push."
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has
been a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and a pillar in
the Mideast peace process initiated in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Describing the present situation as "quite sensitive and
critical," Arafat said it is necessary to come to Egypt to
exchange views with Mubarak on the present situation.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties, he said, involve issues of hot pursuit of
suspects inside the West Bank city of Hebron, arms allowed to the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
Other troubled issues are the setting of a buffer zone to
separate the Jewish settlers and the Palestinian residents, and
the resumption of negotiations over pending matters, mainly
Israeli troops redeployment and final phase negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader will brief Mubarak on the latest
developments of the negotiations with the Israeli side prior to
his meeting with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai this
evening, said Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Redina, who accompanies
him on the trip, before departure from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also scheduled to meet Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu Monday to clear their remaining differences,
according to the latest news reaching here from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from both sides will resume talks this evening on
the long-overdue deal on the partial Israeli troop pullout from
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A deal on Hebron will be the first major progress in the peace
process since the new Israeli government took office in June and
will open the door for peace talks on Lebanese-Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli withdrawal from 80
percent of Hebron should have been completed last March. Netanyahu
insisted on better security for some 450 Jews living among 120,000
Palestinians in the city.

<HEADLINE> China to Lay 24,000 KM Fiber Optical Lines Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build another
24,000 kilometers of optical fiber cables in 1997, according to an
official at China International Telecommunication Construction
Corporation (CITCC).
</P>
<P>
China now has a 100,000 km-long optical fiber telecommunication
cable network which is playing an increasingly bigger role in the
country's economic development and national defence, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
CITCC is the country's major infrastructural builder in the
post and telecommunications industry, with an annual capacity of
setting up 20,000 km-long fiber optical trunks, 10,000 km-long
microwave lines, five million-line telephone facilities and 50
satellite telecommunication ground stations.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the company has made hard efforts to explore
both domestic and international markets. The firm has set up ties
with over 60 overseas companies from over 30 foreign countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 engineers have been sent by the company to work in
foreign telecommunication projects in over a dozen
countries.

<HEADLINE> Agro-science Plays a Decisive Role in Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The progress of agricultural
science has been proved a decisive role in achieving a record
grain harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
The areas sown with hybrid rice and hybrid maize has expanded
by two million hectares this year, said Cui Shi'an, a ranking
official at the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The technique of covering maize fields with framed plastic sheets,
which can turn poor and infertile lane into near-miraculous growth
areas, has been used on two million hectares of land in various
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Sparsely-planting and seedling-spraying methods, which can
raise the per-ha yield by 600 kg and 1,125 kg respectively, have
beed applied on 10 million ha of land.
</P>
<P>
Raising grain output by spreading agro-science has a great
potential, costing less investment, and yielding quick returns,
Cui said.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the acreage sown to grain crops is unlikely
to sprawl by a big margin in 1997, adding that the weather is an
unpredictable factor. Hence, a sure-guaranteed way of maintaining
a sustained grain harvest is to spread modern agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of agro-science attributed to China's agricultural
development climbed to 39 percent this year, five percent higher
over the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
This was an unprecedented but welcome trend, said Hong Fuzeng,
vice minister of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Popularization of advanced agronomy has helped raise the per-ha
yield of maize from 4,350 kg in 1994 to present 5,250 kg, that of
paddy fields from 5,700 kg to 6,000 kg, and wheat from 3,150 kg to
3,750 kg.
</P>
<P>
The country's multiple cropping area rose by 3.5 percent in the
past two years, equivalent to the building of 3.3 million ha of
cultivated land.
</P>
<P>
Hong attributed the extensive-use of agronomy to farmers'
enthusiasm in learning and applying modern techniques, and the
increase in the numbers of agro-technicians over recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he predicted that the part to be played by
agro-science in agricultural development is sure to become bigger
next year.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Bank Sees Notable Growth in Deposits and Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC) has witnessed a remarkable growth in both deposits and loans
this year, thanks to its efforts to step up commercialization and
improve its service.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, the bank had recorded 877.28 billion
yuan in deposits, and 762.99 billion yuan in loans, increases of
20 percent and 14 percent respectively as compared with the end of
last year, according to ABC sources.
</P>
<P>
One of the four major state-owned commercial banks, ABC has
reinforced its assistance to money-tight state-owned enterprises
this year as huge loans have been granted these firms by ABC local
branches.
</P>
<P>
This year, the bank has enhanced its contacts with overseas
banking institutions to learn about advanced technology and
methods in financial management and operations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has started to support fledgling border
trades with neighboring countries by signing mutual clearance
agreements to promote businesses.
</P>
<P>
The recent coming into use of the bank's computerized clearance
network is seen as a big step forward by the bank in moving to
further improve its functions, and to compete with large domestic
and overseas banking institutions.

<HEADLINE> Job Prospects in UK at Seven-Year High for l997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Job prospects going into l997
are at a seven-year high in Britain, according to the latest
Sunday Times/Manpower quarterly Work Watch survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 2,155 employers, looking forward to the next
three months, shows that 21 percent forecast an increase in job
levels, against l5 percent who expect a decrease.
</P>
<P>
It suggests the recovery is broadly based and gathering
strength. The balance, of +6 percent, compares with +3 percent a
year ago, is the most optimistic first-quarter reading since l990.
</P>
<P>
It follows official figures earlier this month showing a drop
of nearly 96,000 in Britain's unemployment total in November,
taking it below 2 million for the first time in more than five
years.
</P>
<P>
The Work Watch survey shows that manufacturing, surprisingly,
is the most optimistic sector of the economy, with a balance of
+l5 percent of firms expecting to increase employment.
</P>
<P>
For services, a balance of 4 percent of employers expect to
recruit extra staff, but this ranges from a very positive picture
for tele-communications (+33 percent) and private health (+l7
percent), to negative readings for retailing (-10 percent) and
energy and water (-ll percent).
</P>
<P>
The public sector is still contracting, with a net 7 percent of
employers expecting to cut jobs. But the building industry,
hardest hit by the recession, expects to increase employment, by a
net 3 percent for public building and l2 percent in the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Lilian Bennett, chairman of Manpower, said: "Apart from
increased optimism over job prospects, there are also signs of a
recovery in overall confidence and investment, particularly in
training."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is entering
the year 1997 with prospects of a healthy growing economy as
economists described the first half of 1996/97 fiscal year as
"doing very well", the newspaper, "Sunday Observer" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
In separate interviews with the newspaper at the weekend,
senior officials of the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) and the Planning
Commission said the economic targets set for 1996/97 are within
reach.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation has come down to 16 percent and our target is 15
percent by June 1997," said Joseph Masawe, Manager of the
Economic Research and Policy Deparment of the BOT.
</P>
<P>
Money supply control is one of the key factors that has helped
lower the inflation, Masawe said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Planning Commission, who preferred
anonymity, said average revenue collections had increased from
about 20 billiion Tanzania Shillings (about 34 million U.S.
Dollars) to 40 billion Shillings (about 66.7 million U.S.
Dollars) per month druing the first half of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
He said recurrent revenue should meet recurrent expenditure
and in October a surplus was recorded in the revenue collection
and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate has risen from 3 pecent in 1994 to about 5
percent this month. Exports of both traditional and
non-traditional crops were expected to rise to 723 million
U.S.Dollars for the year of 1996-97 from 682.9 million during
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade improved as imports decreased from
1,540.5 million U.S. Dollars in 1995 to 1,005.5 miilion in
September this year though it is still negative.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the agicultural sector, which contributes 55
percent of the GDP growth, the Planning Commission official
said food availability in the country is encouraging due to
good crop harvests in 1995/96 season.

<HEADLINE> 28 Foreign Hostages Taken by Nigerian Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The 28 foreign hostages taken
by port workers in Eket in Akwa Ibom state were released unharmed
on Friday, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the hostages were collected by the Nigerian navy
from the oil tanker on board of which they have been held since
December 23. They were first taken to Eket and later transferred
to Calabar in the neighbouring Cross River State.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were unharmed, but some of them were very weak
and could not even stand up by themselves, as they have been
refused food for the last one or two days, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether the Nigerian navy stormed the vessel
anchored on the sea 50 kilometers off the Eket Port, but Hermes
Dorado, the Filipino Charge d'Affairs in Nigeria, was quoted
saying that no agreement was reached with the hostage takers
after days of negotiations, which is to continue on the land.
</P>
<P>
The 28 hostages were taken on December 23, when their vessel
was loading near an oil platform off the Eket Port and was taken
by 60 Nigerian workers on a service barge.
</P>
<P>
They include 10 Filipinos, nine French, five Indians, two
Britons, one Belgians and one Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian workers were said to be employees of a French oil
company identified as Etpm. They allegedly demanded an end of the
year bonus similar to that received by foreign oil workers, which
is about 6,000 U.S.Dollars. But their demands were rejected by
their employer as "unrealistic", said a report.
</P>
<P>
But another report said the workers took the hostage after the
termination of their employment. They demanded a ransom of 50,000
Naira for each of the hostage.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Welcomes DPRK's Regret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
today welcomed the statement of regret made by the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) for the submarine incident in
September this year.
</P>
<P>
It is fortunate that the DPRK's "apology," although belated,
promises efforts to prevent recurrence of a similar incident, said
Kang Ho-yang, spokesman of the National Unification Board (NUB),
in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
Kang said that Seoul hopes that Pyongyang will fully implement
its promise and thus contribute to the confidence building and to
easing tension on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said that the DPRK's
"apology" does have its shortcomings, but fulfills Seoul's basic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang's "apology statement is short and has indirect
expressions, not answering fully to the damage and pain caused to
South Korean people," Yoo told reporters, "but it has the three
key points of demand -- acknowledgement, apology, and promise to
prevent recurrence."
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's statement of regret was announced in Korean through
Radio Pyongyang and in English through the Central News Agency of
the DPRK in the name of Foreign Ministry spokesman today.
</P>
<P>
"The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK
is authorized to express deep regret for the submarine incident in
the coastal waters of Kangnung, South Korea, in September 1996
that caused the tragic loss of human lives," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The DPRK will make efforts to ensure that such an incident
will not recur and will work with others for durable peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula," it added.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang's regret statement came after series of negotiations
with the United States who argued that Pyongyang could not expect
its light-water reactor project to continue or to improve
relations with Washington without an apology acceptable to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
South Korea said that a total of 26 armed DPRK people
"infiltrated into" the country's Kangwon Province from a grounded
submarine in the East Sea (Sea of Japan) on September 18.
</P>
<P>
Of the 26 DPRK people, one is still at large, while 13 were
shot dead by South Korean troops, 11 were found killed by their
colleagues and one was captured alive in a massive manhunt in the
rugged mountains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a total of 14 South Koreans were killed by the DPRK
people, including nine military personnel, two policemen and three
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK had claimed that the submarine, while on a training
mission, drifted after having an engine trouble and hitting a rock
in the sea.
</P>
<P>
However, Seoul said that the case of the intrusion was not an
"inadvertent incident that occurred during routine training" as
Pyongyang said, but was a "carefully premediated act of
provocation."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Underscores Expanding of Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Vice-Minister
of Health Lamisso Hayiso has stressed the need to expand the
family planning services nationwide so that all sections of the
society and especially the rural masses can benefit.
</P>
<P>
According to ''Ethiopian Herald'' today, Hayiso made the
remarks while opening the 9th annual conference of the National
Council of the Family Guidance Association of Ethiopia here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister said that ''a marked departure'' should be
made from previous practices where family planning services were
limited to a few clinics and health centers in urban areas,
future courses of action should focus on bringing these services
within reach of the majority of people in the hinterland, and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He called on the members and staff of the association to work
with more vigour and enthusiasm to create ways of expanding and
improving the provision of family planning services.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the association Teka Feyera said the
association has allocated a budget of 1.76 million dollars for
its activities during 1997. The association's major undertakings
during 1997 will include the provision of counseling services to
105,000 people throughout the country and of skill upgrading
training to nurses, midwives and other health workers, Teka
added.
</P>
<P>
The 30 year old association runs 9 family planning clinics, 30
outreach programs and more than 200 centers that give family
planning services.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian government's target to double per
head income in 15 years, the population growth will be reduced
from the current three percent to nearer two percent a year.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Combined Force in Search of Bandits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan combined force of
army and police was dispatched to Suguta Valley to launch a major
security operation in search of armed cattle rustlers who shot
down an army helicopter on Thursday, the Sunday Nation reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi on Saturday instructed
security agencies in the country to act swiftly and establish the
cause of the helicopter crash which resulted in the death of
the Samburu District commissioner and two army officers.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Air Force sources as saying that the security
personnel are using 10 helicopters to comb the Suguta Valley
which is reputed to be a den of cattle rustlers.
</P>
<P>
Police sources told the paper that Kenyan army is using light
tanks to seal off the east bank of the valley while the police
unit the west bank to prevent the bandits from escaping.
</P>
<P>
The rustlers are trapped in the valley as it has remained
sealed off since Friday when about 300 soldiers of Kenyan Army
and Air Force have mounted a crackdown on the bandits.
</P>
<P>
However, the valley, in which the temperature is so high that
it has proved inaccessible in previous security operations, means
flush of bandits.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the helicopter was shot down with rocket
by bandits when it was pursuing some 600 rustlers who on
Christmas Day stole more than 15,000 head of cattle from Samburu
District.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Monitors Zairea's Border Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian authorities are
closely monitoring a military build up by Zairean troops on its
border with Zambia's Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
The move is to see that security in the area is not
threatened, the local newspaper ''Sunday Times of Zambia''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an iterview with the newspaper, Copperbelt Minister Charles
Museba said that while the Zambian government appreciated that
the Zairean military move was a domestic matter, it was
monitoring the development.
</P>
<P>
Museba hoped that the Zairean soldiers sent to the border were
forming a cordon to stop movements of other people from various
parts of that country through Shaba Province into Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Security at present is the key issue as there have
been serious cross-border crimes of late and we believe that
there can be no meaningful development in our region if peace is
not guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
In the past months, many refugees arrived in Zambia from
eastern Zaire where there are serious strifes. It was also
reported that some armed bandits also came from Zaire to commit
looting and killing in Copperbelt Province.
</P>
<P>
Museba stressed the need to enhance security for property,
investment and people's life in general which, he said, had to be
put in proper perspective all the time.

<HEADLINE> World Bank-Funded Project to be Launched in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Urumqi, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of an
agricultural project in Tarim Basin in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region will start next summer.
</P>
<P>
With 150 million US dollars in a World Bank loan and 20.95
million US dollars in donations from two overseas funds, the Tarim
Basin II Project is the largest World Bank-loaned farming project
in China, according to Shi Yuebo, an official at the regional
financial department.
</P>
<P>
Richard Reidinger, project manager with World Bank, who led a
group of experts on a recent inspection tour in Tarim, said the
prospects for the program were "bright and optimistic".
</P>
<P>
Experts from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization said the
project was designed to help lift local people out of poverty, and
lead to a better ecological environment in the area.
</P>
<P>
The full project consists of two phases. The first phase, which
was started in 1992 and completed early this year, focused on the
construction of irrigation and drainage facilities.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank provided the phase with a loan of 125 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The first phase has helped 2.3 million people in southern
Xinjiang cast off poverty, said Mr Shi.
</P>
<P>
Preparatory work for the second phase, which will cost a total
of 2.3 billion yuan, is now under way. The phase is to be first
carried out in four prefectures in the northwestern part of the
largest inland deposit basin in the country, covering 560,000
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The basin contains China's biggest desert, the Taklimakan,
which is so arid that the annual rainfall is a mere 50mm. Oases in
the basin are mainly irrigated by melting snow from surrounding
mountains.
</P>
<P>
According to John Weatherhogg, leader of the UN expert group,
the second phase will make maximum use of local water resources,
and put the whole area under a single plan. Currently the
utilization ratio of water resources is only 25 percent. About 85
percent of the funds will be used for water projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
The phase will also be aimed at building water conservancy
facilities, expanding the acreage of farmland, increasing the
yield of crops, improving the environment, speeding up
agricultural modernization, and training local peasants.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996, Eventful Year for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has been an
eventful year for Pakistan's political arena, highlighted by the
dissolution of the National Assembly and the dismissal of Benazir
Bhutto's government.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, daughter of late prime minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, assumed the premiership for the second time in October
1993. Being in the saddle for more than three years, Benazir
believed that this time she could complete her full term.
</P>
<P>
However, Benazir's hope that she would stay in power until 1998
was finally dashed on November 5 when President Farooq Leghari, in
exercise of his power under the constitution, dismissed her
government and dissolved the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In fact, no government has completed its full term ever since
the inception of this country. And this was the fourth time that
the Pakistani president invoked the controversial Eighth Amendment
to the Constitution since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Benazir first assumed the premiership in 1988, becoming the
first woman prime minister in the Muslim world. However, her
government lasted only 18 months when she was sacked by then
president Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
</P>
<P>
This time, simmering differences between President Leghari and
Benazir finally erupted in such a big way that cost her dearly in
regard to her political life. And for that, it is widely believed
that Benazir is herself to blame.
</P>
<P>
The government that epitomized "mass corruption, nepotism,
administrative bunglings, ridicule of the superior judiciary,
economic misdirection, indecisive foreign policies" had brought
the country to the brink of a precipice, the local press
commented.
</P>
<P>
Reading the charge-sheet issued by President Leghari against
Benazir, people found it not difficult to understand the
president's action.
</P>
<P>
The most serious charge Leghari leveled against Benazir was her
confrontation with the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary-government tussle reached its peak on March 20
when the Supreme Court issued an order concerning the appointment
of judges -- a prime minister is bound to the advice of the chief
justice on appointment of judges.
</P>
<P>
The verdict deepened the wedge between the presidential house
and the prime minister's secretariat, as Benazir refused to
implement the court order while the president sought his own way
of appointing judges.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's defiance and ridicule of the judiciary became the
turning point in her relationship with President Leghari, once an
ally of Benazir.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of extra-judicial killings in southern Sindh
province, which also took the life of Benazir's estranged brother
Murtaza Bhutto on September 20, was another reason for her ouster.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is believed to be a ready pick-up reason for
President Leghari's action.
</P>
<P>
Benazir and her spouse Asif Ali Zardari are alleged to have
purchased a 355-acre mansion in Surrey near London. The opposition
also accuse the couple of making millions of dollars out of a
Mirage deal with a French company.
</P>
<P>
The utter bungling of the economy was quoted as yet another
reason for the action of the president.
</P>
<P>
The government incurred domestic loans of about 70 billion
rupees (1.75 billion dollars) within 20 days of the passing of the
1996-97 fiscal budget as against the annual budget ceiling of 20
billion rupees (500 million dollars). The foreign exchange reserve
dropped sharply to a mere 600 million dollars against the minimum
of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the badly-needed loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the government accepted the IMF
conditionalities by imposing 80 billion rupee (2 billion US
dollars) additional taxes in the current fiscal year, thus drawing
widespread protest.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ever mounting foreign debts, further depreciation
of the local currency and the higher than accepted inflation rate
had left the country's economy anything but to be optimized.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of the Benazir government has been termed in some
circles as "a constitutional coup." However, the president's
decision to dissolve the National Assembly was no surprise as it
was expected over the last few months. Now the political tumult
has eased, and all, which was expected to happen, has finally
happened.
</P>
<P>
As all the major political parties are now preparing for the
forthcoming general elections scheduled for February 3, 1997, the
earlier suspicion of canceling or postponing the polls is
gradually fading away.
</P>
<P>
When it was sworn in, the caretaker government led by Malik
Meraj Khalid said that the top priorities of the government were
accountability, elections and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
As the accountability process, which could bar corrupted
politicians from contesting the elections, will take months if not
years to complete, major political parties want the polls to be
held on schedule.
</P>
<P>
A record number of 10,566 candidates from all major political
parties have filed their nomination papers for contesting the 700
national and provincial assembly seats. The number of National
Assembly seats this time has risen from 207 to 217 as franchise
has been given to tribals.
</P>
<P>
Among all the parties which announced their participation in
the polls, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz Group) (PML-N) is
widely believed this time to be the strongest contester.
</P>
<P>
PML (N), one of the two largest parties in Pakistan, suffered
little loss in the confrontation between President Leghari and
deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Benazir will lead her Pakistan People's Party (PPP), the other
largest party in the country, in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The PPP suffered a lot during the latest political tussle, and
the party, whose image has been damaged to a great extent during
the last three years, is not expected to perform as well as it did
last time. Thus it is least possible that Benazir could stage a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
However, it is expected that PML (N) will not be able to win
enough seats to form a single-party government. A coalition
government, consisting of two or more parties, is the foreseeable
result of the forthcoming general elections.

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Europe Finetunes Ties With U.S. to Seek More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Rarely in recent history has
the relationship between Europe and the United States been in such
an awkward position -- they are estranged more than ever though
they may still need each other in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
With the most menacing foe, the former Soviet Union,
disappearing from the world arena as a super power, the U.S.,
which hates to stand such a loneliness, is beginning to look for
something or somebody to confront itself with.
</P>
<P>
And Europe, which has long been living in the shadow of the
U.S., has started to feel like letting its voice be heard more
loudly by the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
In a daring move, Europe showed its political will of
independence in March this year when the U.S. Congress passed the
Helms-Burton Act to tighten economic sanctions against Cuba, which
threatened to penalize foreign companies that do business with the
island country, among them many European companies.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) reacted swiftly in sending a clear
message to Washington -- don't hit your friends to hurt your
enemies; we have economic interests over there.
</P>
<P>
Though the U.S. was pressured to soften its position on the
Helms-Burton law afterwards, the EU was reluctant to save face for
its long-time partner.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the EU took the U.S. to the World Trade Organization
and decided to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
On October 29, EU foreign ministers decided to make it illegal
for European companies to obey the Helms-Burton law. They
unanimously approved a counter measure to allow European companies
to claim damages caused by the anti-Cuba law in European courts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. further angered its European allies in August when
President Bill Clinton signed the d'Amato Bill on sanctions
against new investments in the oil industries of Iran and Libya on
the pretext of combating terrorism there.
</P>
<P>
The bill was greeted with the same strong opposition from
Washington's Western allies. Sir Leon Brittan, EU commissioner in
charge of EU-U.S. relations, said in a statement that the U.S.
was going in the wrong direction and that the EU would "act to
defend its rights and interests" if they were jeopardized by the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France and Britain, top Western allies of the U.S.,
warned that they would take joint retaliatory measures if the
U.S. continued to have its own way.
</P>
<P>
An increasingly quarrelsome Europe was more uncompromising in
its recent dispute with the U.S. over who should head the southern
Europe command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as
the alliance tried to restructure its military commands in Europe.
</P>
<P>
France has been pushing for the Naples-based southern command
to be headed by a European, reflecting the desire of the continent
to develop its own security identity within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, has ruled out giving up the
leadership of the command, which is traditionally headed by an
American and currently responsible for the American 6th Fleet.
</P>
<P>
France even threated that it would halt its process of
reconciliation with NATO if its demands are not met.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the NATO military commands in Europe could
well be viewed as a reshaping of U.S.-Europe relations within the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The cold war was over. Time has changed. The European allies of
the U.S. no longer want to play the younger brother.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that in the present context, the most severe
obstacle to the future of a healthy transatlantic relationship may
not be the neo-isolationist tendencies of the U.S. -- as Europeans
often suggest.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, they maintain that the real barrier is the
much more inward-looking tendencies of the Europeans, their
obsession with the challenges of integration and of introducing
the European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The long-time psychological imbalance embedded in the minds of
most Europeans by playing the younger brother has made Europe
sometimes forget itself in criticizing the U.S., some analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the Paris-based French
Institute of International Relations, suggested such a
possibility: a weak Europe that would express its frustration by
pursuing an aggressive policy, in which Europeans would find it
easier to criticize the U.S. than to achieve an agreement among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Europe has not indulged itself so much as to
forget its economic ties with the U.S. Figures show that trade
between the two sides has been constantly growing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day Transatlantic Business Dialogue Conference held in
Chicago in early November, European and American businessmen had a
chance to influence their policy-makers on the future of the
transatlantic relations.
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that at the end of the conference,
U.S. and EU business communities were reportedly united in
condemning the Helms-Burton and d'Amato acts. They vowed to have
the message heard by the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
Europe seems to be less and less cooperative with its elder
brother -- the United States. It demands more political
independence and wants to have a greater say in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
But it is still early to say that the two allies would split,
though they remain far more divided than ever before over key
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The current transatlantic relationship may well attest to an
old saying: interests last but friends don't.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- According to the Insurance
Institute of China, more than 40 well-known Chinese universities,
including Beijing University, Shanghai's Fudan University, and
Tianjin's Nankai University, have started recruiting students for
a bachelor's degree in insurance.
</P>
<P>
Exams are also being given by branches of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, to would-be insurance agents to qualify
for working in the field.
</P>
<P>
In China's financial and trade center of Shanghai, about 9,000
people took the examinations last year, with most passing, while
about 1,000 people became insurance agents in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Overseas insurance companies have also invested in China's
insurance business, a move that may help them find qualified staff
in the future. Since 1991, the US's Aetna Insurance Co. has
donated at least 170,000 US dollars to Beijing University,
providing scholarships for some 1,000 teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
"The Aetna program at Beijing University has achieved
impressive results, and we are honored to be able to continue our
support," says Florence Ng, vice-president of human resources for
Aetna International's Asia Pacific Operation.
</P>
<P>
The German Allianz Insurance Group has endowed a scholarship
fund with 375,000 US dollars, and cooperated with Tongji
University in Shanghai to provide insurance training for
undergrads.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investment Increases in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in Myanmar
has been increasing year by year, reaching 4.69 billion U.S.
dollars in 188 existing projects by the end of October this year,
as against 3 billion  dollars at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures, of the 21 countries
and regions investing in the country, Singapore, Britain and
Thailand are leading with 1.148 billion, 1.009 billion and 783
million dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas, real estate, manufacturing and hotels and tourism
are main recipients of foreign investment as they respectively got
1.43 billion, 839 million, 824 million and 650 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the oil and gas sector, Myanmar has signed a number of
production sharing contracts with companies from Australia,
Britain, France, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and
the United States on oil and gas exploration and production in
five offshore and seven onshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign-invested gas projects, the most successful
are the Yadana gas field in the Mottama offshore area developed by
TOTAL of France, UNOCAL of the United States and PTTEP of
Thailand, and the Yedagun gas field in the Tanintharyi offshore
area developed by Premier of Britain, Texaco of the United States
and Nippon of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the real estate, hotels and tourism sectors has
mostly come from companies in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan
and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, companies from Singapore, Britain,
Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and
China have formed a number of joint ventures with Myanmar's
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the mining sector, foreign investment exceeded 345
million dollars and is involved in 33 projects. 15 companies from
five countries including Australia, Canada, Singapore, Thailand
and the United States are conducting mineral exploration,
prospecting and feasibility study for the development of gold,
copper and other base metal deposits in northern Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Japan are also involved in two major investment
projects: the 12.3-square-kilometer Thanlyin-Kyauktan Industrial
Zone and the Mingaladon Industrial Park in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that foreign investment in the industrial
sector stands at merely 179 million dollars, far less than that in
other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, foreign investors have mostly injected
their capital into areas such as the development of resources and
hotels and tourism while some others are interested in investing
in the financial and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 43 foreign banks have been granted permission to
open representative offices in Myanmar and they are those from
Bangladesh, Brunei, Canada, Cambodia, France, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the
Netherlands, Singapore, Thailand and the United States. Most of
these offices are already in operation.
</P>
<P>
In short, foreign investment in different sectors has pushed
Myanmar's economy to a new stage of development, thanks to the
country's effort to open its door to the outside world and reform
its economy.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar registered a
8.2-percent growth in its gross domestic product in the last four
fiscal years from 1992-93 to 1995-96 which ended in March this
year and is striving for a 6-percent increase in the next five.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambique Develops Economy Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- With the improvement of the
domestic political atmosphere, the gross domestic product
realized a five percent growth in Mozambique this year, the
fastest in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Grain production reached 1.37 million tons, 22 percent higher
than that of last year. And 15,000 tons of maize was exported to
Angola, the first time Mozambique exported grain in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Cash crops increased by 35.7 percent, in which the production
of cashew nuts reached an eight-year high of 65,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
From January to October, the handling capacity of Mozambique's
sea ports reached seven million tons, an 11.1 percent increase
over the same period last year. The volume of rail freight
reached 862 million tons, recording an increase of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth has also been achieved in the country's industrial,
building material and energy sectors, despite a moderate
production drop in the areas of gold mining and fishery.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, exports recorded 169 million U.S.
Dollars in Mozambique, an increase of 33.2 percent over that of
the same period last year. And the total export volume in 1996 is
expected to reach 210 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate will decrease to 30 percent, down
from 54 percent last year. And the exchange rate between the
local currency Meticais and the U.S. dollar is stable.
</P>
<P>
The education situation has been further improved. The primary
school enrolement recorded 1.713 million, up from 1.542 million
last year. The high school enrolement recorded 44,000, up from
38,000 last year. And this year two new universities were opened,
making up a total of five universities in the country.
</P>
<P>
This year the government has worked out a Maputo Development
Corridor Plan to attract foreign investment. It is expected to
draw up the Beira Development Corridor Plan next year.
</P>
<P>
The achievements have been made since the government has
stressed that healing the wounds inflicted by the civil war by
developing the national economy and improving people's living
standard must be put on the top agenda of its priority.
</P>
<P>
Looking forward to the year 1997, the expected partisan
struggles on the issue of local government election may not
affect the domestic political stability and national
reconciliation in Mozambique, observers here say.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Swallows Bitterness in 1996  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The same day the congress of
the Chinese Football Association (CFA) concluded in Guangzhou, top
Chinese soccer officials were let down by the Chinese national
eleven's 3-2 defeat by longtime rivals, the South Korean team.
</P>
<P>
The November 26 match was the second defeat for the Chinese
team in a two-leg exhibition. It lost the first game 3-1 in South
Korea earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
With the Chinese Professional League three years old, the
Chinese soccer is still trying desperately to seek international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
The recognition seems to keep it at a distance as the Asian
Football Confederation (AFC) awarded, in late December, the 2000
Asian Cup to Lebanon instead of China.
</P>
<P>
China's defeat was due, in part, to the poor performance of its
soccer team at the Asian Soccer Cup in the United Arab Emirates,
during which it won only one match in the group and quarter-final
competitions.
</P>
<P>
Compared with Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE, and even with
South Korea and Japan, both of which were eliminated from the last
four by their western Asian rivals, the Chinese team made too many
errors in the games.
</P>
<P>
During the competitions, it adopted an advanced tactics,
switching from the counterattack to an attack-oriented style. Its
offensive looked good in the first match against Uzbekistan, but
its poor defence could hardly back the tactics.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan, which beat China in the 1994 Asian Games final,
cashed in on the defensive loopholes of the Chinese team to claim
a victory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team then downed Syria, but lost to Japan in their
last group match and was edged out of the quarter-finals by Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The 1-3 record in the Asian Cup angered Chinese fans. They
were furious with the way the players lost, not with the defeat
itself.
</P>
<P>
Fans jammed telephone lines to TV talk shows and radio sports
programs, asking almost the same question: Why the Chinese soccer
looks poorer than before the launch of the Professional League.
</P>
<P>
The answer could be found in the 12-team league which lasted as
long as nine months each year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Swallows Bitterness in 1996  (2-last) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 1996 season of the Chinese league had a difficult time.
Critics would say that the quality of the league was
deteriorating, with less competitive scenes and less goals, and
more draws and more yellow and red cards.
</P>
<P>
A total of 292 goals were scored in the season, averaging 2.21
goals per game.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Wanda, which took the title in the inaugural year and
finished third in 1995, again claimed the trophy one week before
the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
Chinese fans, who had managed to keep their faith in the
Chinese soccer since the 1980s, still went to stadiums, though
they often went home disappointed or even angry.
</P>
<P>
The number of fans going to stadiums for league matches
totaled three million, with a game average of 22,700.
</P>
<P>
However, they were not happy with the performance of the
players. They believed that most of them were not physically
strong enough to play a full game in a quick pace.
</P>
<P>
More often than not, the team started a match with a very
impressive offence, but guadually, usually in the second half,
they left the initiative to their opponents.
</P>
<P>
The CFA has noticed the problem and worked out a plan to
encourage, or force, the players to raise their physical
capability. In winter training periods, which begin in December, the
players are asked to run at least 10,000 meters daily in order to
qualify for the fitness test.
</P>
<P>
The test requests players to run some 3,200 meters in 12
minutes. If you can't run that far that fast, you are out next
season.
</P>
<P>
The pratice, once a headache for players when it was introduced
three years ago, has now become a routine for them.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team has been desperately seeking a debut in World
Cup Finals. Two years ago, the CAF set 1997 as the deadline for
the Chinese team to qualify for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
With only five months to go before the World Cup qualifying
campaign, CAF officials now seemed to have realized that the
deadline was set in haste.
</P>
<P>
Few people talked about the deadline in this year's CAF
congress. Instead, the Chinese soccer ruling body now called for
improving the quality of the game.
</P>
<P>
"To fundamentally change the status quo," said CAF vice chairman
Wang Junsheng, "players should toughen both mind and body and
coaches should be open-minded and creative."

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Breaches 7 Percent Mark in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in the
current year, India's inflation rate breached the seven percent
mark to touch a year high of 7.08 percent for the week ended
December 14, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation increased by 0.2 percentage points compared to
6.88 percent during the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The last time the inflation rate crossed the seven percent mark
was in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The week under review witnessed a sharp increase in prices of
commodities such as pork and groundnut seed.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of inflation, which was around six percent at
the beginning of 1996, steadily declined till June. However,
inflation started climbing after the petroleum price hike in the
first week of July.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: 1996, Eventful Year for Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 has been an
eventful year for Pakistan's political arena, highlighted by the
dissolution of the National Assembly and the dismissal of Benazir
Bhutto's government.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, daughter of late prime minister Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, assumed the premiership for the second time in October
1993. Being in the saddle for more than three years, Benazir
believed that this time she could complete her full term.
</P>
<P>
However, Benazir's hope that she would stay in power until 1998
was finally dashed on November 5 when President Farooq Leghari, in
exercise of his power under the constitution, dismissed her
government and dissolved the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In fact, no government has completed its full term ever since
the inception of this country. And this was the fourth time that
the Pakistani president invoked the controversial Eighth Amendment
to the Constitution since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Benazir first assumed the premiership in 1988, becoming the
first woman prime minister in the Muslim world. However, her
government lasted only 18 months when she was sacked by then
president Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
</P>
<P>
This time, simmering differences between President Leghari and
Benazir finally erupted in such a big way that cost her dearly in
regard to her political life. And for that, it is widely believed
that Benazir is herself to blame.
</P>
<P>
The government that epitomized "mass corruption, nepotism,
administrative bunglings, ridicule of the superior judiciary,
economic misdirection, indecisive foreign policies" had brought
the country to the brink of a precipice, the local press
commented.
</P>
<P>
Reading the charge-sheet issued by President Leghari against
Benazir, people found it not difficult to understand the
president's action.
</P>
<P>
The most serious charge Leghari leveled against Benazir was her
confrontation with the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The judiciary-government tussle reached its peak on March 20
when the Supreme Court issued an order concerning the appointment
of judges -- a prime minister is bound to the advice of the chief
justice on appointment of judges.
</P>
<P>
The verdict deepened the wedge between the presidential house
and the prime minister's secretariat, as Benazir refused to
implement the court order while the president sought his own way
of appointing judges.
</P>
<P>
Benazir's defiance and ridicule of the judiciary became the
turning point in her relationship with President Leghari, once an
ally of Benazir.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of extra-judicial killings in southern Sindh
province, which also took the life of Benazir's estranged brother
Murtaza Bhutto on September 20, was another reason for her ouster.
</P>
<P>
Corruption is believed to be a ready pick-up reason for
President Leghari's action.
</P>
<P>
Benazir and her spouse Asif Ali Zardari are alleged to have
purchased a 355-acre mansion in Surrey near London. The opposition
also accuse the couple of making millions of dollars out of a
Mirage deal with a French company.
</P>
<P>
The utter bungling of the economy was quoted as yet another
reason for the action of the president.
</P>
<P>
The government incurred domestic loans of about 70 billion
rupees (1.75 billion dollars) within 20 days of the passing of the
1996-97 fiscal budget as against the annual budget ceiling of 20
billion rupees (500 million dollars). The foreign exchange reserve
dropped sharply to a mere 600 million dollars against the minimum
of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In order to get the badly-needed loans from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the government accepted the IMF
conditionalities by imposing 80 billion rupee (2 billion US
dollars) additional taxes in the current fiscal year, thus drawing
widespread protest.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ever mounting foreign debts, further depreciation
of the local currency and the higher than accepted inflation rate
had left the country's economy anything but to be optimized.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal of the Benazir government has been termed in some
circles as "a constitutional coup." However, the president's
decision to dissolve the National Assembly was no surprise as it
was expected over the last few months. Now the political tumult
has eased, and all, which was expected to happen, has finally
happened.
</P>
<P>
As all the major political parties are now preparing for the
forthcoming general elections scheduled for February 3, 1997, the
earlier suspicion of canceling or postponing the polls is
gradually fading away.
</P>
<P>
When it was sworn in, the caretaker government led by Malik
Meraj Khalid said that the top priorities of the government were
accountability, elections and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
As the accountability process, which could bar corrupted
politicians from contesting the elections, will take months if not
years to complete, major political parties want the polls to be
held on schedule.
</P>
<P>
A record number of 10,566 candidates from all major political
parties have filed their nomination papers for contesting the 700
national and provincial assembly seats. The number of National
Assembly seats this time has risen from 207 to 217 as franchise
has been given to tribals.
</P>
<P>
Among all the parties which announced their participation in
the polls, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz Group) (PML-N) is
widely believed this time to be the strongest contester.
</P>
<P>
PML (N), one of the two largest parties in Pakistan, suffered
little loss in the confrontation between President Leghari and
deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Benazir will lead her Pakistan People's Party (PPP), the other
largest party in the country, in the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The PPP suffered a lot during the latest political tussle, and
the party, whose image has been damaged to a great extent during
the last three years, is not expected to perform as well as it did
last time. Thus it is least possible that Benazir could stage a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
However, it is expected that PML (N) will not be able to win
enough seats to form a single-party government. A coalition
government, consisting of two or more parties, is the foreseeable
result of the forthcoming general elections.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mozambique Develops Economy Amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996 saw encouraging
signs of economic growth in Mozambique with the improvement of
the political climate in the post-war era.
</P>
<P>
After ending the 16-year civil war in 1992, multi-party
elections were held in Mozambique in 1994. Since then, the
southern African country has made remarkable progress toward
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) and the
opposition Mozambique National Resistance (RENAMO) were long-time
rivals. But this year, agreement has been made on important
issues such as the time and modalities of the local government
elections scheduled for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consultations have been constantly held between President
Joaquim Chissano, who is also chairman of the ruling FRELIMO
party, and Afonso Dhalakama, leader of the opposition RENAMO,
aiming to resolve the partisan Discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
In April, Dhalakama had accused the ministers of defense and
interior and the director of the national intelligence of being
incompetent and demanded their resignation.
</P>
<P>
But he softened his stance after his talks with President
Chissano in October, saying he understood the difficulties the
interior minister had run into and that his party had rescinded
the demand for the resignation of the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
"It's our best meeting since I knew Chissano in 1992," said
Dhalakama, who called for his party to cooperate with the
government's effort to solve the problems facing the country.
</P>
<P>
In August, Chissano visited Maringue, RENAMO's former
stronghold, promising to construct roads, build schools and
improve people's living standards. His visit was welcomed by
the local people and hailed by the RENAMO.
</P>
<P>
"It signified the unification of Mozambique as a nation.
Chissano has finally became the president of all the people in
Mozambique," said the local press, commenting on the political
impact of Chissano's visit.

<HEADLINE> Fisherman Back to Huaihe River Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Fish has started to return to a
1,000 kilometer long river in China after a clean-up drive to
bring pollution under control.
</P>
<P>
Now fishermen are flocking back to the Huaihe River on chilly
mornings with their rods and nets. The fish had disappeared long
ago because of serious water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The river is one of the main water channels in central China,
running through Henan, Anhui, Shandong and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
Serious water pollution, caused by thousands of small paper
mills and chemical plants along the Huaihe River basin, made the
river so smelly that fisherman decided to cast their fishing lines
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
About two billion cubic meters of waste water was poured into
the river each year, and the river became so heavily polluted that
the daily water supplies for 20 million residents along the river
banks was endangered. The water was not even fit enough for
agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
"We felt so depressed in recent years because the water in the
river was dirty and the fish disappeared," said Sun Chao, a
63-year-old retired worker, and also a lifelong fishing fan.
</P>
<P>
"But the fish is now coming back again as the water is becoming
clear," the old man said, "so now we have returned, too."
</P>
<P>
In June the four provinces along the river shut down 1,171
small paper mills under a State Council ultimatum to harness the
river. And this move took effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Old man Sun caught seven perch and a crucian carp within one
hour during a morning on the riverbank.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be made to make the river water completely
clear by the end of this century. Anhui Province will spend four
billion yuan in the coming five years to bring waste water
discharge under control.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Tasikmalaya,
West Java province of Indonesia, was gradually returning to
normal, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Tasikmalaya was hit by a wave of riots on Thursday, during
which four people were killed and 15 others injured.
</P>
<P>
As of Saturday, security authorities were still trying to
establish the material loss caused by the apparently ethnic and
religious-tinged riot, said the report.
</P>
<P>
At least 100 buildings, including stores, factories, banks,
churches, police stations and school buildings, were seriously
damaged or even burnt down.
</P>
<P>
Though the situation in Tasikmalaya, about 225 kilometers
southeast of Jakarta, was under control, curfew was still
effective until further notice from the security authorities. The
town appeared to be calm but tense, added the report.
</P>
<P>
Most of the stores and shops in the city were still closed,
paralyzing the economy.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of military troops were deployed in the center of the
city.
</P>
<P>
During the unrest, the police arrested 160 people, mostly
youths, but most of them were later released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tasikmalaya manpower office disclosed that as a
result of the riots, at least 1,000 workers were facing possible
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The riot started at 10:00 am on Thursday as a protest by
thousands of Muslims against alleged police mistreatment of three
Muslim teachers in the town.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of Indonesia's 196 million people follow
Islam but the government gives equal footing to Islam,
Catholicism, Protestantism, Hinduism and Buddhism, the five
religions recognized by the state.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Rebels Release 20 More Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian rebels holding
hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima today
released 20 more people as a result of the direct negotiations
between the government negotiator and guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The freed hostages, including the ambassador of the Dominican
Republic, Jose Diaz Valdepares, Malaysian Ambassador Ahmad Mojtar
Selat, and Peruvian and Japanese businessmen, were picked up by a
bus and taken to a police hospital for medical examination.
</P>
<P>
The release followed the first direct contact between the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels and the government
mediator Domingo Palermo, minister of education, inside the
residence of the Japanese ambassador in Lima, Mirihisa Aoki.
</P>
<P>
Palermo was accompanied by the representative of the
International Red Cross, Michael Minnig, and the Bishop of
Ayacucho, Monsignor Juan Luis Cipiriani, as witnesses for three
hours and 25 minutes, sources close to the police said.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the release, Palermo said that progress had been
made to end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
There are still 83 hostages being held in the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima, which the MRTA guerrillas have
occupied since December 17.
</P>
<P>
The rebels demanded the release of more than 400 of their
imprisoned MRTA comrades. They threatened to kill the hostages,
including Peruvian ministers, legislators and officials, as well
as foreign diplomats and businessmen, if the authorities refuse to
meet their demand.
</P>
<P>
The government mediator was admitted into the residence last
Sunday. He obtained the release of 225 hostages that time.
</P>
<P>
President Alberto Fujimori's government initially refused to
sit down to talks with the MRTA commandos, since it regarded them
as a terrorist group.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Abdala
Bucaram will pay a visit to Peru on January 13-15 as scheduled,
said Peruvian Labor Minister Gonzalez Izquierdo here today.
</P>
<P>
Izquierdo said President Alberto Fujimori spoke with Bucaram on
the phone Friday about the visit.
</P>
<P>
Izquierdo is also temporarily in charge of foreign affairs
since Peru's foreign minister was taken hostage on December 17 by
a rebel group at the Japanese ambassador's residence.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Bucaram indicated that his visit to Peru would
depend on the development of the hostage crisis at the Japanese
ambassador's residence, which has entered its 11th day.
</P>
<P>
Still 83 hostages are being held by armed rebels of the Tupac
Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), who stormed the Japanese
ambassador's residence on December 17 and took more than 500
people as hostages to press for the release of more than 400 of
their comrades jailed in Peru and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest group of 20 hostages were released earlier today as
a government negotiator said "progress has been made" to end the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Izquierdo said the Peruvian government gives much attention to
Bucaram's visit and that Peru wants to seize the occasion to
establish a climate of peace and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
Peru and Ecuador were involved in a brief armed conflict early
last year due to a border dispute over a zone in the Andes known
as the Condor Range.
</P>
<P>
During Bucaram's stay in Peru, the two neighbors plan to sign
agreements on cooperation in the fields of health, education and
culture.

<P>
BEIJING, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Beijing-based Capital Iron and
Steel Company, one of China's leading iron and steel complexes, is
expected to earn 320 million yuan in profits this year, nearly
seven percent more than planned.
</P>
<P>
The company is expected to turn out nearly 7.3 million tons of
iron and 6.9 million tons of rolled steel this year, up 1.4
percent and 3.56 percent over 1995, respectively. It is expected
to win more than 22 billion yuan in sales this year.
</P>
<P>
Owing to a rise of production costs and price cuts for rolled
steel, the company suffered as much as 500 million yuan worth of
losses in its profits.
</P>
<P>
In order to overcome the difficulties, the company exerted
greater effort to promote reforms by reallocating capital and
assets, and learning from Handan Iron and Steel company in Hebei
Province to reduce production costs.
</P>
<P>
It has taken more than 650 measures to reduce costs and
increase economic returns, with total costs cut 539 million yuan
compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the company attaches more importance to upgrading
products by technological application, saving energy consumption,
and restructuring products mix.
</P>
<P>
The average energy consumption for production of steel per ton
in the company has been reduced by nearly 61 kg of standard coal,
helping it save 450,000 tons of coal this year.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Export Goes Down in January-October 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Chile's exports in the first
10 months of this year dropped 3.3 percent over the same period
of last year to 15.75 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export value in the same period of last year was 16.3 billion
dollars, according to the National Exportation Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the decrease in foreign trade revenues
to the fall in the prices of main export products, such as copper
and cellulose.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the average price for copper was 1.33 dollars per
pound (0.37 kilograms), and cellulose's price reached its highest
level in the decade -- an average 810 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the international price of copper dropped
to 1 dollar per pound and cellulose to 560 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The fall in price reduced copper export in the January-October
period to 6.17 billion dollars, 9 percent less than the same
period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Forestry exports went down 22.2 percent in the January-October
period as compared to the same period in 1995 due to the fall in
the price of cellulose.
</P>
<P>
The National Exportation Corporation predicted Chile's export
in 1997 would grow by 8 percent to reach 17 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Old-fashion County Attracts Movie Directors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 29 (Xinhua) -- A county town in the western
suburbs of Shanghai is fast becoming China's answer to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
Zhujiajiao County has been the outdoor location for more than
ten movies this year. Many film makers and directors have
expressed delighted in the unique setting of the long-history
county, reminiscent of Shanghai in 1930-40s.
</P>
<P>
Buildings in styles of the ancient Ming and Qing dynasties, 36
stone bridges, old-looking blocks and lanes are ready-made
reflection of the county's 1,000-year past.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested several million yuan in
renovating well-known Beida Street, Fangsheng Bridge, the town's
God's temple and Shijing River, keeping the county's old flavor.
</P>
<P>
An antiquated residence in Dongjing Street had lured two film
directors for its carved French windows, brick-grounded square
courtyard and interior furnishings, resulting in dozens of camera
shots.
</P>
<P>
Local residents' enthusiasm for movies and antiques owned by
the people are other attractions for making the place a movie
directors' paradise.
</P>
<P>
Old goods from roughly 60 years ago are a specialty of this
county, including old-fashioned wooden armchairs, square tables
for eight people, beds, exotic clocks, wicker baskets, porcelain
vases, and even seldom seen mosquito nets with blue cotton prints.
</P>
<P>
"There is never better location rivaling Zhujiajiao," a senior
movie director said.

<HEADLINE> Nanchang Unemployed Become Hourly-Paid House Keepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, December 29 (Xinhua) -- Many laid-off women in
Nanchang in southeast China's Jiangxi Province, have found jobs as
hourly-paid house keepers. They are taking on jobs that people
used to look down upon.
</P>
<P>
In China's big cities, most of the paid house keepers are from
rural areas. However fewer rural women want to be house keepers
and more are now seeking jobs in rural enterprises, individually
run urban shops, or in inns.
</P>
<P>
At the same time a number of urban women have been displaced by
their state-own or collectively run enterprises, and have to stay
at home.
</P>
<P>
Sanyuan Service Company, attached to the Jiangxi provincial
women's federation, has arranged hourly-wage posts for female
laid-off workers. The hourly-paid employees are usually required
to cook meals, wash clothes, do cleaning, take care of old people
and prepare household dinners.
</P>
<P>
Hourly-waged house keepers are badly needed in the city, as the
households do not need to provide lodging for their employees and
their daily lives need not be disturbed.
</P>
<P>
For laid-off workers, they can get a good income by working for
several households. They have gradually changed their way of
thinking, catering to the needs of earning their bread and
supporting their families.
</P>
<P>
The idea of earning a wage by honest labor, no matter what kind
of work, have been accepted by more urban population, who have
been experiencing reforms that lead to building of a social market
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the head of Sanyuan company, most laid-off workers
registered in their company are above 35 years old, without much
schooling and special skills. However, they are reliable and good
at household work.

MOSCOW, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Duma, the lower house
of Russian Parliament, today approved the 1997 federal budget plan
at the third of the four required readings.
</P>
<P>
The draft was voted by 243 lawmakers in favor, with 117 against
and eight abstentions.
</P>
<P>
But the bill needs another round of voting at a fourth reading
scheduled for late January. The draft budget was passed by the
lower house at the first reading on December 15 and at the second
reading on December 20. Some changes had been made in the bill
after the first two rounds of reading at the lawmakers' request.
</P>
<P>
The bill envisages revenues of 434.36 trillion roubles (78.3
billion U.S. dollars), expenditure of 529.76 trillion roubles (95
billion dollars) and a deficit of 95.4 trillion roubles (17.2
billion dollars), which is 3.5 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Under the budget plan, 6.7 trillion roubles (1.2 billion
dollars) will be allocated to state management, a total of 104.3
trillion roubles (18.8 billion dollars) to the military.
</P>
<P>
It allocates 46.7 trillion roubles (8.8 billion dollars) for
state security, 15.2 trillion roubles (2.7 billion dollars) for
fundamental scientific research, 49.8 trillion roubles (9 billion
dollars) for the industry, power engineering and construction, and
16.1 billion roubles (2.9 billion dollars) for agriculture and
fishery.
</P>
<P>
After today's vote, Finance Minister Alexander Livshits thanked
the legislators for their "constructive work" and expressed the
hope that the implementation of the new bill would let the country
move forward on the path of economic revival.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told reporters that he was
satisfied with today's vote, adding that cooperation between the
cabinet and the lower house in 1996 had been as "fruitful" as
never before.
</P>
<P>
In his words, the budget plan "is the state's major economic
document," and its adoption "will allow to begin a year normally."
</P>
<P>
The budget plan now faces a final Duma vote before going to the
Federation Council, upper house of the parliament, and then to
President Boris Yeltsin for approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 29 (Xinhua) -- The Visit China '97 campaign is
to reach for the sky by promoting holidays on the world's highest
plateau.
</P>
<P>
The regional branch of Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) in Tibet is to play its part in the country's endeavor to
boost tourism on the plateau in Tibet, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of Visit China '97, a nationwide tourism
promotion drive to appeal to travelers from around the world. The
local air transport management body has pledged to improve its
facilities and upgrade its services.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to fulfill its promise, CAAC's Tibetan branch plans to
improve computerized booking services on flights between Lhasa and
Kathmandu in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The branch will set public transport service standards and
train its personnel. A booking office for package-holiday tourists
has been set up in Lhasa, with telephone booking and ticket
delivery.
</P>
<P>
For years tourists have rushed in and out of Tibet during
popular holiday seasons, worsening the already bottleneck air
transport system. The official said the management body will
coordinate with airlines to add flights connecting Tibet and other
places.
</P>
<P>
In addition the ground service should be perfected to guarantee
air transport safety and normal operations, he said.

has worked out a development program for its armed forces, a
senior official said today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese businessman has
crossed a pig with a wild boar to produce a new and better tasting
pork with a higher nutritional level.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yongming, President of Nanfang Wild Animals Cultivation
Company, based in coastal city Ningbo, has carried out research
work into making use of the large number of wild boars in his
hometown Xiangshan County in East China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang, 43, has captured and tamed over 200 wild boars. In 1993,
he obtained 25 cubs through mating one boar as the male parent and
three domestic pigs as the female parents.
</P>
<P>
The hybrid boars are as thin and strong as their wild father,
and as productive and tame as their domestic mothers. And they
have a higher nutritious content as well.
</P>
<P>
Last November a team of experts organized by authoritative
departments from the central and local governments appraised the
hybrids and termed Yang's success an unprecedented achievement.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1, 1995, Yang's company, with the support of
several government institutions, has invested 12.5 million yuan to
set up a swine-cultivating and taming base on an island in
Xiangshan Bay in Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
The boar cultivation base has developed into a big project
covering nearly 200 hectares, with the base raising 6,000 hybrid
pigs this year. So far 800 have been sold to big cities like
Shanghai, Ningbo and Hangzhou, provincial capital of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign companies have ordered 5,000 of the hybrids who
are still in the sty.
</P>
<P>
The hybrids will bring double profits to Yang, compared with
domestic pigs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Yang plans to turn his cultivation base into
a pig-raising, recreational and tourist site. Besides swines, the
base will also house many other kinds of wild animals, including
hares, deer, river deer, wild duck, pheasants, swans, ostriches,
peacocks and snakes.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Joins Hardliners on IRA Army Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams and Martin
McGuinness, Sinn Fein's two most senior members, have been
appointed to the IRA's army council, British intelligence
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Their appointment to the IRA's war cabinet cements their
relationship with IRA hardliners and shatters their claims that
Sinn Fein is entirely independent of the IRA, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
The British newspaper, The Sunday Times which will publish on
December 29 quoted the sources as saying "the newly constituted
army council is expected to call a 'tactical' pre-election
ceasefire in about six weeks' time".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is likely to order more violence in Britain and
Ireland in a bid to placate IRA leaders who want the bombing and
shooting campaign to continue, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
"We have been warned of increased targeting by the IRA on the
mainland during the Christmas holidays and we expect attacks in
the new year," one senior government source said.
</P>
<P>
A security official added: "The IRA have to have a ceasefire
before the election. We think it will be quiet until New Year's
Eve at least, then it will get lively because they need to kill
before they can call a ceasefire."
</P>
<P>
The sources believe that the new deal between Adams, McGuinness
and the hardliners will dictate IRA strategy for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the IRA's strategy was hammered out at an IRA
conference which was attended by up to 100 IRA activists in the
Irish republic two months ago.

<HEADLINE> Police Defuse Bomb under Republican Man's Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The police in Northern Ireland
confirmed Saturday that a device under a car belonging to a
prominent Sinn Fein member was a bomb and said that the bomb had
been defused, according to a BBC television report today.
</P>
<P>
The device was found on the ground under the car of Liam Duffy,
the party's director of elections, in the largely Protestant
Waterside district of Londonderry, Northern Ireland's
second-largest city.
</P>
<P>
Police later confirmed the "suspect device" was a bomb and said
that they carried out a controlled explosion.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that part of the nationalist Gobnascale area of
the Waterside was evacuated while the device was defused by Army
experts.
</P>
<P>
Today's incident happened a week after a car bomb explosion
occurred in north Belfast and in which a leading republican was
badly wounded.
</P>
<P>
Politicians said that they believed Protestant militants loyal
to Britain might be responsible for last Sunday's attack and
feared that a highly-praised, two-year cease-fire by Loyalist
guerrillas could be over although the Combined Loyalist Military
Command has maintained silence.
</P>
<P>
However, Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican
Army, warned Irish nationalist today against possible attack by
pro-British Loyalists.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Brief Visit, Great Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China and Russia, two giant neighbors, share a lengthy border
and traditional friendship. The importance of the establishment of
good neighborly relations between the two nations can not be
underestimated, since it is beneficial to the creation of a
favorable surrounding environment for their economic development.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia have huge markets and their economies are
highly complementary. The sustained growth of the Chinese economy
and recovery of the Russian economy have opened broad prospects
for trade and economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Political ties based on equality and mutual trust complement
the mutually beneficial and cooperative economic relations. Like a
pair of wheels of a cart, they will bring the long-term
good-neighborly relationship between Russian and China well into
the next century and benefit peoples of both countries.
</P>
<P>
The world is moving towards multi-polarization. Both Russia and
China are important countries with great influence in the
world. With a huge population, China has maintained a strong
momentum in economic development, while Russia enjoys a solid
foundation in science and technology with a vast territory and
rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and China well deserve to be two important and
independent poles in the multi-polar world. The establishment and
development of strategic partnership between Russia and China is
conducive to the multi-polarization of the world and to the
establishment of a just and fair international economic and
political order.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both countries made it clear that they do not favor
a world dominated by one power.
</P>
<P>
They believe that a country's internal affairs should be dealt
with by its own people and international issues should be handled
with equal participation of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Non-interference into each other's internal affairs should be
observed as one of the fundamental principles in handling
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The shared belief of the leaders of the two countries has best
reflected the common voice of the world. The strategic partnership
between China and Russia is not directed against any other
parties. It is not only in the basic interests of the two peoples,
but also conducive to global peace and development.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 will be important for Sino-Russian
relations. Chinese President Jiang Zemin will pay a visit to
Russia in early spring, and premiers of the two countries will
continue their regular contacts.
</P>
<P>
We are fully confident that Russia and China, guided by the
principles of "good-neighborliness, equality and mutual trust,
mutually beneficial cooperation, and common development," will
make fresh progress in their cooperation in every field.
</P>
<P>
We hail the success of Premier Li's visit to Russia and wish
prosperity for both countries and happiness for both peoples. May
Sino-Russian friendship be passed on from generation to
generation.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Houseowners Enjoy Bright Future Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Houseowners in Britain can look
forward to a happy new year, with prices rising by an average of
seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Property sales will shoot up by 15 percent during 1997 as more
people put their houses on the market, according to the
prediction by Nationwide, one of Britain's biggest lenders.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat forecast, coming after a good year for the housing
market, is backed up by Abbey National, which also expects values
to rise seven percent.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1.23 million homes were sold this year -- seven
percent more than in 1995, says Nationwide. The society believes
this will increase to 1.4 million next year.
</P>
<P>
The society also predicts next year's recovery will be
strongest in London and the Home Counties, where price increases
of 10 percent and more will be commonplace.
</P>
<P>
"We expect substantially more existing houseowners to return to
the market next year, resulting in more properties for sale and
unlocking the severe log-jam on sales seen over recent months,"
says Nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Negative equity -- the blight of the housing market in the
early 1990s -- will virtually disappear in the next few years,
claims Nationwide.
</P>
<P>
This time last year, building societies were more gloomy --
predicting a rise in house prices of just two or three percent.
</P>
<P>
The optimism is also backed up by a survey by Barclays
Mortgages which found that 51 percent of people believe the value
of their home will increase over the next 12 months -- compared to
36 percent this time last year.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration Ministers to Mend Arab Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus Declaration
signatory states will hold a ministerial meeting to resolve
differences within the eight-member group and close Arab ranks,
Kuwaiti Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Abdel Aziz
al-Dekheil said today.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts are afoot to resolve inter-Arab differences," said the
Kuwaiti minister upon arrival here to attend the 14th meeting of
the group.
</P>
<P>
The routine session of the foreign ministerial meetings, which
is set to begin here this evening, will probe the Middle East
peace process and highlight the necessity of Iraq's enforcement of
the U.N. resolutions passed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Top diplomats from the Declaration group are also expected to
dispel the grudges between the Gulf states of Qatar and Bahrain
and bring together Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab
Emirates, Egypt and Syria, Dekheil added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Ministrer Amr Moussa who met with the Kuwaiti
minister said that the Damascus Declaration meeting will study
different issues of the Arab ranks and regional matters.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, in the two-day gathering, will review
the development of the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on
implementing the long-overdue Israeli partial withdrawal from the
West Bank city of Hebron in addition to the future of the Syrian
and Lebanese peace tracks, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the developments of the Hebron deal, Moussa said Egypt
follows these developments and the deal is expected to be signed
within days.
</P>
<P>
He added that he can not say that the agreement will be signed
today or tomorrow but it is clear that there is marked progress.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the Hebron agreement can make positive impact on
the atmosphere of the peace process and lead to progress on
Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks, according to the
Egyptian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to pursue further the recent change in the
Israeli position vis-a-vis the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UAE-Iran ties have strained over Iran's military presence in
three disputed tiny islands claimed by both of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bahrain and Qatar are locked in a bitter dispute
over possession of the Hawar islands in the Gulf and a strip of
land known as the Zubara in Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The top Egyptian diplomat hoped that mediation efforts between
Qatar and Bahrain would reach a solution as the deterioration of
relations between the two Gulf emirates are "to the disinterest of
Arabs."
</P>
<P>
A quadrilateral committee has been formed to take charge of the
mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration, signed in the Syrian capital
following the 1991 Gulf war, calls for joint security and military
arrangements in addition to economic cooperation among the
signatories.

<HEADLINE> PLO: Egypt Not to Guarantee Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said here today that Egypt will not guarantee the implementation
of the proposed deal under which Israel is to pull out troops
from most parts of the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Member of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas told a press conference that
the Palestinians and Israelis have agreed upon "basic issues" in
their attempts to complete their Marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
"The signing (of the deal) will be within three or four days"
when security concerns are cleared, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides Friday were negotiating on certain
details pertaining to "the outstanding issues related to the
security."
</P>
<P>
Under the autonomy accords, the Israeli redeployment should
have been completed by last March. Netanyahu has insisted on
better security for the 450 Jews living among the 200,000 Arabs
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In case of signing the deal, he said, the Egyptians are not a
neutral party to give guarantees for its implementation. Egypt's
presence at the signing ceremony will be discussed later, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, that signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979 to
become the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, has been a pillar in the Mideast peace process and a
strong advocate of the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured that Egypt is "fully aware of the tiny
details of the negotiations and the agreements" between the
Palestinian and Israeli sides, Abbas said.
</P>
<P>
There will be U.S. guarantees or protocol letter on mutual
commitments, he said, adding that such protocol means that
Washington will send each party a letter.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a query on timetables for implementing the
pullout, he stressed the timetables are an integral part of the
agreement itself.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official who arrived here Friday night gave
the press conference following meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa earlier today.
</P>
<P>
He briefed Moussa on the outcome of the recent
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and the summit meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also tackled other issues related to the
transitional period and the final phase as well as the details on
troop redeployment, added Abbas, who is better known as Abu-Mazen.
</P>
<P>
According to the PLO official, so far the two sides have
agreed on the security arrangements in Hebron in general, the
airport, and the opening of the Shohada and Hesba roads for
Palestinians, but there are still some points of disagreement
between them.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not dropped its opposition to the opening of the
Hussein market and giving the Palestinians right of passage in
the Shohada Street. It still insists on buffer zones between
areas controlled by the Israelis and Palestinians and on control
over Ibrahim Mosque, sacred to Moslems and Jews.
</P>
<P>
Abbas added that the two sides also agreed there should be
commitment to the post-Hebron issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Tunisian President Zine
al-Abidine Ben Ali today announced that his country will undertake
a package of political and economic reforms designed to promote
democracy and bolster the national economy so as to enhance its
ability to meet future challenges.
</P>
<P>
President Ben Ali made the announcement in a speech delivered
before the Tunisian House of Representatives. He said that a plan
for amending the constitution would be submitted to the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The plan, he explained, involves maintaining the cultural gains
of the country, discarding violence and extremism. He said
political parties and organizations are not allowed to be
established on racial, frontal or religious foundations.
</P>
<P>
Giving citizens the right to join the Parliament regardless of
their parental origin, increasing seats in the House of
Representatives and making it easier for the opposition elements
to joint municipal councils are also included in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Ben Ali's speech dealt with the most important results secured
by Tunisia in all sectors during the outgoing five-year plan
(1992-1996), pointing out that Tunisia has enhanced its labor
capacity and developed its exports.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian President announced that a committee would be
formed to coordinate the activities of diplomatic, economic, trade
and tourist missions overseas, and that it would be headed by
the Minister of International Cooperation and Foreign Investment.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Tunisian House of Representatives approved the
1997 state budget, which amounts to 8.01 billion U.S. dollars, an
increase of 10.8 percent compared with that of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Damascus Declaration Ministers Meet to Close Ranks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the
eight-member Damascus Declaration signatories met here this
evening on a joint Arab political, security and economic agenda to
close Arab ranks and foster Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Convened at a time of mounting grudges within the Gulf states,
the two-day ministerial meeting is expected to focus on endorsing a
working strategy in the future to bolster inter-Arab cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Top diplomats from Egypt, Syria and the six Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states, namely, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, will discuss the most
pressing issues in the region and try to remove the snags in their
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's implementation of relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions passed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait will be among
the topics on the agenda to be dealt with by the foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The participants will tackle the Arab-Iranian ties in general
and the tense relations between Iran and the Gulf Arab states in
particular, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted
diplomatic sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has blasted Iran's military presence in three disputed
tiny islands claimed by both of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, top diplomats from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and
Oman are set to meet on the sidelines of the Damascus Declaration
meeting to discuss a territorial dispute between Bahrain and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain and Qatar are locked in a bitter dispute over
possession of the Hawar islands in the Gulf and a strip of land in
Qatar known as the Zubara.
</P>
<P>
Qatar submitted the dispute to the International Court of
Justice in the Hague, rejecting Arab mediation to reach a peaceful
settlement to the 60-year-old row. Due to the contention, Bahrain
recently boycotted a GCC meeting held in the Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will also review the development of the
ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on implementing the
long-overdue Israeli partial withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Arab differences and means of reaching a unified Arab stance
vis-a-vis regional and international issues, Arab-Iranian
relations and Israeli settlement expansion in the Golan Heights
and its impact on the peace process will also be discussed by the
foreign ministers this evening, according to sources here.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they will examine ways of creating an executive
schedule for the Declaration signed in the Syrian capital
following the 1991 Gulf war. The agreement calls for joint
security and military arrangements in addition to economic
cooperation among the eight signatories.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this evening, senior officials of the eight member
states met to discuss issues on the agenda of the ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic source close to the meeting said a unified working
paper will be forwarded to the foreign ministers for discussion
and approval.
</P>
<P>
This paper, to be included in the final statement to be issued
Sunday, will focus on main issues of interest to the Damascus
Declaration states.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Highway Safety in New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
appealed to the nation today for highway safety, calling for
mandatory drug testing of new teenage drivers and for improved air
bag technology.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio address to deliver a New Year's appeal,
Clinton also has announced plans for a new joint federal-state-
private effort to increase the nationwide use of seat belts.
</P>
<P>
In response to recent reports that the rapidly inflating air
bags pose a particular danger to children, Clinton said the
government will work out rules to allow manufacturers to install
more safe air bags for people with different ages and heights.
</P>
<P>
He said that new rules should allow dealers to deactivate air
bags upon customer request and allow manufacturers to install air
bag cut-off switches in cars lacking back seats or room for child
safety seats.
</P>
<P>
Air bags have saved the lives of some 1,700 people, but have
been blamed for the deaths of 33 children and 23 short adults,
mostly women.
</P>
<P>
Noting that seat belt saved 10,000 lives last year alone,
Clinton called for drivers to use seat belt which he called as
"the first line of defense against injuries and fatalities."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his proposal for drug-testing prospective teenage
drivers "sends a simple message to our children, our families
and our friends: Driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol
is wrong, it's illegal, it can kill."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Approves Budget Stressing Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 28 (Xinhua) -- The Lower House of Jordan's
Parliament today approved a 1.916 billion Jordanian Dinars (about
2.7 billion U.S. dollars) draft budget for 1997, a 6 percent
increase over 1996, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget projects a total revenue of 1.86 billion
dinars (2.63 billion dollars), with local revenue estimated at
1.69 billion dinars (2.38 billion dollars), or an 8.2 percent
increase over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, estimated at 3.9 percent of the gross domestic
product, will be largely covered by foreign grants and assistance
projected at 169 million dinars (238.3 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House, Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti
said that (with the approval of the draft budget) Jordan's
financial reliance on others and the conditions under which
Jordan was forced to ignore its future needs have become part of
the history.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget, presented by the government and adopted by
the Lower House by a vote of 53 to 15 after four days' debate,
reflects no contradiction between the aspirations and the
financial resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken concrete measures to alleviate
poverty and combat unemployment by creating job opportunities for
the labor force, he added.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Marwan Awad said that the draft budget aims
to help the country achieve financial self-reliance, which is
just the main point of Jordan's financial policy.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget will be submitted to the upper house, also
known as the House of Notables, for discussion and approval,
which is just a necessary procedure to make the budget fully
legitimate.

initiative for a solution to the protracted Cyprus problem.

In his new year's message to overseas Cypriots today, President

in 1997, as of great importance, saying that "our aim is to find a
solution ensuring our future on the land of our ancestors".

U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali recently sent his
newly-appointed special representative for Cyprus Han Sung Joo to
the island in an effort to bring about early and direct talks
between the two sides.

Clerides expressed the hope that the Turkish Cypriot side will
also take the same attitude.
</P>
<P>
The President stressed that "for the first time the permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council are showing great interest
in a solution of our national problem, as a result of the
flexible, dynamic and prudent policy we are pursuing."
</P>
<P>
The President called on overseas Cypriots to play their role
in enlightening public opinion and influencing the governments,
the parties and the mass media in the countries where they are
living to persuade them to support efforts for justice in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides assured the overseas Cypriots that Cyprus, divided
since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and took control of the
northern third, will be reunited.
