<HEADLINE> Judge: Man who claims Prozac caused him to rob banks, store  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Wallingford man who claims an overdose of Prozac
made him insane, leading him to rob banks and a department store, has been found
innocent by reason of mental disability or defect.
<P>
	   In a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge Richard Arnold on Thursday found
Christopher DeAngelo, 28, innocent of the 1997 robberies.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a case of somebody pulling a fast one or being too clever,"
said DeAngelo's attorney, John Williams. "The hard indisputable fact of this
case is that this young man was driven to commit crimes by a prescription drug."
</P>
<P>
	   State psychiatrists in July supported the findings of defense experts,
concluding that DeAngelo's actions at the time of the robberies were linked to
his Prozac intake.
</P>
<P>
	   Arnold ordered DeAngelo committed to the custody of the state Department of
Mental Health for 45 days. After that time, a competency hearing will be held to
determine if he should be freed or remain institutionalized.
</P>
<P>
	   DeAngelo was taking Prozac to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder, which a
psychiatric evaluation suggested may have been caused by Lyme disease.

    Brazil Archdiocese Offers Internet
</P>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Call it virtual preaching. A Catholic
archdiocese in southern Brazil has found a novel way of spreading the faith:
</P>
<P>
	   Free Internet service.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea began when a group of lay Catholics and priests in Porto Alegre,
700 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro, teamed up with a handful of companies
eager to expand their marketing strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus was born Catolico, "the provider with a social mission." It offers an
Internet connection, e-mail and customer support services to users of any
denomination, with no strings attached.
</P>
<P>
	   "The objective is to reveal the Catholic faith," said Irineu Brand, a priest
in Porto Alegre. "We have an interest in being known."
</P>
<P>
	   Competition in the religious market is fierce in Brazil, the world's largest
Roman Catholic country. In recent decades, millions of Catholics have switched
to fast-growing Protestant evangelical religions.
</P>
<P>
	   At Catolico's Web site, visitors can donate money to an orphanage, volunteer
for community service, find out when the next Mass is at a local church or learn
how to say the rosary. They can click on an ad and buy a computer or a T-shirt,
pick an Amazon.com book or bank online.
</P>
<P>
	   Catolico doesn't carry ads for cigarettes, alcohol, birth control or
astrological charts. But users have access to any Web page on the World Wide
Web, including pornographic sites.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't have any type of control," said Adao Oliveira, a computer
technician and service coordinator for Catolico. He said Catolico's goal is to
evangelize and not to censor. "We plant the seed. If they get it, they get it."
</P>
<P>
	   The response has been overwhelming, Oliveira said. His staff gets 1,000
e-mails a day from people who want to volunteer or ask questions, and has even
received a couple of messages from Rome congratulating Catolico on its
achievement.
</P>
<P>
	   Within two weeks after Catolico was launched on Jan. 14, more than 10,000
Brazilians had signed up. That was more than Oliveira expected for the first
month, and there weren't enough phone lines available to meet the demand.
Technicians created a waiting list.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous companies also have approached the group wanting to place their ads
close to images of Jesus, Brand added.
</P>
<P>
	   The Porto Alegre archdiocese, with 170 parishes, claims to be the first
religious institution to offer the free service. It seemed a logical next step
in the church's use of mass media -- from the printed Bible to televised masses
-- to spread the faith. And it fit right in with the pope's recent appeal for
churches to embrace the new waves of communication.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet the novelty took Brazil's Catholic Church hierarchy by surprise. Luis
Cesar Cordoba, a computer scientist at the National Conference of Brazilian
Bishops in Brasilia, the nation's capital, said he was unaware that the church
offered such services. Catholics in Brasilia still pay for Internet access, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not for long, said Oliveira.
</P>
<P>
	   Catolico's next goal is to offer free service to other major Brazilian
cities by the end of March. It already has 1,000 registered users outside its
home state of Rio Grande do Sul, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Catolico is unusual because religious organizations rarely are at the
forefront of technological advancements, said Nevio Fiorin, a coordinator at the
Brazilian Institute of Religious Studies in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
	   "Churches tend to follow the movement hesitantly," he said. "In this case,
they are pioneers."
</P>
<P>
	   Fiorin cautioned that only Brazil's upper and middle classes have access to
the Internet. To reach the poor, face-to-face contact still will be necessary.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Internet will not teach people to pray, will not raise their faith," he
said. "I don't think anyone will be converted over the Internet."
</P>
<P>
	   Free Internet service also is a dangerous gamble, said Erick Sanz, president
of the Brazilian Association of Internet Providers. The service was first
offered here last December by a Brazilian bank, and since then a handful of
other banks and companies have jumped on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
	   Large providers risk flooding the market, losing money and driving
established, paid Internet providers out of business, Sanz said. Catolico
probably won't cause much damage because it is restricted to a single community
and has a specific goal, to win followers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike in the United States, advertising profits in Brazil will likely not
cover the initial costs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The free-of-charge service is a way of climbing the ladders in the
Brazilian telecommunications market," Sanz said. "Their objective is to start
making a profit in 2002," when privatization of Brazil's government-controlled
telecommunications should be concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, the concept of free Internet service providers picked
up momentum with companies like AltaVista and NetZero competing against the
almighty America Online, with more than 20 million paying customers. Some
companies failed to persuade advertisers to spend enough and died. Still, the
market is tempting, research has shown. There are more than 60 million Internet
users in the United States, compared to about 3.2 million in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Everyone wants a share.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Church wants to make its mark in the new communication channels," Brand
said. "And the Internet today is a great channel."
</P>
<P>
	   "We too want to be a virtual community."

<HEADLINE> New York Senate race turns negative early  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - He has a "HillaryNo.com" Web site. Her pals say he
looks like Pez container. He tells potential donors she is guilty of "hostility
toward America's religious traditions." She says he's always angry.
<P>
	   The Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
has turned negative early, much earlier than usual even for normally nasty New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Minus the TV ads, it's like October already," pollster Lee Miringoff, head
of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, said. "They're already doing
the hypocrite-liar routine."
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the New York City mayor began airing a radio spot this month
attacking the first lady's husband for refusing to tap the nation's strategic
oil reserves to help push down rapidly rising home heating oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mr. President, why don't you feel our pain?" the mayor asked. Clinton
campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson called it "the first negative ad of the
campaign."
</P>
<P>
	   The ad is tame compared with some of the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
	   At a dinner Sunday night in Albany she advised more than 1,000 blacks and
Hispanics that they should ask the candidates "will you work to unite people or
will you try to bring more conflict by insulting and demeaning people? ... I
reject the politics of division, revenge and retribution."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor has been quick to jump on apparent, but seemingly minor campaign
gaffes by the first lady, including her failure to leave a tip for a waitress at
a restaurant in rural Albion just west of Rochester. She was taken to task for
the playing of Billy Joel's "Captain Jack," a song that deals with drug use, as
part of the warmup music at her formal campaign announcement. Her aides said
they hadn't selected the music.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Democratic Committee has begun putting out a "City Hall Scandal
Sheet" that catalogues anything negative written about the mayor. The Republican
National Committee uses its fax machines to bash the first lady at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   He regularly jokes about the "vast right-wing conspiracy" that she once
blamed for the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal that led to the president's
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
	   For the record, both deny running negative campaigns. It's the other guy,
they say.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not going to let the Clintons blow into town, set up shop here and
conduct the same kind of very nasty personal campaigns they've done in the
past," Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Clinton campaign adviser James Carville had called Giuliani's
team "goons" and "thugs," Teitelbaum said, "We're not suckers and we won't be
played for suckers ... This is New York. This is a different kind of campaign
and we're not going to be a punching bag."
</P>
<P>
	   "There seems to be a charge a day coming from the other side and of course
you have to respond to that," Clinton said Tuesday during a Buffalo-area stop.
"But I think New Yorkers want this election to be about their future and that's
what I'm going to try to keep it focused on."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight lead over Clinton and few
undecided voters. That, says GOP political consultant Jay Severin, explains the
negative tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a race in which both candidates are fairly well known, so there
aren't a lot of ways to get people to love or like you more," Severin, who is
not involved in the Senate race, said. "One alternative is to drive up the other
person's negatives."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Marist poll, made public Thursday, had Giuliani leading Clinton,
47 percent to 41 percent, among registered voters with 12 percent undecided. But
when the undecideds were pressed, the mayor's lead moved into double digits, 52
percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "She has to start increasing the contrasts between herself and Rudy because
right now his negatives are too low among key groups for her," Miringoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, among white women, Giuliani was viewed favorably by 62 percent
of voters and unfavorably by 25 percent. Her breakdown was 48 percent favorable
and 42 percent unfavorable in that same group.
</P>
<P>
	   Severin said another enticement is that getting a negative message out is
quicker, and thus cheaper, than trumpeting a positive one.
</P>
<P>
	   "The attack needs to be seen or heard or read only once," he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani's lead jumps when undecided voters pressed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rudolph Giuliani's slight lead over Hillary Rodham
Clinton in New York's Senate race reaches double digits when undecided voters
are asked who they are leaning toward for the November election, according to a
statewide poll.
<P>
	   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found that 47 percent
of registered voters supported the New York City mayor while 41 percent favored
the first lady, statistically unchanged from recent Marist polls.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the 12 percent of the voters who said they were undecided were
questioned about who they were leaning toward, Giuliani wound up leading
Clinton, 52 percent to 41 percent, with 7 percent remaining on the fence.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a CBS News-New York Times poll today showed the Clinton-Giuliani
race is a statistical dead heat. That poll showed 47 percent of the voters
surveyed supporting Giuliani and 46 percent backing Clinton. The poll also
showed that fewer than half of those polled - 48 percent - said they are
satisfied with the choices they will apparently have, between Clinton and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Thursday the results of his poll show
Clinton facing an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "She clearly has her work cut out for her," Miringoff said. Nonetheless,
Miringoff said Clinton remains "within striking distance" of her Republican
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, said that "despite a very
glitzy, well-publicized kickoff to her campaign and a statewide tour (early this
month), Mrs. Clinton's numbers have not gone anywhere ... New Yorkers are not
buying her candidacy."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no response from the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, the mayor continued to lead among men and white voters,
including white women, while Clinton had the clear advantage among blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   One advantage for Giuliani was cross-party support. The Republican mayor
captured the support of 29 percent of Democrats surveyed while Clinton picked up
just 14 percent of the Republican vote. In New York, Democrats hold a nearly 5-3
enrollment edge over Republicans. The mayor also led among independents, 49
percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among New York's important Roman Catholic community that makes up almost 45
percent of the New York electorate, Giuliani led Clinton, 52 percent to 35
percent. She had a slight edge among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio has been suggesting lately that he might be
interested in challenging Giuliani for the Republican Senate nomination, the
Marist poll found little support among GOP voters for the congressman from Long
Island. In such a possible matchup, Giuliani led Lazio, 75 percent to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 602 registered voters was conducted Sunday and Monday
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Miringoff said the advantage for Giuliani among undecided voters stemmed in
large part from the fact that most have a more positive view of him. Sixty
percent viewed him in a favorable light while her positive rating was 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist pollster noted the mayor is running much stronger than the first
lady in the politically crucial New York City suburbs where he leads, 65 percent
to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The carpetbagger issue used against Clinton, who didn't move to New York
until early January, appears to be slowly diminishing. In the new poll, 26
percent of voters said they were concerned a great deal about her not being from
New York, down from one in three voters who felt that way in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News-New York Times telephone poll of 1,240 likely voters was
conducted Feb. 16-22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> McCain chairman to hammer Bush with Catholics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - George W. Bush's visit to Bob Jones University will
be a major part of the campaign for New York's substantial Roman Catholic vote,
says John McCain's campaign manager who vows to win the state.
<P>
	   Catholics make up nearly half of the Republican electorate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a major issue," said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari,
the head of the Arizona senator's New York campaign. "Bigotry is a major issue
no matter where it is. And Bob Jones University has been nothing but bigotry for
decades and decades."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari also warned that if the Texas governor became the GOP nominee, the
Democrats would "jam this stuff down Bush's throat."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a federal judge set Feb. 29 as a hearing date for a lawsuit
seeking to open up the state's Democratic and Republican presidential primaries
on March 7 to independent voters. They are currently open only to party members.
McCain's New Hampshire and Michigan victories were due in part to Democrats and
independents voting in the "open" Republican primaries there.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Bush side, TV ads were to begin running across the state on Friday.
Bush's New York effort, led by Gov. George Pataki, also planned mass mailings
and thousands of pre-primary telephone calls to potential voters. The candidate
planned to spend at least two days in the state before the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's television and radio ads will hit the airwaves next week when the
senator himself will start campaigning in New York, Molinari said. McCain will
probably hit New York City, Long Island and some of the major upstate areas, he
said. "Right now, I'm not going to concede a single district in New York state,"
Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones University has long been under fire for barring interracial dating
and because some of its officials have espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning sharply right to appeal to South Carolina voters, Bush made the
school in Greenville, S.C., his first stop in the state after his big loss to
McCain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush later defended the visit and said he is not anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I go to speak to voters, I don't necessarily have to embrace the
policies of the university," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki, Bush's New York campaign chairman, called the Texas
governor a man of "inclusion, tolerance and honor."
</P>
<P>
	   "The attacks against him that imply anything other than that are wrong,
malicious and obviously coming from a desperate political campaign," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Molinari said Bush is not a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's a spark of bigotry in his system. That's not what
he's about," the former congressman said. "But he made a tactical error and it
was gross insensitivity to stand there at a place that is notorious for
attacking every other religion but their own."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Catholics make up about 46 percent of the state's 3 million
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Peter King, a Catholic, already has abandoned the Bush campaign to
become co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign, citing the Bob Jones
controversy as a reason for jumping off the Bush ship. The Bob Jones visit has
also been criticized by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Catholic who
while a Bush backer has repeatedly lauded McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show a close race between Bush and McCain in New York's GOP-only
presidential primary. A CBS News/New York Times poll out Thursday has Bush
leading McCain, 43 percent to 36 percent, among Republican voters. A second poll
out Thursday, from Manhattanville College, had Bush leading McCain, 45 percent
to 35 percent, among likely Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   A Wednesday poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion had the
race even closer with Bush at 43 percent and McCain at 41 percent among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari told WROW-AM radio in Albany that the controversy is going to hurt
Bush in New York and Republicans nationwide during the presidential election.
Molinari called the Bob Jones issue "dynamite."
</P>
<P>
	   "We could be in for a disaster of a year," Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said he isn't worried about going up against Pataki. He said the
New York governor lacks the political muscle that has been enjoyed in past years
by former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and state party Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see Pataki as having a state network among Republicans like D'Amato
did or like Bill Powers did, so from a McCain perspective, I welcome it,"
Molinari said. "I think it's great for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha called the borough president's comments "the
latest in a long list of things Molinari has said during campaigns. Nobody
should take anything he says seriously."
</P>

<HEADLINE> McCain supporter challenging closed primary structure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge is considering allowing independent
voters in New York's March 7 closed primaries after a John McCain supporter was
told that she wouldn't be able to vote in a Republican presidential primary
until 2004.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge David Hurd on Thursday issued a temporary restraining
order keeping political parties from rejecting primary applications of
registered independent voters. He will hold a hearing on Tuesday in Utica to
decide whether the restraining order should become permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   If Wendy Van Wie of Columbiaville wins her action, an extra 2.2 million
independent voters would be able to participate in New York's "Super Tuesday"
Democratic and Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Texas Gov. George Bush's supporters in New York, including state GOP
Chairman William Powers, have come out against opening the state primaries to
independent voters. "I think the Republican primary should be for Republicans,
not Democrats and independents," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain got major help from independent and Democratic voters in his
victories in New Hampshire and Michigan. "If they get a favorable decision, I
think we'll sweep New York," said former Congressman Guy Molinari, McCain's New
York chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Wie, 46, who previously had not registered for a political party in New
York, registered as a Republican after a federal judge on Feb. 4 ordered McCain
placed on the ballot statewide in New York. However, Van Wie, a recent Albany
Law School graduate, was told state law would keep her from voting in a New York
presidential primary until 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters who switch parties or join parties after being uncommitted have to
wait until after a presidential election to participate in their new party's
primary. That means the first primary she would be able to vote in would be in
2004.
</P>
<P>
	   "I personally want to vote for John McCain," said Van Wie, who along with
Lloyd Wright of Dutchess County asked a federal judge to stop New York's
political parties from keeping independent voters out of their primaries. "I
don't really care who anyone else votes for, though. I just want people to be
able to vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawyer, Susan Galvin, says unregistered voters in New York can wait
until at least 20 days before a primary and register for a party and vote in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "The non-enrolled are treated clearly differently and in a discriminatory
manner from the way in which people who are not registered to vote at all in New
York are treated," she said. "If you haven't bothered to register or you haven't
bothered to exercise your right to vote in the past, you get preferential
treatment over somebody who is registered and has voted."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari, Galvin and Van Wie all insisted Thursday that the McCain campaign
is not behind the lawsuit to get more independent support into the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Named in the injunction are Powers, Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope,
GOP Gov. George Pataki, the state Board of Elections, the Columbia County Board
of Elections and the Dutchess County Board of Elections.

<HEADLINE> Guilty pleas in statewide investigation of asbestos industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In what's called the largest criminal investigation
and prosecution of the asbestos removal industry, 12 individuals and two
corporations have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the federal Clean Air
Act.
<P>
	   "Over and over again, these defendants willingly put the public at risk to
line their own pockets," French said. "They are criminals. They were driven by
greed. Their behavior was reprehensible."
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants face penalties such as jail terms and fines.
</P>
<P>
	   They removed asbestos from such prominent buildings as the state Legislative
Office Building in Albany and a state police regional headquarters in Sidney in
the southern tier.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators encountered phony asbestos removal training courses offering
bogus certificates, usually with full knowledge of the client paying for the
training, according to French. In one case, five men pitched in to buy a used
car to trade for such certificates, which allowed them lucrative and plentiful
work. Bid rigging was also routine, according to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Asbestos from a taxpayer-funded $50,000 job in a state office ended up not
in an out-of-state disposal area as contractors promised, but in a box in a
parking lot in downtown Albany. An undercover sting operation in Watertown found
cases of "phantom asbestos removal" being conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors highlighted the case of Empire Remediation, which for four years
saw projects win easy approval by Fisher Environmental Services, Inc. Both
companies were owned by the same man, Daniel Fisher, 29, of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher admitted Thursday that he routinely falsified air monitoring reports,
even sending blank "casettes"- filter-like devices worn by asbestos removal
workers used to determine whether workplace asbestos levels exceed safety
guidelines - to ensure project approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Fisher, the perpetrators are consultants and lab owners, in court
they described themselves as graduates of undergraduate biology and
environmental science programs in colleges around the state.
</P>
<P>
	   And so far, officials say, they are only the tip of the iceberg, part of a
statewide network of a shady asbestos removal companies that has lied to four
school districts, a nursing home, a community college, a newspaper, a veterans
hospital and a more than 100 more known public and private entities. Violations
have already been found in Albany, Schenectady, Troy, Syracuse, Utica,
Watertown, Auburn and Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that to compete in this industry others had to be corrupt too,"
French said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yearlong investigation that included mail fraud convictions ultimately
involved New York's health and labor departments as well as the U.S. Postal
Service, Internal Revenue Service and Environmental Protection Agency. It began
after the U.S. attorney's office received tips from industry insiders, French
said.
</P>
<P>
	   By the middle of next month, authorities said, the list of fraudulent
projects will likely total 200. They said there will also be cases where private
homeowners paid for work that may have been done shoddily, by falsely trained
workers, unnecessarily or not at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Those living, working or learning in buildings where asbestos removal work
was done improperly are not and have not been exposed to asbestos, according to
Ronald Tramontano of the state Department of Health. Rather, workers may have
been exposed to clouds of airborne asbestos particles due to the use of improper
removal techniques, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exposure to asbestos can cause asbestosis, which scars lung tissue and can
lead to death.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a reason for restrictions on asbestos removals - asbestos is
dangerous if mishandled," EPA Regional Administrator Jeanne Fox said at a joint
news conference Thursday with French.

<HEADLINE> McCain chairman to hammer Bush with Catholics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - George W. Bush's visit to Bob Jones University will
be a major part of the campaign for New York's substantial Roman Catholic vote,
says John McCain's campaign manager who vows to win the state.
<P>
	   Catholics make up nearly half of the Republican electorate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a major issue," said Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari,
the head of the Arizona senator's New York campaign. "Bigotry is a major issue
no matter where it is. And Bob Jones University has been nothing but bigotry for
decades and decades."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari also warned that if the Texas governor became the GOP nominee, the
Democrats would "jam this stuff down Bush's throat."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a federal judge set Feb. 29 as a hearing date for a lawsuit
seeking to open up the state's Democratic and Republican presidential primaries
on March 7 to independent voters. They are currently open only to party members.
McCain's New Hampshire and Michigan victories were due in part to Democrats and
independents voting in the "open" Republican primaries there.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Bush side, TV ads were to begin running across the state on Friday.
Bush's New York effort, led by Gov. George Pataki, also planned mass mailings
and thousands of pre-primary telephone calls to potential voters. The candidate
planned to spend at least two days in the state before the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's television and radio ads will hit the airwaves next week when the
senator himself will start campaigning in New York, Molinari said. McCain will
probably hit New York City, Long Island and some of the major upstate areas, he
said. "Right now, I'm not going to concede a single district in New York state,"
Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones University has long been under fire for barring interracial dating
and because some of its officials have espoused anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning sharply right to appeal to South Carolina voters, Bush made the
school in Greenville, S.C., his first stop in the state after his big loss to
McCain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush later defended the visit and said he is not anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I go to speak to voters, I don't necessarily have to embrace the
policies of the university," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki, Bush's New York campaign chairman, called the Texas
governor a man of "inclusion, tolerance and honor."
</P>
<P>
	   "The attacks against him that imply anything other than that are wrong,
malicious and obviously coming from a desperate political campaign," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Molinari said Bush is not a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's a spark of bigotry in his system. That's not what
he's about," the former congressman said. "But he made a tactical error and it
was gross insensitivity to stand there at a place that is notorious for
attacking every other religion but their own."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Catholics make up about 46 percent of the state's 3 million
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Peter King, a Catholic, already has abandoned the Bush campaign to
become co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign, citing the Bob Jones
controversy as a reason for jumping off the Bush ship. The Bob Jones visit has
also been criticized by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Catholic who
while a Bush backer has repeatedly lauded McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show a close race between Bush and McCain in New York's GOP-only
presidential primary. A CBS News/New York Times poll out Thursday has Bush
leading McCain, 43 percent to 36 percent, among Republican voters. A second poll
out Thursday, from Manhattanville College, had Bush leading McCain, 45 percent
to 35 percent, among likely Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   A Wednesday poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion had the
race even closer with Bush at 43 percent and McCain at 41 percent among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari told WROW-AM radio in Albany that the controversy is going to hurt
Bush in New York and Republicans nationwide during the presidential election.
Molinari called the Bob Jones issue "dynamite."
</P>
<P>
	   "We could be in for a disaster of a year," Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said he isn't worried about going up against Pataki. He said the
New York governor lacks the political muscle that has been enjoyed in past years
by former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and state party Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see Pataki as having a state network among Republicans like D'Amato
did or like Bill Powers did, so from a McCain perspective, I welcome it,"
Molinari said. "I think it's great for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha called the borough president's comments "the
latest in a long list of things Molinari has said during campaigns. Nobody
should take anything he says seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said Pataki had wound up with a "black eye" for backing an
unsuccessful effort by Bush's New York supporters to keep McCain off the New
York primary ballot, a move the former congressman called "the dumbest political
move I've seen in the past two decades."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not a bad guy. I think he's getting bad advice," Molinari said of
Pataki. "If things continue this way, I can't see him running for reelection."

<HEADLINE> Poll: Giuliani's lead jumps when undecided voters pressed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Rudolph Giuliani's slight lead over Hillary Rodham
Clinton in New York's Senate race reaches double digits when undecided voters
are asked who they are leaning toward for the November election, according to a
statewide poll.
<P>
	   The Marist College Institute for Public Opinion poll found that 47 percent
of registered voters supported the New York City mayor while 41 percent favored
the first lady, statistically unchanged from recent Marist polls.
</P>
<P>
	   But when the 12 percent of the voters who said they were undecided were
questioned about who they were leaning toward, Giuliani wound up leading
Clinton, 52 percent to 41 percent, with 7 percent remaining on the fence.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a CBS News-New York Times poll today showed the Clinton-Giuliani
race is a statistical dead heat. That poll showed 47 percent of the voters
surveyed supporting Giuliani and 46 percent backing Clinton. The poll also
showed that fewer than half of those polled - 48 percent - said they are
satisfied with the choices they will apparently have, between Clinton and
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist pollster Lee Miringoff said Thursday the results of his poll show
Clinton facing an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
	   "She clearly has her work cut out for her," Miringoff said. Nonetheless,
Miringoff said Clinton remains "within striking distance" of her Republican
rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruce Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, said that "despite a very
glitzy, well-publicized kickoff to her campaign and a statewide tour (early this
month), Mrs. Clinton's numbers have not gone anywhere ... New Yorkers are not
buying her candidacy."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no response from the Clinton campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, the mayor continued to lead among men and white voters,
including white women, while Clinton had the clear advantage among blacks and
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   One advantage for Giuliani was cross-party support. The Republican mayor
captured the support of 29 percent of Democrats surveyed while Clinton picked up
just 14 percent of the Republican vote. In New York, Democrats hold a nearly 5-3
enrollment edge over Republicans. The mayor also led among independents, 49
percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Among New York's important Roman Catholic community that makes up almost 45
percent of the New York electorate, Giuliani led Clinton, 52 percent to 35
percent. She had a slight edge among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio has been suggesting lately that he might be
interested in challenging Giuliani for the Republican Senate nomination, the
Marist poll found little support among GOP voters for the congressman from Long
Island. In such a possible matchup, Giuliani led Lazio, 75 percent to 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 602 registered voters was conducted Sunday and Monday
and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Miringoff said the advantage for Giuliani among undecided voters stemmed in
large part from the fact that most have a more positive view of him. Sixty
percent viewed him in a favorable light while her positive rating was 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Marist pollster noted the mayor is running much stronger than the first
lady in the politically crucial New York City suburbs where he leads, 65 percent
to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The carpetbagger issue used against Clinton, who didn't move to New York
until early January, appears to be slowly diminishing. In the new poll, 26
percent of voters said they were concerned a great deal about her not being from
New York, down from one in three voters who felt that way in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS News-New York Times telephone poll of 1,240 likely voters was
conducted Feb. 16-22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> High court says stressed-out manager can get workers' comp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The manager of an A&AMP;P store, so stressed out by
cost-cutting measures imposed by his employer that he needed hospitalization,
can receive workers' compensation benefits for the six months he was out of
work, a court ruled.
<P>
	   The state Court of Appeals decided 7-0 Thursday that Nick De Paoli's
debility fit the criteria for coverage under workers' compensation, which more
typically provides benefits to people who suffer on-the-job physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   He blamed a series of cost-cutting moves at the A&AMP;P market in Goldens
Bridge, in northern Westchester County, in mid-1994 for prompting his
stress-related condition. According to court papers, A&AMP;P dismissed two veteran
co-managers and replaced them with inexperienced workers as well as rearranging
the work schedules for crews at his store.
</P>
<P>
	   Facing pressure from higher-ups at A&AMP;P to "make it work," De Paoli said he
began working 70-hour weeks trying to maintain the market properly, lost 35
pounds and had trouble sleeping. On Oct. 30, 1994, he experienced severe
trembling, profuse sweating, heart palpitations and numbness in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
	   What De Paoli believed was a heart attack was diagnosed as a panic attack
and De Paoli missed a half year of work recuperating, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;P opposed De Paoli's attempt to collect workers' comp. The company said
there is an exception in the law which applied in his case, one which exempts
worker injuries resulting directly from good-faith personnel decisions by
employers from workers' comp coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The personnel moves at the Goldens Bridge A&AMP;P were just such "lawful job
transfers made in good faith," A&AMP;P lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
	   But the state's high court rejected that reasoning. De Paoli did not get
sick because of personnel decisions affecting his own job directly, the court
said in a decision written by Chief Judge Judith Kaye, but those of his
coworkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Indeed, he was not the subject of any personnel decision at all," Kaye
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves at A&AMP;P forced De Paoli "to work longer hours, take on more
responsibility and manage a store that was not performing well," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, the two workers hired to replace the comanagers
were later fired for incompetence and the work shift changes made prior to De
Paoli's illness were undone by the company.
</P>
<P>
	   John Curley, De Paoli's lawyer, said he was pleased with Thursday's ruling.
He said his client is still working at the same store, but is no longer manager.
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;P's lawyer, Ralph Magnetti, said he found the ruling disappointing but was
"not terribly surprised by it."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested the decision may ultimately discourage some companies from
doing business in New York because they can be held liable for workers' comp
benefits for making "legitimate personnel decisions that have to be made in
order to profit in the business."

<P>
	   Bush later defended the visit and said he is not anti-Catholic.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I go to speak to voters, I don't necessarily have to embrace the
policies of the university," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki, Bush's New York campaign chairman, called the Texas
governor a man of "inclusion, tolerance and honor."
</P>
<P>
	   "The attacks against him that imply anything other than that are wrong,
malicious and obviously coming from a desperate political campaign," Pataki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even Molinari said Bush is not a bigot.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's a spark of bigotry in his system. That's not what
he's about," the former congressman said. "But he made a tactical error and it
was gross insensitivity to stand there at a place that is notorious for
attacking every other religion but their own."
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, Catholics make up about 46 percent of the state's 3 million
registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Rep. Peter King, a Catholic, already has abandoned the Bush campaign to
become co-chairman of McCain's New York campaign, citing the Bob Jones
controversy as a reason for jumping off the Bush ship. The Bob Jones visit has
also been criticized by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Catholic who
while a Bush backer has repeatedly lauded McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show a close race between Bush and McCain in New York's GOP-only
presidential primary. A CBS News/New York Times poll out Thursday has Bush
leading McCain, 43 percent to 36 percent, among Republican voters. A second poll
out Thursday, from Manhattanville College, had Bush leading McCain, 45 percent
to 35 percent, among likely Republican primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   A Wednesday poll from Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion had the
race even closer with Bush at 43 percent and McCain at 41 percent among
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari told WROW-AM radio in Albany that the controversy is going to hurt
Bush in New York and Republicans nationwide during the presidential election.
Molinari called the Bob Jones issue "dynamite."
</P>
<P>
	   "We could be in for a disaster of a year," Molinari said.
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said he isn't worried about going up against Pataki. He said the
New York governor lacks the political muscle that has been enjoyed in past years
by former U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and state party Chairman William Powers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see Pataki as having a state network among Republicans like D'Amato
did or like Bill Powers did, so from a McCain perspective, I welcome it,"
Molinari said. "I think it's great for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha called the borough president's comments "the
latest in a long list of things Molinari has said during campaigns. Nobody
should take anything he says seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari said Pataki had wound up with a "black eye" for backing an
unsuccessful effort by Bush's New York supporters to keep McCain off the New
York primary ballot, a move the former congressman called "the dumbest political
move I've seen in the past two decades."
</P>
<P>
	   "He's not a bad guy. I think he's getting bad advice," Molinari said of
Pataki. "If things continue this way, I can't see him running for reelection."

<HEADLINE> McCain supporter challenging closed primary structure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A federal judge is considering allowing independent
voters in New York's March 7 closed primaries after a John McCain supporter was
told that she wouldn't be able to vote in a Republican presidential primary
until 2004.
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge David Hurd on Thursday issued a temporary restraining
order keeping political parties from rejecting primary applications of
registered independent voters. He will hold a hearing on Tuesday in Utica to
decide whether the restraining order should become permanent.
</P>
<P>
	   If Wendy Van Wie of Columbiaville wins her action, an extra 2.2 million
independent voters would be able to participate in New York's "Super Tuesday"
Democratic and Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Texas Gov. George Bush's supporters in New York, including state GOP
Chairman William Powers, have come out against opening the state primaries to
independent voters. "I think the Republican primary should be for Republicans,
not Democrats and independents," Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain got major help from independent and Democratic voters in his
victories in New Hampshire and Michigan. "If they get a favorable decision, I
think we'll sweep New York," said former Congressman Guy Molinari, McCain's New
York chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Wie, 46, who previously had not registered for a political party in New
York, registered as a Republican after a federal judge on Feb. 4 ordered McCain
placed on the ballot statewide in New York. However, Van Wie, a recent Albany
Law School graduate, was told state law would keep her from voting in a New York
presidential primary until 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters who switch parties or join parties after being uncommitted have to
wait until after a presidential election to participate in their new party's
primary. That means the first primary she would be able to vote in would be in
2004.
</P>
<P>
	   "I personally want to vote for John McCain," said Van Wie, who along with
Lloyd Wright of Dutchess County asked a federal judge to stop New York's
political parties from keeping independent voters out of their primaries. "I
don't really care who anyone else votes for, though. I just want people to be
able to vote."
</P>
<P>
	   Her lawyer, Susan Galvin, says unregistered voters in New York can wait
until at least 20 days before a primary and register for a party and vote in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   "The non-enrolled are treated clearly differently and in a discriminatory
manner from the way in which people who are not registered to vote at all in New
York are treated," she said. "If you haven't bothered to register or you haven't
bothered to exercise your right to vote in the past, you get preferential
treatment over somebody who is registered and has voted."
</P>
<P>
	   Molinari, Galvin and Van Wie all insisted Thursday that the McCain campaign
is not behind the lawsuit to get more independent support into the Republican
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Named in the injunction are Powers, Democratic Party Chairwoman Judith Hope,
GOP Gov. George Pataki, the state Board of Elections, the Columbia County Board
of Elections and the Dutchess County Board of Elections.

<HEADLINE> High court says stressed-out manager can get workers' comp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The manager of an A&AMP;P store, so stressed out by
cost-cutting measures imposed by his employer that he needed hospitalization,
can receive workers' compensation benefits for the six months he was out of
work, a court ruled.
<P>
	   The state Court of Appeals decided 7-0 Thursday that Nick De Paoli's
debility fit the criteria for coverage under workers' compensation, which more
typically provides benefits to people who suffer on-the-job physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   He blamed a series of cost-cutting moves at the A&AMP;P market in Goldens
Bridge, in northern Westchester County, in mid-1994 for prompting his
stress-related condition. According to court papers, A&AMP;P dismissed two veteran
co-managers and replaced them with inexperienced workers as well as rearranging
the work schedules for crews at his store.
</P>
<P>
	   Facing pressure from higher-ups at A&AMP;P to "make it work," De Paoli said he
began working 70-hour weeks trying to maintain the market properly, lost 35
pounds and had trouble sleeping. On Oct. 30, 1994, he experienced severe
trembling, profuse sweating, heart palpitations and numbness in his left arm.
</P>
<P>
	   What De Paoli believed was a heart attack was diagnosed as a panic attack
and De Paoli missed a half year of work recuperating, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;P opposed De Paoli's attempt to collect workers' comp. The company said
there is an exception in the law which applied in his case, one which exempts
worker injuries resulting directly from good-faith personnel decisions by
employers from workers' comp coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The personnel moves at the Goldens Bridge A&AMP;P were just such "lawful job
transfers made in good faith," A&AMP;P lawyers argued.
</P>
<P>
	   But the state's high court rejected that reasoning. De Paoli did not get
sick because of personnel decisions affecting his own job directly, the court
said in a decision written by Chief Judge Judith Kaye, but those of his
coworkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Indeed, he was not the subject of any personnel decision at all," Kaye
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves at A&AMP;P forced De Paoli "to work longer hours, take on more
responsibility and manage a store that was not performing well," she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   According to court papers, the two workers hired to replace the comanagers
were later fired for incompetence and the work shift changes made prior to De
Paoli's illness were undone by the company.
</P>
<P>
	   John Curley, De Paoli's lawyer, said he was pleased with Thursday's ruling.
He said his client is still working at the same store, but is no longer manager.
</P>
<P>
	   A&AMP;P's lawyer, Ralph Magnetti, said he found the ruling disappointing but was
"not terribly surprised by it."
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested the decision may ultimately discourage some companies from
doing business in New York because they can be held liable for workers' comp
benefits for making "legitimate personnel decisions that have to be made in
order to profit in the business."

<HEADLINE> Guilty pleas in statewide investigation of asbestos industry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In what's called the largest criminal investigation
and prosecution of the asbestos removal industry, 12 individuals and two
corporations have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the federal Clean Air
Act.
<P>
	   "Over and over again, these defendants willingly put the public at risk to
line their own pockets," French said. "They are criminals. They were driven by
greed. Their behavior was reprehensible."
</P>
<P>
	   Defendants face penalties such as jail terms and fines.
</P>
<P>
	   They removed asbestos from such prominent buildings as the state Legislative
Office Building in Albany and a state police regional headquarters in Sidney in
the southern tier.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators encountered phony asbestos removal training courses offering
bogus certificates, usually with full knowledge of the client paying for the
training, according to French. In one case, five men pitched in to buy a used
car to trade for such certificates, which allowed them lucrative and plentiful
work. Bid rigging was also routine, according to the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
	   Asbestos from a taxpayer-funded $50,000 job in a state office ended up not
in an out-of-state disposal area as contractors promised, but in a box in a
parking lot in downtown Albany. An undercover sting operation in Watertown found
cases of "phantom asbestos removal" being conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors highlighted the case of Empire Remediation, which for four years
saw projects win easy approval by Fisher Environmental Services, Inc. Both
companies were owned by the same man, Daniel Fisher, 29, of Schenectady.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher admitted Thursday that he routinely falsified air monitoring reports,
even sending blank "casettes"- filter-like devices worn by asbestos removal
workers used to determine whether workplace asbestos levels exceed safety
guidelines - to ensure project approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Fisher, the perpetrators are consultants and lab owners, in court
they described themselves as graduates of undergraduate biology and
environmental science programs in colleges around the state.
</P>
<P>
	   And so far, officials say, they are only the tip of the iceberg, part of a
statewide network of a shady asbestos removal companies that has lied to four
school districts, a nursing home, a community college, a newspaper, a veterans
hospital and a more than 100 more known public and private entities. Violations
have already been found in Albany, Schenectady, Troy, Syracuse, Utica,
Watertown, Auburn and Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that to compete in this industry others had to be corrupt too,"
French said.
</P>
<P>
	   The yearlong investigation that included mail fraud convictions ultimately
involved New York's health and labor departments as well as the U.S. Postal
Service, Internal Revenue Service and Environmental Protection Agency. It began
after the U.S. attorney's office received tips from industry insiders, French
said.
</P>
<P>
	   By the middle of next month, authorities said, the list of fraudulent
projects will likely total 200. They said there will also be cases where private
homeowners paid for work that may have been done shoddily, by falsely trained
workers, unnecessarily or not at all.
</P>
<P>
	   Those living, working or learning in buildings where asbestos removal work
was done improperly are not and have not been exposed to asbestos, according to
Ronald Tramontano of the state Department of Health. Rather, workers may have
been exposed to clouds of airborne asbestos particles due to the use of improper
removal techniques, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exposure to asbestos can cause asbestosis, which scars lung tissue and can
lead to death.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a reason for restrictions on asbestos removals - asbestos is
dangerous if mishandled," EPA Regional Administrator Jeanne Fox said at a joint
news conference Thursday with French.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Looks To Ease Iraqi Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is looking for ways to loosen
sanctions against Iraq that block the import of machinery, oil industry spare
parts, pesticides and other industrial products, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington has discretely been reviewing its screening of imports under the
sanctions, the Post said, quoting unidentified U.S. and Western officials. While
maintaining a hard line against Saddam Hussein, the administration has been
trying to accommodate U.N. Security Council allies who want to ease
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials agreed this week to release a $80 million electrical repair
contract on condition that U.N. workers verify that the parts are used as
intended, the Post said in the article for its editions Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has frequently exercised its right as a member of the
Security Council to block Iraq from acquiring ``dual use'' items such as
pesticide sprayers, which can be used for biological warfare as well as for
helping farmers to grow food. Britain, France and other U.S. allies are
concerned restrictions on such technology are undermining efforts to ease
humanitarian suffering in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month several congressmen asked President Clinton to ease the
sanctions on Iraq, insisting children were suffering needlessly and Hussein's
regime was benefiting from the measures.
</P>
<P>
	   Making a similar complaint, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, Hans
von Sponeck, quit this month.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait barred Baghdad
from selling oil, its most precious commodity, on the open market. Under U.N.
resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors determine that
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have been eliminated.

<HEADLINE> Woman Pleads Guilty To Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A woman accused of nearly starving her young son in an
effort to keep him religiously pure pleaded guilty to reduced charges of child
abuse and misdemeanor assault Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under terms of the plea agreement, prosecutors plan to recommend up to 90
days in jail and probation for the woman, Kyndra Fink. Her ex-husband,
Christopher Fink, has pleaded guilty to similarly reduced charges and is
awaiting sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple told family members their son, David, was the ``Christ Child''
and had to remain pure, and so they fed him a limited diet. He was brought to a
hospital by worried family members.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1998, the couple abducted the boy, then 21 months old, from the
hospital and disappeared. Police found the Finks 16 days later, living in a tent
in a remote part of Montana. They were charged with kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyndra Fink gave birth to the couple's second child while in the woods. Both
children now are in foster care.

<HEADLINE> Former British POWs File Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Former British prisoners of war filed a slave
labor lawsuit Thursday against a Japanese company, using a new California law
that specifically allows such cases against foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of all British
and Allied prisoners of war between 1941 and 1945, seeks all profits their work
brought Japan Energy Corp., formerly known as the Nippon Mining Company.
Attorneys estimate those profits run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We starved and were beaten to provide profits for this company,'' said
Arthur Titherington, a 77-year-old British veteran and plaintiff in the suit.
``Japan Energy is directly responsible for systematically torturing hundreds of
men and profiting from their labor. This is perhaps our last chance to make
book.''
</P>
<P>
	   Masanori Takada, spokesman for Japan Energy Corp., said the company could
not comment because it could not confirm the lawsuit had been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit accuses the company of participating in the beatings, starvation
and ultimately the deaths of prisoners of war at the Kinkaseki copper mine. Of
the 523 prisoners who were sent to work in the mine, court documents said only
93 were left alive when the camp was liberated in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit is the latest step by Titherington and others to get
compensation for their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a Tokyo court rejected their demand for compensation for Allied
soldiers and civilians held prisoner by Japanese troops during World War II. As
a result, Titherington and others rejected an apology by the prime minister for
the country's brutality during the war, insisting it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese court has said all war compensation issues were settled by
postwar treaties and individuals could not sue under the Hague Convention of
rules of war.
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney Steve Berman, who filed the California lawsuit, said despite
war crimes trials at the conclusion of the war, Japan Energy has never been held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anyone can argue that Japan Energy profited from the misery
of POWs,'' he said. ``The only question is whether Japan Energy will live up to
their moral obligation to these war veterans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Japan Energy has 210 subsidiaries and 92 affiliates worldwide, including
California-based Japan Energy USA and Irvine Scientific.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Laura Asked To Temper Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
   By JESSIE SEYFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A gay rights group took on the nation's top-rated
radio talk show host Thursday, accusing Laura Schlessinger of harming children
by saying gays are ``deviants'' whose sexuality can be cured through therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem with Dr. Laura's anti-gay rhetoric is it doesn't stop even
after you turn it off,'' reads a full-page ad, which appeared in the San
Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner and Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   The San Francisco-based Horizons Foundation placed the ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlessinger's show, taped in Sherman Oaks, Calif., airs on 500 stations in
the United States and Canada. It attracts some 20 million listeners.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Dr. Laura's rhetoric -- heard by parents, educators, uncles, aunts and
grandparents -- gets repeated and is absorbed by America's children,'' said
Peter Teague, the foundation's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlessinger responded to the group's arguments on the air Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never made anti-gay commentary. I've made anti-gay activist agenda
commentaries, but I've never made anti-gay commentary. You better believe I
always consider the impact of my commentaries, especially on children,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlessinger, 53, said she was targeted because she has encouraged
California listeners to vote in favor of Proposition 22, which would make
male-female marriages the only legally recognized marriages in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What these people are trying to do is demonize me in an effort to help
their political campaign against the Protection of Marriage Initiative,'' she
said.

	   Mark Madsen added 20 points for the Cardinal (23-1, 12-1 Pac-10), which shot
82 percent from the field in the second half (18-of-22) to win its 11th in a
row.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford, which held the No. 1 ranking for three weeks earlier in the

	   Washington State (5-18, 0-14) has lost 15 straight under new coach Paul

<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Paul Pierce scored 25 points as the
Boston Celtics never trailed and cruised to a 101-77 win over the Vancouver
Grizzlies on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierce, who shot 11-of-17 from the field in 32 minutes, was aided by 24
points from Antoine Walker and 22 from Kenny Anderson as the Celtics won for the
second time in five starts on their six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareef Abdur-Rahim led Vancouver with 20 points in the Grizzlies' first
game at home after a 2-2 Eastern road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston, idle since playing Monday in Portland, shot 60 percent in a first
half in which the Celtics opened a 52-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies had their worst quarter this season, opening the game with
just 11 points in the opening 12 minutes. Vancouver missed 19 of 23 attempts
from the field in the period, and the Boston defense forced eight turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Things didn't get much better for the Grizzlies. The low point came during
the second period trailing 31-14 when they were forced to call a timeout just to
inbound the ball after a Boston basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Grizzlies center Bryant Reeves was an early casualty, suffering a sprained
right knee 6:03 into the contest. He did not return. The lack of an interior
presence hurt the Grizzlies, who were outrebounded 44-32 by the undersized
Celtics.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 111, Magic 92  </HEADLINE>
    By LANDON HALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Damon Stoudamire scored a season-high 30 points as
the Portland Trail Blazers pushed their winning streak to 10 with a 111-92 rout
of the Orlando Magic on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Stoudamire was 13-of-18 from the field, and his point total was a new season
high for any of the Blazers. Steve Smith had the previous high of 27 against the
Los Angeles Lakers on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong and Chucky Atkins each had 16 points and Michael Doleac
had 14 for the Magic, who were coming off a 36-point loss at Seattle on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers played one of their best offensive games recently, shooting 56
percent. Orlando stayed in it by hitting its outside shots, but a series of
breakdowns in the third quarter was all the room Portland needed.
</P>
<P>
	   A jumper by Magic center John Amaechi cut the lead to 54-47 early in the
third, but the Blazers went on an 11-0 run. Arvydas Sabonis passed behind his
back to Stoudamire for an easy layup, and then after a flat-footed block of
Doleac, Sabonis dropped in a layup for a 67-49 lead with 4:05 left in the
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando cut it to 13 several times in the fourth, but got no closer in
falling to 1 1/2 games behind Detroit and Milwaukee for the eighth and final
playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando lost its third straight but still is 9-5 since Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   After missing a breakaway layup to start the game, Stoudamire hit seven of
his next eight shots, including three jumpers to beat the clock. The last one
came after Smith found him in the corner for a 3-pointer as time ran out to give
the Blazers a 51-41 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   In their previous meeting, an 81-79 Portland win on Nov. 17, the Magic had
25 offensive rebounds, the most allowed by the Blazers this season. The trend
continued Thursday, as Ben Wallace had four by himself in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blazers countered with crisp ball movement, and their waiting for the
right shot paid off. Portland's field goal percentage was its highest since it
shot 56 percent in a 105-95 win at San Antonio on Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   The only drama late in the game was whether seldom-used veteran center Joe
Kleine would hit a basket for the Blazers. He sank a jumper with 58.6 seconds
left, his first hoop since Nov. 13 against Atlanta.

</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks (20-6, 11-3) survived a 39-point performance from UCLA's Maylana
Martin to hold onto the Pac-10 lead. She made 17-of-22 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon, which won its sixth straight game, outscored the Bruins 9-0 in the
first two minutes of the second half to break a 36-36 tie. The Ducks turned the
burst into a 22-5 run that broke it open.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA (15-8, 9-4) could get no closer than 11 points the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>

minutes of the second half. She hit a short jumper, followed by a 3-pointer,
after the Bruins had trimmed Oregon's lead to 58-47 with 12 minutes to play.

<HEADLINE> Former British POWs File Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Former British prisoners of war filed a slave
labor lawsuit Thursday against a Japanese company, using a new California law
that specifically allows such cases against foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of all British
and Allied prisoners of war between 1941 and 1945, seeks all profits their work
brought Japan Energy Corp., formerly known as the Nippon Mining Company.
Attorneys estimate those profits run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We starved and were beaten to provide profits for this company,'' said
Arthur Titherington, a 78-year-old British veteran and plaintiff in the suit.
``Japan Energy is directly responsible for systematically torturing hundreds of
men and profiting from their labor. This is perhaps our last chance to make
book.''
</P>
<P>
	   Masanori Takada, spokesman for Japan Energy Corp., said the company could
not comment because it could not confirm the lawsuit had been filed.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit accuses the company of participating in the beatings, starvation
and ultimately the deaths of prisoners of war at the Kinkaseki copper mine. Of
the 523 prisoners who were sent to work in the mine, court documents said only
93 were left alive when the camp was liberated in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit is the latest step by Titherington and others to get
compensation for their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, a Tokyo court rejected their demand for compensation for Allied
soldiers and civilians held prisoner by Japanese troops during World War II. As
a result, Titherington and others rejected an apology by the prime minister for
the country's brutality during the war, insisting it was not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   The Japanese court has said all war compensation issues were settled by
postwar treaties and individuals could not sue under the Hague Convention of
rules of war.
</P>
<P>
	   But attorney Steve Berman, who filed the California lawsuit, said despite
war crimes trials at the conclusion of the war, Japan Energy has never been held
accountable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think anyone can argue that Japan Energy profited from the misery
of POWs,'' he said. ``The only question is whether Japan Energy will live up to
their moral obligation to these war veterans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Japan Energy has 210 subsidiaries and 92 affiliates worldwide, including
California-based Japan Energy USA and Irvine Scientific.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Argue Over Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. (AP) -- On the haze-draped banks of the Hudson River, Vice
President Al Gore picked up an endorsement Thursday from the New York League of
Conservation Voters. But Friends of the Earth, which backs Bill Bradley, accused
Gore of selling out on his promise to protect wetlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore used the occasion of his endorsement, which included backing by
prominent New York Republican and environmentalist Larry Rockefeller, to
criticize GOP presidential candidates John McCain and George W. Bush for the
second straight day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For these candidates clean air really is an act. Clean water is too,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign released a television ad in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
says, ``There is no American political leader in our history with a greater
understanding or commitment to environmental protection than Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
	   The airing of the 30-second spot coincided with an article in the Feb. 28
issue of The American Prospect magazine. The article quotes Kennedy as one of
several environmentalists disturbed by the Clinton-Gore administration's support
for a federal-state plan permitting construction of a shopping mall by the Mills
Corp. on 500 acres of wetlands in New Jersey's Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends of the Earth Political Action Committee, which endorsed Bradley last
fall at least partly to show its frustration with the administration, said in a
news release that executives, contractors and family members of the Mills Corp.
have given Gore $43,000 for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the mall project an outrageous assault on wetlands, Kennedy told the
magazine: ``It is disappointing to see Al Gore, who I admire, succumb to this
kind of mercenary approach.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy was out of the country on Thursday, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I make you this pledge -- that if you entrust me with the presidency I
will not let you down. I will fight with everything I've got to protect the
environment here in New York, all through our country, and around our world. I
will not let you down. That's not to say we will agree 100 percent on
everything,'' Gore told his riverside audience of about 100 supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A gauzy haze obliterated what Gore aides had hoped would give him a scenic
backdrop. What was visible instead, over Gore's shoulder, was the work of
demonstrators on a nearby outcropping: a giant black spider straddling a globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Across the continent, Bradley set up temporary shop in Washington state,
driving hard for a win in its nonbinding Feb. 29 primary. There, he began airing
a two-minute biographical TV ad designed to help with his still-poor name
recognition. And he released a 30-second commercial that hits several of his
national themes and one of parochial interest. ``Only Bill Bradley fought to
protect our salmon on the Elwah River,'' the ad says, latching onto a hot
environmental issue in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying again to undermine Gore on the core issues of his front-running
campaign, Bradley told his audience at the University of Washington that Gore
spent 16 years in Congress but introduced just four bills addressing education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore was the conservative Democrat,'' Bradley said. ``He's a
conservative who picks weapons over classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley argued anew that Gore is a closet conservative, not just in the
past, when he was an anti-abortion-choice, pro-gun congressman from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   He said, ``Washington has the opportunity to send a message to the country.
I need your help.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, he was warmly received by about 500 people at The Evergreen State
College in Olympia, where he answered questions about foreign policy, defense
spending and gay rights, among other things. He used the venue -- students at
the liberal arts school are known as ``Greeners'' due to their passionate
environmentalism -- to slam Gore's record on the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also repeated his desire to eliminate the F-22 stealth jet fighter
that Boeing Co. is helping to develop, and he disappointed many students by
refusing to condemn police reaction during the violent World Trade Organization
demonstrations in Seattle last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in New York, Gore accepted the New York environmental group's
endorsement with rare, kind words for his rival.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Bradley does have a good environmental record and I acknowledge
that,'' Gore said. ``But I deeply appreciate your willingness to look at not
only the two very similar records on votes but also to go beyond that and look
at leadership, because I've worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
	   The national, Washington-based League of Conservation Voters is not likely
to choose sides in the Democratic primary, said Lisa Wade, the group's
communications director.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, the group gave Bradley an 84-percent approval rating for his
environmental record during the 18 years he represented New Jersey in the
Senate. Gore earned a 64 percent rating.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Thursday, Gore visited the Orthodox Jewish community of New Square,
outside New York. All 7,000 in the Hasidic community greeted Gore -- the women
lined the village streets, one of which is named for President Clinton, while
the men and boys applauded Gore's speech inside the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing a yarmulke and using a few Yiddish words, Gore argued for a national
hate crimes law and support for Israel. Asked if the vice president had any
problems speaking to a group that separates men and women, his spokesman Chris
Lehane said, ``His views on equal rights are clear -- abundantly clear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere, working to stave off Bradley's criticism of his abortion record,
Gore released a new radio ad for Washington state featuring Kristina Kiehl, a
founder of Voters for Choice. ``I'm disappointed Bill Bradley has chosen to
attack Al Gore on abortion rights, simply for political gain,'' she says in the
ad. ``The fact is both Bill Bradley and Al Gore are strongly pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Clinton told a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser that the
next president may be in position to name three or four Supreme Court justices
-- and reminded the party faithful of what that could mean for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Democratic candidates for president will support maintaining a woman's
right to choose and will act accordingly,'' Clinton said Thursday night in New
York. ``The Republican candidates won't, and will act accordingly.''

<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Creating more state agencies to run programs and
services now overseen by the Department of Children and Families will not help
children, department officials say.
<P>

a bill that would set up a new state agency to handle juvenile justice work and
put the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services in charge of
children's mental health needs.

	   Another bill would create an Office of Children Policies and Services to
oversee DCF's budgetary and planning needs.

	   The Program Review and Investigations Committee began probing DCF after the
deaths of several children who were in the agency's custody, including the
suicide of a teen-age girl at the Long Lane school.
</P>
<P>
	   Committee analysts who studied the agency said it is crisis-driven and
spends too many resources on child protection, to the detriment of juvenile
justice, mental health and abuse prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilman said more bureaucracy won't solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are working to solve problems that are there," he said. "But the concern
that several people share is that these proposals will ultimately lead to a
reduction in services for children."
</P>
<P>
	   DCF officials have said that the changes could mean that a child who is
abusing drugs, has mental health problems and is in trouble with the law, would
have to deal with three state agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   "I do believe the department has a broad role, and I want to be assured that
the proper services are being made available to the children," said Julia
Wasserman, R-Newtown, the committee's co-chairwoman.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Man who claims Prozac caused him to rob banks, store  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - A Wallingford man is innocent of robbing banks and
a department store because the drug Prozac made him do it, a judge has ruled.
<P>
	   In a non-jury trial, Superior Court Judge Richard Arnold on Thursday found
Christopher DeAngelo, 28, innocent of the 1997 robberies due to mental disease
or defect.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a case of somebody pulling a fast one or being too clever,"
said DeAngelo's attorney, John Williams. "The hard indisputable fact of this
case is that this young man was driven to commit crimes by a prescription drug."
</P>
<P>
	   State psychiatrists in July supported the findings of defense experts,
concluding that DeAngelo's actions at the time of the robberies were linked to
his Prozac intake.
</P>
<P>
	   DeAngelo was taking 60 mg of Prozac and a tranquilizer called Xanax to treat
depression and an obsessive-compulsive disorder,which one psychiatric evaluation
suggested may have been caused by Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams claimed DeAngelo was taking two to three times the amount of Prozac
normally prescribed for a person in his condition when he robbed the First Union
Bank in Derby on Dec. 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctors agreed that DeAngelo's mental state probably was influenced by
the impairments brought on by Lyme disease coupled with an adverse reaction to
his medication. The psychiatrists said DeAngelo's mental state may also have
been affected by his family history of bipolar disorder and his abuse of alcohol
at the time he was taking the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   While Prozac and Xanax are commonly used to treat depression, psychiatrists
said the drugs, when taken together and in high doses, can have "manic-like"
side effects, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeAngelo, who was previously free after posting bail of more than $200,000,
was taken to the Whiting Forensic Division of Connecticut Valley Hospital in
Middletown. A competency hearing will be held to determine if he should be freed
or remain institutionalized. He is due back in court on April 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Arnold's 21-page ruling is unprecedented in Connecticut and appears to be
rare nationwide. Claims based on Prozac use have been raised but rejected in
Kentucky, New York and Minnesota courts over the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Senators want more money for fire departments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Fighting fires is not cheap.
<P>
	   Breathing equipment: $4,000. Fire-resistant jacket: $1,900. Truck with
ladder: $700,000.
</P>
<P>
	   This gear, with its hefty price tags, were on display Thursday to
demonstrate the bare minimum firefighters need to do their jobs every day.
</P>
<P>
	   Add to that hi-tech equipment that could save lives - like $25,000 cameras
that help locate people in burning buildings - and the cost of safety can be out
of reach for many fire departments, said a group of lawmakers who held a press
conference to push for more money.
</P>
<P>
	   After all, "there's just so many bake sales you can have," said Rep. Bill
Pascrell.
</P>
<P>
	   The New Jersey Democrat, along with Sens. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, and Chris
Dodd, D-Connecticut, has introduced a measure that would authorize $5 billion
over five years in grants to paid and volunteer fire departments.
</P>
<P>
	   That is less than half of the $11 billion the federal government spent in
1999 on law enforcement initiatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal fire prevention and training spending in 1999 totaled $32 million.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 16 senators have signed on to the bill. The House version has broad
support, with more than half the members co-sponsoring it.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill stipulates that $500 million be earmarked for grants to local
programs dedicated to prevention and public education. The idea, DeWine said,
"is to stop fires before they ever happen."
</P>
<P>
	   Grants from the remaining money could go for salaries, training and
equipment ranging from fire trucks and protective gear for firefighters to
high-tech thermal-imaging cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   The cameras, which cost about $25,000, help firefighters make rescues in
thick smoke and might have saved the lives of six Worcester, Mass., firefighters
who died last December, Prince George's County (Md.) Fire Chief Ronald Siarnicki
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to safety problems the lack of up-to-date equipment also has
made it more difficult for volunteer fire departments to recruit people, said
Pascrell, who called the measure "a form of property tax relief."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the bill, state or local governments would have to match 10 percent of
any federal grant.

Texas Executes Convicted Killer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was executed by injection
Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve. Betty Lou Beets became the
fourth woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court in 1976
allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the second woman executed in Texas
since the Civil War. She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the
death chamber gurney. She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but
smiled at her attorney and a spiritual adviser watching through a window at her
side. She continued smiling as she slipped into unconsciousness.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Persian Gulf oil ministers have agreed
to increase production of crude to stabilize prices around the world, but have
not decided how much -- leaving it unclear whether consumers will find relief at
the gas pumps. A senior United Arab Emirates oil official said Thursday that
Gulf Arab oil ministers who met the day before in Saudi Arabia agreed to a
production increase. Such a move could bring down oil prices, which have been
hovering near a nine-year high. The official said a production increase will be
gradual and will be in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6 percent
above current levels.

beneath two pickup trucks and outside a business was shot and wounded Thursday
by police after he was discovered hiding under a church. Luis Cristobal, a

bombs under trucks owned by Cristobal's brother-in-law and a man acquainted with
Cristobal's estranged wife. The third bomb was placed outside a building where
Cristobal used to work. The fugitive was asked to put down the gun and would
not, so the officer fired, Geller said. Cristobal was in stable condition from

<HEADLINE> Arson murder retrial of Branford business owner begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The rotten-egg smell of natural gas permeated
the Floors &AMP; More store the morning before a fatal fire erupted, according to
testimony from the son of the store's owner.
<P>
	   The father, Anthony "Gene" Bontatibus, 61, is accused of setting the fire at
his Floors &AMP; More store and warehouse on Thanksgiving 1996 to collect $124,000
in insurance money.
</P>
<P>
	   Bontatibus' lawyers maintain the fire started accidentally because of gas
and electrical problems in the building.
</P>
<P>
	   His retrial started Thursday in Superior Court before a jury of seven men
and five women. Testimony is scheduled to continue today.
</P>
<P>
	   His first trial in July 1998 ended in a hung jury, with jurors in favor of
acquittal by a small margin on the most serious charge, arson murder, related to
the death of firefighter Edward Ramos, 36. Bontatibus also is charged with three
counts of arson.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Bontatibus' son, also named Anthony Bontatibus, testified that
he smelled a strong rotten egg smell in the building at about 8 a.m. on the day
the building burned.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend who came by identified the smell as natural gas. Anthony Bontatibus
said he aired out the building and called his father, who said he would shut off
the gas meter and call the company that works on the building's heating system.
</P>
<P>
	   The younger Bontatibus said he went back to the business at about 3:15 p.m.
that day and found all the doors open and his father in the front of the
building, where carpet samples are on display for customers. The gas smell was
fainter but still detectable.
</P>
<P>
	   Anthony Bontatibus said he went home while his father was still at the
business. At about 4:45 p.m., he heard fire engine sirens and looked out the
window to see smoke in the sky.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just knew it - the store had problems," he testified.
</P>
<P>
	   When New Haven State's Attorney Michael Dearington asked how he knew, he
replied: "The gas down there. I just knew."
</P>
<P>
	   Under questioning from defense attorney Thomas Ullmann, the younger
Bontatibus described how the building was filled with cleaners, solvents,
adhesives, vehicles and other possibly flammable items around the
9,600-square-foot building.
</P>
<P>
	   Problems with gas service started about two weeks before, when a gas furnace
suspended from the ceiling of the warehouse was knocked down by a roll of carpet
and a forklift, Anthony Bontatibus said.
</P>
<P>
	   The furnace was reinstalled, but about a week later a gas smell was
detectable in the building, Anthony Bontatibus said. The service company was
called to check into the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first trial, Dearington tried to paint Gene Bontatibus as a
businessman who was heavily in debt and needed to replace the furnace of his
store.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the owner of the building, Richard Patterson, testified that
Bontatibus usually paid the monthly rent of about $3,000 on time, and if he was
a few days late, he would call. The summer before the fire, Bontatibus had
talked about buying the building if Patterson and his partner wanted to sell.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was a very good tenant," Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was detected at 4:30 p.m. by a passerby, Raymond Stone, who was
driving to his home in North Branford.
</P>
<P>
	   Stone testified whitish-brown smoke was billowing out of the eaves of the
building and from a vent in the front of the building.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the fire department from a home nearby, saying: "It looked like it
was going pretty good and they better get out there quickly."
</P>
<P>
	   Stone, who had been a volunteer firefighter, said he then drove back to the
building and saw more smoke and flames shooting out of the vent. He left a few
minutes later when the fire department started to arrive.

<HEADLINE> Witness testifies shooting victim had hands up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) - A witness in the murder trial of New Milford
Police Officer Scott Smith testified that Franklyn Reid had his hands in the air
and was apparently surrendering before he was shot.
<P>
	   William Eayrs Jr., of New Milford, said he was driving with his family down
Route 202 on Dec. 29, 1998, when a black man ran through traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Eayrs said a white man followed and when he pulled out a gun, the black man
turned to face him and put his hands up as if to surrender.
</P>
<P>
	   The white man was Officer Smith. The black man was identified Reid.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were talking but I couldn't hear what they were saying because the
windows were rolled up," he said. "(Smith) walked across the road toward the
black man, who had his hands up in the air. I thought it was all over.'
</P>
<P>
	   On cross examination, Eayrs conceded that his police statement the day after
the shooting never mentioned Reid had his hands up. He also said that as he
drove away, he never heard the gunshot.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, 28, has claimed he acted in self-defense when he shot Reid, 27, after
a chase from a nearby gas station. Reid was wanted on several warrants,
including threatening and breach of peace, which are misdemeanors, and failure
to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith has said he believed Reid was reaching for a weapon as the two
wrestled to the ground before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors contend Smith fired the fatal shot after Reid was subdued and on
his knees. An investigation found Reid was unarmed, but a knife with a 2-inch
blade was found in a jacket nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Eayrs was the first witness to testify that Reid had apparently surrendered
before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A New Milford police officer on Thursday testified Smith and Reid were
"grappling" before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   On the opening day of testimony Wednesday, jurors heard tapes of the police
calls made just before and after Smith shot Reid, and the testimony of Smith's
fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The tapes revealed that just before Reid was shot to death, the police who
were chasing him announced he was in custody. Then came the call for an
ambulance.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia President Ordered To Rest  </HEADLINE>
   By GEOFF SPENCER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A day after being diagnosed with influenza,
Indonesia's frail President Abdurrahman Wahid took a second day off work Friday,
aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was ordered to stay in his room by the doctors,'' said one palace
official speaking on condition of anonymity. ``All his programs have been
canceled.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid emerged to visit a nearby mosque for weekly Friday prayers. The head
of state looked relatively strong and was walking normally. He was accompanied
by aides and members of his medical team.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid denied Thursday that he was seriously ill after doctors ordered him to
rest for several days and to cancel official engagements.
</P>
<P>
	   He joked with reporters Thursday and appeared relatively healthy. Despite
his illness, he hosted a private dinner for visiting dignitaries from Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The 59-year-old head of state is nearly blind, suffers from diabetes and has
had a series of strokes in recent years. He finds it difficult to walk unaided.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muslim cleric and democratic reformer is regarded as central to
Indonesia's chances of recovering from economic and political turmoil. Confusion
over his condition made financial markets jittery. The Jakarta Stock Exchange
index dropped 2 percent Thursday and the value of the currency, the rupiah, also
slid.
</P>
<P>
	   Thursday and Friday were Wahid's first days off for illness since he took
charge of the world's fourth-most populous nation four months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president has been advised to rest,'' said Dr. Mohammad Tony Soufyan,
the head of Wahid's five-member medical team. ``In general, his condition is
good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cabinet Secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the president postponed a
scheduled Friday visit to west and central Java island. A scheduled Sunday trip
to the neighboring oil-rich sultanate of Brunei also was called off.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid has had two strokes in recent years and underwent brain surgery to
stop internal bleeding in early 1998. Questions about his health have dogged him
since he took office last October.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has subjected himself to a punishing daily schedule and long
hours in his quest to introduce democratic change, fix the battered economy and
end several bloody communal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as extensive tours of islands across sprawling Indonesia, he has
visited a long list of countries on several whirlwind diplomatic tours. In his
most recent overseas trip earlier this month, he visited 15 cities in the Middle
East, Europe and Asia in 16 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials did not say whether Wahid would go ahead with a planned visit to
East Timor next Tuesday. The visit would be the first by an Indonesian head of
state since the half-island territory broke away from Indonesian rule last year,
triggering a wave of violence by pro-Jakarta militiamen.

<HEADLINE> Jury eyes two officers in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Jurors in the murder trial of the four white police
officers who shot Amadou Diallo have told a judge they want to listen again to
the testimony of the two defendants who first confronted the unarmed black man.
<P>
	   The jury ended its second day of deliberations Thursday without reaching a
verdict. But they did seek guidance about the meaning of less serious charges
against the defendants.
</P>
<P>
	   Before leaving, jurors also wrote the last of several notes to Supreme Court
Justice Joseph Teresi, saying that today they wanted to be re-read transcripts
of testimony by defendants Sean Carroll and Edward McMellon about the moments
leading up to the Diallo shooting. It also asked for the testimony of an expert
witness on police tactics, and for clarification on laws allowing police
officers to claim self-defense.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury deliberated more than 11 hours, ending at 11 p.m. before being
sequestered for the night.
</P>
<P>
	   "You never know what they're thinking," defense attorney James Culleton
said. "It sounds like they're going through the charges step-by-step. There's no
way to tell. We're not in the room."
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo died in a hail of 41 bullets on his Bronx doorstep on Feb. 4, 1999.
The Guinean immigrant was hit 19 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 37, McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, each
have pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. Conviction on that charge carries
a sentence of anywhere from 15 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   At trial, the plainclothes officers testified that Diallo ignored their
repeated orders to halt, pulled out a black object in a threatening manner and
remained on his feet as bullets flew. The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict could hinge on the defense claim that the officers unleashed the
barrage because they thought Diallo had a gun and was threatening them. The
judge has instructed jurors, "A person who acts in self-defense is not guilty of
any crime."
</P>
<P>
	   Given the option of considering a range of charges other than murder, jurors
asked the judge about manslaughter. He explained that unlike second-degree
murder - which requires proof the officers intended to murder Diallo -
manslaughter means they only sought to cause serious injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalties for first-degree manslaughter range from 5 to 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   By evening, jurors requested that Teresi read them the law on second-degree
manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Those charges, respectively,
apply when someone recklessly causes death or fails to perceive the risk of
death. Both carry sentences that could be as light as probation.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were members of a roving unit that has been accused by some of
stopping and frisking young black men without cause. Diallo's slaying sparked
such intense publicity and so many protests that the case was moved to Albany.

<HEADLINE> Study: Blacks on TV Are Segregated  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Black characters on TV tend to be segregated in certain
sitcoms and on fledgling networks UPN and WB, according to a Screen Actors Guild
study released this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Conducted by University of Southern California sociology professor Darnell
Hunt, the study examined all comedy and drama series that aired on ABC, CBS,
NBC, Fox and the two newer networks during five weeks in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was released Thursday, shortly after the NAACP and other civil
rights groups wrapped up agreements with the four major networks to commit to
more ethnically diverse programming and hiring. A nearly all-white slate of fall
1999 new series prompted the groups to act.
</P>
<P>
	   Hunt said his findings were important because the way TV includes or
excludes groups of people reflects "unresolved questions about power imbalances
in our society."
</P>
<P>
	   Hunt found that blacks were numerically well represented. Blacks make up
12.2 percent of the U.S. population but accounted for nearly 16 percent of the
characters seen on the six networks during the period reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   But about half of all black characters appeared in comedies, compared with
less than a third, 30 percent, of all white characters, the study found.
</P>
<P>
	   The black characters were concentrated on UPN and WB. The networks produced
less than a third of the episodes aired, 29.4 percent, but accounted for more
than 44 percent of all black characters seen in prime time.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven predominantly black sitcoms airing Monday and Friday nights on UPN and
WB represent nearly two-thirds of all black prime time characters who appear for
a substantial amount of time, more than 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The study "seems to go right to the heart of what our effort has been all
about," said Frank Berry, Western region executive director of the NAACP. Blacks
"are being steered, for whatever reason, into comedies."
</P>
<P>
	   Berry said blacks need to branch out not only into dramatic acting roles,
but into writing and directing jobs to ensure their experience is accurately
portrayed.
</P>
<P>
	   While every show on UPN featured a black series regular, less than half of
WB's shows had blacks as regular characters. That suggests "the WB lineup is
largely segregated into 'black' and 'white' shows," according to the study.
</P>
<P>
	   The statistics reflect the tendency of newer networks to go after
underserved minority audiences to build viewership, a tactic Fox once used as a
young network.
</P>
<P>
	   But now blacks are underrepresented at Fox, the study found, and at NBC as
well: Less than 10 percent of the characters on Fox and about 11 percent of
those on NBC were black, and most were not central to story lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 15 percent of all characters in ABC series and 13 percent of CBS
characters were black.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Children's Traffic Deaths High  </HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN BACHMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Too big for child safety seats and too small for adult seat
belts, children ages 4 to 8 face a unique risk of dying in accidents because
drivers often leave them unrestrained and in the front seat, according to
government researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 children in that age group die in car wrecks each year, according
to a study of federal traffic fatality data released Thursday by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found that from 1994 to 1998, 14,411 children ages 4 to 8 were
involved in fatal car wrecks; 2,549 of them died. The report also found that
more than two-thirds of the children killed in car accidents during that period
were not wearing a safety restraint, and fewer than half -- 49 percent -- were
in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Transportation Safety Board recommends that children 12 and
under ride only in the back seat. Studies show that keeping children in the back
seat could cut deaths by a third, yet about a quarter of all kids routinely ride
up front, the CDC said.
</P>
<P>
	   Children in the front seat also face injury risk from air bags and are more
likely to suffer injury there than in the back.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's lead author, Steven Trockman of the CDC's National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control, likened the issue to a disease in which a vaccine
goes unused. He said placing children in booster seats in the back seat wouldn't
save every life, but would reduce the number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a known problem. We have a known vaccine for it,'' Trockman said.
``The vaccine is not getting to the children.''
</P>
<P>
	   The figures are discouraging because of substantial safety gains among
toddlers in recent years, experts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In general, parents just don't understand'' the problem, said Karen
DiCapua, director of child passenger safety at the National SAFE KIDS Campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once the child is 2 1/2 or 3, parents just jump at the chance to put them
in the adult seat,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC recommends that children ages 4 to 8 use booster seats so that
shoulder belts fit them securely between the neck and arm and the lap belt fits
across the upper thighs. But only about 5 percent of the children killed in
accidents were using a child booster seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Children must be 58 inches tall and weigh 80 pounds before they fit into
adult seat belts, according to CDC-adopted guidelines from the American Academy
of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, while all states have child-restraint laws, the CDC found wide gaps
among the safety measures mandated for children ages 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
	   No state requires the use of booster seats, and 19 states allow children to
ride in the back seat without a restraint, according to the Insurance Institute
for Highway Safety, an Arlington, Va.-based research group funded by auto
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 12 states prohibit the use of adult seat belts for children.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Has Uphill Road in New York  </HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN THOMPSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Campaign volunteer Emerson Barr should have known he
was in for a long afternoon when the first potential voter he encountered made
him yell through the picture window of her home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to tell you a little bit about Bill Bradley,'' Barr shouted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know who that is,'' came the woman's reply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's running for president,'' Barr continued. ``He's a former NBA star,
senator and Rhodes scholar.''
</P>
<P>
	   The woman agreed to take some literature through the door.
</P>
<P>
	   Success. Or at least, not failure. On this day, when most who did open their
doors said they were supporters of Vice President Al Gore, it was no small feat.
</P>
<P>
	   A February poll showed Gore with a substantial lead over Bradley in New
York: 54 percent to 35 percent. As recently as December, the two men were in a
statistical dead heat among Democratic voters, with the vice president at 43
percent and the former New York Knicks basketball star at 40 percent, according
to Marist College polling.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has acknowledged he is behind but said there was plenty of time to
turn things around. The primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of organized campaigning for Bradley in Buffalo, a hardy
handful of volunteers fanned out over icy sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's hard to reach everyone. It's a big country,'' Bradley's national
issues director, Mark Alexander, had told the group as they opened Bradley's
campaign headquarters in a former pizza shop.
</P>
<P>
	   They chose Hamlin Park to canvass first. The solidly Democratic neighborhood
boasts a high voter turnout and a taxpayers' association that gets things done.
Many of its primarily black residents have owned homes there since World War II.
Others are students just passing through.
</P>
<P>
	   The issues are about quality of life: Not peace in the Middle East, but in
the streets. Not a stock market index at 11,000, but jobs for the kids.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal among Bradley workers was ``to show people that although Clinton
and Gore have done a lot, the prosperity has not touched this area,'' Barr said.
``We want to show Bill Bradley has fresh ideas.''
</P>
<P>
	   It would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudolph Franklin opened his door, but there was no opening his mind to a
vote for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can tell me about him but I'm voting for the competition,'' Franklin,
friendly but defiant, told Barr.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clinton has already laid out the plan,'' the union laborer explained.
``The country's in the best economic shape in 30 years. People are working.
Products are moving globally. Gore's more qualified and can follow in his
footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the candidates' integrity, Franklin answered: ``In all reality,
politics is a dirty game.''
</P>
<P>
	   A week later, Bradley arrived in the area to deliver his message in person,
finding a mix of about 200 hard-core supporters, undecideds and the curious at a
community college.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Clinton, 79, sat, hat in hands, waiting for Bradley to speak. The
Democrat had yet to pick a candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I would like to hear is one of the candidates go for a universal
health care plan for all Americans. None of these gimmicks that each one has,''
the retired railroad worker said. ``It would take an Einstein to figure them
out. The ordinary citizen can't make heads or tails of them. Start by
eliminating the HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
	   A few rows away, college employees Sharon Gatti, Deborah Medina and Sue
Felser wore ``Bradley for president'' stickers. But none quite believed it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to hear what he has to say in regard to health issues,'' said
Medina, a Republican. ``I like Bush but it's not definite.''
</P>
<P>
	   Felser, also a Republican, liked Bradley's abortion-rights stance but was
withholding a decision as was Gatti, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   Behind the women sat 19-year-old Jason Litwak of New City, who will cast his
first vote next month -- for Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did tons and tons of reading,'' Litwak said. ``I'm looking for someone
who has his priorities straight ... common sense. I think Al Gore has shown he
has that, not only in 23 years of public service but through the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Bradley spoke of offering ``a new story for a new century.''
In times of ``unprecedented prosperity,'' he said, it was time for new programs
in health care and education.
</P>
<P>
	   Alissa Marshall, a 31-year-old music teacher, said she was leaning toward
Gore but was open to hearing about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll have to do my research,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Fight Over Closed Base Turns Ugly  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION, Calif. (AP) -- The fight over an airport
proposed at this closed Orange County base has turned ugly, with images of body
bags and air crashes hitting the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides in the battle -- which pits cities in the southern part of the
county against their northern neighbors -- are airing fiery cable television
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads escalate one of the largest, costliest land use debates in the
country. Records indicate both sides will spend more than $35 million trying to
get their way with the base.
</P>
<P>
	   At stake in a March 7 vote is the fate of 4,700 acres in a tight housing and
transportation market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This isn't just about an airport. It's about the future of the county.
Where it's going. How it's going to get there,'' said Meg Waters, spokeswoman
for the anti-airport El Toro Reuse Planning Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents say the airport is unsafe and would create noise, pollution and
traffic that would damage property values and their suburban quality of life.
</P>
<P>
	   They have been airing ads featuring footage from a 1965 airplane crash that
occurred in nearby mountains. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff from El
Toro, killing 84 military servicemen bound for Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   The commercial shows body bags being hauled into a helicopter with a
voiceover: ``If it's too dangerous for the Marines, isn't it too dangerous for
you?''
</P>
<P>
	   Airport proponents, led by the county Board of Supervisors, have demanded
the advertisement be pulled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is inexcusable that a community organization is using a tragic accident
and the deaths of U.S. servicemen, which occurred 35 years ago, to further their
political agenda,'' Supervisor Cynthia Coad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Coad's brother-in-law died in an airplane crash at the base in 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What has the debate over El Toro come to?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   El Toro, adjacent to the cities of Lake Forest and Irvine, opened as a
temporary base in March 1943 on bean fields about 50 miles south of Los Angeles.
The base closed last year. A majority of supervisors support turning it into a
commercial airport that could handle 28.8 million passengers a year by 2020.
</P>
<P>
	   If an anti-airport measure passes, it would require two-thirds voter
approval before the county could build or expand airports, jails and hazardous
waste sites. That would mean the earliest an airport could open would be 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, proponents began airing an ad featuring retired Gen. William A.
Bloomer, who ran the base from 1984 to 1986, saying pilot error caused the 1965
crash, not an unsafe runway takeoff.
</P>
<P>
	   He accuses the coalition of cities of ``capitalizing on pain and human
suffering just to make a political point.''
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents aren't backing down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's unfortunate that Gen. Bloomer is offended,'' said Susan Withrow,
chairwoman of the group representing the southern cities. ``Our intention was to
show the very real safety hazards.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. OKs Troop Commitment for Congo  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With approval for a 5,500-strong observer mission for
Congo, the United Nations must now start the expensive and complex task of
deploying troops in a country the size of Western Europe but with virtually no
roads.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of transport limitations, the United Nations is planning to rely
almost entirely on hundreds of airlifts to get the troops on the ground to start
monitoring Congo's faltering cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
	   That takes time and costs money: an estimated $500 million for the operation
in its first year, an amount that represents a third of the U.N. peacekeeping
budget approved last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The logistical planning was put into high-gear following the Security
Council's unanimous decision Thursday to authorize 500 military observers to
move into Congo and lay the groundwork for a possible U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels took up arms in eastern Congo in August 1998 to oust Congolese
President Laurent Kabila from power. Citing concerns about security along their
borders with Congo, Rwanda and Uganda backed the rebels, while Kabila enlisted
the support of Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
	   All the key factions signed the cease-fire agreement last summer in Lusaka,
Zambia, but fighting has continued -- particularly in the eastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   The first observers, who would be backed by 5,037 security and logistical
support staff, could begin arriving in Congo in the next two to three weeks. But
a senior U.N. official told reporters Thursday it would take four to six months
for the full strength of 5,537 to arrive.
</P>
<P>
	   That timeframe, the official stressed, was predicated on ideal conditions:
that the troops were ready to go, that the fighting didn't worsen, and that the
six warring countries in the Congo guaranteed their security.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, the United Nations has troop commitments for the 500 observers and
most of the support staff, the official said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Pakistan, Jordan, Senegal and Egypt have been mentioned as possible troop
contributors.
</P>
<P>
	   But the United Nations is still short much of the needed equipment, such as
helicopters and large aircraft. The United States has said it won't contribute
ground troops, but may provide logistics support, which in past peacekeeping
operations has included transport, communications and equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations is planning to deploy the force in four key cities --
Kindu and Kisangani in rebel-held territory and Mbuji-Mayi and Mbandaka in
government-held land.
</P>
<P>
	   They would work with military officials from the warring sides under overall
U.N. authority to monitor the cease-fire and redeploy forces.
</P>
<P>
	   The observer mission is expected to make preparations for a possible
large-scale U.N. peacekeeping force, which would oversee the disarmament of the
foreign troops and their withdrawal from the country.
</P>
<P>
	   During Thursday's Security Council vote, several ambassadors cautioned that
they would only deploy peacekeepers if the Africans themselves showed their
commitment to ending the war and made progress implementing the cease-fire
agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   And they stressed that the United Nations wasn't going into Congo to enforce
a peace but merely to monitor it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The situation is so complicated that it would not only be naive but
dangerous to rely on its settlement by external forces, even if these are United
Nations forces,'' Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov warned.
</P>
<P>
	   Congolese Ambassador Andre Kapanga said he was gratified that the council
was finally getting involved to solve the Congo conflict. And he said the U.N.
mission would be ``warmly welcomed'' by the Congolese people.
</P>
<P>
	   But Congo has already let it be known that it is uncomfortable with the
presence of the United Nations in the country, and has told U.N. officials it
doesn't want deployment at Mbuji-Mayi, the diamond-mining center whose stones
are financing Kabila's war effort.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Truth Report Does Little  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL WEISSERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- One year ago, Guatemala's truth commission issued its
report on the 36-year civil war. It told a horrific tale of death and
destruction that haunts Guatemala's past and besieges its present. It also
described a new beginning for what could be its future.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, many in Guatemala say, all that remains are its horror stories.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've gone nowhere. Nothing has changed,'' said Mario Polanco, a leader of
an organization for relatives of the disappeared. ``If the question is, 'Did
Guatemala listen to what the commission was saying?' the answer is 'No.'''
</P>
<P>
	   The 70-page report entitled ``Guatemala: Memory of Silence,'' issued a year
ago today, was prepared by the three-member Commission for Historical
Clarification, established as part of the 1996 peace agreement that ended the
war between government soldiers and leftist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission made 83 recommendations for the nation's future -- blueprints
for how to put right more than three decades of wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   It recommended everything from the creation of a national holiday to honor
the war's 200,000 victims to the establishment of a legal status of
``disappeared'' for individuals whose remains will likely never be found.
</P>
<P>
	   The group laid out, in painstaking detail, plans for a government program to
compensate the families of the war's victims for their personal and material
loss and mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
	   One year later, almost none of the commission's recommendations have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a tragedy that almost none of the recommendations became a reality,''
said Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu, a Guatemalan Indian rights activist. ``I
hope to God justice will eventually triumph, but how many deaths are we going to
have to endure before the government responds?''
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-week-old government of President Alfonso Portillo says it is
approaching the recommendations with a new urgency, but given that the leader of
his party was a dictator who presided over some of the war's worst years, and
given that Guatemala has a $77 million debt, no one is holding their breath.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything that happened during the war continues, thanks to the
ineptitude of our government,'' said Alfredo Balsells, one of the report's
authors. ``The militarized culture of yesterday is still the culture of tomorrow
here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guatemalans long ago became accustomed to not relying on their cash-strapped
government for anything with a significant price tag. But even the commission's
symbolic suggestions have been ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It doesn't cost a penny to stand up and say, 'This was our mistake and we
want to make it right,' which was at the top of the commission's list,'' said
Frank LaRue, executive director of the Legal Defense Fund, a human rights group.
``Even that hasn't been done.''
</P>
<P>
	   For LaRue, Guatemala's commitment is best summed up by the actions of the
last president, Alvaro Arzu: He refused to attend the February 1999 presentation
of the truth commission's report in Guatemala City's National Theater, declined
to comment on its findings and scoffed at suggestions that he apologize for the
actions of his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose Maria, a spokesman for President Portillo, said the new government is
approaching the truth commission's recommendations with a new sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is committed to the continued development of Guatemala after
the war as are all of the leaders in Guatemala's government,'' he said. ``That
includes evaluating the report and its findings.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some effort was made to honor the commission's recommendations in the
Guatemalan Senate. Less than two months after the report was released, lawmakers
approved a program worth $2.6 million that was supposed to reimburse the
families of civil war victims over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the money never got to the people it was intended for. According to the
U.N. Mission to Guatemala, some of the money was filtered to ``pilot programs''
designed to help get Indian communities back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The governmental arm in charge of distributing the money, the Secretary of
Peace, can't account for the rest of the money, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the protection of human rights nationwide appears to be going
downhill.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. mission here released its annual human rights report in December,
documenting 4,800 human rights abuses in 1999, four times the 1,200 abuses
recorded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, which documented politically or socially motivated killings and
attacks, cited poor training for judges and district attorneys.
</P>
<P>
	   The truth commission provided 32 recommendations to ``strengthen Guatemala's
legal and democratic process,'' mostly to improve the functioning of Guatemalan
courts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a step-by-step appraisal of what Guatemala needed to improve,''
LaRue said. ``Now it's just words on a paper.''

<HEADLINE> Dockworkers Picket Danish Ship  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Twenty dockworkers, chanting and holding signs,
picketed Thursday at a terminal where a freighter owned by a Danish company was
being unloaded by nonunion workers.
</P>
<P>
	   About 100 police wearing helmets and holding riot shields watched as
protesters circled in front of the entrance to the terminal where the freighter
owned by Nordana Line docked at sundown.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month during a similar demonstration, about 400 members of the
International Longshoremen's Association clashed with police. Ten people were
injured and four were indicted on charges of criminal conspiracy and rioting.
</P>
<P>
	   No arrests were reported Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bausch &AMP; Lomb Enters Laser Surgery  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Just as prices for laser-eye surgery appear set to
fall sharply, a major new player is jumping into the fast-growing U.S. market
with what it calls the world's most sophisticated vision-correction machine.
</P>
<P>
	   Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. recently won federal approval to sell its Technolas 217
excimer-laser system, which is already the market leader abroad for treating
both nearsightedness and farsightedness.
</P>
<P>
	   The eye-care company's emergence on the domestic scene seems likely to
intensify a price war among providers of laser-eye surgery equipment and
contribute to the sharp drop in consumer prices. Analysts predict as many as 1.7
million Americans will undergo laser eye surgery this year, up from about
900,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Douglas Christopher, an analyst with Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles,
said he expects the price of the surgery to drop from an average of $2,100 per
eye to about $1,500 per eye this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even if it went to $1,000 an eye, that's still a lot of money," he said
Thursday. "But I don't think Bausch &AMP; Lomb are in the market to become a
low-price leader. They're looking at it as a technological advancement, maybe
more of a premium product."
</P>
<P>
	   In the surgery, a beam of light is used as a scalpel to make the cornea
slightly flatter and allow light to focus on the image-sensing retina. The laser
removes minute layers of tissue with a dose of "cold" ultraviolet energy that
leaves surrounding tissue undamaged.
</P>
<P>
	   The Technolas 217 machines, which sell for $525,000 each, employ a more
precise laser beam that is just millimeters in diameter -- three times narrower
than standard broad-beam lasers, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   In clinical studies, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said 99.7 percent of patients had their
vision improved to 20/40 or better, and 87.3 percent ended up with practically
perfect 20/20 vision or better.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology also diminishes the risk of patients ending up with
uncomfortable side effects, the company said. After surgery, some patients
experience a glare, which is described as long lines of light coming from a
point of light. Others see a halo, a ring around a point of light.
</P>
<P>
	   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said it will charge a $100 royalty fee for each use of its
system by doctors, matching the fee charged by industry leaders Visx Inc. of
Santa Clara, Calif., and Summit Technologies of Waltham, Mass. This week, Summit
and Visx lowered the per-procedure fee they charge doctors from about $250.
</P>
<P>
	   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said its laser-eye products account for about 10 percent of
its $1.8 billion in revenues. It said it commands about one-third of the
overseas market with 500 machines in place, and its next closest competitor is
Japan's Nidek Co. with 430 machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Visx operates an estimated 500 machines in the United States and 360
machines abroad, while Summit Technologies has 235 machines in this country and
170 abroad, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Laser eye surgery is rarely paid for by insurance because it isn't
considered medically necessary.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Firm Demystifies Stocks  </HEADLINE>
    By MATT MOORE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RIDGELAND, Miss. (AP) -- Ensconced in what is nothing more than a series of
garage bays and storage facilities, two Mississippi men aim to help investors
demystify penny stocks and their volatility.
</P>
<P>
	   Key Ramsey, 39, and Greg Ballard, 33, are at the forefront of what have
been, until now, the smallest and, some would say, least covered investment
pursuits: penny stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Known as small-cap investments, penny stocks are usually worth what their
name infers: just pennies per share. They range anywhere in value from 2 or 3
cents per share to as much $1 or $2 per share. And unlike their bigger-name
counterparts that are traded on the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange, their
volatility is what often draws investors to them.
</P>
<P>
	   That is why Ramsey and Ballard, both of whom had dabbled in penny stock
investment, decided in 1998 that if they wanted to invest in the stocks, then
others probably did, too. But research on such companies was virtually
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We noticed that numerous people couldn't find the basic information on
their stocks like telephone numbers, addresses, that sort of thing," said
Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair had planned on taking a plane trip to scout out some of the
companies whose penny stocks they planned to invest in when they realized if
they were going to spend the money needed for plane tickets, lodging and meals,
someone might be willing to pay them for the information they gathered.
</P>
<P>
	   The result was the creation of pennyPI LLC.
</P>
<P>
	   In its original incarnation, the company was going to serve as a sort of
clearinghouse for penny stock investors who wanted to glean more information
about possible investments.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the Internet rapidly became a more credible source for information,
the men decided to make their company a Web-based business, gathering as much
information about penny stocks as possible and putting it in one central
location: pennyPI.com.
</P>
<P>
	   PennyPI now has 10 employees and provides detailed listings of 6,500
companies whose shares are traded over the counter. Subscribers pay $20 a month
to gain full access to the site, which includes company profiles, histories and
chat rooms to talk with other penny stock investors.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was part of our business plan ... to create the first electronic
database of these firms," Ballard said. "The problem is you can't find anything
on these companies and that's why we're here. We intend to cover all of them."
</P>
<P>
	   The company does not endorse any particular stock, nor does it offer tips or
recommendations on which ones to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to be completely arms-length, third party source and have
complete independence," Ramsey said. "We present the facts."
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, people want to get stock picks whereas what they really need
is the truth," Ballard said. "If they know and trust us, which is what we're
trying to foster is trust, they know that we went to (a company's) offices" and
researched it.
</P>
<P>
	   Now that they've established themselves, the next goal is to try to sell
pennyPI's information to institutions, including securities dealers, stock
brokers and others.
</P>
<P>
	   "That way when you go to your local broker and tell him you've got a hot tip
from your brother-in-law, he'll have a reliable source of information," Ballard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Or, as is increasingly common, Ramsey said, investors going it alone through
an online brokerage will have the site's research for support.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's vital at this point that with online trading growing the way
it is, there be a source for that information," Ramsey said.

<HEADLINE> Marriott, Investors Reach Agreement  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLEY SHANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Marriott and investors suing the company over limited
partnerships formed in the 1980s have reached a tentative settlement under which
the hotel giant would buy back 120 Courtyard by Marriott inns for $372 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement also calls for Marriott International Inc. and Host Marriott
Corp. each to pay $31 million to end lawsuits involving certain limited
partnerships aside from the Courtyard by Marriott deals.
</P>
<P>
	   Marriott's lawyers unveiled key components of the agreement in court
Thursday, stressing at this point it remains non-binding.
</P>
<P>
	   It still must receive the formal approval of investors and the court.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for both sides characterized the deal as a "win-win" situation
providing liquidity for investors and value in the form of hotels for Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sense I get is the clients are thrilled to have liquidity," said David
Berg of Houston, lead plaintiffs' attorney. "I'm thrilled with the settlement,
and I think Marriott is and I hope it gets done."
</P>
<P>
	   Berg estimated the number of affected investors to be about 6,000 in six
different limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Settling the case in this way is preferable to a prolonged court fight, said
Arne Sorenson, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Marriott
International.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's old news," Sorenson said. "We're talking about something that happened
in the mid- to late '80s. We're glad to bring it to a close."
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement will result in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $30 million to
$40 million to Marriott International, Sorenson said, adding that after that
period it should have no impact on earnings per share. Host Marriott said it
would take a charge of between $40 million and $50 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the tentative deal arrived as attorneys were on the verge of going
to trial in one of the limited partnership disputes. Investors accused Marriott
of fraud and claimed the hospitality company sold hotel properties for inflated
prices, charged excessive management fees and presented unrealistic profit
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement calls for Marriott International and Host Marriott, through
an unconsolidated joint venture, to acquire the Courtyard by Marriott I and
Courtyard by Marriott II limited partnerships for $372 million. The two limited
partnerships own 120 hotels, which are managed by Marriott.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction would end those limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Marriott companies also would pay a combined $62 million to settle
limited partnership lawsuits involving two Residence Inn limited partnerships
and Fairfield Inn and Desert Springs limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   "The settlement is a complicated business transaction that involves the
repurchase of 120 hotels from two limited partnerships relating to Courtyard for
significant amounts of money," Richard Hoffman, an attorney for Marriott
International. "But it's the repurchase of assets by the company, it's not just
a payment of money to the plaintiffs to settle a fraud claim."
</P>
<P>
	   The repurchase of the Courtyard by Marriott inns will mean a profit for the
investors, Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each investor in the Courtyard by Marriott I Limited Partnership who put an
initial $100,000 into the deal in the late 1980s would receive about $135,000
after the hotels are sold and the partnership ends. That is above the $78,000 in
distributions the investors received over the life of the partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Courtyard by Marriott II Limited Partnership, each $100,000
investment will see $147,000 after the hotel sale. Investors had already
received $72,000 in previous distributions.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated amounts are subject to slight changes as details of the
settlement are worked out, attorneys said.

<HEADLINE> Future of Kosovo On the Line  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT H. REID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- The decision to send reinforcements to Kosovska
Mitrovica goes beyond the need to restore order in Kosovo's most turbulent city.
The province's future and the entire international peacekeeping effort are on
the line.
</P>
<P>
	   The stakes are enormous. All the major players -- NATO, the United Nations,
the Yugoslav government and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority -- have vital
interests in determining how events play out there.
</P>
<P>
	   If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic can hold on to any part of Kosovo,
which the United Nations recognizes as sovereign Yugoslav territory, the area
around Kosovska Mitrovica is his best shot. It is a prize worth gambling to
retain.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to three-quarters of Yugoslavia's entire mineral wealth is believed to
lie beneath the steep hills outside the city, which strides the Ibar River about
30 miles northwest of the provincial capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
	   The city and the villages to the north and east are home to the largest
community of Serbs left in the province -- a population perhaps as low as
25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Most Serbs fled Kosovo following the Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo under
terms of the June agreement which ended 78 days of relentless NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite Western goals of a multiethnic Kosovo, few Kosovo Albanians want to
see substantial numbers of Serbs remaining. The decision to send three
additional battalions of peacekeepers coincides with NATO plans to start
resettling ethnic Albanians in the Serb part of the city next week -- a move
Serbs oppose.
</P>
<P>
	   If NATO and the United Nations cannot build a multiethnic society in
Kosovska Mitrovica, they cannot do so anywhere in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Serbs, the Kosovska Mitrovica community affords the best chance for
a long-term, viable foothold in the province.
</P>
<P>
	   It is the only Serb enclave which borders the rest of Serbia -- 12 miles to
the north at the nearest point. Serbs in other, smaller enclaves must cross
Albanian-dominated territory to reach Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
	   Without a safe means of resupply from Serbia, the future of the other
enclaves is bleak.
</P>
<P>
	   The rugged terrain along the northern border, thinly guarded by Danish and
French troops, includes the best avenues for infiltrating Serb agents and
paramilitary police, some of whom are believed already there organizing tough
young Serbs who patrol the Serb-run north of Kosovska Mitrovica as a community
self-defense force.
</P>
<P>
	   For the ethnic Albanians, the stakes in Kosovska Mitrovica are equally high.
</P>
<P>
	   During the early stages of the 18-month conflict, many ethnic Albanian
leaders suspected that in case Milosevic failed to crush the rebellion, his
fallback position was to push for Kosovo's partition, keeping the north.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining surreptitious control through a viable Serb presence is his next
best option.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnic Albanians, however, cannot accept that. Without control of the
north, Kosovo is not a viable economic entity -- except perhaps for smuggling.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the province, historically Yugoslavia's least-developed area,
survives on subsistence farming or smallscale trading in an economy fueled with
money sent by Kosovo Albanians working in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Kosovska Mitrovica, however, is home to the giant Trepca complex, a
sprawling conglomerate of about 40 mines and factories headquartered in the
northern suburb of Zvecan.
</P>
<P>
	   Until the political turmoil which followed Milosevic cancellation of
Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, Trepca's mineral wealth, including gold, lead, zinc,
silver, cadmium and bismuth, was the foundation of Kosovo's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor unrest by ethnic Albanian miners was one of the reasons cited by
Milosevic when he revoked autonomy. Although conditions at Trepca and the main
Stari Trg mine have deteriorated, the complex could be revived with foreign
money.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Trepca exported $100 million worth of products, making it
Yugoslavia's largest export company. Apart from the mineral riches, some U.N.
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, suspect the complex was also used
by Milosevic and his clique for money-laundering abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Trepca's ownership is unclear. The United Nations suspects most shares
belong to the Serbian Development Fund, two government-run banks and the Serbian
electric company.
</P>
<P>
	   One month into the peacekeeping mission, a director of the French company
Societe Commerciale de Metaux et de Minereux claimed part ownership through
business ties to a Belgrade owner bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The French government did not support the claim. Nevertheless, it fueled
rumors among the ethnic Albanians that France insisted on sending its troops to
Kosovska Mitrovica to control Trepca in league with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   That soured France's image among many ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   A stronger claim has been laid by the Greek mining company Mytilineous
Holding, whose chairman, Evangelos Mytilineos, signed a seven-year $500 million
deal with Belgrade in 1997 to market Trepca's products.

<HEADLINE> Madagascar Cholera Epidemic Marred  </HEADLINE>
   By KATYA ROBINSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- Madagascar's battle against a cholera
epidemic is being complicated by a spat between the government of one of the
world's poorest countries and an acclaimed international aid agency.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 1,000 Malagasies -- as residents of this Indian Ocean island are
called -- have died since the epidemic erupted a year ago, according to official
figures. Most health officials believe the death toll is higher, even as the
government said Wednesday the epidemic is ``diminishing.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a battle on the sidelines, the Swiss section of Doctors Without Borders
announced Tuesday it was abandoning its cholera-fighting operations in the
country because the government refused it access to victims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The reason they gave (was) `We the people of Madagascar can care for our
own population,''' said Thomas Nierle, a Doctors Without Borders official. ``I
think it's a question of sovereignty. It's a lot of pride. It's almost
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
	   The government, for its part, made a similar accusation against Doctors
Without Borders, which won the Nobel Peace Prize last year for bringing medical
aid to conflict areas worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Doctors Without Borders) has treated us like a war-torn country with no
ability to conduct its own health initiatives, dictating what we do,'' Armand
Ralaidovy, the Health Ministry's coordinator for combating cholera, said in an
interview. ``Their statement was derogatory.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have more than 2,000 doctors. We have the health infrastructure,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ralaidovy said the government was ably handling the epidemic. But some of
the criticism has come from Madagascar's own doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, a local association of doctors known by its French acronym
SEDODIA called for Heath Minister Henriette Rahantalalao to resign, saying she
was bungling the handling of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after the epidemic broke out, the Ministry of Defense erected
roadblocks on major highways. All travelers were required to take heavy doses of
oral antibiotics in a move many critics said was ineffective and even dangerous.
Giving antibiotics to those without cholera serves no purpose, and raises the
general population's resistance to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   The roadblocks were taken down on Nov. 26, but were put back up a few weeks
ago and only travelers complaining of diarrhea were then given the antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
	   This Texas-sized island off southeast Africa is known to the 100,000-plus
tourists who visit annually for its unspoiled beaches, virgin rain forests and
sightings of lemurs and humpback whales. But behind the pristine attractions lie
poverty and unsanitary living conditions -- a breeding ground for cholera.
</P>
<P>
	   Only one in three people have access to clean water in Madagascar, the 13th
poorest nation on the planet. Only 3 percent have access to flush toilets. Most
even lack the money to buy charcoal to boil water, a critical step in preventing
cholera, an acute intestinal infection that causes copious diarrhea, which can
quickly lead to dehydration and death.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wednesday, 16 patients with severe diarrhea checked into the dim,
run-down Befelatanana Hospital in Antananarivo. A crowded roomful of listless
men, women and children were laid out on cots with IV cords dangling above them.
</P>
<P>
	   A notice in an office around the corner reminded medical personnel to
require relatives to take special precautions in burying the bodies of cholera
victims, to prevent more infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said about 50 cholera patients were in the hospital, down from more
than 100 in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Ministry said Wednesday the worst of the epidemic was over.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The outbreak has peaked and now is diminishing because of our
interventions,'' Ralaidovy said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nierle, who recently completed a 13-month tour of duty in Madagascar and
was interviewed by phone from Geneva, said there were no signs the epidemic was
slowing.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 18,809 suspected cholera cases have been identified in the past
year in Madagascar, the government said. A reported 1,070 people have died.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Earthquake Hits S. Pacific  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- A powerful earthquake hit the South Pacific on
Friday, but the magnitude 7.1 tremor was hundreds of miles from the nearest land
and very unlikely to have caused any damage, seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shallow quake struck in the afternoon at a point about halfway between
the island nations of Fiji and Vanuatu, said Mark Leonard of the Canberra-based
Australian Geological Survey Organization. Fiji and Vanuatu are more than 500
miles apart.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a big earthquake. A very big earthquake,'' he said. The quake was
likely to have caused a very small seismic wave, or tsunami, Leonard added.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is likely that the quake did break the ocean floor and cause a tsunami,
but if it did we would not expect it to be very big,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Appeals court stops visits between families in embryo mix-up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A fertility clinic mix-up lead to a woman giving birth
to another couple's baby - and now a Manhattan appeals court has suspended
court-ordered visits between the families.
<P>
	   The State Supreme Court's Appellate Division ruling stops the biweekly
visits ordered last month by Justice Diane Lebedeff last month. In June a
five-judge panel will hear arguments from both sides to determine whether the
visits should resume. The visits had gone on without formal court orders almost
since the boys were born.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Clair, the lawyer representing Deborah Perry-Rogers and Robert
Rogers of Teaneck, N.J., said he asked for the break in visitation because he
does not believe Lebedeff has the authority to order the visits between the
other couple - Donna and Richard Fasano of Staten Island - and the Rogers'
child.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Fasano, who is white, gave birth to two boys, one black and one white,
on Dec. 29, 1998, after a doctor implanted her with one of her own fertilized
eggs and - accidentally - with one belonging to Perry-Rogers.
</P>
<P>
	   Four months later, after DNA tests showed the black child was the Rogerses'
genetic son, the Fasanos relinquished custody of the child to the Rogerses
without a court fight.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mrs. Fasano set conditions. She wanted the boys to be raised to know
each other as brothers, and to visit together often.
</P>
<P>
	   Last July, Lebedeff declared the Rogerses the legal parents of the black
child, Akeil, who had been named Joseph when he was born to Mrs. Fasano along
with the white baby, Vincent.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the two couples worked out a visitation agreement and Lebedeff
approved it. But the couples did not get along.
</P>
<P>
	   After Lebedeff made a visitation schedule last month, Clair said he would
appeal. He said that after declaring the Rogerses Akeil's legal parents,
Lebedeff had no authority to order the child to visit anyone.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivan Tantleff, the Fasanos' lawyer, said he believes that Lebedeff did in
fact have the authority to order visitation. He's preparing a lawsuit for the
Fasanos accusing the Rogerses of breach of contract and fraud for failing to
live up to the agreement that gave them custody of Akeil.

   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Bush was admitted to a hospital with an
irregular heartbeat on Thursday after feeling ill at a reception, a spokesman
said. He was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   George Herbert Walker Bush, 75, had been on his feet for about 90 minutes at
a reception at the Registry Resort when he felt lightheaded, spokesman Jim
McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides sat him down and he claimed to feel better, McGrath said. He was
driven to the airport for a return flight to his Houston home, but still felt
ill and was taken to Naples Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   He was expected to be released on Friday, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
	   The career politician, diplomat and 41st president of the United States is
generally considered to be healthy. He suffered an irregular heartbeat during a
jog on May 4, 1991, and was found to have a thyroid condition called Graves
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In his youth, he also sat out one year of school at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., with a serious respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving office, Bush largely stayed out of the spotlight. He made
headlines in March 1997 when, at age 72, he made a successful parachute jump.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he had promised himself a jump for fun after a parachute jump
during World War II. He repeated the feat in June 1999, a few days shy of his
75th birthday.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors play tape of Sante Kimes' alleged attempt to con  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Prosecutors say Sante Kimes tried to get Irene
Silverman's social security number and later helped kill the millionaire because
she wanted her Manhattan mansion.
<P>
	   Jurors in the case of a mother and son on trial for killing the elderly
widow listened to a tape of the presumed victim refusing to give her Social
Security number to a telephone con woman.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape records the widow, Irene Silverman, receiving a telephone call in
late June of 1998 from a woman who tells Silverman she has won a four-day,
all-expenses-paid vacation to the Las Vegas casino-hotel, Circus Circus.
</P>
<P>
	   The casino caller, prosecutors said Thursday, is convicted scam artist Sante
Kimes, 65, who is on trial with her son Kenneth, 24, in Manhattan's State
Supreme Court on murder and other charges related to Silverman's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors - there are four at the trial - say the Kimeses became
frustrated that they could not get Silverman's home by trickery, and simply
killed her and created their own deed to the property.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the taped call was made by Sante Kimes to Silverman. In the
recording, the caller warns Silverman to sit down before delivering the good
news. She then tells Silverman that she need only give her Social Security
number and the casino will forward all the necessary paperwork for her to claim
her prize.
</P>
<P>
	   "So are you sitting down?" the caller asks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am. I am sitting down," replies Silverman, who is described by her
employees as sharp and wary. "I am also wondering what the catch is."
</P>
<P>
	   The caller tries to convince Silverman that "there is no catch" and says her
name was selected at random. She also tells Silverman she must use the prize
within two months and that only 50 people were so lucky.
</P>
<P>
	   "So how about a Social Security number?" the caller says.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know my number, to tell you the truth," Silverman responds.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to have the number to send you the information."
</P>
<P>
	   "Well, you send me whatever you have there, and if I like it, I will give
you my Social Security," Silverman says.
</P>
<P>
	   The caller congratulates Silverman, and hangs up.
</P>
<P>
	   When the Kimeses were arrested on July 5, 1998 - the last day Silverman was
seen alive - they had a bogus deed containing Silverman's forged signature which
purported to transfer ownership of the mansion to them.
</P>
<P>
	   Silverman rented out rooms in the mansion, running it as a high-class
boardinghouse-hotel for wealthy guests. The Kimeses had rented a room in the
house three weeks before Silverman disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the Kimeses killed Silverman because they wanted her
six-story, beaux-arts mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side, a home valued at
$4 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the phony deed, prosecutors say, the Kimeses were found with
Silverman's personal documents, keys, money, a recording of Silverman's
telephone conversations as well as several guns, knives, and knock-out drops.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With approval for a 5,500-strong observer mission for
Congo, the United Nations must now start the expensive and complex task of
deploying troops in a country the size of Western Europe but with virtually no
roads. Because of transport limitations, the United Nations is planning to rely
almost entirely on hundreds of airlifts to get the troops on the ground to start
monitoring Congo's faltering cease fire. The logistical planning was put into
high-gear following the Security Council's unanimous decision Thursday to
authorize 500 military observers to move into Congo and lay the groundwork for a

Thursday after Gov. George W. Bush rejected her claim that she killed her fifth
husband in self-defense and deserved a reprieve. Betty Lou Beets became the
fourth woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court in 1976
allowed the death penalty to resume. She was the second woman executed in Texas
since the Civil War. She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the
death chamber gurney. She made no eye contact with the victim's family, but
smiled at her attorney and a spiritual adviser watching through a window at her

Gulf Arab oil ministers who met the day before in Saudi Arabia agreed to a
production increase. Such a move could bring down oil prices, which have been
hovering near a nine-year high. The official said a production increase will be
gradual and will be in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6 percent

   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Bush was admitted to a hospital with an
irregular heartbeat on Thursday after feeling ill at a reception, a spokesman
said. He was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   George Herbert Walker Bush, 75, had been on his feet for about 90 minutes

</P>
<P>
	   Bush, a vigorous septuagenarian who has skydived, was expected to be
released on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush takes medication for heart problems, McGrath said. While he was
president, Bush had a similar episode in 1991, right after the Gulf War, and
spent two days in the hospital, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
	   The career politician, diplomat and 41st president of the United States
suffered an irregular heartbeat during a jog on May 4, 1991, and was found to
have Graves disease, the most common form of hyperthyroidism or an overactive
thyroid gland.

	   In his youth, Bush also sat out one year of school at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., with a serious respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
	   A less serious ailment -- a stomach flu -- contributed to one of Bush's most

<HEADLINE> Interest in No-Till Farming Rises  </HEADLINE>
    By ROXANA HEGEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Hillsboro farmer Rod Peters had put only six hours in
one season on his largest tractor when he decided to sell it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Six hours doesn't justify keeping a 175-horsepower tractor on the place,
but that is what I needed for tilling the soil," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago he owned four tractors, two disks, two cultivators and two
chisels. Now that he's adopted no-till farming all he needs is one smaller
tractor to pull his planter and drill, and a combine to harvest his increasingly
bountiful crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But even more important to his bottom line: One person can now farm the same
ground that it once took three people to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
	   In Clay Center, farmer Brian Martin switched to no-till farming seven years
ago. He figures he uses just a third of the amount of fuel farming today that he
did under conventional tillage. And with higher prices for diesel fuel -- now
hovering at around $1 a gallon for farm use -- it can make the difference
between a profitable or losing season at today's low crop prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggling farm economy -- as well as changes in the freedom-to-farm
bill which gave farmers more planting flexibility -- has driven a renaissance of
sorts for a practice long rooted in environmental and soil conservation causes.
</P>
<P>
	   No-till farming -- in its simplest terms, planting a new crop in the stubble
of previous crops without cultivating the land between plantings -- has rapidly
gained converts in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1989 Kansas had only 415,000 acres farmed under no-till practices. By
1998 that had grown to 2.3 million acres, about 11 percent of farmable acres in
the state, said Charles Atkinson, coordinator for the Kansas Crop Residue
Management Alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   He expects that number to grow another 10 percent in the coming year as
farmers who had been toying with the idea are swayed by high fuel prices into
finally making the move.
</P>
<P>
	   But here in wheat country, the increased popularity of no-till farming can
be traced back five years, when the freedom-to-farm bill gave farmers the
opportunity to diversify their crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers discovered they could double crop their farmland -- even in dry
western Kansas -- by planting row crops in the stubble of their winter wheat
crops or winter wheat in the residue left behind by their fall soybean harvest.
</P>
<P>
	   That is what Peters does on his farm ground. On the same spring day he
harvests his winter wheat crop, he runs a tractor drilling the seed for the
fall's milo crop into the wheat stubble. And Martin sows his wheat seed right
after harvesting his fall soybean crop, making the best use of the nitrogen left
behind by the soybeans.
</P>
<P>
	   As more Kansas farmers abandon the tillage practices used by generations of
farmers before them, they are also reaping some of the conservation and
environmental advantages such as erosion control long touted by no-till
advocates.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin said the biggest advantage of no-till farming for him has been the
added time he gets to spend with his family, even while holding down a
full-time, city job and farming 700 acres.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now we just plant and harvest, and eliminate everything in-between," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Court Latino Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By ERICA WERNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush says Spanish is ``muy bello.'' Vice
President Al Gore is running Spanish-language ads. Sen. John McCain is making
the rounds of Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Hispanic vote expected to be a critical element of California's
March 7 primary, the presidential candidates are coming and courting -- a clear
indication of the increased political profile of Latinos in the nation's most
populous state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've seen the writing on the walls for the past few years in terms of the
growing Hispanic population, the growing political clout,'' said Ingrid Duran,
executive director of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in Washington. ``Our
votes are truly up for grabs. ... We're voting as an educated bloc on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1996 presidential election, Hispanics made up 11.6 percent of
California voters. That's projected to increase to 13.4 percent this year,
according to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials,
which monitors Hispanic voting patterns nationwide. They accounted for 4.7
percent of voters nationwide in 1996, projected to increase to 5.4 percent this
year, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   In California and other states where they make up at least 10 percent of the
electorate -- Arizona, Florida, New Mexico and Texas -- Hispanics can be a
make-or-break voting bloc. The presidential candidates know that and are working
hard to earn their support.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush wasted no time after his losses Tuesday in Arizona and Michigan to
attend a ``town hall'' sponsored by the Univision television network in Los
Angeles the following day. Before a Hispanic audience, he described the Spanish
language as ``muy bello,'' or very beautiful. And he agreed to debate other
candidates on issues important to Hispanics, but ``solamente en espanol'' --
only in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, also a sometime Spanish speaker, began running Spanish-language ads in
California this week. Rep. Luis V. Gutierrez, D-Ill., introduced Bill Bradley's
immigration platform at the Mexican Cultural Institute on Thursday. McCain meets
with Hispanic groups when he visits the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders say Hispanic voters have the same concerns as other groups:
education, health care, and economic advancement. Immigration and wage issues
can be of particular concern, and Hispanics tend to be socially conservative and
can respond to appeals to values, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush ``makes an appeal on the basis of values, Democrats would do it on the
basis of programs,'' said Gregory Rodriguez, a Los Angeles resident who attended
Bush's town hall Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics traditionally have backed Democrats. President Clinton got 72
percent of the Hispanic vote in 1996 compared with Bob Dole's 21 percent. Ronald
Reagan's 44 percent in 1984 from Hispanic voters remains the high-water mark for
a GOP presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   California represents a particularly tough test for Republicans, since many
Hispanics here remain bitter over former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's backing
of anti-immigration measures like Proposition 187, which sought to end
government benefits for illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush is well-liked by Hispanics at home in Texas, and is viewed as
almost the antithesis of Wilson. Bush has spoken out against the ``spirit of
187'' and, unlike Wilson, embraces relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   His backers insist that if any Republican can take California, Bush can.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On the issues he's right on target with Hispanic voters. I just think he's
a natural fit for the state,'' said Republican Rep. David Dreier, co-chairman of
Bush's California campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Others say no amount of Spanish-language forums, ads or one-on-ones with
Spanish-speaking journalists can do it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure that anyone yet can overcome the Republican stigma,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst. ``It's still too close to Pete Wilson
and Proposition 187.''
</P>
<P>
	   A poll last month of California Hispanics gave Gore a wide margin -- 56
percent to 26 percent -- over Bush. The survey of 604 registered Hispanic voters
statewide by the nonpartisan Tomas Rivera Policy Institute at Claremont Graduate
University had a 4 percent margin of error.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore seems to benefit from his connection with the Clinton administration,
which remains well-liked by Hispanics. He also has the backing of most
high-placed Hispanic officials in California, like Los Angeles County Supervisor
Gloria Molina.

<HEADLINE> Defense: No proof doctor wanted to 'line his pockets with money'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Park Avenue practice of a prominent fertility doctor
accused of cheating insurance companies of more than $2 million became a target
of prosecutors talented at false accusation and distortion, his lawyer says.
<P>
	   "He's innocent," Theodore D. Wells said of his client, Dr. Niels Lauersen.
"He didn't steal any money. He didn't break any laws. He is not a criminal."
</P>
<P>
	   Wells criticized the prosecution as he delivered closing arguments Thursday
in the trial of the 63-year-old obstetrician and gynecologist and Dr. Magda
Binion, an anesthesiologist who worked for him.
</P>
<P>
	   They are charged with conspiracy, health care fraud and mail fraud in
connection with a scheme to falsely bill fertility surgeries that were not
covered by insurance. The jury in Manhattan was expected to begin deliberations
today.
</P>
<P>
	   "False accusation and distortion is what this prosecution is. There is
insanity in this prosecution. This is the biggest bunch of bull I've ever seen,"
Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his closing, Assistant U.S. Attorney James G. Cavoli warned jurors not to
get distracted by the "high volume defense."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Lauersen lied repeatedly on insurance forms, forcing companies to
pay for surgical procedures that were never performed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The scope of the fraud: 10 years, hundreds of procedures, millions of
dollars," Cavoli said. "Ninety-five percent of the time, the operative reports
were outright lies."
</P>
<P>
	   The two allegedly claimed the operations were gynecological - a definition
that would allow them to be covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells said there had been no evidence that his client "told lies to line his
pockets with money."
</P>
<P>
	   Binion's lawyer, Harlan A. Levy, told the jurors that if they find Lauersen
committed no fraud, then the case against his client must fail as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, the author of "It's Your Body," has appeared frequently on
television and in publications as an expert on fertility matters, which make up
about 10 percent of his practice.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavoli said the conspiracy started in 1987 as Lauersen falsely charged
insurance companies $7,500 at least 500 times, collecting at least $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Cavoli told the jury it was a "simple, simple case" showing that Lauersen
for years billed fertility procedures as emergency gynecological operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is the fraud. It is really that simple. The reason they did it is also
simple. They did it to make money, millions of dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wells, though, said his client was "in a different world" than other Park
Avenue doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a Park Avenue practice that treated everybody, everybody who came -
rich, poor, working class, middle class. And if the poor came, what you heard
is, the poor got treated for free," Wells said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This man worked day and night to treat sick people," the lawyer said. "When
he wasn't working, he was writing books, writing books on women's health issues.
That was his passion."
</P>
<P>
	   He reminded jurors of one defense witness, a Lauersen employee who said she
called insurance companies 15 years ago and was instructed to fill out insurance
forms the way Lauersen always did, billing only for emergency gynecological
procedures with no mention of fertility procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "When she testified to that, it was like one of those stakes on one of those
vampire movies that have been put through the heart of the vampire," Wells said.
"There was blood all over the floor. The case was over."

<HEADLINE> Bush Targets Tobacco Country  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL TOLME Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush is targeting tobacco country,
the military-dominated Norfolk area and northern Virginia in his bid to defeat
Sen. John McCain in Virginia's Republican presidential primary on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   In tobacco-growing southern Virginia, Bush supporters are chastising the
Arizona senator for supporting tax increases on cigarettes. Voters in the
Newport News-Norfolk area, home of the world's largest Navy installation, are
being told of McCain's opposition to the Seawolf submarine.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Washington suburbs, McCain is being attacked for trying to increase
flights into Reagan National Airport, which some northern Virginians say is
noisy enough already.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign hopes the regional attacks, combined with support from Gov.
Jim Gilmore and much of Virginia's GOP establishment, will bring a resounding
victory following losses in Republican presidential primaries this week Michigan
and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls have shown Bush with a comfortable lead in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey today by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research Inc. showed Bush with 48
percent support, compared with 37 percent for McCain. Alan Keyes was at 3
percent. The statewide poll of likely primary voters had a margin of error of
plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor was campaigning across the state today, with stops in
Newport News near Norfolk on the Atlantic coast, America Online in northern
Virginia and later in Richmond. His father, former President Bush, visited
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``George W. Bush is the candidate most in line with traditional Republican
values,'' said Steve Katsurinas, Bush's co-chairman in Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign counters that Gilmore and the state's GOP establishment
are seeking to ram Bush down the throats of Virginians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Bush folks strike me as a little smug. They assume they have won
here,'' said Dennis Peterson, executive director of McCain's Virginia campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Far from hurting him, McCain's votes to trim excess military spending and
curb tobacco use by minors should show voters that he is courageous, supporters
say. His service as a Navy pilot and the more than 5 1/2 year he spent in a
Vietnamese prison camp also show his toughness, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   But most agree McCain faces an uphill battle here.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ultimately, his problem in Virginia is he has no organization, and what
organization there is is very amateurish,'' said Stephen Medvic, an Old Dominion
University political science professor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also has locked up all of the state's high-profile GOP politicians,
including Gilmore, former governor George Allen, Sen. John Warner and Rep. Tom
Davis. Attorney General Mark L. Earley plans to announce his support for Bush
today during the Newport News visit.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When one party from the governor on down decides to get something done, it
usually gets done here,'' Medvic said. ``It's not a state where people have a
history of bucking trends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia's primary is similar to those in New Hampshire and Michigan in that
it is open to all registered voters, and support from non-Republicans pushed
McCain to victory in those states.
</P>
<P>
	   But those who want to participate in Tuesday's primary must sign a pledge
agreeing not to take part in any other party's presidential nominating process.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush supporters argue that he has the support of the party faithful, while
McCain is reaching out to Democrats and others who want to trip up Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bush also is trying to win the support of Virginia veterans. A
campaign brochure mailed to Virginians shows him in his Texas Air National Guard
uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has begun running TV ads in northern Virginia touting himself as
a conservative in the spirit of Ronald Reagan, was considering a Monday
appearance in the veteran-rich Norfolk area.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also is on the local airwaves with ads criticizing McCain for comparing
him to President Clinton and touting himself as a ``leader and reformer who gets
results.''

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mark Watson scored in the 68th minute as Canada beat
Trinidad and Tobago 1-0 Thursday night and became champion of soccer's North and
Central American and Caribbean region for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   Although it was only a semifinal of the CONCACAF Gold Cup, the region's
biennial championship, Canada's opponent in Sunday's final is Colombia, a South
American team invited to the 12-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada, which hasn't qualified for the World Cup since 1986, earned a spot
in the next FIFA Confederations Cup, which is for the champions of Europe, South
America, Africa, Asia, Oceania and the CONCACAF region.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're like the Bad News Bears," said Canada's Carlo Corazzin, the
tournament's leading scorer with three goals. "We just keep winning. We played
poorly. Sometimes the best team doesn't win. On this day, they were a better
team but we won."
</P>
<P>
	   With no Latin American team to draw fans, the game was attended by only
about 2,800 on a cool night in the 92,000-seat Los Angeles Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
	   Watson scored on a header off Carlo Corazzin's assist. The play began when
Davide Xausa sent a corner kick to James Brennan. Canada, ranked 85th in the
world, extended its unbeaten streak to 10 games (6-0-4). Trinidad and Tobago,
ranked 49th, outshot the Canadians 22-13.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada goalkeeper Craig Forrest, who plays for West Ham United in England's
Premier League, stopped David Nakhid's penalty kick in the 3th minute after
Watson knocked down Jarren Nixon just in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico and the United States, the top powers in the region, were eliminated
in the quarterfinals. Canada beat Mexico and Colombia defeated the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Canadiens 3, Devils 2, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Benoit Brunet and the Montreal Canadiens had some nervous
moments before they could celebrate their overtime victory over the New Jersey
Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet scored on a power play 58 seconds into overtime as the Canadiens
extended their season-high winning streak to seven games with a 3-2 victory over
New Jersey on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Brunet batted the puck out of the air past goalie Martin Brodeur. The goal
was reviewed to see if the Canadiens forward made contact with the puck above
the level of the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it's long like that sometimes you think that they're going to refuse
it because it's close, but that wasn't the case," Brunet said. "I thought it was
good.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's easy to say now but I waited -- I don't know if I waited long enough
-- and I think my stick was lower than the crossbar when I made contact, but
you're never sure in the thick of the action like that."
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadiens, 13-4-2 since Jan. 11, moved within two points of the eighth
and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. New Jersey, tied for the
overall NHL lead, has lost three straight and is winless in four games.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't really see it," Brodeur said of the deciding goal. "I guess it was
really, really close and when you're in a different building, the close calls
are always going to go to the home team.
</P>
<P>
	   "But it was fairly close and we put ourselves into a jam, having to kill a
penalty in overtime."
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal captain Saku Koivu set up the winner with a shot that caromed off
Brodeur's stick into the air as the Canadiens exerted pressure following a
penalty to Randy McKay with nine seconds left in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   "Koivu made a spin-o-rama, I went down, it hit the paddle of my stick and
went straight up," Brodeur said. "The next thing you know I heard the puck hit a
stick and it went right by me."
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal's Jeff Hackett made 21 saves for his sixth straight victory. The
Canadiens have allowed just five goals in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal's Sergei Zholtok scored his 20th goal of the season midway through
the third period to tie it at 2. Zholtok, who also assisted on Martin Rucinsky's
power-play goal late in the second period, beat Brodeur from the slot.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a solid, solid effort," Zholtok said. "It was a really emotional
game for us. The fans were on our side and helped us create the momentum to tie
it and win it in OT.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm really proud about the character the team is showing in coming back.
That's a huge two points."
</P>
<P>
	   Petr Sykora gave New Jersey a 2-1 lead on a power play 6:51 into the third
with his 18th of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Nemchinov opened the scoring for New Jersey at 4:29 of the second
with his eighth goal. Rucinsky tied it with his 19th on a goal-mouth scramble
with 32 seconds left in the second period.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks moved slightly higher Friday, unaffected by an
overnight fall on Wall Street. The dollar slipped against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 19,817.88 points, up
246.44 points, or 1.26 percent. On Thursday, the average closed up 51.89 points,
or 0.27 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.94 yen, down 0.12 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 111.06 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei fluctuated in a narrow range between
negative and positive territory amid caution about the direction of U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   But buying of some high technology issues and major department store stocks
pushed the index into positive territory before the end of the morning session.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders said the market's downside was supported by hopes for buying from
newly established investment trust funds and the overnight record close in the
technology-rich Nasdaq Composite Index in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 133.41 points to
10,092.63 amid worries about rising interest rates. At one point, it briefly
fell below 10,000 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, however, finished up 67.32 points at 4,617.65, reaching a new
closing high for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section finished at 1,724.50 points, up 34.45 points, or 2.04 percent. The TOPIX
closed up 22.81 points, or 1.37 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar moved lower Friday morning as
some investors covered short, or oversold, yen positions in the absence of major
market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.88 yen, down from 110.84 yen
late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.8750
percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8700 percent. Its price fell 0.05 point to
99.36.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers pay respects to Diallo as they await verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - As a jury considers murder charges against the four
police officers who gunned down Amadou Diallo last year, a steady stream of New
Yorkers paid homage to the West African immigrant by making a pilgrimage to the
apartment house vestibule where he died.
<P>
	   Diallo's death in February 1999 spurred angry, but peaceful demonstrations.
Now the mood in Diallo's Bronx neighborhood is one of sadness and cynicism over
the fairness of the trial. On Wednesday, religious leaders in the Bronx held a
service to urge calm when the verdict is announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Some who came Thursday, like Edmund White, took pictures of the Bronx
apartment building vestibule where the officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo. It
was White's first visit to the two-story brick building, where the front steps
have become an outdoor shrine.
</P>
<P>
	   "The jury should have been here to see this for themselves," said White, in
his 50s, adding that he was struck by how small the vestibule was and how close
it was to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
	   "They (the cops) could have just about touched him as he stood here," White,
a Bronx resident, added as he continued to snap pictures of messages written to
Diallo on the vestibule's yellow walls.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to show these to my future grandchildren," he said as he got back
into his car.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury began was to begin its third day of deliberations today in Albany,
150 miles north, where the trial was moved for fear the police officers could
not get a fair trial in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, 37, Edward McMellon, 27, Kenneth Boss, 28, and
Richard Murphy, 27, have each pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. The
defense claims Diallo ignored the officers' repeated orders to halt, pulled out
a black object in a threatening manner and remained on his feet as bullets flew.
The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   More messages have been written in the weeks since the trial began.
</P>
<P>
	   "God Sees Everything," wrote one person.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to see this for myself. I drove from Manhattan. If his family reads
this my condolences go out to you. May his soul rest in peace," signed Joyce and
family.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the vestibule, a cardboard "tombstone" was taped to the building. It
featured this Daily News headline: "Deadly Barrage. Doc: Cops kept shooting
after Diallo was dead." A drawing depicting where the 19 bullets hit Diallo was
on the tombstone, as well as newspaper photos of the four officers, with the
number of times they fired at Diallo circled above their heads.
</P>
<P>
	   Bouquets of flowers, candles and signs adorned the building's front. A small
yellow teddy bear encased in plastic was holding a note: "We cry tears of
blood," signed Angela and Tyrone of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan and Maria Melendez paused in front of the tombstone, and touched it,
whispering prayers in Spanish. The elderly couple lives about three blocks from
Diallo's building, but this was their first visit to the spot.
</P>
<P>
	   "May God protect his family," Mrs. Melendez said. "And may there be justice
for him, and peace for this neighborhood."
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of the people who came by Thursday believed the officers would
not be convicted on any charges. And most believed the neighborhood residents
would not riot.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are expecting the cops to be found innocent, because that's the way the
system is stacked - against all people of color," said Michael Robinson, 33, who
lives several blocks from the crime scene and rode his bike to the building.
"But we won't riot because we know that's what (Mayor Rudolph) Giuliani wants us
to do."
</P>
<P>
	   But brothers Carlos and Edwin Semprit believe if the cops are acquitted, the
neighborhood will erupt in anger.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cops shot to kill," said Carlos Semprit, 32, who lives in Diallo's
neighborhood. "There's no justification for what they did."
</P>
<P>
	   "And what if the tables were turned?" asked Edwin Semprit, 29. "What if four
of us had shot a cop. We'd be facing the death penalty. It's not fair."

<HEADLINE> Virginia Voters Must Sign Pledge  </HEADLINE>
   By BOB LEWIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- After using Democrats and independents to triumph in
Michigan's open Republican primary, Sen. John McCain is facing a Virginia GOP
contest that requires voters to sign a party pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls showed that more than half of the voters in Michigan's primary
Tuesday were not Republicans, and they strongly favored McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia, which does not require voters to register by party affiliation,
also will let any registered voter in. But to receive a ballot, each person must
sign a pledge not to take part in another party's presidential nominating
process.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign disdains the oath and will recommend that Democrats and
independents sign it and vote for the Arizona senator on Tuesday. There is no
provision in state law for enforcing the pledge and no penalty for violating it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're telling people it is an attempt by the Republican Party to limit
voting, and we also tell them they can sign that doggone thing with no qualms
whatever,'' said Paul Galanti, state campaign director for McCain. ``It has no
bearing on anyone unless you're a delegate to the state or national Democratic
convention.''
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Democrats will choose their delegates to the national convention
through a system of regional spring caucuses leading up to a state convention in
June.
</P>
<P>
	   Trey Walker, McCain's national field director, put the issue in a more
historical perspective: ``Any time you get into swearing an oath -- especially
in the South -- at a polling location, it brings back a lot of unsavory
memories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign supports the pledge in open primary states, since Bush has
fared best among Republicans in the earlier contests, exit polls show.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a Republican primary, and the nominee of the Republican Party
should be decided by people who have a stake in the party and will be willing to
fight for their nominee against Al Gore in November,'' said Quintin Kendall,
Bush's Virginia campaign director.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the sake of political expediency, John McCain is doing whatever it
takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
	   Outsiders meddling in Republican primaries have vexed the state GOP before,
especially its conservatives. When the Republican right sought to punish Sen.
John W. Warner in the 1996 primary for turning his back two years earlier on GOP
senatorial nominee Oliver North, independents and Democrats crossed over and
helped Warner bury the conservatives' choice, former Reagan administration
budget director James C. Miller.

<HEADLINE> US Kosovo Reinforcements Considered  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. Marine contingent is standing by in the
Mediterranean Sea as a potential reinforcement for NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo,
but the Pentagon says there has been no request to send them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We and other countries will decide how to respond to a specific request,
but there has not been a specific request yet,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth
Bacon said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Expanding the U.S. troop presence in Kosovo would raise the risk for a force
that has largely escaped casualties. Members of Congress are worried about
putting more American soldiers in harm's way. But NATO feels it cannot let the
flare-up of ethnic violence in the city of Mitrovica go unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen has said he expects the Mitrovica problem to
be resolved shortly, possibly without U.S. reinforcements. France, whose
peacekeepers are in charge of the ethnically divided Mitrovica, is preparing to
send 600 to 700 more troops to the city.
</P>
<P>
	   The NATO's chief commander, U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, requested the extra
French troops and asked NATO's political authorities for the go-ahead to put
about 1,200 other troops on a higher state of alert for possible deployment.
Among these other troops are the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials were to meet on the matter today at alliance headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether to send Marines is an ``open question,'' White House press secretary
Joe Lockhart said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We support the request General Clark has made,'' Lockhart told reporters.
``We take this mission very seriously and we will take the appropriate steps to
deter any further violence.''
</P>
<P>
	   The approximately 5,300 American troops now on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo
are in a U.S.-controlled sector in the southeastern part of the Serb province,
where the ethnic tension is less intense. While eight Americans have died there
since peacekeeping began in June, none of the deaths resulted from hostile
action.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left open the
possibility of more American troops, but noted the United States already has the
biggest contingent. For now, it would be up to the Europeans to add troops, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill, lawmakers expressed concern at the prospect of deepening
U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm gravely concerned about the increasing risks to the men and women of
our armed forces,'' said the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Republican John Warner of Virginia. His committee held a two-hour closed door
briefing with top Pentagon officials Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said that while
President Clinton does not need formal congressional approval to send more
troops to Kosovo, ``I think Congress needs to be involved in terms of
oversight.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials say the best solution would be to rapidly increase the number
of trained international police for Kosovo because military peacekeepers are not
well suited for a criminal justice role.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must recognize that old models of peacekeeping don't also meet current
challenges,'' Albright said. She said Clinton had ordered the State Department
to create an office responsible for issues associated with U.S. participation in
the criminal justice aspects of peace operations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plan May Boost HIV Benefits  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is allowing Maine to extend
Medicaid coverage to people with HIV, after years of saying it would be too
expensive to cover all the infected Americans who don't have full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicaid usually covers people with AIDS because they are disabled and
unable to work and does not apply to HIV-infected people who don't show
symptoms. But expensive AIDS-fighting drugs are effective when used before
people get sick.
</P>
<P>
	   Maine would be the first state to offer "people living with HIV access to
promising therapies," Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said.
Several other states are looking at offering a similar plan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Better research, prevention and treatment is helping people with this
disease live longer, healthier lives, even as we continue our search for a
cure," Shalala said Thursday at a conference on black people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago the Clinton administration rejected a proposal to extend
Medicaid to cover people with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, because it would
be too expensive -- an estimated $3 billion to $9 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis Finnegan, Maine's Medicaid director, said that without the new plan,
"the Medicaid program was in the untenable position of having to wait until
someone grew so sick with AIDS that they became disabled" before treatment and
drugs could be made available.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's five-year demonstration project begins in September. To be
eligible, a participant must be HIV-positive and have an income of less than
about $25,000, which is three times the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the plan, only children, pregnant women and the elderly or disabled
with incomes below the poverty level were eligible for assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Maine would have spent about $56 million over the next five years to care
for HIV-positive patients under the old standards, according to federal and
state estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   To receive approval for their new approach, the state drafted a plan that
wouldn't cost any more by limiting the number of recipients in the demonstration
program, getting discounts from drug companies and having a benefit package
tailored for people infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   The benefits include drug therapy, office visits, lab services, case
management, hospitalizations, mental health and substance abuse services.
</P>
<P>
	   "Research was able to show conclusively that it is less expensive for the
state to pay for preventative measures that control HIV than it is to wait for
the disease to progress to full-blown AIDS," Maine Gov. Angus King said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 1,300 Maine residents are infected with HIV and 350 have AIDS,
according to the Maine Bureau of Health. The new waiver will allow the state to
offer treatment to about 300 people who couldn't otherwise afford it.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the early intervention is expected to reduce the need for
costly hospitalization and prevent additional infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, about 900,000 people are infected with HIV, a third of those
with full-blown AIDS, said Kathryn Bina, a spokeswoman for the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of those whose HIV hasn't progressed
into AIDS, about 200,000 people, don't know they have the disease, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Claudia French, acting executive director of AIDS Action, a national AIDS
support group, said more states need to adopt such a plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's announcement will prolong the lives of low-income Mainers with
HIV," French said. "But we want all HIV-positive Americans to have access to
drugs that could keep them from developing full-blown AIDS."

<HEADLINE> Study Looks at Health of Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
    By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government study on the health of Hispanics living in
the United States shows that Puerto Ricans fare worse than other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The four-year study released today by the National Center for Health
Statistics showed that Puerto Ricans reported being sick more often than
Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans and others of Hispanic descent. They had more
doctors' visits, hospital stays and sick days off from work and school than
other Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
	   "The health indicators for Puerto Rican persons are significantly worse than
for other Hispanic-origin subgroups," said Anjum Hajat, the study's author.
</P>
<P>
	   The study is the government's first effort to look at health differences
among Hispanic groups after the explosive growth in the nation's Hispanic
population over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 30 million people of Hispanic origin reside in the United States,
representing 11 percent of the population. That's up 36 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Other studies have shown that as a group Hispanics lag in many areas of
health. Diabetes, AIDS and depression are major health problems for Hispanics.
Recent studies have shown that a fourth of the 44 million people without health
insurance are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, which looked at data from a national health survey of all
Americans collected from 1992 through 1995, focused on the largest Hispanic
subgroups: Mexicans, who make up 63 percent of all Hispanics; Puerto Ricans, who
represent 11 percent; and Cubans, 4 percent. Another 22 percent of people of
Hispanic origins other than those three were grouped together.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also found:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Eighteen percent of Puerto Ricans reported being in fair or poor health,
compared with 16 percent of Mexicans, 14 percent of Cubans and 12 percent of
other Hispanic groups.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Eighty-three percent of Puerto Ricans reported seeing a doctor in the
past year, compared with 78 percent of Cubans, 77 percent of other Hispanics and
69 percent of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Puerto Ricans reported being sick more than the other groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanic health experts warned that the study, which isolated Hispanics'
data out of a general study of Americans' health, could mask important health
information about Hispanics and reinforce stereotypes that Hispanics, because
they tend to have lower incomes than other Americans, are in poorer health.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, Hispanics live longer on average than whites, and Hispanic women
have lower rates of breast cancer but more cervical cancer than non-Hispanic
women, according to the National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services
Organizations, a Washington-based advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kind of data used is missing the bigger issues," said Jane Delgado,
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was based on interviews with 36,924 Mexican-Americans, 6,922
Puerto Ricans living in the United States, 3,008 Cuban-Americans and 13,865
people of other Hispanic origin.
</P>
<P>
	   The Puerto Ricans surveyed were those living in the United States, not those
living in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Body of man found inside Manhattan restaurant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Police continued their investigation into the murder of
a man found with his throat slashed inside a Manhattan restaurant.
<P>
	   The man had been stabbed numerous times - a meat cleaver was found atop his
body, and a 12-inch carving knife at his side Thursday. But Police Capt. Robert
Iovino said police were not certain if those items were used in the murder.
Iovino described the scene as "pretty bloody."
</P>
<P>
	   No arrests had been made by early today and police did not comment on a
motive. Iovino said the victim had not yet been positively identified by family
members.
</P>
<P>
	   However, identification found on the victim showed that he was Nicola
Orobello, 62, of Flushing, Queens, said a police source, speaking on condition
of anonymity. Business records showed that the Upper East Side restaurant -
Erminia - was owned by Orobello.
</P>
<P>
	   Two women identified by employees at the scene as Orobello's mother and wife
were described as hysterical as they entered the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   The victim was found at 11:30 a.m., when a linen delivery man discovered the
body in the rear of the restaurant in the kitchen area as he pushed open an
unlocked door at the East 83rd Street location, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately known how long the victim had been dead. Police were
investigating whether he had been in the restaurant late Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Erminia, a 15-year-old restaurant, specializes in Italian cuisine. The
Zagat's restaurant guide describes it as a tiny, intimate hideaway with
excellent food "worth every penny for that much romance."
</P>
<P>
	   "At least one engagement" would occur per night, the guide added.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanley Poll, 60, was outside the restaurant Thursday and said he dines
there a few times a year. He called Erminia a "romantic hideaway," and spoke
highly of Orobello.
</P>
<P>
	   "He made you feel like you were somebody special," Poll said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Judge hands legal victory to a Manhattan couple in their battle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Internal Revenue Service taxed the nerves of a
federal judge when it sued a couple who had overpaid $10,000 in taxes, claiming
they were not entitled to the money because they filed a document three days
late.
<P>
	   "Beset by budget cuts, our federal tax collectors have chosen to focus on
cases that really count," U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff wrote with sarcasm
in a ruling throwing out the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision, made public Thursday, was a victory for Susan Lesinski and
Peter McGrath, who were married in the early 1990s but later separated.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff said the IRS brought the case because it believed the couple had
filed three days late for a refund of the approximately $10,000 they had
overpaid on $58,000 in estimated taxes for 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the IRS wanted "to recover monies to which it was never entitled in
the first place."
</P>
<P>
	   "As it turns out, however, what the lawsuit lacks in equity or common sense,
it more than makes up in absence of legal merit," Rakoff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rakoff threw out the case even though he had been asked by the IRS to
immediately rule in its favor prior to trial.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he could do so because all relevant issues had been argued by both
sides in legal papers "ad nauseum and no surprises remain."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said the legal issues overwhelmingly favored the couple.
</P>
<P>
	   Louise Kaminskyj, an IRS spokeswoman, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Lesinski and McGrath did not immediately return telephone messages at their
residences.

<HEADLINE> Gravano's old enemies: We told you so  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - John Gotti hadn't heard the news yet: his
sidekick-turned-stool pigeon, Sammy "The Bull" Gravano, was back in trouble with
the law.
<P>
	   But word of Gravano's arrest would not surprise the Dapper Don, said defense
lawyer Bruce Cutler, echoing the chorus of "I told you so" coming from Gravano's
hometown after the Mafia killer's Arizona arrest on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was waiting for this," Cutler said Thursday in his Manhattan office. "You
can't change the nature of a man. ... He is a reprobate, a craven liar. Gravano
is motivated only by greed. I guess he didn't steal enough before."
</P>
<P>
	   That's before he entered the federal witness protection program, which the
Brooklyn-born Gravano did in the spring of 1995 after testifying against Gotti
in a trial that ended with the Gotti being sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Gravano, who admitted killing 19 people, wound up with just a 5-year jail
sentence because of his deal with the government. His testimony eventually led
to the convictions of three dozen mobsters, including Genovese family boss
Vincent "The Chin" Gigante.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler ripped Gravano as "the great impostor, a liar, a coward." He later
condemned the former Gambino family underboss as "a Tasmanian devil, full of
lies."
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Ron Kuby, who represents the families of Gravano's 19 murder
victims in an ongoing civil suit, said it was no surprise that the career
criminal had allegedly returned to his illegal ways.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of that nonsense about Gravano being reformed, repudiating his criminal
ways, was just another scam to get over, just as Sammy Gravano has done
successfully his entire adult life," Kuby said.
</P>
<P>
	   The families of Gravano's murder victims filed suit under New York's "Son of
Sam" law, looking to seize profits from the killer's biography, "Underboss." The
law prevents criminals from making a profit on their crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal authorities who cut Gravano his deal had little to say about the
former underboss' alleged recidivism.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have nothing to do with him," said FBI spokesman Joe Valiquette. Former
U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney, whose office prosecuted Gotti, did not return a
call for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Cutler said he planned to call Gotti at the federal prison in Marion, Ill.,
to pass on word of Gravano's arrest - hopefully in the next week. But Cutler
predicted that the ex-head of the Gambino family would not delight in the fall
of his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only concern John Gotti would have about this," Cutler said with a
straight face, "is concern about the teenagers who were buying those pills."

<HEADLINE> Former President Bush Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Bush was admitted to a hospital with an
irregular heartbeat on Thursday after feeling ill at a reception, a spokesman
said. He was kept overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
	   George Herbert Walker Bush, 75, had been on his feet for about 90 minutes
during an investors conference at the Registry Resort when he felt lightheaded,
spokesman Jim McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides sat him down and he said he felt better, McGrath said. Bush was driven
to the airport for a return flight to his Houston home, but still felt ill. His
doctor, contacted by phone, suggested Bush be taken to a hospital as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   McGrath said Bush walked into the Naples Community Hospital on his own.
Bush, a vigorous septuagenarian who has skydived, was expected to be released on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush takes medication for heart problems, McGrath said. While he was
president, Bush had a similar episode in 1991, right after the Gulf War, and
spent two days in the hospital, McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
	   The career politician, diplomat and 41st president of the United States also
suffered an irregular heartbeat during a jog on May 4, 1991, and was found to
have Graves disease, the most common form of hyperthyroidism or an overactive
thyroid gland.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Barbara, also has Graves disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In his youth, Bush also sat out one year of school at Phillips Academy in
Andover, Mass., with a serious respiratory illness.
</P>
<P>
	   A less serious ailment -- a stomach flu -- contributed to one of Bush's most
well known incidents. He collapsed and vomited during a 1992 state dinner in
Tokyo, but recovered quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving office, Bush largely stayed out of the spotlight. He made
headlines in March 1997 when, at age 72, he made a successful parachute jump.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he had promised himself a jump for fun after a parachute jump
during World War II. He repeated the feat in June 1999, a few days shy of his
75th birthday.

U.N. OKs Troop Commitment for Congo

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With approval for a 5,500-strong observer mission for
Congo, the United Nations must now start the expensive and complex task of
deploying troops in a country the size of Western Europe but with virtually no

almost entirely on hundreds of airlifts to get the troops on the ground to start
monitoring Congo's faltering cease fire. The logistical planning was put into

authorize 500 military observers to move into Congo and lay the groundwork for a

fourth woman to be executed in the United States since the Supreme Court in 1976

since the Civil War. She gave no final statement as she lay strapped to the

Gulf Nations OK Oil Production Hike

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Persian Gulf oil ministers have agreed
to increase production of crude to stabilize prices around the world, but have
not decided how much -- leaving it unclear whether consumers will find relief at
the gas pumps. A senior United Arab Emirates oil official said Thursday that
Gulf Arab oil ministers who met the day before in Saudi Arabia agreed to a
production increase. Such a move could bring down oil prices, which have been
hovering near a nine-year high. The official said a production increase will be
gradual and will be in the range of 1.5 million barrels a day, or 6 percent
above current levels.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: two men made more than $1 million through cyber stock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two men charged with securities fraud by federal
prosecutors used Internet e-mails to trick investors into buying the stock of
troubled companies, authorities said.
<P>
	   James Sheret Jr. and Glenn Conley made more than $1 million in three months
spent littering the Internet with hundreds of thousands of e-mails touting lousy
investments as solid prospects, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the dark side of the Internet," White said in a statement.
"Determined fraudsters can swindle a virtual audience by taking large positions
in thinly traded stocks, disseminating hundreds of thousands of Spam e-mails
touting these stocks and then sell them into the fraudulently inflated market
they have created."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the method of cheating investors was similar to what goes on in
so-called boiler rooms, where dozens of stock brokers at a time pitch stocks to
investors to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the boiler room scam "takes on a new dimension because of the
ability online to reach thousands, if not millions, of investors with a single
keystroke."
</P>
<P>
	   "Whether people commit these crimes in cyberspace or in office space, we
will identify them, we will find them and we will prosecute them," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York office,
said the case "represents the marriage of an old scheme with modern technology."
</P>
<P>
	   "Unscrupulous stock manipulators should be on notice that, to the law
enforcement community, it's the message, not the medium, that matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheret, 31, of Bayside, Queens, and Conley, 31, of Gaston, Oregon, allegedly
operated the fraud from November until earlier this month, making themselves
$1.13 million in illegal profits, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair operated the scam from an entity they called Alphanet, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   They allegedly sent hundreds of thousands of e-mails touting the investment
prospects of thinly traded, largely dormant microcap companies whose stock they
had purchased.
</P>
<P>
	   Then they disguised the e-mails to make them appear as if they had been sent
by America Online Inc., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   A criminal complaint alleged that the men fraudulently opened e-mail
accounts through 23 Internet service providers around the country and used false
information to conceal their identity.
</P>
<P>
	   The false names, addresses and telephone numbers made it difficult to
determine the source of the bogus e-mails, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission also brought civil charges against
the men.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, they could face up to five years in prison and a maximum fine
of $250,000 or twice the gross gain resulting from the offense.

<HEADLINE> Patrick Kennedy Raises Dems' Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Over white wine in long-stemmed glasses and
bite-sized sandwiches, some 40 people paid $500 each for a piece of Camelot.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, nephew of President
John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert Kennedy, had come to town.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I knew I was going to be feeling right at home,'' Kennedy quipped, amid
the art collection that adorned the walls of the palatial home here.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Rhode Island congressman, family lore and campaign checks have
proven to be a potent combination. He's already set a one-year fund-raising
record for House Democrats, and he's traveled around the country on behalf of
candidates he hopes will help the party win a congressional majority, such as
Columbus City Council member Maryellen O'Shaughnessy, running for an open House
seat.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't think of being in a place where I could put my good name to
better use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the
fund-raising arm for House Democrats -- Kennedy is bringing in the money at a
rate the party has never seen before.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Kennedy's stewardship, the committee raised $33.4 million last year --
compared with $14.9 million during the same period in 1997 -- and had $19.8
million in the bank as of Dec. 31 -- 11 times the total of two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Belonging to the newest generation of the famous American political family
gives Kennedy clout far beyond what might be expected from a third-term
congressman.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kennedy is a magic name in the Democratic Party, still,'' said David
Leland, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ``Thirty-seven years after
Camelot, the Kennedy mystique is still strong and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though wide-eyed and just 32, Kennedy has shed much of the awkwardness he
displayed during his first congressional term in 1995. He now talks without
notes, and liberally peppers his pleas for money with references to his family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you cared about President Kennedy, if you cared about my uncle Robert
Kennedy, you'll care about this election,'' he told an earlier O'Shaughnessy
gathering, where supporters paid $20 for cheese puffs and beer. ``They'd be
fighting to make sure we get a Democratic majority.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Florida that same weekend, Kennedy gave his support to another top
Democratic candidate, state Rep. Elaine Bloom.
</P>
<P>
	   In a pastel-bathed Hollywood, Fla., restaurant, as he and Bloom walked the
receiving line, Broward County Democratic committeeman Jack Shifrell pointed to
a 20-something woman nearby. That's how old he was, he told Kennedy, when he
volunteered for Robert Kennedy's Senate campaign 36 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was the beginning of my political career,'' Shifrell told Kennedy,
who flashed a boyish grin before moving on.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stump, he often pokes fun at his sheltered upbringing and the
tax-cutting Republicans he wants to dethrone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a conflict of interest for me to vote,'' he told 75 senior citizens
at a synagogue south of Hollywood. ``Wealthy families make out like bandits''
under the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennedy credits his fund-raising success to the Democrats' improved chances
to win back the House this fall -- they need to capture just six seats. But he's
not afraid to invoke his role as a scion of Camelot to help the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's an incredible name,'' Kennedy said. ``I had nothing to do with making
it what it is today, but I can transmit the power of the name to accomplish a
goal that my uncles would fight for themselves if they were alive today and my
father continues to fight for every day he's in the Senate.''

<HEADLINE> Govt's False Claim Recoveries Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private citizen whistleblowers have helped the government
recover more than $3.5 billion from companies that allegedly defrauded the
taxpayers, thanks to a surge in health care fraud and a law encouraging private
citizens to report false claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half that $3.5 billion has come in the last 2 1/2 years as big health
care cases have been resolved, the Justice Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half of all the private whistleblower cases and more than half of the
total recovered money involve health care fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   During this period, the government has turned over $550 million of the total
recoveries to the private whistleblowers who first complained that their
companies or others were defrauding the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The False Claims Act allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits on behalf
of the United States alleging that private companies -- usually their employer
-- have submitted fraudulent claims for government payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The private whistleblowers who file these lawsuits are given 15 percent to
25 percent of any money won in settlement or judgment if the federal government
intervenes in the case and takes over as the plaintiff. The private
whistleblowers can be given up to 30 percent of the money recovered if the
government does not join the case, but they pursue it to victory on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Private whistleblower provisions were first added to the False Claims Act in
1976, but in 1986, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Howard L. Berman,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments that made it easier for whistleblowers to benefit
from their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1986, there was no minimum in the law, like the current 15 percent,
for sharing the recovered money with the whistleblowers. Judges set the amount
and gave some whistleblowers nothing. The amendments also relaxed a provision
that had precluded whistleblowers from sharing in the recovery if there had been
any information whatsoever about the fraud in government files before the
lawsuit, even if it was not even information to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It took us 12 years -- the end of fiscal year 1998 -- to recover $2
billion in civil fraud cases brought under the whistleblower provisions,'' said
Acting Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of the department's civil division.
``We have reached the $16 billion mark just 16 months later.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 3,000 such lawsuits have been filed since 1986, rising from 33 in
the year after the amendments to 483 in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the recoveries, more than $3.3 billion has come in cases the Justice
Department entered, and $211 million in cases tried by whistleblowers after the
department declined to enter.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's private whistleblower provisions ``have provided a remarkable
return for the taxpayers of this country,'' Ogden said. The department's
recovery of more than $3.3 billion ``demonstrates that the public-private
partnership encouraged by the statute works and is an effective tool in our
continuing fight against the fraudulent use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent recoveries include $375 million, the largest civil recovery in a
health care fraud case, from National Medical Care, now also known as Fresenius
Medical Care, North America, the largest provider of kidney dialysis services in
the nation. A private whistleblower alleged the company submitted false claims
for laboratory tests and conspired to pay illegal kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest operator of nursing homes,
agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations it defrauded Medicare by
fabricating records to make it appear nurses were devoting much more time to
Medicare patients than they actually did.
</P>
<P>
	   Olsten Corp. paid $40.9 million to settle allegations that it and
Columbia/HCA disguised unallowable acquisition costs as allowable management
fees when Columbia/HCA bought home health agencies in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   False claim whistleblowing is not confined to health care fraud. Recently,
Chevron Corp. agreed to pay $86.2 million to resolve allegations it and its
affiliates underpaid royalties for oil produced on leased federal and Indian
land since 1988. Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pay $45 million, and Oxy-USA Inc.
paid $7.3 million to resolve similar royalty underpayment claims.

<HEADLINE> Senate Medicare Plan Attacked  </HEADLINE>
   By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats are launching fresh attacks on a Senate
Medicare overhaul plan favored by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without question, seniors would be forced to pay considerably more under
this reform plan,'' said Sen. John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal could drive Medicare premiums up by 47 percent or more,
according to a letter from Health and Human Services Department actuary Richard
Foster that is being circulated by Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., co-sponsor of the bill with Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., called the letter ``just a continuation of the (Clinton) administration's
disinformation campaign on Breaux-Frist, which is the only proposal that
provides both outpatient prescription drugs and true Medicare reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   HHS spokeswoman Melissa Skolfield defended Foster's analysis. While it may
serve the administration's position, she said that he serves in a
congressionally established office created to assess the financial condition of
Medicare and his conclusions are reached independently.
</P>
<P>
	   Congressional action on Medicare this year is uncertain, but the topic is an
election-year favorite for rhetoric and partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Frist and Breaux served on a 1999 bipartisan Medicare reform commission,
where the plan they are now peddling did not win enough support from Democrats
to be formally recommended to Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton has since come out with his own Medicare plan, featuring a
new prescription drug benefit at a cost to retirees of $26 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans have criticized Clinton's plan as an attempt to score political
points for Democrats without seriously tackling the problem of curbing Medicare
costs, which are expected to balloon once baby boomers begin to retire in about
a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, GOP leaders have praised the Breaux-Frist plan, which would seek
to save the government money by making Medicare more like the health benefits
many younger Americans get from employers.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior citizens would choose among pre-approved private health plans and
Medicare would pay a standard portion of the premium. Those choosing higher-cost
plans would pay more out-of-pocket, but supporters say competition among plans
would bring costs down for many.
</P>
<P>
	   A government-run Medicare option would continue to be available. But it
would have to compete under the same financial constraints as private plans.
</P>
<P>
	   For that reason, Foster said in his Feb. 23 letter that staying in the
government-run plan -- which would be most similar to what retirees are used to
now -- could cost 25 percent more out-of-pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Foster's letter noted that the Breaux-Frist legislation calls
for money from premiums collected from Medicare beneficiaries to cover 12
percent of Medicare's total costs. Under current law, premiums are scheduled to
cover about 10 percent of costs in 2003, 11 percent by 2010, and in 2015, the
program would run short of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   A boost to premiums covering 12 percent of costs in 2003 would translate
into a 22 percent rise in premiums, Foster estimated. Monthly Medicare premiums
are currently $45.50 per month.
</P>
<P>
	   Those choosing new prescription drug coverage offered under the Breaux-Frist
proposal would pay an additional charge, which Foster estimated at about $57.50
per month.

<HEADLINE> Engineers Corps Denies Budget Scheme  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are warning the Army Corps of Engineers that its
credibility is at stake as new accusations emerged of secret schemes by agency
officials to bloat the price tag of its water projects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the public wants is to know it's above board,'' Sen. George
Voinovich, R-Ohio, said Thursday regarding the Corps' process for deciding which
water projects to pursue.
</P>
<P>
	   And Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said recent news reports on the Corps have left
the impression that the shipping industry has been ``hotwiring'' projects to get
them approved and ``have really taken a toll on your credibility.''
</P>
<P>
	   The senators spoke as top Corps officials appeared before the transportation
and infrastructure subcommittee that Voinovich chairs, a part of the Senate
Environment and Public Works Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Joe N. Ballard, the Corps' chief of engineers, told the lawmakers
that recent criticism of the agency creates an impression that ``a bunch of
rogue officers plotted to take over this program. That simply is not true.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing came as Environmental Defense, a pro-environment group, released
what it said were internal Corps documents.
</P>
<P>
	   One memorandum on a $1 billion plan to expand locks on the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers said a preliminary study of the project was ``wrong'' and that
the Corps should not issue a ``limpwristed'' recommendation that the work be
stretched out to 2025.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental Defense also released a slide show that officials from Corps
headquarters showed to staff in field offices, detailing a plan to expand the
agency's current $4 billion civil works budget to $6.2 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Both documents were described in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
	   After the hearing, Army Secretary Louis Caldera announced that the National
Academy of Sciences, a congressionally chartered private group, would review the
Corps' study of the Mississippi and Illinois river project. The Army has already
begun investigating other allegations against the Corps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to assure you that we take these charges seriously,'' Caldera said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   At the hearing, Joseph W. Westphal, an assistant secretary for the Army who
oversees some of the Corps' work, said he had not been aware of the slide
presentation. He said the agency has ``a very grassroots level for making
policy'' in which recommendations for various projects usually come from local
offices, not headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not in a position from my office in the Pentagon to know everything
going on out in the field,'' Westphal told the senators.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard, sitting beside Westphal at the witness table, said he had not shown
the presentation to his civilian superior yet because it had not been completed.
</P>
<P>
	   Ballard said the proposal to increase the agency's budget was aimed at
letting it handle its huge backlog of unfinished water projects, not start new
ones. And he said agency officials cannot get projects approved without the
approval of Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It just doesn't happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Corps projects are extremely popular on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers
compete with each other annually to try to win construction for their home
districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., chairman of the Environment and Public
Works committee, said poor communication between the Corps' military and
civilian leaders ``obviously is unacceptable and we need to straighten it out.''
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``We want to make sure we don't lose this trust you have built up
over the years with the public.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Corps, which dredges rivers and builds and maintains locks and dams, has
been under fire in recent weeks for allegedly falsifying its justifications for
some projects. Some of the criticism has come from within the Corps itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, a sworn affidavit by a Corps economist accused it of
altering a $50 million study of locks on the Mississippi and Illinois rivers to
justify their expansion in order to speed barge traffic.
</P>
<P>
	   Corps officials have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Experts Debate Popular Diet Plans  </HEADLINE>
    By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Put the nation's most popular weight-loss experts in one
room and they can agree on a few things: Americans are too fat. Exercise is good
for you, and sugar isn't.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond that, the diet gurus who faced off Thursday in the
government-sponsored Great Nutrition Debate couldn't agree on what makes people
fat, much less the best way to keep it off.
</P>
<P>
	   On one side was cardiologist Robert Atkins, promoter of the wildly popular,
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet that lets people eat omelets, bacon and
bun-less burgers. "It's easy to follow. You're never hungry," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other: Dean Ornish, an internist whose book promises readers they can
"Eat More, Weigh Less" if they follow his ultra low-fat, vegetarian diet.
</P>
<P>
	   In between were people like heart surgeon Morrison Bethea, co-author of
"Sugar Busters! Cut Sugar to Trim Fat," who says the secret to losing weight is
cutting out not just sugar but also foods like potatoes and carrots that act in
similar ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, biochemist Barry Sears, who believes the answer to obesity is viewing
food as a powerful drug that controls the body's insulin level, and internist
John McDougall, who thinks it should be obvious to anyone that an Asian
rice-based diet is best. "This is a no brainer," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Balance is the key," said Keith-Thomas Ayoob, a spokesman for the American
Dietetic Association and a panelist for the debate. "We've gone to all the
extremes now. Maybe somewhere in between is where we need to go."
</P>
<P>
	   Diets can reduce weight, but the question is whether people can keep it off,
said Ayoob, a nutritionist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. "Big
changes are temporary changes."
</P>
<P>
	   One diet is not "appropriate ... for each and every patient," said another
panelist, Denise Bruner, president of the American Society of Bariatric
Physicans, the doctors who treat obesity. "Does a physician treat every stomach
ache with a pill?"
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins vigorously defended his low-carb diet, which has been roundly
criticized by Ornish as well as many medical experts who fear it could damage
the kidneys or bones.
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins said that it is the fat and cholesterol produced by the body that is
the culprit in obesity, not the fat that's eaten. And not only does his diet
work, it's safe, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so, said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   "Telling people that pork rinds and sausage is healthy sells books, but it's
hazardous to your health," said Ornish.
</P>
<P>
	   In the sharpest exchange of the debate, Ornish criticized the lack of
research done on the effects of Atkins' diet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not as good a fund-raiser as you are," Atkins snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the number of books you sell you could fund your own studies," Ornish
fired back.
</P>
<P>
	   As for critics who say Ornish's low-fat diet is unappealing, he said that's
because they are not cooking the right way.
</P>
<P>
	   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who organized the debate and had the
final word, made no effort to sort out the myriad of conflicting claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eat well and eat healthy," he advised. But he suggested that it may be time
for government researchers get involved in evaluating the various diets.

<HEADLINE> Walt Disney, lawyers top first lady's donors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - More than half of the individual donations Hillary
Clinton has received for her U.S. Senate bid in New York came from outside the
state, a nonpartisan watchdog group said.
<P>
	   In an analysis of the first lady's campaign filings, the Center for
Responsive Politics found that 56 percent - or $3.4 million - of Clinton's $6
million in individual contributions came from 45 other states and the District
of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   Walt Disney executives and their families donated $56,500 to Clinton's U.S.
Senate bid, more than any other company. But as an industry, lawyers topped the
list, giving the Yale Law School graduate $666,879, the center said. The
entertainment industry was next, donating $439,740, the nonpartisan center said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can see that this really is a national race," Larry Makinson, the
center's executive director, said Thursday. "She's successfully tapping
traditional Democratic donors, like lawyers. The twist is how well she's
connected to Hollywood."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew $668,779 from California, topping all states except New York.
Of the $2.7 million she raised in New York state, $2.2 million of it came from
the New York City metropolitan area, the analysis found. Much of that cash came
from wealthy neighborhoods in Manhattan's Upper East Side, the data showed.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton received just $13,250 from her new hometown of Chappaqua, the
Westchester County town where she and the president recently purchased a $1.7
million home. Other heavy givers to Clinton were Massachusetts ($382,600), Texas
($312,824), District of Columbia ($276,940), and Illinois ($229,700), the center
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has been fighting the perception that she is a carpetbagger in New
York, where she had never lived or worked until launching her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign of her GOP rival, Rudolph Giuliani, has also been receiving
large numbers of contributions from outside New York. But Bruce Teitelbaum, the
New York City mayor's campaign manager, attacked the first lady Thursday for
"running a campaign based out of California, Illinois and Massachusetts with
money from wealthy trial lawyers and movie producers."
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum said that less than 50 percent of Giuliani's $11.5 million
campaign warchest has come from outside New York. Clinton raised a total of $8.1
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's analysis of the first lady's fund raising found that more than
61 percent of her money came from individual donors giving $1,000 or more but it
only counted contributions of $200 or more. Individuals may contribute a maximum
of $2,000 under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are very proud that the campaign has more than 58,000 contributors and
that their average contribution was $136," Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Makinson said he expected his center to conduct a similar analysis of the
mayor's fund raising when the data was available electronically from the Federal
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's analysis included money raised by Clinton's Senate campaign
during 1999 and also included proceeds from joint fundraisers with the
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to lawyers and entertainment executives, the analysis also found
that Clinton was popular with the securities and investment industry. Her
second-largest single donor company was Goldman Sachs Co. where executives and
their families donated $39,120. Clinton's other top donors also came from the
financial services industry: Deloitte and Touche ($28,750); Patton Boggs
($25,500) and Citigroup ($22,000).
</P>
<P>
	   While corporations cannot give money to candidates directly, political
action committees set up by them may contribute. So can executives within a
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Within Disney, most of Clinton's donations came from executives at Miramax,
which has produced such blockbusters as last year's Oscar winner for best
picture, "Shakespeare in Love."

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviews Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee and the Justice
Department are both taking a closer look at former CIA Director John Deutch's
home computer security breaches and the CIA's internal investigation of his
conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The time lapses are, in my view, just unacceptable,'' said Sen. Richard
Bryan, D-Nev., vice chairman of the Senate panel. ``There are a lot of
unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Committee members say they want to know, among other things, why it took the
CIA some 18 months to notify congressional oversight panels of their discovery
that Deutch was using unsecured home computers for work on some of the nation's
most sensitive secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel intends to question former CIA general counsel Michael O'Neil next
week on whether he withheld information about his former boss from agency
investigators and the Justice Department, members said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno, meanwhile, said that the Justice Department --
which declined last spring to bring any charges against Deutch -- is now
scrutinizing the case more closely.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The department is looking at the whole matter ... to see whether there is
any basis for further action,'' Reno said Thursday at her weekly news
conference. Reno indicated both Deutch's behavior and the CIA's investigation of
it would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
	   Intelligence Committee members welcomed Reno's review, but said they planned
to press on with their own probe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's sad she didn't take a closer look at it earlier, because something is
wrong and we're going to get to the bottom of it,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., the chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the panel, which heard from Deutch earlier in the week, is turning
attention to why it took the CIA so long to notify the Justice Department and
Congress after discovering in December 1996 that Deutch had mishandled
classified material.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency did not submit a report to the Justice Department until March
1998 and did not notify congressional oversight panels until June 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is inexplicable to me and to others on the committee,'' Shelby said,
suggesting ``possibly a cover-up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch, CIA director from May 1995 to December 1996, processed thousands of
highly classified documents on unprotected home computers that he and family
members used to connect the Internet, according to an internal CIA
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch was
stripped of most of his security clearances by CIA Director George Tenet last
August. As a former deputy defense secretary, Deutch also had Pentagon
clearances, but he voluntarily gave them up earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has apologized for his behavior, both in private testimony to the
Senate Intelligence Committee and in a brief appearance on Tuesday before
reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Deutch, the Senate committee has questioned CIA Inspector
General Brit Snider and FBI and CIA security officials in closed-door sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neil, the former general counsel who left the agency in October 1997, at
first declined to turn over computer storage cards from Deutch's computers and
delayed notifying the Justice Department of the matter, according to an
unclassified version of an internal CIA inspector general's report released
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel also intends to call Nora Slatkin, the CIA's former executive
director and now an official with Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
	   Shelby, in an interview, suggested Tenet and his top deputies didn't act
right away ``because of the friendship, the relationship they had with Dr.
Deutch.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, the Justice Department's criminal division declined to
prosecute Deutch for mishandling classified information, finding the lapses were
largely due to carelessness.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno and her aides declined to specify what questions were being reviewed.
They said only that the entire matter was under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   One Justice official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said two criminal
division lawyers are handling the review.
</P>
<P>
	   The review is more comprehensive than the one the Justice Department
announced three weeks ago, the official said. At that time, Justice lawyers were
said to be taking a look at the CIA inspector general's report, but, based on
information then available, there were no plans to reopen the investigation.

<HEADLINE> President Attends NYC Fund-Raisers  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to remind supporters of the high stakes in the
coming election, President Clinton pointed to stark differences between
Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on the emotional issues of gun
control and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   At a pair of Democratic Party fund-raisers Clinton told contributors
Thursday night that his successor would likely appoint between two and four
justices to the Supreme Court -- and reminded the party faithful what that might
mean for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will have a huge impact in America,'' he said. ``The Democratic
candidates for president will support maintaining a woman's right to choose and
will act accordingly. The Republican candidates won't and will act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
	   In just a few hours, the president helped raise $1.1 million for the party,
and he made a point of reminding donors why they were supporting the Democratic
cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley support some gun
control measures, he said, while Republicans would sacrifice public safety by
siding with the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're willing to pay a price ... that I'm not willing to pay,'' he said.
``They actually agree with the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also boasted about the nation's economic prosperity, crediting the
high technology boom and low interest rates, among other factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the evening's partisan tone and Manhattan location, he made only
passing reference to his wife's New York Senate campaign. And Democratic
National Committee chairman Ed Rendell, mindful that he was in the hometown of
Bradley's basketball Knicks, dutifully praised both candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Well-heeled Democrats paid $25,000 a couple to dine with the president on
lobster salad and lamb at the posh French bistro Daniel, on the Upper East Side.
A late night event at the Four Seasons restaurant drew about 50 guests at
$10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
	   The president urged them to stop and ponder how the nation can best take
advantage of the opportunities presented by the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested continuing to pay down the debt, trying to ensure that future
economic downturns are short and not too severe, and helping the poor share in
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton reminded his wealthy guests that not all Americans have benefited
from the good economic times. He cited persistent poverty in some inner city and
rural areas and high unemployment on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
	   He offered some credit for the good economy to his two Republican
predecessors, who he said were responsible for open markets and expanding trade.
He also praised Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan for not reflexively
raising interest rates in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was willing to look at the evidence ... and not get in your way,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's fund-raising stops followed an afternoon visit to
Philadelphia, where he offered a similarly positive vision of the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was spending the night at his new home in Chappaqua before returning
to Washington today.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Suspends Gun Traffic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Clinton administration is suspending the export of guns
and ammunition to Canada amid concern that they might be flowing back into the
United States, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States nine months ago began requiring licenses to export weapons
to Canada. Since last April, licenses have been issued for 115,000 handguns,
25,000 rifles and 200 million rounds of ammunition, according to U.S. government
data cited by the Times.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior law enforcement official in Canada told the newspaper that the
import figures were ``astonishing,'' given the country's strict firearms laws.
``I don't know where these handguns could be going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension was ordered because it is unknown where the firearms are
going, the Times reported, citing anonymous U.S. officials. One said it was
``extremely possible'' the guns were being smuggled back into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada, with a population of 31 million, limits possession of handguns to
collectors, target shooters and those who can demonstrate a need of guns to
protect their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian government sent a letter to the U.S. State Department on
Wednesday asking for the license program to be suspended pending an
investigation, officials from both countries told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension is effective immediately, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration last April suspended handgun sales to Venezuela,
worried that the weapons were being used by drug gangs and guerillas in
Colombia. A suspension of firearm sales to Britain in April 1998 has been
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Brain Injury Vaccine Tested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report out today holds promise of an oral vaccine that
might one day protect brain neurons from injury caused by epilepsy seizure or by
stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers at the medical school of Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia report in the journal Science that a vaccine given to rats caused
their immune system to develop antibodies that prevented the action of a protein
that causes damage after brain injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Matthew During, professor of neurosurgery at Jefferson and lead author
of the study, said the vaccine works against a brain protein, called the NMDA
receptor, that has been shown to aggravate brain damage after a stroke and to
play a role in epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
	   Other researchers have tried to block the action of the NMDA receptor using
drugs, but these drugs often fail to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier,
a natural barrier that protects the brain from most destructive substances in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
	   By using a vaccine, the researchers prompt the body, in effect, to make its
own NMDA blocker by creating antibodies that neutralize the protein after brain
injury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, some rats were immunized with the anti-NMDA antibody while
others were not. A month later, the rats were injected with a neurotoxin,
kainate, which causes seizures similar to those in epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the control rats, which were not immunized, there was a seizure rate
of 70 percent. Among those with the anti-NMDA antibody, the seizure rate was 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In another study, immunized and nonimmunized rats were tested after five
months for protection from stroke damage. An artificial stroke was induced in
the animals using a drug.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the immunized rats, said During, "We found dramatic protection in the
rats' brains. ... It doesn't stop the stroke from occurring, but the amount of
brain damage is diminished by 70 percent."
</P>
<P>
	   None of the studied rats showed abnormal behavior from the vaccine, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study has been conducted only in rats, and During said a vaccine may
cause unknown effects that are not reversible.

<HEADLINE> Stage Is Set for Latin Grammys  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Next stop, the Latin Grammys.
</P>
<P>
	   The growing popularity of Latin music has prompted the National Academy of
Recording Arts and Sciences to add a separate ceremony for Spanish-language
artists this fall. This week's Grammy celebration was a fitting intro.
</P>
<P>
	   From a parade of Hispanic presenters and performers to such high-profile
winners as Carlos Santana and Christina Aguilera, the 42nd annual Grammys
showcased the surge in Latin music.
</P>
<P>
	   "The time is ripe for the arrival of the Latin Grammys," said Ricardo
Dopico, director of Latin music for the Recording Industry Association of
America. The Latin awards show air on CBS on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're talking national exposure on primetime television for a
Spanish-language music show," Dopico said. "That's going to stir additional
interest in Latin music."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mexican-born Santana won eight Grammys, including top album for
"Supernatural" and best record for "Smooth," his collaboration with singer Rob
Thomas of Matchbox 20. Santana tied Michael Jackson's record for most awards in
one night.
</P>
<P>
	   Aguilera, whose father is from Ecuador and who plans to release a
Spanish-language album this spring, was a surprise winner for best new artist,
beating teen sensation Britney Spears, rock-rapper Kid Rock and acclaimed R&AMP;B
newcomer Macy Gray.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricky Martin's performance at last year's Grammys helped kick the Latin
sensation's career into high gear. Martin and fellow Latin singer Marc Anthony
had nominations in top pop categories at Wednesday's Grammy show, which also
included a Latin musical segment featuring numbers in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Latino awards presenters included Gloria Estefan, Jimmy Smits, Andy Garcia
and Jennifer Lopez, perhaps the evening's most talked-about celebrity because of
her revealing gown.
</P>
<P>
	   Everyone, Latino or not, praised Santana, whose commercial comeback has put
the guitar impresario on top of the album charts for the first time in almost 30
years.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruben Blades, who won the Grammy for Latin pop performance for "Tiempos,"
said he grew up listening to such acts as Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers but
that Santana's music came along and "there was a Latin face behind it."
</P>
<P>
	   "His success inspired a lot of people," Blades said.
</P>
<P>
	   Latin bandleader Tito Puente, who won a Grammy for traditional tropical
Latin performance, joked that he has profited off the talent of Santana, whose
early hits include Puente's "Oye Como Va."
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time he plays 'Oye Como Va,' I get a nice royalty check," Puente
said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Warns Diabetics on China Herbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Diabetics are being warned by the Food and Drug
Administration to avoid five brands of Chinese herbal products because the herbs
illegally contain prescription drugs that could cause dangerous drops in blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
	   Makers of the products say they contain only natural Chinese herbs. But
after a diabetic herb user had several episodes of hypoglycemia, California
investigators discovered the products also contain the prescription diabetes
drugs glyburide and phenformin.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers can receive a dangerously high amount of the drugs from the
affected herbs, California's health department concluded -- and herb users
particularly are at risk if they also take regular diabetes medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "People with diabetes should avoid these products and consult their
physician if they've been taking them," the FDA warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, people who suffer fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating
or numbness after taking the herbs should call a doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   Affected products are:
</P>
<P>
	   --Diabetes Hypoglucose Capsules, sold by Chinese Angel Health Products of
Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   --Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules, imported by Sino American Health Products
Inc. of Torrance, Calif., but also sold by Chinese Angel.
</P>
<P>
	   --Tongyitang Diabetes Angel Pearl Hypoglycemic Capsules and Tongyitang
Diabetes Angel Hypoglycemic Capsules, sold by Sino American.
</P>
<P>
	   --Zhen Qi Capsules, sold by Sino American.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has stopped imports of the products and is investigating how the
drugs were added to the herbs and whether any other herbal products are
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese Angel and Sino American have agreed to recall the products, which
may be returned to the place of purchase for a refund.

<HEADLINE> Fox: No More Exploitive Shows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Fox Television executive who canceled "Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?" said the network intends to scrap exploitative
reality shows that had become a big part of its prime-time lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Television Entertainment Group, said Thursday
that he wanted to avoid the kind of material that resulted in the fiasco over
the multimillionaire show, The New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow told the newspaper that the special was "hardly reflective of what
we hope to accomplish."
</P>
<P>
	   "They're gone; they're over," Grushow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox's reliance in recent years on such programs had only served as a stopgap
to cover for a dwindling stream of hit series, Grushow said. The programs began
airing in 1995 to fill scheduling holes, and have become a major part of the Fox
brand image.
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow canceled a rerun of the highly rated millionaire special after
reports arose that the bridegroom, Rick Rockwell, had been accused of abusing a
past girlfriend. Darva Conger, the woman who was selected on the show to marry
him, now says she made a big mistake in taking part in the show and will seek an
annulment.
</P>
<P>
	   Expressing what he termed "frustration and anger" over the fallout from the
special, Grushow said he intended to "address how something like this wound up
on our air."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not a witch hunt," Grushow said. "We're just trying to understand
where we are from a program standard point of view so that nothing like this
ever happens again."
</P>
<P>
	   He defined the specials as "anything that is exploitative, that reeks of
desperation, anything that's merely out for ratings."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Darnell, the Fox executive behind his network's reality shows such as
"When Good Pets Go Bad," was unavailable for comment, the newspaper said.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 30 points in
today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange hold a slim
lead over gainers.
</P>

	   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off fractionally and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't closed below 10,000 since last April.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 7; Nasdaq Climbs 42  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were moderately higher in quiet early trading today
as traders had little reaction to a government report of soaring economic growth
during the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 7.99 at 10,100.62. On Thursday, the Dow briefly dipped below
10,000 for the first time since October.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 42.08 at 4,659.73, pushing further into
record territory after reaching a new closing high Thursday for the second
straight session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was was up 8.47 at 1,361.90.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a 6.9 percent
annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest pace in more
than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product -- the total
output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were largely expecting the strong growth, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, fears of higher interest rates sent the Dow down 133.10 to
10,092.63 after dipping as low as 9,942.78. The technology-dominated Nasdaq
closed up 67.32 to 4,617.65, bringing its two-day increase to 235.12.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin today on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 143.5 million shares, down from
Thursday's session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index rose 1.89 to 555.93.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. In afternoon
trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.8 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.5
percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 1.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Talks Abortion, Gun Control  </HEADLINE>
   By BETH GARDINER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to remind supporters of the high stakes in the
coming election, President Clinton pointed to stark differences between
Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on the emotional issues of gun
control and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   At a pair of Democratic Party fund-raisers, Clinton told contributors
Thursday night that his successor would likely appoint between two and four
justices to the Supreme Court -- and reminded the party faithful what that might
mean for abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will have a huge impact in America,'' he said. ``The Democratic
candidates for president will support maintaining a woman's right to choose and
will act accordingly. The Republican candidates won't and will act
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
	   After overnighting at their Westchester County home, the president and Mrs.
Clinton stopped for breakfast at the Chappaqua Restaurant and Cafe today.
Passersby lined up to be checked by the Secret Service so they could enter the
tiny establishment and wait in line to chat with the Clintons, who sat in a
corner booth below three shelves of model cars. The Clintons shook hands as they
waited for their omelets.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman told the president she enjoyed his appearance with movie critic
Roger Ebert.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had more fun doing that,'' Clinton said. ``Aside from the State of Union
(address), I got more comments being on Roger Ebert talking about the movies.''
</P>
<P>
	   In just a few hours Thursday, the president helped raise $1.1 million for
the party, and he made a point of reminding donors why they were supporting the
Democratic cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley support some gun
control measures, he said, while Republicans would sacrifice public safety by
siding with the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're willing to pay a price ... that I'm not willing to pay,'' he said.
``They actually agree with the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also boasted about the nation's economic prosperity, crediting the
high-technology boom, low interest rates and other factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the evening's partisan tone and Manhattan location, he made only
passing reference to his wife's New York Senate campaign. And Democratic
National Committee Chairman Ed Rendell, mindful that he was in the hometown of
Bradley's basketball Knicks, dutifully praised both candidates for the
Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Well-heeled Democrats paid $25,000 a couple to dine with the president on
lobster salad and lamb at the posh French bistro Daniel, on the Upper East Side.
A late-night event at the Four Seasons restaurant drew about 50 guests at
$10,000 each.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Govt's False Claim Recoveries Rise  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Private citizen whistle-blowers have helped the
government recover more than $3.5 billion from companies that allegedly
defrauded the taxpayers, thanks to a surge in health care fraud and a law
encouraging private citizens to report false claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half that $3.5 billion has come in the last 2 1/2 years as big health
care cases have been resolved, the Justice Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Almost half of all the private whistle-blower cases and more than half of
the total recovered money involve health care fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   During this period, the government has turned over $550 million of the total
recoveries to the private whistle-blowers who first complained that their
companies or others were defrauding the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
	   The False Claims Act allow private citizens to file civil lawsuits on behalf
of the United States alleging that private companies -- usually their employer
-- have submitted fraudulent claims for government payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The private whistle-blowers who file these lawsuits are given 15 percent to
25 percent of any money won in settlement or judgment if the federal government
intervenes in the case and takes over as the plaintiff. The private
whistle-blowers can be given up to 30 percent of the money recovered if the
government does not join the case, but they pursue it to victory on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   But the future of private whistle-blower lawsuits now is at issue before the
Supreme Court. Last November, the high court heard arguments in a Vermont case
that originally asked whether citizens could file such lawsuits against states,
but the justices broadened it to consider whether people ever have legal
standing to file fraud claims on the government's behalf. A ruling is expected
by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Private whistle-blower provisions have been in the False Claims Act since
1863, but in 1986, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Howard L. Berman,
D-Calif., sponsored amendments that made it easier for whistle-blowers to
benefit from their actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Before 1986, there was no minimum in the law, like the current 15 percent,
for sharing the recovered money with the whistle-blowers. Judges set the amount
and gave some whistle-blowers nothing. The amendments also relaxed a provision
that had precluded whistle-blowers from sharing in the recovery if there had
been any information whatsoever about the fraud in government files before the
lawsuit, even if it was not enough information to act.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It took us 12 years -- the end of fiscal year 1998 -- to recover $2
billion in civil fraud cases brought under the whistle-blower provisions,'' said
acting Assistant Attorney General David W. Ogden, head of the department's civil
division. ``We have reached the $3 billion mark just 16 months later.''
</P>
<P>
	   More than 3,000 such lawsuits have been filed since 1986, rising from 33 in
the year after the amendments to 483 in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the recoveries, more than $3.3 billion has come in cases the Justice
Department entered, and $211 million in cases tried by whistle-blowers after the
department declined to enter.
</P>
<P>
	   The law's private whistle-blower provisions ``have provided a remarkable
return for the taxpayers of this country,'' Ogden said. The department's
recovery of more than $3.3 billion ``demonstrates that the public-private
partnership encouraged by the statute works and is an effective tool in our
continuing fight against the fraudulent use of public funds.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent recoveries include $375 million, the largest civil recovery in a
health care fraud case, from National Medical Care, now also known as Fresenius
Medical Care, North America, the largest provider of kidney dialysis services in
the nation. A private whistle-blower alleged the company submitted false claims
for laboratory tests and conspired to pay illegal kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest operator of nursing homes,
agreed to pay $170 million to settle allegations it defrauded Medicare by
fabricating records to make it appear nurses were devoting much more time to
Medicare patients than they actually did.
</P>
<P>
	   Olsten Corp. paid $40.9 million to settle allegations that it and
Columbia/HCA disguised unallowable acquisition costs as allowable management
fees when Columbia/HCA bought home health agencies in several states.
</P>
<P>
	   False claim whistle-blowing is not confined to health care fraud. Recently,
Chevron Corp. agreed to pay $86.2 million to resolve allegations it and its
affiliates underpaid royalties for oil produced on leased federal and Indian
land since 1988. Mobil Oil Corp. agreed to pay $45 million to resolve similar
royalty claims.

<HEADLINE> Dow Slips Another 63; Nasdaq Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks extended their losses today and the Nasdaq
moved again into record territory as investors again migrated from established
industrial companies into younger, faster-growing high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
	   At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down
63.29 at 10,029.34. On Thursday, the Dow briefly dipped below 10,000 for the
first time since October.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mixed today.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 42.08 at 4,659.73, pushing further into
record territory after reaching a new closing high Thursday for the second
straight session. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was was down 2.31 at 1,351.12.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies that
promise faster profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continung
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow lower was Wal-Mart, off 2 15/16 to 44 15/16 and 3M, off 3
5/8 to 87 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a 6.9 percent
annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest pace in more
than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product -- the total
output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were largely expecting the strong growth, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way. The industrial stocks have
been hurt in particular by fears of higher rates that would curtail their
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, interest rate concerns sent the Dow down 133.10 to 10,092.63
after the index dipped as low as 9,942.78. The technology-dominated Nasdaq
closed up 67.32 to 4,617.65, bringing its two-day increase to 235.12.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Some Human Rights Gains  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a result of free elections in Indonesia and Nigeria,
two of the world's most populous states, more people came under democratic rule
last year than at any time in the recent past, the State Department said today
in its annual report on human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said that international interventions in Kosovo and East
Timor ``demonstrated that the international community has the will and the
capacity to act against the most profound violations of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the negative side, the study cited Serbia's expulsion of over 850,000
Albanians, the Indonesian military's complicity in the militia rampage through
East Timor and the ``horrors'' perpetrated by rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   These events ``all show that the world has a long way to go before it fully
adheres to the precepts of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   It added that the military coup in Pakistan and popular dissatisfaction in
largely democratic Latin America ``clearly demonstrate that the road to
democratic governance is not without its problems and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report, issued annually since the late 1970's, surveys more the 180
nations and territories and covers the 12-month period ending last Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Some country-by-country highlights:
</P>
<P>
	   --China: Authorities broadened and intensified their efforts to suppress
those perceived to threaten government power or national stability. ``Citizens
who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views faced
widespread repression.'' In the weeks leading up to key events last year,
including the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic, the government moved
against political dissidents across the country, detaining and formally
arresting scores of activists.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia: Russian attacks on separatists in Chechnya included air strikes
and indiscriminate shellings of cities predominantly inhabited by civilians.
``These attacks, which in turn led to house to house fighting in Grozny, led to
the deaths of numerous civilians and the displacement of hundreds of thousands
more.'' There were credible reports of Russian military forces carrying out
summary executions of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   --North Korea: Government repression is so severe that no organized
opposition is known to exist. ``The government regards almost any independent
activity--including listening to foreign broadcasts, writing letters, and
possessing 'reactionary' printed matter--as crimes against the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Burma: The military intensified its systematic use of coercion and
intimidation to restrict further freedom of association. ``Authorities undertook
a sustained, systematic campaign to destroy the National League for Democracy
without formally banning it.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Iraq: The regime continued to commit widespread, serious and systematic
rights abuses, summarily executing actual and perceived political opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   --Syria: The government uses ``its vast powers to quash all organized
political opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sudan: The government continues to restrict most civil liberties,
including freedom of assembly, association, religion and movement. ``Government
security forces regularly tortured, beat, harassed, arbitrarily arrested and
detained opponents or suspected opponents of the government.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sierra Leone: Rebel forces committed ``numerous egregious abuses,
including murder, abduction, deliberate mutilations and rape.'' Pro-government
militias also committed abuses, albeit on a lesser scale.
</P>
<P>
	   --Cuba: The government of President Fidel Castro continued to suppress
opposition and criticism. ``Cuban authorities routinely harass, threaten,
arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison and defame human rights advocates and
members of independent professional associations.''

<HEADLINE> JonBenet Little Seen in Miniseries  </HEADLINE>
    By SANDY SHORE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's golden curls and haunting eyes are barely a
blip on the television screen in a new miniseries about her brutal death.
</P>
<P>
	   Since she was killed three years ago, the 6-year-old beauty queen has graced
magazines, newspapers, television programs and tabloid newspapers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
	   But her character is visible for just 2 1/2 minutes in the two-part,
four-hour program called "Perfect Murder, Perfect Town," part of a calculated
strategy to transform viewers into armchair jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was my mandate to myself, that I would have an opportunity to lay it
out for the entire country," said director-producer Lawrence Schiller, who has
spent nearly three years researching the unsolved slaying. "I've tried to be as
even-handed as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Based on Schiller's best-selling book of the same name, the miniseries is
scheduled to air Sunday and Wednesday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is little new information for those who have closely followed
the case, the series neatly packages the two distinct theories about JonBenet's
killer, with evidence pointing to a family member and evidence pointing to an
intruder.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is the public going to have a more even-handed view of the case? That's
what I'm trying to present," said Schiller.
</P>
<P>
	   The story unfolds much as it did for police and prosecutors, showing every
blemish of the controversial, drawn-out case -- police mistakes, infighting,
resignations of key investigators and the Ramseys' actions.
</P>
<P>
	   By sticking as close to the truth as possible, Schiller eliminates much of
Hollywood's docudrama style, leaving a story that is interesting, yet sometimes
laborious.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, John Ramsey carries his daughter's body -- a mannequin -- up
the basement stairs, her limbs sticking out stiffly because of rigor mortis.
Another graphic shot briefly shows the autopsy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It looks phony and looks like a doll ... that's exactly how rigor mortis
is," Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was early on the day after Christmas 1996 when Patsy Ramsey called
police, saying she found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for her daughter.
Eight hours later, John Ramsey found his daughter's body in a basement room,
beaten and strangled.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics have blamed early mistakes by police officers for jeopardizing the
investigation, such as allowing family friends to wander about the house and
asking Ramsey to search it.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, police investigators and District Attorney Alex Hunter were at
odds for months, a dispute that many believe hampered progress.
</P>
<P>
	   A Boulder County grand jury examined evidence for 13 months, adjourning in
October. No charges were filed, but the case remains open. Police say the
Ramseys remain under suspicion, while the parents steadfastly deny the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiller said he meticulously checked facts and scenarios, using coroners
and investigators as consultants, including some who worked on the case. He
altered a few facts to help protect the investigation and combined some
developments into a composite for clarity.
</P>
<P>
	   The film was made mostly in Provo, Utah, where Schiller built a replica of
the Ramseys' upscale Boulder home and the Boulder County Justice Center. There
are a few shots of the actual home and of downtown Boulder.
</P>
<P>
	   The most difficult task, Schiller said, was convincing the actors to set
aside personal views so the audience could judge the case fairly.
</P>
<P>
	   Marg Helgenberger portrays Patsy Ramsey as a hysterical mourning mother who
is evasive in police interviews. Ronny Cox presents John Ramsey as a broken man
who is composed during questioning.
</P>
<P>
	   Kris Kristofferson is cast as retired homicide detective Lou Smit, who
consulted with Hunter but later resigned, insisting there was credible evidence
an intruder may have killed JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott Cohen plays Steve Thomas, the lead police investigator, who eventually
resigned, accusing Hunter of mishandling the case and trying to protect the
Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
	   Actors met with their real-life counterparts in most cases, Schiller said;
the Ramseys did not participate.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Dyanne Iandoli, who makes her television debut as JonBenet, the cast
and crew were careful to protect her from the ugliness of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never referred to the real event. Her parents told the child about what
she was doing. Nobody on the crew was ever allowed to refer to her as JonBenet,"
Schiller said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wasn't going to ask her to re-create a dead child. I wanted her to be
herself."

<HEADLINE> Aetna Replaces Its Chief Executive  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc. replaced its outspoken chairman with a Wall
Street veteran today as the nation's largest health insurer struggled to cope
with rising medical costs and a falling stock price. Chief executive Dick Huber
was succeeded by long-time board member William H. Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
	   Donaldson is the co-founder of the investment banking firm of Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette. He previously was chairman and CEO of the New York Stock
Exchange and has been on the Aetna board of directors since 1977.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Board and I share not only pride in the company's leading position in
health care and financial services, but also frustration at the recent returns
received by Aetna shareholders," Donaldson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock price has slumped from about $100 last spring to $39 today.
</P>
<P>
	   Its shares have been under pressure since last fall, when the company became
the target of several class-action lawsuits alleging the insurer put profits
before patient care. The suits were filed by the same trial attorneys who won
big awards against the tobacco companies. The company denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around the
money-losing Prudential Healthcare business, which is bought last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumers groups and medical providers who argue the company skimps on
care.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Aetna posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits, but
warned it was having trouble controlling rising medical costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber took over the top position at Aetna five years ago and led the company
through rapid expansion, punctuated by the purchases of U.S. Healthcare in 1996
and Prudential Healthcare in 1999.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Gun Sales Into Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The export of guns and ammunition to Canada has been
suspended while authorities look into a surge in requests for handgun licenses,
the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States nine months ago began requiring licenses to export weapons
to Canada. Since last April, licenses have been issued for 115,000 handguns,
25,000 rifles and 200 million rounds of ammunition, according to U.S. government
data cited today by the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   A senior law enforcement official in Canada told the newspaper that the
import figures were ``astonishing,'' given the country's strict firearms laws.
``I don't know where these handguns could be going,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said exports were suspended after State
Department officials who monitor gun sales to Canada noticed a ``large,
increased surge'' in requests for licenses for handguns, rifles and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   Canadian officials were not aware of that surge, Lockhart said; Only about
one-fourth of the requested licenses were for Canadian law enforcement. U.S.
officials processed the Canadian government requests, but put a hold on those
for private commercial resellers in Canada ``while they get some answers,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no apparent explanation, on the base of it, for those who
process the licenses,'' Lockhart said. ``Canadian authorities are now looking
into it from their end.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the United States has not cut off all gun sales to Canada. ``The
important thing here is that we have a system of export licenses that works.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Times, citing an anonymous U.S. official, said it was ``extremely
possible'' the guns were being smuggled back into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada, with a population of 31 million, limits possession of handguns to
collectors, target shooters and those who can demonstrate a need of guns to
protect their lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian government sent a letter to the U.S. State Department on
Wednesday asking for the license program to be suspended pending an
investigation, officials from both countries told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension is effective immediately, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration last April suspended handgun sales to Venezuela,
worried that the weapons were being used by drug gangs and guerillas in
Colombia. A suspension of firearm sales to Britain in April 1998 has been
lifted.

<HEADLINE> Japan Finance Reformer Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By KOZO MIZOGUCHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The chief of Japan's financial reform agency resigned Friday
amid a furor over remarks he made suggesting he would be lenient when inspecting
bank operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Michio Ochi, the head of the Financial Reconstruction Commission, handed in
his resignation hours after he insisted he would not quit.
</P>
<P>
	   "My comment caused a lot of trouble for the Cabinet," Ochi said. "I had no
choice but to resign."
</P>
<P>
	   The furor began Saturday when Ochi spoke to a crowd of officials from credit
unions and other financial institutions in a town north of Tokyo about upcoming
inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the method of examination is strict, please bring it to the attention of
my office. The utmost consideration will be given," Ochi said, according to a
tape released by the opposition Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments were controversial in Japan because the government has pumped
massive amounts of public money into the banks to help them bounce back from a
bad loan crisis. The crisis has been blamed on bad management and poor oversight
by government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The Financial Reconstruction Commission is the government body overseeing
efforts to clean up the industry, and inspections of the institutions are to be
conducted from March to July.
</P>
<P>
	   Sadakazu Tanigaki, former director general of the Science and Technology
Agency, was appointed to succeed Ochi.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition had jumped on Ochi's comments, accusing him of pandering to
the banking industry and using the scandal to pummel Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's coalition government.
</P>
<P>
	   Three opposition parties stormed out of a Budget Committee meeting in the
lower house of Parliament on Friday in protest.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time for you to resign," Democrat Kazuhiro Haraguchi railed at Ochi.
</P>
<P>
	   Obuchi's government acknowledged Ochi's comments were troublesome.
</P>
<P>
	   The resignation defused a conflict that could have complicated upcoming
parliamentary budget discussions.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Some Human Rights Gains  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a result of free elections in Indonesia and Nigeria,
two of the world's most populous states, more people came under democratic rule
last year than at any time in the recent past, the State Department said today
in its annual report on human rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said interventions in Kosovo and East Timor ``demonstrated
that the international community has the will and the capacity to act against
the most profound violations of human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the negative side, the study cited Serbia's expulsion of more than
850,000 Albanians, the Indonesian military's complicity in the militia rampage
through East Timor and the ``horrors'' perpetrated by rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
	   These events ``all show that the world has a long way to go before it fully
adheres to the precepts of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
	   It added that the military coup in Pakistan and popular dissatisfaction in
largely democratic Latin America ``clearly demonstrate that the road to
democratic governance is not without its problems and challenges.''
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright used the occasion of the report's
release to highlight the abuses she said Russian soldiers have committed in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters, she reaffirmed an earlier administration call for
Russia ``to launch full and open investigations into credible reports of
massacres and other human rights violations in Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the United States ``will continue to speak out on behalf of those
in China who are systematically denied basic political and religious freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
	   She also endorsed China's proposed entry into the World Trade Organization,
saying it would set in motion changes that ``will add to the pressures welling
up from within China for greater personal and political freedom.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, issued annually since the late 1970s, surveys more the 180
nations and territories and covers all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Some country-by-country highlights:
</P>
<P>
	   --China: Authorities broadened and intensified their efforts to suppress
those perceived to threaten government power or national stability. ``Citizens
who sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views faced
widespread repression.'' In the weeks leading up to key events last year,
including the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic, the government moved
against political dissidents across the country, detaining and formally
arresting scores of activists.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia: Russian attacks on separatists in Chechnya included air strikes
and indiscriminate shellings of cities predominantly inhabited by civilians.
``These attacks, which in turn led to house to house fighting in Grozny, led to
the deaths of numerous civilians and the displacement of hundreds of thousands
more.'' There were credible reports of Russian military forces carrying out
summary executions of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   --North Korea: Government repression is so severe that no organized
opposition is known to exist. ``The government regards almost any independent
activity--including listening to foreign broadcasts, writing letters, and
possessing 'reactionary' printed matter--as crimes against the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Burma: The military intensified its systematic use of coercion and
intimidation to restrict further freedom of association. ``Authorities undertook
a sustained, systematic campaign to destroy the National League for Democracy
without formally banning it.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Iraq: The regime continued to commit widespread, serious and systematic
rights abuses, summarily executing actual and perceived political opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   --Syria: The government uses ``its vast powers to quash all organized
political opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sudan: The government continues to restrict most civil liberties,
including freedom of assembly, association, religion and movement. ``Government
security forces regularly tortured, beat, harassed, arbitrarily arrested and
detained opponents or suspected opponents of the government.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sierra Leone: Rebel forces committed ``numerous egregious abuses,
including murder, abduction, deliberate mutilations and rape.'' Pro-government
militias also committed abuses, albeit on a lesser scale.
</P>
<P>
	   --Cuba: The government of President Fidel Castro continued to suppress
opposition and criticism. ``Cuban authorities routinely harass, threaten,
arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison and defame human rights advocates and
members of independent professional associations.''

<HEADLINE> Cal. Researchers Make 'Bionic Chip'  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Don't look for the Six Million Dollar Man just yet,
but researchers say they have found a way to mate human cells with circuitry in
a "bionic chip" that could play a key role in medicine and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   The tiny device -- smaller and thinner than a strand of hair -- combines a
healthy human cell with an electronic circuitry chip. By controlling the chip
with a computer, scientists say they can control the activity of the cell.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer sends electrical impulses to the cell-chip, triggering the
cell's membrane pores to open and activating the cell. Scientists hope they can
manufacture cell-chips in large numbers and insert them into the body to replace
or correct diseased tissues.
</P>
<P>
	   The cell-chip also gives them greater control over the difficult process of
gene therapy because they can more precisely open the cell's pores, said lead
researcher Boris Rubinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've brought engineering essentially into the field of biology," said
Rubinsky, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California,
Berkeley, which funded his research. "We can introduce DNA, extract proteins,
administer medicines -- all without bothering other cells that might be around."
</P>
<P>
	   The cell-chip, profiled in the March issue of the journal Biomedical
Microdevices, rests on a long-known phenomenon: Cell membranes become permeable
when exposed to certain voltages.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists for years have been conducting genetic research in a
time-consuming trial-and-error process of bombarding cells with electricity in
an attempt to introduce foreign substances such as new drug treatments or
genetic material.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers hope eventually they can develop cell-chips tuned for the
precise voltage needed to activate different bodily tissues, from muscle to bone
to brain. That way, cell-chips could be applied by the thousands to correct a
variety of health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the past, any electricity applied to the cell was like hitting it with a
hammer in the hopes that something would happen, or it would open for us. Now,
we know just how to make it work," Rubinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauro Ferrari, director of the Biomedical Engineering Center at the
University of Ohio, called Rubinsky's invention a "potentially useful laboratory
tool in the early stages of development."
</P>
<P>
	   "The method for opening cells has been around a long time, but this makes it
more exact and easier to do in large throws," Ferrari said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems to me that we have a ways to go before you'd see a bionic man," he
said, but the ability to program cells quickly could accelerate genetic
research.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Telecom Bids $1.6B for CTV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's largest telecommunications company, BCE Inc., is
offering $1.6 billion in cash for CTV Inc., the country's biggest commercial
television broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
	   BCE wants to use programming from CTV to provide local and national content
for Sympatico-Lycos, its Internet portal. CTV owns one of Canada's three
national TV networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean C. Monty, president and CEO of Bell Canada's parent company, said the
acquisition would "squarely place BCE as a leading player in the converging
broadcasting and new media industries."
</P>
<P>
	   CTV's board was expected to meet soon to discuss the bid.
</P>
<P>
	   BCE's bid "fits very, very well into their overall strategy," said Fred
Ketchen, a stock analyst at ScotiaMcLeod.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can see where BCE wanted to go -- this gives them the opportunity to do
it. They've got greater opportunity for content -- by Internet, by satellite, by
regular TV; it's all there," Ketchen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Canadian regulations, 10 percent of the value of the transaction, or
about $160 million, will have to be spent to develop the broadcasting industry
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   CTV owns and operates 25 television stations, as well as the Atlantic
satellite service ASN and specialty channels CTV Newsnet and Talk TV. It also
has major stakes in The Comedy Network, CTV Pay-Per-View Sports, CTV Sportsnet,
Outdoor Life Network and History Television.
</P>
<P>
	   CTV is seeking government approval for its purchase of a 68.5 percent stake
in NetStar Communications Inc., which runs The Sports Network, Dome Productions
Inc. and the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, BCE announced an offer to buy Teleglobe Inc. for $6.65
billion in stock, giving the Toronto-based company access to an international
telecommunications transmission network.

<HEADLINE> Va. Firm Bids for 2 NY Nuke Plants  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN BREZOSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Virginia energy provider Dominion Resources offered
$686 million for the two nuclear power plants operated by the New York Power
Authority, topping an earlier offer by Louisiana's Entergy Corp. by more than 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Jim Norville said Friday the offer reflected Dominion's intention
to compete across the Eastern Seaboard states which consume 40 percent of the
nation's power.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. offered $638 million for the same
plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The Power Authority's nuclear facilities are the James A. Fitzpatrick
nuclear power plant north of Syracuse and the Indian Point 3 nuclear plant in
New York City's northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the NYPA board and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to
approve either deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The NYPA is the largest state-owned power organization. It is unloading most
of its power-generating plants as part of New York's electricity deregulation
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Dominion, based in Richmond, Va., owns and operates the North Anna Power
Station, which has two 950-megawatt pressurized water reactors, and the Surry
Power Station, which has two 850-megawatt reactors. Both sites are in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   The company serves 4 million retail gas and electric customers in five
states, with a 20,000-megawatt generating capacity, and an additional 6,000
megawatts under development. Dominion is also one of the largest independent oil
and natural gas exploration and production companies in North America, with 3
trillion cubic feet of reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   For Entergy, the purchase would be the second in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In July, Entergy bought the Pilgrim Nuclear Station at Plymouth, Mass., from
Boston Edison for $81 million, the first nuclear plant sale by a utility in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also operates four nuclear plants, including Arkansas Nuclear One in
Russellville, Ark.; Waterford 3 at Taft, La.; the River Bend station near St.
Francisville, La.; and Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Miss. It is
also managing the decommissioning of the Maine Yankee plant near Wiscasset,
Maine, and Northeast Utilities' Milestone Unit 1 station near Waterford,
Conn.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 6.9 Percent Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a speeding locomotive, the U.S. economy grew at a
6.9 percent rate in the last quarter of 1999, its fastest pace in more than
three years. Economists said the rapid growth makes it all but certain the Fed
will boost interest rates in the coming months to slow the economy and keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised estimate in the gross domestic product -- the total output of
goods and services -- eclipsed most analysts' expectations and showed the
economy growing at a much more robust pace than the 5.8 percent fourth-quarter
rate the government estimated a month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department said Friday that the economy's performance in the
final three months of last year matched a 6.9 percent growth spurt posted in the
second quarter of 1996 and hasn't been exceeded since a 7.2 percent rate of
increase at the end of 1987. The economy sprinted past the third quarter's 5.7
percent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy boomed, skyrocketed, soared, was on fire -- no matter what
descriptor you choose, it will be an understatement," said economist Joel Naroff
of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer and government spending and a strong build-up in business
inventories added to fourth-quarter growth, while the bloated U.S. trade deficit
subtracted from it.
</P>
<P>
	   With investors expecting supercharged growth, financial markets showed scant
reaction to the report. The Dow Jones, which has been volatile over fears of
higher interest rates, lost more than 150 points, and the Nasdaq, after a small
gain, went into negative territory in early afternoon. Bond prices were largely
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the report makes it likely that Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan and his colleagues will boost interest rates on March 21 and
again on May 16. The central bank has raised rates four times since June to slow
the barreling economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed has to work even harder to get the economy to slow," said Mark
Zandi, an economist with RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's preferred speed limit is in the 3 percent range, believed to be
the growth rate that can be sustained without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy was smoking during the fourth quarter. Fire chief Alan
Greenspan is determined to extinguish this blaze before it turns into a
five-alarm fire," said economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the red-hot growth, inflation, while picking up, remained
relatively well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP and watched closely by Greenspan rose at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, the same as previously
estimated but higher than the 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,
has been powering the speeding economy. In the fourth quarter, consumer spending
rose at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, more brisk than the 4.9 percent rate of
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains, Americans have
been feeling wealthy and in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending pulled the nation's savings rate, which reflects savings
as a percentage of disposable income, to a record quarterly low of 1.8 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter.
But that's not as dire as it seems, because the calculation doesn't take into
account gains realized from such things as rising stock market values and higher
real estate values for homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Confident that consumers will keep spending, businesses increased their
stockpiles to $68.7 billion, up from $38 billion in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists believe both strong inventory building and robust consumer
spending partially reflected hoarding related to fears about possible problems
from the Year 2000 computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spending, meanwhile, grew by 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
more than double the 4.5 percent rate of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit was the one blot on an otherwise stellar economy.
Exports grew by an 8.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter, but imports climbed
faster at a 10 percent rate. Both exports and imports grew more briskly in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists predict the economy will slow to around a 4 percent rate in the
current first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home
sales fell by 10.7 percent in January, the biggest plunge since April 1995, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million units, reflecting higher
mortgage rates and record low supply.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops Another 180 to 9,912  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell below the psychologically charged
10,000-level today as investors continued to put selling pressure on old guards
like General Electric and Coke.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hours before the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial average was
hovering near its lows of the day, down 180.25 at 9,912.38.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which had been up earlier in the day, was down
15.04 at 4,602.61. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 17.17 at 1,336.26.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies that
promise faster profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow lower was Wal-Mart, off 3 1/2 to 44 3/8, 3M, off 3 11/16 to
87 5/16, and GE, down 3 5/16 at 127 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   This morning the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a 6.9
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest pace in
more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product -- the
total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were largely expecting the strong growth, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Holding up the Nasdaq were companies like Oracle, up 6 1/16 at 68, and
Commerce One, up 22 1/4 at 201 1/4, on news the two companies were combining
their Internet business exchanges for the automakers General Motors, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way. The industrial stocks have
been hurt in particular by fears of higher rates that would curtail their
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, interest rate concerns sent the Dow down 133.10 to 10,092.63
after the index dipped as low as 9,942.78. The technology-dominated Nasdaq
closed up 67.32 to 4,617.65, bringing its two-day increase to 235.12.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a four-to-three margin today on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 730.24 million shares, down
from 753.57 million the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small companies, the only key stock index in
positive territory, rose 4.28 to 558.32.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Telecom Bids $1.6B for CTV  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's largest telecommunications company, BCE Inc., is
offering $1.6 billion in cash for CTV Inc., the country's biggest commercial
television broadcaster.
</P>
<P>
	   BCE wants to use programming from CTV to provide local and national content
for Sympatico-Lycos, its Internet portal. CTV owns one of Canada's three
national TV networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean C. Monty, president and CEO of Bell Canada's parent company, said the
acquisition would "squarely place BCE as a leading player in the converging
broadcasting and new media industries."
</P>
<P>
	   CTV's board was expected to meet soon to discuss the bid. The company's
stock jumped 23 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the news came out.
</P>
<P>
	   BCE's bid "fits very, very well into their overall strategy," said Fred
Ketchen, a stock analyst at ScotiaMcLeod.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can see where BCE wanted to go -- this gives them the opportunity to do
it. They've got greater opportunity for content -- by Internet, by satellite, by
regular TV; it's all there," Ketchen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Canadian regulations, 10 percent of the value of the transaction, or
about $160 million, will have to be spent to develop the broadcasting industry
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   CTV owns and operates 25 television stations, as well as the Atlantic
satellite service ASN and specialty channels CTV Newsnet and Talk TV. It also
has major stakes in The Comedy Network, CTV Pay-Per-View Sports, CTV Sportsnet,
Outdoor Life Network and History Television.
</P>
<P>
	   CTV is seeking government approval for its purchase of a 68.5 percent stake
in NetStar Communications Inc., which runs The Sports Network, Dome Productions
Inc. and the Discovery Channel.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, BCE announced an offer to buy Teleglobe Inc. for $6.65
billion in stock, giving the Toronto-based company access to an international
telecommunications transmission network.

<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- David Duchovny calls the Fox network's "Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire" a travesty.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a travesty when it was popular. Now it's a travesty that it's a

criticism by women's groups and revelations that millionaire Rick Rockwell had

	   Economy Grows at 6.9 Percent Rate

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy, propelled by hardy consumer
spending, surged ahead at a breakneck 6.9 percent annual rate
during the final three months of 1999 -- the strongest pace in more
than three years. The Commerce Department reported today that the
big advance in the gross domestic product -- the total output of
goods and services -- was even stronger than the sizzling 5.8
percent fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one
month ago. Today's revised estimate matched a 6.9 percent growth

<HEADLINE> Fairy Tale Opera Is a Delight  </HEADLINE>

<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The children's fairy tale Cinderella delighted and amused
the Metropolitan Opera's adult audience at a delicious first performance this
season of Rossini's "La Cenerentola."
</P>
<P>
	   The singers Thursday night all had the right kind of voices for this opera:
beautiful tones and the flexibility to handle the fast notes. Sometimes they
were almost singing patter songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossini also wrote ensembles, duets, trios, etc., in "La Cenerentola," and
the voices blended marvelously. Good acting and comic timing were in evidence
throughout.
</P>
<P>
	   The evening began with promise. After Bruno Campanella, a specialist in bel
canto operas, conducted the overture, there was so much applause that the
conductor and orchestra took a bow. Campanella was making his Metropolitan
debut.
</P>
<P>
	   Mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore starred as Cinderella. She lightly tossed off
the high coloratura, and in her lower range her voice was plush and velvety.
</P>
<P>
	   Joyce Guyer and Patricia Risley sang her stepsisters. Pretty and slim, their
unattractiveness was in their nasty competitiveness, haughty manners, and
insults to their servant, Cinderella, and a man they think is a valet.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenor Raul Gimenez sang Don Ramiro, the prince. Near the end of the opera,
Gimenez has some very high notes, and he hit them squarely. Alessandro Corbelli
sang Dandini, Ramiro's valet.
</P>
<P>
	   The prince meets Cinderella early in the opera when he comes to her
stepfather's home to check out the three young women there. He and his valet
trade clothes, so he can better observe the women. For Ramiro and Cinderella,
it's love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
	   Dandini obviously enjoys impersonating the prince, and Corbelli's walk,
between a strut and a slope, conveys it. Throughout, Corbelli was a master of
comic timing, as was Cinderella's stepfather, played by Simone Alaimo in a
fright wig. Their playing was broad but not overdone.
</P>
<P>
	   The chorus is male, usually seen in matching black suits. But in Alaimo's
one big number, in which he has been made the prince's wine steward, the chorus
men, playing drunk, wear wine waiter aprons.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of a fairy godmother, Rossini has an angel transform Cinderella so
she can go to the ball. The angel was sung with substance and focus by
bass-baritone John Relyea, in his Met debut.
</P>
<P>
	   The audience laughed when, after Relyea took off the hooded cloak that made
him seem a beggar, angel wings popped open on the back of his suit. Then a small
dressing room on a huge hook and chain dropped to the stage and Cinderella found
a ballgown inside.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1817 opera was first performed by the Met in 1997 with Corbelli making
his Met debut as Dandini, and Alaimo and Guyer in the cast.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a sense of jolly partnership and delightful music flowed from
the stage and orchestra pit.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton cut short a speech today and left a
downtown hotel when a fire alarm sounded while he was delivering a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You want us to leave?'' Clinton asked. With that, he stopped his remarks
and calmly walked out of the ballroom of the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel after
three uniformed Secret Service officers entered the room and asked everyone to
leave.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm had sounded earlier during introductory remarks by Commerce
Secretary William Daley but then went off. It resumed when Clinton began to
speak, and the president joked about it and asked if someone could find a way to
silence the noise. As it continued, Clinton asked if it was a real alert.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was whisked to his limousine. It was not known whether there
was an actual fire or not.

<HEADLINE> CVS Denies Interest in Rival Chain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WOONSOCKET, R.I. (AP) -- CVS Corp. denied Friday that it plans to buy the
pharmacy benefits business of rival Rite Aid Corp. after a published report said
it was one of two bidders for the operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid shares plunged more than 20 percent, losing $1.81 1/4 from late
Thursday to trade at $7.81 1/4 in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wall Street Journal reported that CVS, the nation's second largest chain
of drug stores, was one of two bidders for Rite Aid's PCS Health Systems, which
administers prescription benefits for more than 50 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The identity of the other bidder was not known.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, CVS issued a brief statement Friday that it does not intend to
buy the business. The company, based in Woonsocket, offered no additional
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   It already operates a benefits manager called PharmaCare, which covers 8
million people.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid spokeswoman Allison Costello said Rite Aid doesn't comment on
speculation about transactions, mergers or acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pa., has been plagued by accounting troubles
and wants to sell the business to raise cash and reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The operator of the country's third-largest drug-store chain, Rite Aid
bought the pharmacy benefits management business last year for $1.5 billion from
Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., which paid $4 billion for the unit in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Rite Aid's financial woes sent the company's stock tumbling by more than 80
percent in a year. The company has switched auditing firms and a restatement of
its earnings for the past three years was expected to result in a $500 million
reduction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Indian Program Boost  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton brought American Indian tribal leaders
to the White House on Friday to publicize his plan to pump $1.2 billion more
into federal Indian programs. ``There is no better time than now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While some of today's tribes have found success in our new economy, far
too many have been caught in the cycle of poverty and unemployment,'' said
Clinton, flanked by a dozen tribal leaders. ``Too many have suffered from
government's failure to invest proper resources in education, infrastructure and
health care.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's 2001 budget proposal would increase overall spending on Indian
programs by more than 12 percent to $9.4 billion. It would devote more money to
building and repairing reservation schools and roads, enhancing law enforcement
and improving health care for the country's 2.4 million American Indians.
</P>
<P>
	   Tribal leaders who met with Clinton said they support the proposal as a good
first step toward reversing declines in safety and opportunity for members of
the 558 tribes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the first time in history that we've gotten such (proposed) large
increases in some areas,'' said Kelsey Begaye, president of the Navajo Nation,
the country's largest tribe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It means a lot. Not just the math, but the meaning and the policy behind
it,'' said Brian Wallace, chairman of the Washoe tribe of Nevada and California.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton cited a host of statistics that outline the problems Indians face:
one-third live in poverty, they are twice as likely as other Americans to be
victims of violent crime, reservation unemployment rates can reach as high as 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These facts are discouraging but clearly not irreversible,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tribal leaders said they would lobby Congress to back the Clinton budget
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to take a lot of action from Indian Country to make sure the
pressure's on,'' said Susan Masten, chairwoman of California's Yurok tribe and
president of the National Congress of American Indians.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was evacuated from a downtown hotel
today after a fire alarm sounded while he was delivering a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm went off just after Clinton began a speech for the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Awards at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel. A fire had
broken out in the hotel laundry room.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, apparently unaware of the fire, tried to continue his remarks after
joking about the noise. But when three uniformed Secret Service officers entered
the room, he asked, ``Do you want us to leave?''
</P>
<P>
	   They motioned for everyone to leave, so Clinton calmly walked out of the

to Clinton's limousine and whisked back to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon arriving at the White House, Clinton stepped out of his limousine and
waved to reporters before walking up to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was confined to the hotel's service area, according to Gwendolyn
Smith, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Fire and Emergency Medical
Services. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm had sounded earlier during introductory remarks by Daley, but
stopped. It resumed when Clinton began to speak, and the president joked about
it and asked if someone could find a way to silence the noise. As it continued,

<HEADLINE> Santana Reveals He Was Molested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Grammy-winning guitarist Carlos Santana says he was
sexually molested as a child.
</P>
<P>
	   Santana told Rolling Stone magazine an American man who often bought him
toys and gifts brought him across the border from Tijuana, Mexico, and abused
him "almost every other day" for about two years, when he was 10 to 12 years
old.
</P>
<P>
	   "My first encounter with sexuality was not a pleasant one or romantic or
tender or wonderful," he said in an interview for the magazine's March 16 issue.
"It was more like a shock kind of thing; gross, disgusting shock."
</P>
<P>
	   Santana, who won eight Grammys on Wednesday, said the experience left him
with a great deal of anger. He didn't deal with it until 1995, when his wife
pushed him to enter therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   "You want to get angry with yourself for not knowing better," he said. "The
mind has a very insidious way of making you feel guilty: You're the guilty
party, shame on you, you're the one who brought this on yourself."

<HEADLINE> Strategies Offered for State Growth  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the new technology-based national economy, state
governments must reinvent themselves to keep skilled workers, entrepreneurs and
private investment within state borders, a new report to the nation's governors
says.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, being released Saturday at the winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association, offers a variety of strategies for states to compete and
grow in a ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Suggestions include turning over some government functions to private
companies, re-evaluating taxes and regulations that may hamper expansion of
technological businesses and establishing sites on the World Wide Web to provide
government information and services to the citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is appropriate at our first meeting of the 21st century that we examine
the extraordinary opportunity governors have to create a dynamic new government
that reflects the technological era we are living in today,'' Utah Gov. Michael
O'Leavitt, the association's chairman, said in a written statement. ``Whether we
meet the challenge and seize this opportunity will define America's future.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the conference, the governors will attend sessions and share ideas on
how to spur state economies through technology, ensure broadband access and
examine the impact of a technology-based economy on the environment and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors are scheduled to meet Monday with President Clinton and
Tuesday, the final day of the four-day conference, with members of the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Some other recommendations for state governments in the report:
</P>
<P>
	   --Decentralize decision-making by getting local groups and institutions
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   --Consider forming partnerships with private companies, unions, nonprofit
organizations, churches and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   --Invest in higher education in a way that ensures it is market-driven and
responsive to the needs of state businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   --Create opportunities for development and research within the state's
university systems and facilitate commercialization of the products that result
by establishing so-called business ``incubators.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Support work force training to improve skills and to help citizens rise to
higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Enhance the state's physical infrastructure to ensure that transportation
and telecommunications systems can keep up with growth.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls Below 10,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell below the psychologically charged
10,000-level today as investors continued to put selling pressure on old guards
like IBM and 3M.
</P>
<P>
	   With less than an hour before the closing bell, the Dow Jones industrial
average was hovering near its lows of the day, down 157.29 at 9,935.34.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was down 1.40 at 4,616.25. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 15.88 at 1,337.55.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies that
promise faster profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow lower was IBM, down 4 1/8 at 106 11/16, and 3M, down 4 1/8
at 86 7/8. Also taking a hit: General Electric, off 3 9/16 at 127 7/16 and
Hewlett Packard, down 3 1/8 at 126 3/8.
</P>
<P>
	   This morning the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a 6.9
percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest pace in
more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product -- the
total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way. The industrial stocks have
been hurt in particular by fears of higher rates that would curtail their
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the big winners of the day were Oracle, up 7 5/8 at 69 9/16, and
Commerce One, up 34 7/8 at 213 7/8. The two companies announced they were
combining their Internet business exchanges for the automakers General Motors,
Ford and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a four-to-three margin today on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 857.30 million shares, down
from 906.27 million the same time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of small companies, the only key stock index in
positive territory, rose 5.59 to 559.63.

<HEADLINE> French Economy Grows 2.7 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PARIS (AP) -- The French economy has entered a period of strong growth,
figures released Friday show, growing 0.9 percent in the final three months of
last year and 2.7 percent in 1999 as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   Buoyed by low interest rates and a relatively weak euro, the French economy
expanded by close to an annualized 4 percent in the second half of last year, up
from just 2 percent during the first six months. First half growth was hampered
by the ill effects of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Other figures out Friday added to the optimism, showing high business
confidence in France while consumer spending rose 1.4 percent in January, above
market expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   With the German economy also looking up, evidence of strong growth in France
has strengthened calls for the European Central Bank to tighten the screw,
lifting interest rates to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   But euro-zone governments have also been attempting to talk up the euro in
recent months, underlining the single currency's potential to rise against the
U.S. dollar. An appreciation in the value of the euro could help put off
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   Underpinned by strong domestic demand, France's economic growth is not
expected to let up. Economists peg growth this year at around 3.5 percent, and
regard the government's own official estimate of 2.6 percent to 3 percent as
excessively conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   This is France's most sustained period of economic well-being since before
the oil shock of the mid-1970s. It has allowed the leftist coalition government
of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to make political capital out of strong growth
and the resulting lower unemployment. The government has also promised to cut
taxes by $27 billion over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The government forecasts that unemployment, the most nagging economic
problem, will come down to single digits by the end of this year from its
current level of 11 percent. Government critics have said falling unemployment
is being achieved by the creation of thousands of part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The shortened workweek instituted by Jospin -- down to 35 hours from 39
hours -- was aimed at creating more jobs by hiring more personnel to maintain
levels of productivity.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Sends Farm Commodities Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat prices plummeted Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade,
falling to seven-week lows on outlooks for more wet weather in the Midwestern
and Plains states. Other grains and soybeans also fell.
</P>
<P>
	   Moisture levels in the winter wheat belt, which accounts for 70 percent of
U.S. wheat, have improved sharply in recent days and the trend is expected to
continue as more rain heads for the region.
</P>
<P>
	   That means investors are eager to bring wheat prices lower, after pushing
them higher on the assumption that dryness would harm the quality of the current
U.S. crop.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also was dragged lower by soybeans, which also took a tumble.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans were pressured by forecasts for weekend rain in key growing areas
of the Midwest along with beneficial crop weather expected in South America over
the coming days.
</P>
<P>
	   The rainy outlook weighed almost as heavily on corn futures, which closed at
a seven-week low. The fall was not as steep as that of wheat, in part because of
stronger-than-expected weekly export sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for May delivery fell 8 cents to $2.59 1/4 a bushel; May corn fell 3
1/4 cents to $2.21 1/2 a bushel; May oats fell  3/4 cent to $1.15 a bushel; May
soybeans fell 8 1/4 cents to $5.05 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures rose on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle rose .35 cent to 71.32 cents a pound; March feeder cattle
rose .35 cent to 83.27 cents a pound; April lean hogs rose .60 cent to 57.65
cents a pound; March pork bellies rose 1.05 cent to 90 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Fendi Designs in the Lap of Luxury  </HEADLINE>
    By DANIELA PETROFF AP Fashion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) -- Karl Lagerfeld is in his element in the latest round of
"moda Milanese" with a collection dedicated to glitz and extravagance.
</P>
<P>
	   Excessive and eccentric, the designer wallows in the glamour of rich furs,
ostentatious styles and shiny fabrics. And lots of gold is on its way in his
Fendi 2000-2001 fall-winter collection, presented Thursday, including belts,
purses, chains and fabrics, plus shoes with a six-inch gold heel and a gold
ankle strap.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from being very rich, the collection is also very French in its
unabashed show of extravagance.
</P>
<P>
	   Far from the understated, well-tailored look that put Italian ready to wear
on the international fashion map several decades ago, everything in the latest
Fendi collection is "exagere." It includes furs with gold threading, super long
hemlines, maxi sized fur bags, new boxy baguette bags and over the knee high
boots.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if not intended, the Gallic influence was a reminder that Rome-based
Fendi is now in the hands of French luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moet
Chandon, which together with Prada bought more than 50 percent of the company in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   In the realm of sheer beauty on either side of the Alps, Lagerfeld created a
series of irresistible white mink coats decorated with delicate multicolored
geometric patterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Also extravagant, but in a very Italian way, were the duo Dolce and Gabbana,
who presented their winter fantasy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   To underline the eccentric theme of their collection, the designers turned
the garden of their downtown Milan palazzo into the salon of an eccentric
countess, hanging an Andy Warhol print in a room decorated with brocade wall
paper and a Venetian chandelier.
</P>
<P>
	   The countess wore tweed knickerbockers and a lurex striped tank top under a
reversible patterned mink coat. At night, she shone in an evening gown covered
in 2,645 Swarowski crystal beads weighing 20 pounds that costs $25,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Her favorite leather for belts and the eccentric platform sandals is
crocodile; her favorite fabric is brocade. By day or night, she is never without
her beaded beret and extra long beaded scarf.
</P>
<P>
	   Things were quieter on the Milan runway Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Consuelo Castiglione for Marni showed naif tulip floral print sweaters worn
with long felt skirts by day and little silver lame cardigans over thrift shop
styles by night. In an ordinary season these outfits would have been cute but
they paled next to the current glam feast.
</P>
<P>
	   Glamour for Rebecca Moses was more in the street than the sumptuous home,
with mink fur cut to resemble a pair of jeans, jean jacket or argyle bustier.
Prosaic corduroy is trimmed in fox.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Some Human Rights Gains  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Russia of
brutality in Chechnya and demanded Friday a full and open investigation into
reports of massacres in the rebellious region.
</P>
<P>
	   She said whole Chechen neighborhoods had been devastated through
indiscriminate attacks by Russian troops in their offensive to quell the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing the State Department's annual global human rights report,
Albright singled out not only Russia but Sudan, Cuba, North Korea and Burma as
countries whose governments must change their ways.
</P>
<P>
	   And at this end, she said, ``We have a responsibility to keep the spotlight
turned on high until they do.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the bright side in 1999, free elections in Indonesia and Nigeria, two of
the world's most populous states, put more people under democratic rule than at
any time since the fall of the Berlin Wall 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   In Russia, which the report said has built well-defined constitutional
structures, the government's human rights record last year was described as
uneven and even worse in some respects.
</P>
<P>
	   Government forces killed numerous civilians through the use of
indiscriminate force in Chechnya, the report said, and security officials beat
many people to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the report said, human rights groups allege that 10,000 to 20,000
people die annually in extremely harsh Russian prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   In other areas, Harold Koh, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said abuses in China multiplied even as the Clinton administration attempted to
promote reform through engagement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities intensified efforts to suppress those considered threatening to
the government, and political and religious dissenters faced widespread
repression, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also rejected calls by critics for restrictions on U.S. trade with
China. She said prospects for progress through ties with China were better than
if ties were cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Koh said there was marked deterioration in China last year. ``There
is a limit to how much you can do,'' he said when reminded at a news conference
that President Clinton has pursued an engagement policy for years.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said his faith was unshakable that contact with China is the best way
to foster human rights improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Cuba's suppression of
opponents and other critics of President Fidel Castro's government, North
Korea's near-total ban on organized opposition, the disappearance of two
well-known dissidents in Belarus, summary executions in Iraq and murder of human
rights activists by paramilitary forces in Colombia were among abuses listed in
the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certain countries seem to take particular pleasure in restricting the
right to democratic dissent,'' the report said, citing Cuba and Yugoslavia's
Serbian republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said international intervention in the Serbian province of
Kosovo and in East Timor, a region where a vote for independence from Indonesia
in August led to a crackdown, ``demonstrated that the international community
has the will and the capacity to act against the most profound violations of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday night, the Senate moved to bring increased international
monitoring of the human rights situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   A resolution proposed by Sen. Paul D. Wellstone, D-Minn., also urged Russia
to halt its military operations in the republic and begin peace talks with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must fully condemn the use of indiscriminate force against the
civilians in Chechnya and denial of humanitarian relief to Chechen civilians,''
Wellstone said. ``We must remind the Russian leadership that the world is
watching.''

<HEADLINE> Mint Speeds Sacagawea Coin Delivery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Mint is speeding delivery of its new Sacagawea
dollar coin to community banks, which had complained that the popular coins were
difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
	   Up to 50 million of the golden-colored coins will be shipped directly to
small financial institutions, including community banks, by registered mail --
the same way the Mint sent the coins to Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores last
month.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint shipped 100 million dollar coins to the Federal Reserve's 12
regional banks by truck last month. Individual banks then make arrangements to
get the coins from the Fed banks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This program is designed to augment, not replace, the routine delivery of
coins through the Federal Reserve System,'' Mint Director Philip Diehl said in a
statement Thursday. ``We want to get as many Golden Dollars to these (small
financial) institutions as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Mint has been aggressively marketing the new dollar coins, particularly
mindful of the flop of the Susan B. Anthony dollar coins, which often were
mistaken for quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   From March 1 through March 31, banks and other financial institutions will
be able to order the new dollar coins online via the Mint's Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   By the end of March, the Mint said it expects to have placed 350 million
Golden Dollars into circulation -- about 200 million through the Federal Reserve
System and the rest through direct shipment to retailers and small financial
institutions.

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Human Rights Report  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Highlights of the State Department's annual human rights report:
</P>
<P>
	   --China: Authorities broadened and intensified efforts to suppress those
perceived to threaten government power or national stability. ``Citizens who
sought to express openly dissenting political and religious views faced
widespread repression.'' In the weeks leading up to major events last year,
including the 50th anniversary of founding of the People's Republic of China,
the government moved against political dissidents across the country, detaining
and formally arresting scores of activists.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Russia: Russian attacks on separatists in Chechnya included airstrikes and
indiscriminate shellings of cities inhabited mainly by civilians. ``These
attacks, which in turn led to house-to-house fighting in Grozny, led to the
deaths of numerous civilians and the displacement of hundreds of thousands
more.'' Credible reports had Russian military forces carrying out summary
executions of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   --North Korea: Government repression is so severe that no organized
opposition is known to exist. ``The government regards almost any independent
activity -- including listening to foreign broadcasts, writing letters and
possessing `reactionary' printed matter -- as crimes against the state.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Burma: The military intensified its systematic use of coercion and
intimidation to restrict further freedom of association. ``Authorities undertook
a sustained, systematic campaign to destroy the National League for Democracy
without formally banning it.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Iraq: The regime continued to commit widespread, serious and systematic
rights abuses, summarily executing actual and perceived political opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   --Syria: The government uses ``its vast powers to quash all organized
political opposition.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sudan: The government continues to restrict most civil liberties,
including freedom of assembly, association, religion and movement. ``Government
security forces regularly tortured, beat, harassed, arbitrarily arrested and
detained opponents or suspected opponents of the government.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Sierra Leone: Rebel forces committed ``numerous egregious abuses,
including murder, abduction, deliberate mutilations and rape.'' Pro-government
militias also committed abuses, albeit on a lesser scale.
</P>
<P>
	   --Cuba: The government of President Fidel Castro continued to suppress
opposition and criticism. ``Cuban authorities routinely harass, threaten,
arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison and defame human rights advocates and
members of independent professional associations.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Iran: The government's record remained poor, but efforts within society to
make the government accountable intensified. Religious minorities, particularly
Baha'is, continued to suffer repression by conservative elements of the
judiciary and security forces.
</P>
<P>
	   --Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire): Widespread killing of
Tutsis in 1998 did not continue in 1999, but the government failed to prosecute
any state officials or others in the killings.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Falls to 760  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and natural
gas in the United States fell this week by 13 to 760.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the rigs running nationwide, 156 were exploring for oil and 604 were
looking for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported Friday. During the
same week last year, 533 rigs were operating in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally peaked at
4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil boom but set several record
lows last year, bottoming out at 498 on April 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Louisiana gained five rigs and
Califonia gained three. Texas lost six, New Mexico five, Oklahoma three and
Wyoming one.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska's count remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Below 10,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed below the
psychologically charged 10,000-level today for the first time since April 1999
as investors continued to put selling pressure on old guards like IBM and 3M.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow fell 223.61, or 2.2 percent, to 9,869.02, according to preliminary
calculations. That brings the Dow's drop for the week to 350 points, and its
drop for the year to 1,627 points or 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed Thursday at a record high, fell
27.65 today to 4,590.00.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies that
promise faster profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors hammered Dow stalwarts like General Electric, IBM, 3M and Hewlett
Packard today.
</P>
<P>
	   This morning, the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a
6.9 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest
pace in more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product --
the total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way. The industrial stocks have
been hurt in particular by fears of higher rates that would curtail their
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the big winners of the day were Oracle and Commerce One, which
announced they were combining their Internet business exchanges for the
automakers General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   The news, however, had little bounce for shares of General Motors and Ford
because investors are worried higher interest rates in the future will hurt
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The market's decline today "is very troubling," said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When you get declines of the magnitude
we've had this year, it's very demoralizing ... and can invite more selling."

<HEADLINE> Govt. Presses for Tobacco Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department urged a federal judge Friday to
keep its massive lawsuit against the tobacco industry alive because the
cigarette companies "pose a continuing threat to the health and well-being of
the American public."
</P>
<P>
	   In several documents filed with U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler, the
department argued that the companies made "multiple legal errors" in their
motions last December to dismiss the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
	   The government accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for 45 years to
mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and seeks to recover billions of
dollars spent by Medicare and other federal health programs treating
smoking-induced illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   When the lawsuit was filed last September, Attorney General Janet Reno said
federal health plans spend more than $20 billion a year treating smoking-related
illnesses, which take 400,000 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry lawyers contended that no court had ever recognized the
government's right to recover payments it made under the Medicare health
program. But the Justice Department said, "That argument asks the court to
ignore the plain statutory language of the Medical Care Recovery Act ... (which)
authorizes the United States to recover all medical costs that it is 'authorized
or required by law to furnish or pay for'."
</P>
<P>
	   To the industry's complaint that the government had never before brought
such a case, the Justice Department replied, "What makes this suit unique is the
conduct of these corporations, which for decades have deliberately and
successfully addicted millions of citizens to a product that defendants have
long known causes suffering and death. ... Defendants cannot rely on the sheer
massiveness of their wrongdoing to defeat this suit."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the industry reached settlements with all 50 states. It agreed to
pay states $246 billion to settle lawsuits they filed to recover the cost of
treating sick smokers in the Medicaid program, which serves poor and disabled
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco lawyers argued that many of the federal government's non-monetary
demands are already required by those state settlements, such as a ban on
attempts to target children in advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department replied that the state settlements "did not speak to
the far greater costs that the same unlawful conduct has imposed on Medicare,
the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the Indian Health Service, the
health care programs of the military branches and the Department of Veterans
Affairs."
</P>
<P>
	   And, the state settlements "did not impose restraints that will definitively
end the defendants' unlawful conduct, prevent them from improperly profiting
from the conduct or eliminate the severe future public health consequences of
that conduct," the department added.
</P>
<P>
	   The department also said industry lawyers erred in suggesting the government
was required to show before trial how remedies under the federal racketeering
law, used in one portion of the lawsuit, might restrain future wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit was filed against Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,
American Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co.,
British American Tobacco Ltd., Liggett and Myers Inc., the Council for Tobacco
Research-USA and the Tobacco Institute.

<HEADLINE> Fox Swears Off Exploitive Shows  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox says it is swearing off exploitative reality TV shows.
But the promise sounds similar to one made in January -- a month before it aired
the wedding of two strangers and a motorcyclist's jump over a moving train.
</P>
<P>
	   Battered by bad publicity over "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire," top
Fox executive Sandy Grushow said in Friday's edition of The New York Times that
the network was shutting the door on the programming genre it pioneered.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're gone," he said. "They're over."
</P>
<P>
	   But Grushow, appointed last year as chairman of the Fox Television Group,
told reporters in January that he wanted to move away from the stunts because
programs like "When Good Pets Go Bad" or "World's Scariest Police Shootouts" had
damaged Fox's reputation.
</P>
<P>
	   "For a while, those programs brilliantly masked many of the growing problems
on the Fox schedule," Grushow said in January. "But, unfortunately, this
overreliance, oversaturation, has really come back this season to bite us on our
collective Fox behind."
</P>
<P>
	   A month after he said this, Fox aired "Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   The show was a sensation, drawing nearly 23 million viewers when Rick
Rockwell and Darva Conger exchanged vows. Fox immediately announced plans to
rerun a part of the broadcast a week later.
</P>
<P>
	   When questions were raised about Rockwell's background, including
allegations that he hit an ex-girlfriend, Fox quickly retreated. It canceled the
rerun and said it wouldn't air any future multimillionaire weddings.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, however, Fox aired another special featuring daredevil Robbie
Knievel in a live motorcycle jump over a train. He emerged unhurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Grushow hasn't responded to interview requests from The Associated Press to
address whether this month's specials contradicted his earlier stated intentions
to back away from the reality genre.
</P>
<P>
	   He tried to draw a distinction in January between "blood and guts" reality
specials that featured car chases and shootouts, and "entertainment reality,"
which would seem to include prime-time weddings. Fox has likened Knievel's
stunts to watching a circus tightrope performer.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that Fox would still air some reality shows because they had
already paid for them. "Right now we're sort of on the methadone program," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   These specials are enormously tempting for television executives because
they are far cheaper to produce than traditional comedies and dramas and often
get strong ratings, said Tom DeCabia, executive vice president of the media
buying firm Schulman Advanswers NY.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like someone who goes to their boss and says, 'We can make something
at half the cost that will make twice as much money,"' he said. "The boss would
say, 'Go do it, but don't embarrass us.' This has turned into an embarrassing
situation and now they have to fix it."
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear whether any Fox executives will lose their jobs in the
"Multimillionaire" fallout.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Darnell, Fox's executive vice president of alternative programming,
conceived the special and is the industry leader in creating reality shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, Grushow described Darnell as "one of the finest creative
executives working in the business today."

<HEADLINE> Fire Alarm Shortens Clinton Speech  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was hustled out of a hotel ballroom
Friday after a fire alarm sounded as he delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm went off just after Clinton began his speech at the Marriott
Wardman Park Hotel for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, awarded for
corporate innovation. A fire had broken out in the hotel's laundry room.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently unaware of the fire, Clinton tried to continue his remarks after
joking about the noise. At one point he joked that because of the blaring alarm,
``The Marriott is not a candidate for the Baldrige Award.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Could somebody tell me what the deal is?'' Clinton finally asked. An aide
told him it was a fire alarm. ``Are we supposed to leave?'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not yet,'' the aide replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not yet?'' Clinton asked incredulously. ``That's not an encouraging
answer.''
</P>
<P>
	   But when three uniformed Secret Service officers entered the ballroom and
motioned for the audience of about 1,000 to leave, Clinton calmly walked out
with Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
	   They were taken down a stairwell to Clinton's limousine and driven back to
the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Upon arriving at the White House,
Clinton stepped out of his limousine and waved to reporters before walking to
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently a contract welder working near the laundry room set off a small
fire in the laundry room,'' Lockhart said. ``The fire marshals responded and
made the decision to evacuate the hotel. The president evacuated and came back
to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was confined to the hotel's service area, according to Gwendolyn
Smith, spokeswoman for the city's Department of Fire and Emergency Medical
Services. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm had sounded earlier during introductory remarks by Daley, but it
stopped then. It resumed when Clinton began to speak.

<HEADLINE> Unilever To Close St. Louis Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PAGEDALE, Mo. (AP) -- Unilever will shut down its suburban St. Louis plant
early next year, with much of the production moving to Baltimore, the company
has told the Missouri Division of Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 235 workers are expected to lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said Friday it will negotiate with the International Chemical
Workers union on benefits for the workers losing their jobs and ways to help
them find work.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant makes Snuggle and Final Touch liquid fabric softeners and Sunlight
and Dove dish washing detergents. Earlier this week, the company announced it
would shut down 100 of its 250 factories around the world and fire 25,000
workers. That's about 10 percent of Unilever's total work force.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said its goal was to boost profits and share price.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. announced Friday that it plans to

newspaper efforts on larger newspapers."
</P>

after consumers found shards of a soft drink can that accidentally went through
a vegetable dicer, the company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Five pieces of aluminum, ranging in length from an inch to almost 3 inches,
have been found in three cans of the soup, said John Faulkner, a spokesman for
the Camden, N.J., company. None of the metal was ingested, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The aluminum can apparently was caught in a load of carrots or potatoes, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recalled product is labeled "Campbell's Healthy Request Vegetable Beef
Condensed Soup." Some 168,000 cans of soup that was processed Sept. 27 are
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   Each can is stamped with the code "SEP 01 09279" and "EST 4K DEAL," plus
four digits that indicate military time.
</P>
<P>
	   The soup was distributed to stores in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas,
Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South
Dakota, the Agriculture Department said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers should return the soup to the store where they bought it, Faulkner
said. There is a toll-free telephone number on the label for consumers with
questions about the recall.

<HEADLINE> Agent Black Accused of Defrauding  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prominent sports agent William H. "Tank" Black has been
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of defrauding his athlete
clients of at least $5 million in investment scams.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Tampa, Fla., issued a restraining order Thursday against
Black and his business partner, the SEC announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Black denied the SEC's allegations, saying they "are false and do not
reflect actual events."
</P>
<P>
	   "We will respond vigorously with the facts at the appropriate time," he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC filed a civil lawsuit Thursday against Black; his firm, Professional
Management Inc.; James A. Franklin Jr., the firm's general counsel; and
Professional Management Consulting Inc., an affiliate of the firm owned by Black
and Franklin.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC had requested the temporary restraining order against Black,
Franklin and the two firms. It freezes their assets, bars them and their
employees from exercising any control over their clients' accounts, and requires
them to account for and bring back to this country all assets they hold
offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also is seeking unspecified fines and repayment of allegedly illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC said Black "repeatedly provided false evidence" during
its investigation that contradicted statements by his clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Black, who is from Columbia, S.C., became the center of an investigation by
University of Florida police last spring for possible illegal inducements he
gave to former university players.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities charged him in October with unlicensed agent activity in
the state. If convicted, he could face a $5,000 fine and up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Black's clients, whom he represents in contract negotiations with
their teams, are professional football players. In return for helping them get
lucrative National Football League contracts, he expects them to help him
recruit other players to his agency. He's built a multimillion-dollar business
using this network of players.
</P>
<P>
	   The 42-year-old Black, who got his nickname as a 10-pound, 15-ounce newborn,
grew up poor in Johnson City, Tenn. But he had enough athletic skill to become a
three-time NAIA All-American at Carson Newman as a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Clients or former clients include Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor, New
York Giants wide receiver Ike Hilliard and Philadelphia running back Duce
Staley.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor recently accused Black in a newspaper interview of cheating him out
of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Black also represents Vince Carter of the NBA's Toronto Raptors, one of the
game's brightest young stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Another former client, ex-Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth, has been
charged in the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the athletes were interviewed by SEC investigators preparing the
case against Black.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, Clarence Anthony, father of client Reidel Anthony, said Black
had recommended an investment as a good opportunity, telling him that prominent
people including the Rev. Jesse Jackson were involved in the venture.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an SEC document, Anthony, Carruth, Hilliard, Terry Allen and
Robert Brooks invested a total $6.1 million in one scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Franklin, 32, who also lives in Columbia, was not represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC alleged in its suit that beginning in early 1996, Black and his
business partner Franklin defrauded some two dozen athlete clients, reaping at
least $5 million through various schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   In one scheme, the SEC said, Black and Franklin advised clients to invest
millions in high-yield promissory notes that they said would finance an auto
title loan company called Cash 4 Titles. In fact, the SEC said, Black and
Franklin had a secret arrangement with the promoters of the promissory notes
that allowed them to skim their clients' profits and put the money into a
multi-million-dollar Ponzi scheme run out of the Cayman Islands in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Ponzi scheme, money from recent investors is used to pay returns to
earlier investors.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Below 10,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average closed below the
psychologically charged 10,000-level today for the first time since April 1999
as investors continued to put selling pressure on old guards like IBM and 3M.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow fell 223.61, or 2.2 percent, to 9,869.02, according to preliminary
calculations. That brings the Dow's drop for the week to 350 points, and its
drop for the year to 1,627 points or 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index, which closed Thursday at a record high, fell
27.65 today to 4,590.00.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies that
promise faster profit growth.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors hammered Dow stalwarts like General Electric, IBM, 3M and Hewlett
Packard today.
</P>
<P>
	   This morning, the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a
6.9 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest
pace in more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product --
the total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way. The industrial stocks have
been hurt in particular by fears of higher rates that would curtail their
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the big winners of the day were Oracle and Commerce One, which
announced they were combining their Internet business exchanges for the
automakers General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   The news, however, had little bounce for shares of General Motors and Ford
because investors are worried higher interest rates in the future will hurt
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
	   The market's decline today "is very troubling," said Hugh Johnson, chief
investment officer at First Albany Corp. "When you get declines of the magnitude
we've had this year, it's very demoralizing ... and can invite more selling."	  
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 20.10 to 1,333.33.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancing issues by a wide margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 1,805 down, 1,163 up and 449 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.06 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.17 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index, which was the only index in positive territory
today, rose 3.20 to 557.24.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.3 percent. Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 1.83 percent, Germany's DAX index was gained 1.28 percent and France's
CAC-40 was up 1.81 percent.

<HEADLINE> Oil Increase Said Unlikely in 2Q  </HEADLINE>
    By TAREK AL-ISSAWI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Producing nations likely won't raise oil
output before July because they fear a sharp fall in revenue, a Saudi oil
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks were likely to confirm market suspicions that producers' talk of
"stable prices" won't mean fast relief for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, crude oil for April delivery rose 38 cents to $30.35 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude closed at $27.48, up 11 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saudi official said there was an implicit agreement between producing
countries from inside and outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production "gradually as of the third or fourth quarters
of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Countries that import oil had hoped that OPEC ministers, scheduled to meet
at the end of March, would increase production to bring down prices starting in
the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, some oil producers, such as Mexico, have called for
OPEC to increase production beyond the current 22.976 million barrels a day set
by an agreement in March last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The market has closely watched the flurry of meetings held over the past
three days, and will be closely monitoring a March 2 meeting in London involving
the oil ministers of Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela -- the three nations
that put together the March 1999 agreement, which slashed producers' output by
more than 4 million barrels per day and sent prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices have nearly tripled since then, surging to the highest levels since
the eve of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saudi oil official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
producing nations feared that increasing output in the second quarter would
result in a sharp fall in prices, adversely affecting their revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   He said oil producers wanted to make sure that oil stocks in major
industrialized nations were low before an increase is implemented, otherwise,
prices would fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said there was a possibility
demand would fall in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot specify a stance now by producing countries on whether to
continue with the production cuts agreement or to increase production," Naimi
told reporters after receiving U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who
arrived from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson was to hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Naimi on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, the world's largest oil market, has been at the forefront
of calls to producing countries to raise their rates of production to increase
the world's supply of oil and bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday in Kuwait, Richardson said Washington does not want to
manipulate markets or dictate prices.
</P>
<P>
	   While a price of $10 a barrel was "much too low," $30 a barrel was too high,
Richardson said. "What we want to see is stability in the oil market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a meeting of Gulf oil ministers in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on
Wednesday, officials said the ministers favored a daily increase in production
of between 2 million and 2.5 million barrels -- about 8 percent to 10 percent.
That, they calculated, would lead to a price of crude oil of $20 to $25 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have said an increase of at least 2 million barrels a day is
needed to stabilize markets and make a sufficient impact on oil stocks.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Times To Sell Seven Newspapers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co. announced Friday that it plans to
sell seven of its smaller newspapers and the nine telephone directories that are
part of its Regional Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspapers and directories being sold accounted for approximately $52.7
million, or 2 percent, of the company's 1999 revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   "The decision to sell these smaller newspapers and directories is a result
of a review of the business portfolio of our Regional Newspaper Group," said
Russell T. Lewis, president and chief executive officer of the Times Company.
"We believe our shareholders will be better served by focusing our regional
newspaper efforts on larger newspapers."
</P>
<P>
	   The daily newspapers being sold include the Santa Barbara (Calif.)
News-Press, The Daily World in Opelousas, La., the Daily News in Palatka, Fla.,
and the Lake City (Fla.) Reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   The non-daily newspapers, all in Florida, are The News-Sun in Sebring/Avon

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presents Business Awards  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday presented the Malcolm Baldrige
National Quality Award to four companies whose performances have enhanced U.S.
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   The winners provide processed eggs, electronic circuits, business
consultation and luxury hotels. One firm, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company LLC,
won the award once before, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The awards were named in honor of Baldrige, commerce secretary under
President Reagan who died in a horseriding accident in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Atlanta-based Ritz-Carlton, the companies that received the award
were STMicroelectronics Inc., of Carrollton, Texas; BI, a business performance
company based in Minneapolis, Minn.; and Sunny Fresh Foods, of Monticello, Minn.
</P>
<P>
	   Several cheering BI employees stood and waved purple pom-poms as president
Guy Schoenecker accepted the award from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I thought about all the things that Minnesota has given our country --
Garrison Keillor, Jesse Ventura,'' Clinton told the crowd of about 1,000. ``This
is the only group I've ever seen that had pompom boys as well as pompom girls.''
</P>
<P>
	   The awards ceremony was cut short when the hotel ballroom was evacuated
because of a fire alarm. No injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Below 10,000  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Capping a string of Blue Fridays on Wall Street, the Dow
industrials closed below 10,000 for the first time in more than 10 months as
investors continued to abandon old guard stocks like IBM and 3M to chase the new
generation of dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow not only fell through the 10,000 barrier, but sank below 9,900. In
the broad selloff, the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index retreated after
two straight days of closing at all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 230.51, or by 2.3 percent, to
9,862.12. It was the first close below 10,000 since April 6, 1999, and the
lowest close since April 1, 1999, when it finished at 9,832.51.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow now has tumbled almost 16 percent since its record close of
11,722.98 on Jan. 14. A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a
"correction," or sudden, steep reversal in a rising market. Such a drop does not
necessarily mean the end to the bull market that has been raging since October
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.15 to 4,590.50.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which captures the biggest picture of the
market, ended down 20.07 at 1,333.36.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth Friday out of the last five that the Dow fell by more than
200 points and the sixth straight Friday decline for the stock market's
best-known indicator. For the week, the Dow lost 357 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is serious," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany
Corp. The market is sending a message that the economy and profit growth will
slow in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies and the
lure of faster profit growth. Investors hammered Dow stalwarts like General
Electric, which fell 5 5/16 to 125 11/16, and IBM, down 4 1/2 to 106, as well as
3M off 5 5/16 to 85 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anybody thinks (the drop) doesn't effect the investors' psyche, they're
wrong," Johnson said. "The decline itself can be demoralizing and can invite
more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday morning, the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a
6.9 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest
pace in more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product --
the total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology sector, however, continues to show pockets of strength. Among
the big gainers Friday were Commerce One, up 34 1/16 to 213 1/16, and Oracle, up
8 11/16 to 70 5/8. The two companies announced they were combining their
Internet business exchanges for the automakers General Motors, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler, which rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Small company stocks also have bucked the trend. The Russell 2000 index rose
2.70 Friday to 556.74.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.06 billion shares, down from
1.16 billion Thursday but still heavy. About three stocks fell in price for
every two that rose on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a different story overseas where markets closed higher before the
worst of the declines on Wall Street. In Japan, the Nikkei rose 1.3 percent. In
Europe, London's FT-SE rose 1.8 percent, the Paris CAC rose 1.8 percent, and the
German DAX rose 1.3 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure to lift sanctions, President Clinton said
Friday the United States will explore ways to relieve the suffering in Iraq if
it can be done without helping Saddam Hussein rebuild his weapons arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that shortages of food and medicine were the result of the
Iraqi president's policies, not the United Nations' embargo imposed after the
Gulf War. ``It's clear to everybody who has looked at the facts ... that they're
exporting about as much oil now as they were before the embargo was imposed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president spoke with reporters outside the White House as he left for a
speech at a nearby hotel. He cut short his address after a hotel fire alarm was
triggered by a small blaze in the laundry room.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his remarks with reporters, also said:
</P>
<P>
	   --International humanitarian agencies should be granted unfettered access to
Chechnya to investigate reports of atrocities by Russian troops. Clinton said
the reports were ``very troubling'' but added, ``In any conflict of any duration
there are always excesses. I'm not excusing anything.''
</P>
<P>
	   --China's threats against Taiwan should not prompt members of Congress to
vote against permanent trade benefits for Beijing. ``In the absence of some
destructive action,'' Clinton said, ``it would be a terrible mistake ... to use
this as an excuse to isolate China and almost guarantee the very things they say
they're worried about.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Persian Gulf oil ministers have agreed to increase production ``because
they believe it's in their long-term best interest ... to try to stabilize
prices at a lower rate.''
</P>
<P>
	   --It is impossible to judge whether Sen. John McCain or Texas Gov. George W.
Bush would be the strongest Republican candidate for the presidential race.
``Look how different today's facts are than the facts six months ago,'' Clinton
said. ``And six months from now, they might be different again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Clinton said he would explore ways to relieve suffering in Iraq,
the administration emphasized that it does not support easing the sanctions.
``What we are reviewing is whether there is some way to continue our policy of
meeting human needs without allowing Saddam Hussein to rearm,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``We believe that Saddam Hussein
knows what he needs to do to get out from under U.N. sanctions against his
country. And there will be no shift until he understands that and acts on it.''
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said the U.S. goal is to deny Saddam items that
would assist him in a weapons program without stopping exports that might help
extract oil that Iraq is permitted to sell for humanitarian purposes. Proceeds
must be used for food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the official said, chlorine, which could be used in water
purification, would now be cleared for export to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   The sanctions, imposed in 1990, were subsequently eased to permit Iraq to
sell $5.2 billion worth of oil every six months provided the revenue is used to
assist the Iraqi people. But even with oil prices soaring, Saddam deliberately
and cynically does not take advantage of the quota, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Western diplomats on the U.N. sanctions committee said they had seen no
easing of the hard-line U.S. position. The diplomats noted that recently as last
Friday, the United States canceled between 20 and 30 items, such as fork lifts
and car batteries, from a list of goods that could be approved automatically in
the sanctions committee.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. figures show that $1.77 billion worth of goods were frozen as of Feb.
21, nearly all of them frozen by put on hold by the United States.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean AIDS Explosion Examined  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE RELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Homophobia, sex tourism,
infidelity and poverty are major factors causing a rapid spread of AIDS and
increasingly infecting women in the Caribbean, international and regional health
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Societal norms encourage homosexuals to have heterosexual relationships, and
married men to have sex with other women, said experts and victims. Also,
poverty is forcing men and women to prostitution, often with tourists, they said
in a dramatic and uncharacteristically open discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   They spoke at a conference organized by the U.S. National Institutes of
Health that is being held simultaneously on five Caribbean islands in a
high-profile effort to stir debate and awareness about the once-taboo issues of
sexual promiscuity and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is definitely an epidemic, and in the Caribbean we have the second
largest incidence in the world after Africa," said Peggy McEvoy, Team Leader for
the Caribbean program for Geneva-based UNAIDS, which handles AIDS policy issues,
education and research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The islands with tourism are the ones that don't want to talk about it very
much," McEvoy said. "There's a tremendous amount of sexual activity involved
with tourism. There's a lot of fear that if tourists are aware they're not going
to come."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the number of people infected with the HIV virus in the Caribbean
is likely more than 500,000 and could be as high as 700,000 -- about double the
previously reported figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is that some countries keep track of AIDS but not HIV
infections. McEvoy cited the Dominican Republic, which reported a total of 4,230
cases of AIDS in August 1998. The latest U.N. estimates, from a December report,
say the country has 150,000 cases of HIV-positive and AIDS victims, said McEvoy.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighboring Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, said it had 4,967
total AIDS cases in 1998. McEvoy said UNAIDS officials believe there are 330,000
Haitians infected with the virus and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conference sessions are being broadcast live by satellite from the U.S.
Virgin Islands to some of the 2,300 health officials, AIDS activists and victims
meeting here and in Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
	   One dire statistic presented -- from a survey of 8,100 schoolchildren in
four English-speaking Caribbean islands -- has 42 percent experiencing sex
before the age of 10. The figure rises to 62 percent by age 12. That survey,
conducted by the Washington-based Organization of American States' Pan American
Health Organization, could reflect a high rate of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
	   A third of reported AIDS cases in the Caribbean are among women and the
percentage seems likely to grow, according to the Ministry of Health in Trinidad
and Tobago. It reported last year that seven of eight youths being infected
between the ages of 10 and 19 are female.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials at the conferences appeared to agree that there is a
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jamaica, Health Minister John Junor said the challenge was fighting "the
irresponsible sexual behavior of our men."
</P>
<P>
	   McEvoy noted that married women face high risks because their partners are
unfaithful and won't use condoms. "Married women (here) don't have the
negotiating power within a marriage to insist on a condom," she said. "Their
husbands would kick them out."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many women are unaware that their husbands are having
extramarital affairs, McEvoy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the territory's delegate to Congress, physician
Donna Christian-Christensen, cited "a great reluctance to talk about bisexuality
and little acceptance of men who have sex with men."
</P>
<P>
	   This, experts suggested, could lead bisexual or homosexual men to hide their
sexual behavior from their spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures on the epidemic are notoriously unreliable, in part because many
people who are infected deny they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   McEvoy also cited late reporting, no reporting, travel abroad to be tested
in addition to the poor reporting of HIV infections. But the number of reported
new cases alone increased by 26 percent last year, from 45,000 to 57,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Brendon Bain of the University of the West Indies medical school noted
that between 1 percent and 2 percent of Jamaica's 2.6 million people have AIDS
or are infected with HIV. But he cautioned that the numbers of people infected
are doubling every 12 to 18 months, giving the Caribbean the highest rate of
infection in the world after sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The enormous health-related costs threaten already fragile economies,
according to the Barbados-based Caribbean Epidemiology Center, which recently
estimated the spiraling annual cost could reach $1.2 billion by 2010 -- almost 5
percent of the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But most of those infected are treated only for the opportunistic illnesses
related to AIDS. Only the wealthy in the Caribbean can afford the anti-viral
drug cocktails keeping AIDS patients alive in wealthier nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though reckless behavior can lead to AIDS, excessive caution is a
problem in dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Ainsley Reid, who has been infected with HIV since 1992, told the conference
that fear of the disease must be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fear in most quarters is very unrealistic: the belief that it is
transmitted by kissing, touching, by just sharing a bed," said Reid, director of
the support group Jamaica Network of Seropositives.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Replaces CEO After Stock Loss  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s outspoken chairman resigned Friday, succumbing
to intense pressure from shareholders who want the nation's largest health
insurer to boost its ailing stock price and improve its relations with patients
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed the decision by Richard L. Huber to step down, but warned
the company has left unclear how it plans to overcome rising medical costs and
lawsuits alleging that the company unduly restricts care to build profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Dick Huber losing his job solves Aetna's problems," said Todd
Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. "The only thing this does
is makes it appear as if the board cares and is doing something."
</P>
<P>
	   The company wouldn't say whether Huber was forced out. Aetna's board of
directors replaced him with William H. Donaldson, 68, a member of the board
since 1977, and co-founder of the investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. Donaldson, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, is only
expected to hold the top job for a short while.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber, 63, jolted the once stodgy Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company
with a series of acquisitions and his brash management style. He had been
expected to retire by the end of next year when he turned 65.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the stock down 60 percent in less than a year, some investors began
calling for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board and I share not only pride in the company's leading position in
health care and financial services, but also frustration at the recent returns
received by Aetna shareholders," Donaldson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock price has slumped from about $100 last spring to under $40. It
was rose 18 3/4 cents to $40.75 on New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, the company became the target of several class-action lawsuits
alleging, among other things, that its system of paying doctors rewards them for
skimping on care. The suits were filed by the same trial attorneys who won big
awards against the tobacco companies. The company denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around
Prudential Healthcare and NYLCare, two money losing health insurance companies
that it bought last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumer groups and doctors, who have complained that it frequently
delays paying claims and drags its feet approving medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's payment practices riled some hospitals and doctors so much that they
resigned from its network, forcing patients to seek care elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Some investors believe Huber made the PR job even harder with blunt remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a day after a California woman won a $120.5 million jury verdict
against Aetna for delaying care to her husband before he died of cancer, Huber
said the award was the work of a "skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a
politically motivated judge and a weeping widow." Huber later apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed Donaldson's appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   "He understands shareholder concerns probably more closely and is likely to
take a fresh look at everything the company is doing," said David Marsh, of
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's options include selling its international division in order to
generate some cash and focus solely on its domestic operations -- something
Huber had ruled out. The company could also abandon unprofitable regions.
</P>
<P>
	   To improve its image, it could follow the lead of competitor United
Healthcare and give more power to doctors make care decisions without being
overruled by health plan administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber took over the top position at Aetna five years ago and led the company
through rapid expansion, punctuated by the purchases of U.S. Healthcare in 1996
and Prudential Healthcare and NYLCare in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber's rough style was just what Aetna needed in the mid 1990s when the
company struggled to keep up with competitors, said Larry Marsh, an analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time Aetna's growth was stagnant because of its focus on offering
traditional indemnity health insurance coverage that gives patients freedom to
use any doctor but also had higher costs. When Huber arrived, he was unafraid to
tell doctors and hospitals to change the way they operated because he believed
they were inefficient.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was fine for slow, sleepy and stocky Aetna a few years ago but today
that attitude is taken as belligerence and he became the lightening rod for what
everyone hates about HMOs," Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Aetna posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits, but
warned it was having trouble controlling rising medical costs. That startled
many on Wall Street because several other managed care firms such as United
Healthcare said they had costs under control.

<HEADLINE> Some Soup Kitchens Reject Census  </HEADLINE>
   By GENARO C. ARMAS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Salvation Army will keep the doors to over 500 of its
soup kitchens shut to census takers looking to compile information from homeless
people, claiming the presence of government workers could scare the homeless
away from services they desperately need.
</P>
<P>
	   The policy by the Salvation Army, one of the country's largest service
providers to the homeless, could hurt the Census Bureau's already difficult task
of counting that population. The bureau is relying on advocacy groups, shelters
and soup kitchens to help with the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The legal counsel has said that we will drive people away who desperately
need to be fed,'' Lt. Col. Tom Jones, national community relations and
development secretary for the Salvation Army, told The Associated Press on
Friday. ``We've been in the business of feeding people over 125 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Salvation Army is concerned about the Census count of the homeless,
Jones said, ``but obviously our primary concern is to feed people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Census officials said it was unclear if the bureau was previously notified
of the Salvation Army's decision, and declined additional comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The census occurs every 10 years. The first forms will be delivered to homes
in early March, and households are asked to mail it back to the bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   The process is different for the homeless since there are no permanent
addresses to mail surveys to. Census workers will instead fan out to shelters,
soup kitchens and street corners for three days in late March to count that
population.
</P>
<P>
	   The Salvation Army policy affects 520 temporary housing shelters that also
serve meals. Census workers will be able to talk to residents of the facility,
but not to those people who use it solely for meals, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayors across the country consider the homeless survey an important factor
to producing a more accurate count of city populations. The more people a city
has, the bigger chunk of federal funding it gets.
</P>
<P>
	   Census officials estimate it undercounted about 1.4 percent of the
population in 1990. They presume that most of the undercounted are minorities,
inner-city residents, and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the Salvation Army said it housed 622,867 people in its shelters,
and served over 32 million people total, including both homeless people and
those needing emergency assistance because of fire or natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has estimated there are about 600,000 people in
the country without fixed addresses.
</P>
<P>
	   The bureau has a tough job ahead even if the Salvation Army did allow access
into its dining facilities, said Mary Ann Gleason, director of the National
Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We empathize with the challenges of the Census Bureau. It's an awesome
task,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we really have to be clear about is that it's not an actual count of
the homeless population. It's a service-based enumeration that counts people who
receive some services some of the time,'' Gleason added.

	   Dow Closes Below 10,000
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Capping a string of Blue Fridays on Wall Street,
the Dow industrials closed below 10,000 for the first time in more
than 10 months as investors continued to abandon old guard stocks
like IBM and 3M to chase the new generation of dot-coms. The Dow
Jones industrial average dropped 230.51, or by 2.3 percent, to
9,862.12. It was the first close below 10,000 since April 6, 1999.
The Dow now has tumbled almost 16 percent since its record close of
11,722.98 on Jan. 14. A drop of more than 10 percent is considered
a ``correction.'' The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.15 from
yesterday's record high to end at 4,590.50. Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities, said: ``People are

	   Economy Grows At 6.9 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a speeding locomotive, the U.S. economy
grew at a 6.9 percent rate in the last quarter of 1999, its fastest
pace in more than three years. Economists said the rapid growth
makes it all but certain the Fed will boost interest rates in the
coming months to slow the economy and keep inflation at bay. The
revised estimate in the gross domestic product -- the total output
of goods and services -- eclipsed most analysts' expectations and
showed the economy growing at a much more robust pace than the 5.8
percent fourth-quarter rate the government estimated a month ago.

	   Govt. Presses for Tobacco Lawsuit
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department urged a federal judge
today to keep its massive lawsuit against the tobacco industry
alive because the cigarette companies ``pose a continuing threat to
the health and well-being of the American public.'' In several
documents filed with U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler, the
department argued that the companies made ``multiple legal errors''
in their motions last December to dismiss the lawsuit. The
government accuses cigarette makers of conspiring for 45 years to
mislead the public about the dangers of smoking and seeks to
recover billions of dollars spent by Medicare and other federal
health programs treating smoking-induced illnesses.

Buoyed by low interest rates and a relatively weak euro, the French

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Dropped in January  </HEADLINE>
    By CLAUDE R. MARX Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports dropped slightly in January, for the fifth
time in the last six months, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The import level of 2.70 million metric tons, from 2.78 million in December,
represented a 4 percent drop. It followed an increase last month but decreases
in the four previous months.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Mastel, an economist at the New America Foundation, a Washington think
tank said the data indicate that "the worst of the steel crisis has mostly
passed." But added that "imports are stabilizing at a fairly high level."

	   Imports had increased in December after declining 9 percent in November, 0.9
percent in October, 5 percent in August and 10 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall data for 1999 showed a 14 percent drop in imports.
</P>
<P>
	   Imports of cold-rolled, hot-rolled, wire rod, and heavy structural steel
decreased from their December levels. But imports of cut-to-length plate and
semifinished steel increased.
</P>
<P>
	   The Asian economic crisis that lasted until the beginning of 1999 led to an
unusually large amount of foreign-made steel entering the U.S. market. This

<HEADLINE> Aetna Replaces CEO After Stock Loss  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s outspoken chairman resigned Friday, succumbing
to intense pressure from shareholders who want the nation's largest health
insurer to boost its ailing stock price and improve its relations with patients
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed the decision by Richard L. Huber to step down, but warned
the company has left unclear how it plans to overcome rising medical costs and
lawsuits alleging that the company unduly restricts care to build profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Dick Huber losing his job solves Aetna's problems," said Todd
Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. "The only thing this does
is makes it appear as if the board cares and is doing something."
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which provides health insurance benefits to 21 million
Americans, wouldn't say whether Huber was forced out. Aetna's board of directors
replaced him with William H. Donaldson, 68, a board member since 1977, and
co-founder of the investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
Donaldson, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, is only expected to
hold the top job for a short while.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber, 63, jolted the once stodgy Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company
with a series of acquisitions and his brash management style. He had been
expected to retire by the end of next year when he turned 65.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the stock down 60 percent in less than a year, some investors began
calling for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board and I share not only pride in the company's leading position in
health care and financial services, but also frustration at the recent returns
received by Aetna shareholders," Donaldson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock price has slumped from about $100 last spring to under $40. It
was rose 18 3/4 cents to $40.75 on New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, the company became the target of several class-action lawsuits
alleging, among other things, that its system of paying doctors rewards them for
skimping on care. The suits were filed by the same trial attorneys who won big
awards against the tobacco companies. The company denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around
Prudential Healthcare and NYLCare, two money losing health insurance companies
that it bought last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumer groups and doctors, who have complained that it frequently
delays paying claims and drags its feet approving medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's payment practices riled some hospitals and doctors so much that they
resigned from its network, forcing patients to seek care elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Some investors believe Huber made the PR job even harder with blunt remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a day after a California woman won a $120.5 million jury verdict
against Aetna for delaying care to her husband before he died of cancer, Huber
said the award was the work of a "skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a
politically motivated judge and a weeping widow." Huber later apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed Donaldson's appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   "He understands shareholder concerns probably more closely and is likely to
take a fresh look at everything the company is doing," said David Marsh, of
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's options include selling its international division in order to
generate some cash and focus solely on its domestic operations -- something
Huber had ruled out. The company could also abandon unprofitable regions.
</P>
<P>
	   To improve its image, it could follow the lead of competitor United
Healthcare and give more power to doctors make care decisions without being
overruled by health plan administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber took over the top position at Aetna five years ago and led the company
through rapid expansion, punctuated by the purchases of U.S. Healthcare in 1996,
NYLCare in 1998 and Prudential Healthcare in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber's rough style was just what Aetna needed in the mid 1990s when the
company struggled to keep up with competitors, said Larry Marsh, an analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time Aetna's growth was stagnant because of its focus on offering
traditional indemnity health insurance coverage that gives patients freedom to
use any doctor but also had higher costs. When Huber arrived, he was unafraid to
tell doctors and hospitals to change the way they operated because he believed
they were inefficient.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was fine for slow, sleepy and stocky Aetna a few years ago but today
that attitude is taken as belligerence and he became the lightening rod for what
everyone hates about HMOs," Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Aetna posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits, but
warned it was having trouble controlling rising medical costs. That startled
many on Wall Street because several other managed care firms such as United
Healthcare said they had costs under control.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Eyed in Tobago AIDS Spread  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM McDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUCCOO, Tobago (AP) -- Every Sunday, when the sun goes down on Buccoo
village on the southwest coast of Tobago, the tourists start to gather. The
locals, mainly young men, show up later. By mid-evening, thousands are mingling.
</P>
<P>
	   A steel band strikes up sweet pan music. Driving soca, dance hall, reggae,
even hip-hop, spills out from dingy bars. Harried bartenders dispense beer and
rum and cola. Young women, mostly white Europeans and North Americans, dance
wildly with dreadlocked young islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   It is from parties such as this, experts and officials believe, that AIDS
can spread.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin-island nation of Trinidad and Tobago reported 1,200 new AIDS cases
from January to October 1999, a 20 percent increase over the year before. The
Caribbean region, with 360,000 people reported HIV-positive, has the
second-highest infection rate in the world behind sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Many residents blame foreigners for bringing the disease as they exploited
the easy availability of sex and the ignorance of many local people about AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   "They go crazy when they get here," Samuel Nero says. "There's no other word
for it. They just go crazy."
</P>
<P>
	   The evening party ritual is so ingrained the tourist guidebooks have a name
for it: "Sunday school."
</P>
<P>
	   Some European women arrive off planes clutching photographs of the young men
meeting them -- men recommended by friends who've had a good time in Tobago. But
those men often have local girlfriends, even wives.
</P>
<P>
	   Tourists find plenty of willing suitors on an island of double-digit
unemployment where tourism has supplanted agriculture and fishing as the only
viable industries.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the fellas don't work. They're praying for the tourists to come,"
said Sheldon Julien, an unemployed 23-year-old who contracted HIV two years ago
while working at a beach hotel.
</P>
<P>
	   There are no hard and fast prices for sexual services. One man said he'd
take money, expensive gifts, sometimes just a dinner. "They take whatever they
can get," said Margaret Wright of the Tobago AIDS society.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinidad's Daily Express recently noted how many islanders believe "Clorox,
blue soap or prayer will protect them better than condoms." One teen-ager said
he wouldn't get AIDS if he bathed in the sea immediately after having sex.
</P>
<P>
	   The top government official in Tobago, Morgan Job, blamed the high infection
rate on irresponsible islanders who "put the lives of their families and other
Tobagonians at risk because they want to make some money out of sex."

<HEADLINE> Caribbean AIDS Explosion Examined  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE RELLY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) -- Homophobia, sex tourism,
infidelity and poverty are major factors causing a rapid spread of AIDS and
increasingly infecting women in the Caribbean, international and regional health
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Societal norms encourage homosexuals to have heterosexual relationships, and
married men to have sex with other women, said experts and victims. Also,
poverty is forcing men and women to prostitution, often with tourists, they said
in a dramatic and uncharacteristically open discussion.
</P>
<P>
	   They spoke at a conference organized by the U.S. National Institutes of
Health that is being held simultaneously on five Caribbean islands in a
high-profile effort to stir debate and awareness about the once-taboo issues of
sexual promiscuity and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is definitely an epidemic, and in the Caribbean we have the second
largest incidence in the world after Africa," said Peggy McEvoy, Team Leader for
the Caribbean program for Geneva-based UNAIDS, which handles AIDS policy issues,
education and research.
</P>
<P>
	   "The islands with tourism are the ones that don't want to talk about it very
much," McEvoy said. "There's a tremendous amount of sexual activity involved
with tourism. There's a lot of fear that if tourists are aware they're not going
to come."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the number of people infected with the HIV virus in the Caribbean
is likely more than 500,000 and could be as high as 700,000 -- about double the
previously reported figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of the problem is that some countries keep track of AIDS but not HIV
infections. McEvoy cited the Dominican Republic, which reported a total of 4,230
cases of AIDS in August 1998. McEvoy estimated that the country has 150,000
cases of HIV-positive and AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighboring Haiti, the poorest country in the hemisphere, said it had 4,967
total AIDS cases in 1998. McEvoy said UNAIDS officials believe there are 330,000
Haitians infected with the virus and AIDS. According to the UNAIDS report "AIDS
Epidemic Update: December 1999," the last time Haiti performed HIV surveillance
among pregnant women, in 1996, close to 6 percent tested positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
	   Some conference sessions are being broadcast live by satellite from the U.S.
Virgin Islands to some of the 2,300 health officials, AIDS activists and victims
meeting here and in Jamaica, Barbados, Trinidad and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
	   One dire statistic presented -- from a survey of 8,100 schoolchildren in
four English-speaking Caribbean islands -- has 42 percent experiencing sex
before the age of 10. The figure rises to 62 percent by age 12. That survey,
conducted by the Washington-based Organization of American States' Pan American
Health Organization, could reflect a high rate of child molestation.
</P>
<P>
	   A third of reported AIDS cases in the Caribbean are among women and the
percentage seems likely to grow, according to the Ministry of Health in Trinidad
and Tobago. It reported last year that seven of eight youths being infected
between the ages of 10 and 19 are female.
</P>
<P>
	   Government officials at the conferences appeared to agree that there is a
problem.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jamaica, Health Minister John Junor said the challenge was fighting "the
irresponsible sexual behavior of our men."
</P>
<P>
	   McEvoy noted that married women face high risks because their partners are
unfaithful and won't use condoms. "Married women (here) don't have the
negotiating power within a marriage to insist on a condom," she said. "Their
husbands would kick them out."
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, many women are unaware that their husbands are having
extramarital affairs, McEvoy said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the territory's delegate to Congress, physician
Donna Christian-Christensen, cited "a great reluctance to talk about bisexuality
and little acceptance of men who have sex with men."
</P>
<P>
	   This, experts suggested, could lead bisexual or homosexual men to hide their
sexual behavior from their spouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Figures on the epidemic are notoriously unreliable, in part because many
people who are infected deny they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   McEvoy also cited late reporting, no reporting, travel abroad to be tested
in addition to the poor reporting of HIV infections. But the number of reported
new cases alone increased by 26 percent last year, from 45,000 to 57,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Brendon Bain of the University of the West Indies medical school noted
that between 1 percent and 2 percent of Jamaica's 2.6 million people have AIDS
or are infected with HIV. But he cautioned that the numbers of people infected
are doubling every 12 to 18 months, giving the Caribbean the highest rate of
infection in the world after sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The enormous health-related costs threaten already fragile economies,
according to the Barbados-based Caribbean Epidemiology Center, which recently
estimated the spiraling annual cost could reach $1.2 billion by 2010 -- almost 5
percent of the region's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   But most of those infected are treated only for the opportunistic illnesses
related to AIDS. Only the wealthy in the Caribbean can afford the anti-viral
drug cocktails keeping AIDS patients alive in wealthier nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though reckless behavior can lead to AIDS, excessive caution is a
problem in dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Ainsley Reid, who has been infected with HIV since 1992, told the conference
that fear of the disease must be eradicated.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fear in most quarters is very unrealistic: the belief that it is
transmitted by kissing, touching, by just sharing a bed," said Reid, director of
the support group Jamaica Network of Seropositives.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Mixed; Short-Term Notes Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Shorter-term government bond prices rose for the second
straight session Friday as investors shifted money out of both stocks and
long-term Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
	   The shift in strategy caused the benchmark long-term bond to slip for a
second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1/32 point, or 31 cents per
$1,000 in face value. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of price,
rose to 6.14 from 6.13 late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors often rotate money into government secured bonds when the stock
markets falter. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average, home to many of the
nation's oldest publicly traded companies, lost 230.51 points to end at
9,862.12, the first time the blue-chip index has closed below 10,000 since
April.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks were also sold off Friday, adding additional allure to the
bond markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said short-term bonds have become increasingly popular in the wake
of the U.S. government's announcement that it intends to reduce the amount of
long-term bonds to help pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The pay-down program means some government bonds could be phased out
altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the bond market, prices of short-term Treasury securities rose
7/32 point to 9/32 point and intermediate maturities rose by 11/32 point to 3/16
point, according to Bridge Telerate.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.76 percent, with the discount
down 0.03 percentage point to 5.60 percent from Thursday's 5.63 percent.
Six-month yields were 5.97 percent as the discount was down 0.03 percentage
point to 5.71 percent. One-year yields were 6.14 percent, with the discount
falling 0.03 percentage point from late Wednesday to 5.80 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.68 3/4 from 5.75 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds was unchanged at 92 11/16. The yield
to maturity of the index was also unchanged from Thursday's 6.17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Friday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Crude oil prices rose to another nine-year high Friday as another day passed
without firm indications from OPEC on what it intends to do when its
production-slashing agreement runs out next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil and other energy commodities also rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, coffee prices dipped below $1 a pound for the first time
in four months, and wheat fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest of a series of nine-year highs since November, intermediate
crude oil for April delivery rose as high as $30.83 a barrel -- the highest
level since Jan. 16, 1991 -- before settling up 38 cents at $30.35 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   After seeing prices nearly triple in the past year, the United States and
other big importers are counting on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to raise output at its March 27 meeting. OPEC supplies 56 percent of
U.S. oil imports.
</P>
<P>
	   But signals out of OPEC remain murky despite a lobbying trip by U.S. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson and statements by some oil producers that some form of
increase in supply is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali Naimi was quoted as saying that a
decrease in demand in this quarter may bring prices down and make a production
hike unnecessary. He said no agreement had been reached during Richardson's stop
in the Saudi capital Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
	   With world supplies sinking precipitously, the passage of another day with
no remedial action was enough to keep prices on the rise.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've reached the point where I don't think the market is paying attention
to talk any more," said Bill O'Grady, an energy analyst for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons
Inc. in St. Louis. "They're saying 'If you're going to raise production, do it.
Until then, we don't care what you say."'
</P>
<P>
	   Victor Yu, an analyst for Refco Inc. in New York, said that even if OPEC
puts higher production into effect in April, "the oil probably won't end up on
our shores until late May. By then we are into our summer driving season,"
putting new pressure on dwindling oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, March heating oil rose 4.86 cents to 82.88 cents a gallon,
March gasoline rose 1.21 cent to 86.26 cents a gallon and March natural gas rose
5.4 cents to $2.603 per million BTUs.
</P>
<P>
	   April Brent crude rose 9 cents to $27.46 a barrel on the International
Petroleum Exchange in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Coffee continued its two-month slide on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa
Exchange amid a lack of buyer enthusiasm and speculative selling. May coffee
settled down 3.4 cents at 99.35 cents a pound after falling to a low of 98.25
cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat plunged to seven-week lows on the Chicago Board of Trade on forecasts
for more wet weather in the Midwestern and Plains states.
</P>
<P>
	   Moisture levels in the winter wheat belt, which accounts for 70 percent of
U.S. wheat, have improved sharply in recent days and the trend is expected to
continue as more rain heads for the region.
</P>
<P>
	   May wheat fell 8 cents to $2.59 1/4 a bushel. Other grains and soybeans also
fell because of the rains.

<HEADLINE> Economy Grows at 6.9 Percent Rate  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like a speeding locomotive, the U.S. economy surged ahead
at the fastest pace in more than three years as 1999 ended. But the sizzling 6.9
percent rate of growth reported by the government Friday only added to Wall
Street's fears about higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 230.51 points to 9,862.12, its
first close below the psychologically important 10,000 level since April 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Since hitting its peak on Jan. 14, the Dow has dropped 1,861 points or 15.9
percent, well into the level generally considered as a market correction.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's report on the gross domestic product represented a
bigger-than-expected upward revision in fourth-quarter growth, originally
estimated at 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said it only served to heighten market fears that the Federal
Reserve will have to slam on the interest rate brake even harder to keep the
economy from overheating and sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The report solidified the perception that the economy is cooking," said
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commerce Department said the economy's performance in the final three
months of last year matched a 6.9 percent growth spurt posted in the second
quarter of 1996 and hasn't been exceeded since a 7.2 percent rate of increase at
the end of 1987. The economy sprinted past the third quarter's 5.7 percent
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy boomed, skyrocketed, soared, was on fire -- no matter what
descriptor you choose, it will be an understatement," said economist Joel Naroff
of Naroff Economic Advisors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hardy consumer and government spending and a strong build-up in business
inventories added to fourth-quarter growth, while the bloated U.S. trade deficit
subtracted from it.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists said the report makes more interest rate increases by the Fed a
virtual certainty. The expectation is for rate boosts at the Fed's next meetings
on March 21 and May 16. The central bank has raised rates four times since June
to slow the barreling economy and keep inflation from escalating.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Fed has to work even harder to get the economy to slow," said Mark
Zandi, an economist with RFA Dismal Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed's preferred speed limit is in the 3 percent range, believed to be
the growth rate that can be sustained without triggering inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy was smoking during the fourth quarter. Fire chief Alan
Greenspan is determined to extinguish this blaze before it turns into a
five-alarm fire," said economist Richard Yamarone of Argus Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with the red-hot growth, inflation, while picking up, remained
relatively well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
	   An inflation gauge tied to GDP and watched closely by Greenspan rose at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter, the same as previously
estimated but higher than the 1.8 percent rate in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity,
has been powering the speeding economy. In the fourth quarter, consumer spending
rose at an annual rate of 5.9 percent, more brisk than the 4.9 percent rate of
the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   With plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains, Americans have
been feeling wealthy and in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
	   All that spending pulled the nation's savings rate, which reflects savings
as a percentage of disposable income, to a record quarterly low of 1.8 percent
in the fourth quarter, compared with a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter.
But that's not as dire as it seems, because the calculation doesn't take into
account gains realized from such things as rising stock market values and higher
real estate values for homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Confident that consumers will keep spending, businesses increased their
stockpiles to $68.7 billion, up from $38 billion in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists believe both strong inventory building and robust consumer
spending partially reflected hoarding related to fears about possible problems
from the Year 2000 computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
	   Government spending, meanwhile, grew by 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
more than double the 4.5 percent rate of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. trade deficit was the one blot on an otherwise stellar economy.
Exports grew by an 8.7 percent rate in the fourth quarter, but imports climbed
faster at a 10 percent rate. Both exports and imports grew more briskly in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists predict the economy will slow to around a 4 percent rate in the
current first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In another report, the National Association of Realtors said existing-home
sales fell by 10.7 percent in January, the biggest plunge since April 1995, to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.59 million units, reflecting higher
mortgage rates and record low supply.

<HEADLINE> Agent Black Accused of Defrauding  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prominent sports agent William H. "Tank" Black has been
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of defrauding his athlete
clients of at least $5 million in investment scams.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Tampa, Fla., issued a restraining order Thursday against
Black and his business partner, the SEC announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Black denied the SEC's allegations, saying they "are false and do not
reflect actual events."
</P>
<P>
	   "We will respond vigorously with the facts at the appropriate time," he said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC filed a civil lawsuit Thursday against Black; his firm, Professional
Management Inc.; James A. Franklin Jr., the firm's general counsel; and
Professional Management Consulting Inc., an affiliate of the firm owned by Black
and Franklin.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC had requested the temporary restraining order against Black,
Franklin and the two firms. It freezes their assets, bars them and their
employees from exercising any control over their clients' accounts, and requires
them to account for and bring back to this country all assets they hold
offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also is seeking unspecified fines and repayment of allegedly illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC said Black "repeatedly provided false evidence" during
its investigation that contradicted statements by his clients.
</P>
<P>
	   Black, who is from Columbia, S.C., became the center of an investigation by
University of Florida police last spring for possible illegal inducements he
gave to former university players.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities charged him in October with unlicensed agent activity in
the state. If convicted, he could face a $5,000 fine and up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Black's clients, whom he represents in contract negotiations with
their teams, are professional football players. In return for helping them get
lucrative National Football League contracts, he expects them to help him
recruit other players to his agency. He's built a multimillion-dollar business
using this network of players.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to representing athletes, Professional Management also provides
financial and investment services for its clients.
</P>
<P>
	   The 42-year-old Black, who got his nickname as a 10-pound, 15-ounce newborn,
grew up poor in Johnson City, Tenn. But he had enough athletic skill to become a
three-time NAIA All-American at Carson Newman as a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Clients or former clients include Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor, New
York Giants wide receiver Ike Hilliard and Philadelphia running back Duce
Staley.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor recently accused Black in a newspaper interview of cheating him out
of some $3 million in a scheme that he said also ensnared a dozen other NFL
clients. According to Taylor, Black had said he intended to repay all his
clients by selling the travel agency he partly owns for $18 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Black also represents Vince Carter of the NBA's Toronto Raptors, one of the
game's brightest young stars.
</P>
<P>
	   Another former client, ex-Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth, has been
charged in the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the athletes were interviewed by SEC investigators preparing the
case against Black.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, Clarence Anthony, father of client Reidel Anthony, said Black
had recommended an investment as a good opportunity, telling him that prominent
people including the Rev. Jesse Jackson were involved in the venture.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an SEC document, Anthony, Carruth, Hilliard, Terry Allen and
Robert Brooks invested a total $6.1 million in one scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Franklin, 32, who also lives in Columbia, was not represented by a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC alleged in its suit that beginning in early 1996, Black and his
business partner Franklin defrauded some two dozen athlete clients, reaping at
least $5 million through various schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   In one scheme, the SEC said, Black and Franklin advised clients to invest
millions in high-yield promissory notes that they said would finance an auto
title loan company called Cash 4 Titles. In fact, the SEC said, Black and
Franklin had a secret arrangement with the promoters of the promissory notes
that allowed them to skim their clients' profits and put the money into a
multi-million-dollar Ponzi scheme run out of the Cayman Islands in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Ponzi scheme, money from recent investors is used to pay returns to
earlier investors.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Mark Korean War Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting with wreath-laying ceremonies in Seoul and
Washington on June 25, the United States and South Korea will hold a series of
events marking the 50th anniversary of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon announced Friday that the commemoration, authorized by
Congress, is intended to honor Korean War veterans and their families,
especially those who lost relatives. More than 33,000 Americans were killed in
the war, which began June 25, 1950 when communist North Korean forces invaded
the South.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean war losses are estimated at 2 million or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other anniversary events planned for 2000 are a commemoration of Task
Force Smith, the first group of U.S. Army troops to arrive in South Korea from
occupation duty in Japan, in early July, in a bid to halt the North Korean
advance.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force, named for its commander, Lt. Col. Charles B. Smith, was
overrun by a more heavily armed North Korean force and became a symbol of the
U.S. military's lack of preparedness for war on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   The Task Force Smith commemoration will be at Arlington National Cemetery on
June 28.
</P>
<P>
	   Later events will commemorate the September 1950 Inchon landing of Marines
and the evacuation of Marines from Hungnam in December 1950 following their
retreat from the Chosin Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and its allies fought on South Korea's side against the
North Koreans, who were allied with China and the Soviet Union. The war ended in
a ceasefire on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty was never signed. The United
States still keeps about 38,000 troops in South Korea to deter another war.

<HEADLINE> Aetna Replaces CEO After Stock Loss  </HEADLINE>
    By PHIL GALEWITZ AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc.'s outspoken chairman resigned Friday, succumbing
to intense pressure from shareholders who want the nation's largest health
insurer to boost its ailing stock price and improve its relations with patients
and doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed the decision by Richard L. Huber to step down, but warned
the company has left unclear how it plans to overcome rising medical costs and
lawsuits alleging that the company unduly restricts care to build profits.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think Dick Huber losing his job solves Aetna's problems," said Todd
Richter, an analyst with Banc of America Securities. "The only thing this does
is makes it appear as if the board cares and is doing something."
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which provides health insurance benefits to 21 million
Americans, wouldn't say whether Huber was forced out. Aetna's board of directors
replaced him with William H. Donaldson, 68, a board member since 1977, and
co-founder of the investment banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
Donaldson, a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, is only expected to
hold the top job for a short while.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber, 63, jolted the once stodgy Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company
with a series of acquisitions and his brash management style. He had been
expected to retire by the end of next year when he turned 65.
</P>
<P>
	   But with the stock down 60 percent in less than a year, some investors began
calling for his ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   "The board and I share not only pride in the company's leading position in
health care and financial services, but also frustration at the recent returns
received by Aetna shareholders," Donaldson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's stock price has slumped from about $100 last spring to under $40. It
was rose 18 3/4 cents to $40.75 on New York Stock Exchange trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last fall, the company became the target of several class-action lawsuits
alleging, among other things, that its system of paying doctors rewards them for
skimping on care. The suits were filed by the same trial attorneys who won big
awards against the tobacco companies. The company denies wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had more difficulty than expected in turning around
Prudential Healthcare and NYLCare, two money losing health insurance companies
that it bought last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna has also had to wage a public relations battle to maintain its image
against consumer groups and doctors, who have complained that it frequently
delays paying claims and drags its feet approving medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's payment practices riled some hospitals and doctors so much that they
resigned from its network, forcing patients to seek care elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Some investors believe Huber made the PR job even harder with blunt remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, a day after a California woman won a $120.5 million jury verdict
against Aetna for delaying care to her husband before he died of cancer, Huber
said the award was the work of a "skillful ambulance-chasing lawyer, a
politically motivated judge and a weeping widow." Huber later apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts welcomed Donaldson's appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   "He understands shareholder concerns probably more closely and is likely to
take a fresh look at everything the company is doing," said David Marsh, of
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
	   Aetna's options include selling its international division in order to
generate some cash and focus solely on its domestic operations -- something
Huber had ruled out. The company could also abandon unprofitable regions.
</P>
<P>
	   To improve its image, it could follow the lead of competitor United
Healthcare and give more power to doctors make care decisions without being
overruled by health plan administrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber took over the top position at Aetna five years ago and led the company
through rapid expansion, punctuated by the purchases of U.S. Healthcare in 1996,
NYLCare in 1998 and Prudential Healthcare in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Huber's rough style was just what Aetna needed in the mid 1990s when the
company struggled to keep up with competitors, said Larry Marsh, an analyst with
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time Aetna's growth was stagnant because of its focus on offering
traditional indemnity health insurance coverage that gives patients freedom to
use any doctor but also had higher costs. When Huber arrived, he was unafraid to
tell doctors and hospitals to change the way they operated because he believed
they were inefficient.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was fine for slow, sleepy and stocky Aetna a few years ago but today
that attitude is taken as belligerence and he became the lightening rod for what
everyone hates about HMOs," Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Aetna posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter profits, but
warned it was having trouble controlling rising medical costs. That startled
many on Wall Street because several other managed care firms such as United
Healthcare said they had costs under control.

<HEADLINE> Euro Drops Sharply Against Dollar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro tumbled against the dollar Friday, dropping nearly
2 cents amid fresh evidence of U.S. economic strength and growing perceptions
that European interest rates won't rise as quickly expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen, however.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 97.42 cents, down from
99.33 cents late Thursday. The European currency had regained the $1 level on
Tuesday for the first time in nearly a month. It is now nearing its all-time low
of 96.68 cents set Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. government revised its estimate of how fast the economy grew in the
fourth quarter to 6.9 percent from its earlier projection of 5.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Anderson, a financial economist at FleetBoston Financial, said that
suggested that the U.S. economy will continue to expand faster than European
economies have.
</P>
<P>
	   He said traders had bought euros early in the week in expectations that U.S.
markets "would implode" following a big selloff on Wall Street on Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   "The markets have been volatile, but the money is being reallocated and is
not leaving the country," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, he said euro buyers had anticipated a quick rate rise in
Europe, but now appear to have concluded the European Central Bank "will be
slower to raise rates" than the U.S. Federal Reserve will.
</P>
<P>
	   The euro also was hurt by traders' recent reluctance to hold euros over the
weekend, preferring to trade them for dollars, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market had been positioned for a higher euro but it got disappointed
and got to the end of the week," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the dollar gave back more of its recent gains against the yen. The
dollar was quoted at 110.47 yen in late trading, down from 111.06 yen Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6503 Swiss francs, up from 1.6202, and
1.4492 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4559. The British pound fell to $1.5939
from $1.6000.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Thursday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0071 German marks, up from 1.9695; 6.7316
French francs, up from 6.6055; and 1,987.04 Italian lire, up from 1,949.82.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes Below 10,000  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Capping a string of Blue Fridays on Wall Street, the Dow
industrials closed below 10,000 for the first time in more than 10 months as
investors continued to abandon old guard stocks like IBM and 3M to chase the new
generation of dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow not only fell through the 10,000 barrier, but sank below 9,900. In
the broad selloff, the technology-focused Nasdaq composite index retreated after
two straight days of closing at all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 230.51, or by 2.3 percent, to
9,862.12. It was the first close below 10,000 since April 6, 1999, and the
lowest close since April 1, 1999, when it finished at 9,832.51.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow now has tumbled almost 16 percent since its record close of
11,722.98 on Jan. 14. A drop of more than 10 percent is considered a
"correction," or sudden, steep reversal in a rising market. Such a drop does not
necessarily mean the end to the bull market that has been raging since October
1990.
</P>
<P>
	   "The correction is simply not over yet as we can see by the continuing
pressure on stocks like GE, Coke and Merck," said Charles Pradilla, chief
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "People are moving out of the Old
Economy into the New Economy."
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index fell 27.15 to 4,590.50.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which captures the biggest picture of the
market, ended down 20.07 at 1,333.36.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the fourth Friday out of the last five that the Dow fell by more than
200 points and the sixth straight Friday decline for the stock market's
best-known indicator. For the week, the Dow lost 357 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is serious," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany
Corp. The market is sending a message that the economy and profit growth will
slow in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue chips suffered as traders continued to favor newer companies and the
lure of faster profit growth. Investors hammered Dow stalwarts like General
Electric, which fell 4 7/8 to 126 1/8, and IBM, down 4 3/4 to 105 3/4, as well
as 3M off 5 1/4 to 85 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anybody thinks (the drop) doesn't effect the investors' psyche, they're
wrong," Johnson said. "The decline itself can be demoralizing and can invite
more selling."
</P>
<P>
	   Friday morning, the Commerce Department said the economy surged upward at a
6.9 percent annual rate during the final three months of 1999, the strongest
pace in more than three years. The big advance in the gross domestic product --
the total output of goods and services -- was even stronger than the 5.8 percent
fourth-quarter rate the government previously estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Such rapid growth has led the Federal Reserve to raise rates four times
since June, and warn that more hikes are on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology sector, however, continues to show pockets of strength. Among
the big gainers Friday were Commerce One, up 34 1/16 to 213 1/16, and Oracle, up
8 11/16 to 70 5/8. The two companies announced they were combining their
Internet business exchanges for the automakers General Motors, Ford and
DaimlerChrysler, which rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Small company stocks also have bucked the trend. The Russell 2000 index rose
2.70 Friday to 556.74.
</P>
<P>
	   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 1.06 billion shares, down from
1.16 billion Thursday but still heavy. About three stocks fell in price for
every two that rose on the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a different story overseas where markets closed higher before the
worst of the declines on Wall Street. In Japan, the Nikkei rose 1.3 percent. In
Europe, London's FT-SE rose 1.8 percent, the Paris CAC rose 1.8 percent, and the
German DAX rose 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos. Devise Consolidation Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumers, especially those who make few out-of-state
telephone calls, could save several dollars each month under a plan announced
Friday to consolidate residential bills and reduce long-distance rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest savings -- about $3 to $4 a month -- would go to people with low
long-distance charges, according to the proposal by local and long-distance
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, a revision of one made in the fall, seeks to address criticism by
consumers groups that contended low-volume long-distance users would not save
any money.
</P>
<P>
	   The revised proposal includes a pledge by the nation's largest long-distance
company, AT&AMP;T, to eliminate a $3 monthly charge for residential customers on
AT&AMP;T's most basic calling plan. Long-distance charges for some of their
customers are less than that fee.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, applauded
"a principled compromise that will bring certainty and stability to the market,"
and consumer groups said the plan was an improvement.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely a step forward offering consumers a potential for lower
prices regardless of how much calling they do," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director
of the Washington office of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Long-distance companies AT&AMP;T and Sprint joined major local phone companies
Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE and SBC in the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, local companies would reduce by $2.1 billion the "access"
fees they charge long-distance carriers to connect calls. Long-distance
companies have pledged to pass on the savings, meaning consumers should see
lower per-minute rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have cut access charges by several billion dollars over the past
few years to better reflect local phone companies' connection costs. The
industry proposal is meant to continue the transition of making subsidies --
which are used to support affordable phone service -- explicit and clear to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also folds together and reduces some flat-rate charges now on
monthly bills.
</P>
<P>
	   One, the subscriber line charge, covers the cost of the phone line from the
local phone company into the home and is capped at $3.50 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   A second pays for long-distance companies' use of the local phone network.
It now averages about $1.50 per month but would climb to $4.35 and eventually
$6.50 after three years, according to the industry plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard said the FCC would review the charge before it reached $5 to ensure
that additional increases could be justified.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies said their proposal also would keep local phone service
affordable to poor people and customers in rural and other high-cost areas
through a $650 million universal service fund. The new bills would spell out
this monthly charge, although consumers indirectly have been contributing
already to keep local phone service affordable.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T also said it would notify customers in writing about other plans the
company offers, so they can pick the one that best fits their usage.
</P>
<P>
	   No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI WorldCom and the other major Bell company, U
S West, are not members of the coalition.

<HEADLINE> Strategies Offered for State Growth  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the new technology-based national economy, state
governments must reinvent themselves to keep skilled workers, entrepreneurs and
private investment within state borders, a new report to the nation's governors
says.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, being released Saturday at the winter meeting of the National
Governors' Association, offers a variety of strategies for states to compete and
grow in a ``new economy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Suggestions include turning over some government functions to private
companies, re-evaluating taxes and regulations that may hamper expansion of
technological businesses and establishing sites on the World Wide Web to provide
government information and services to the citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is appropriate at our first meeting of the 21st century that we examine
the extraordinary opportunity governors have to create a dynamic new government
that reflects the technological era we are living in today,'' Utah Gov. Michael
O. Leavitt, the association's chairman, said in a written statement. ``Whether
we meet the challenge and seize this opportunity will define America's future.''
</P>
<P>
	   During the conference, the governors will attend sessions and share ideas on
how to spur state economies through technology, ensure broadband access and
examine the impact of a technology-based economy on the environment and natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
	   The governors are scheduled to meet Monday with President Clinton and
Tuesday, the final day of the four-day conference, with members of the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Some other recommendations for state governments in the report:
</P>
<P>
	   --Decentralize decision-making by getting local groups and institutions
involved.
</P>
<P>
	   --Consider forming partnerships with private companies, unions, nonprofit
organizations, churches and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   --Invest in higher education in a way that ensures it is market-driven and
responsive to the needs of state businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   --Create opportunities for development and research within the state's
university systems and facilitate commercialization of the products that result
by establishing so-called business ``incubators.''
</P>
<P>
	   --Support work force training to improve skills and to help citizens rise to
higher-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Enhance the state's physical infrastructure to ensure that transportation
and telecommunications systems can keep up with growth.

<HEADLINE> Fire Alarm Shortens Clinton Speech  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton was hustled out of a hotel ballroom
Friday after a fire alarm sounded as he delivered a speech.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm went off just after Clinton began his speech at the Marriott
Wardman Park Hotel for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, awarded for
corporate innovation. A fire had broken out in the hotel's laundry room.
</P>
<P>
	   Apparently unaware of the fire, Clinton tried to continue his remarks after
joking about the noise. At one point he joked that because of the blaring alarm,
``The Marriott is not a candidate for the Baldrige Award.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Could somebody tell me what the deal is?'' Clinton finally asked. An aide
told him it was a fire alarm. ``Are we supposed to leave?'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not yet,'' the aide replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not yet?'' Clinton asked incredulously. ``That's not an encouraging
answer.''
</P>
<P>
	   But when three uniformed Secret Service officers entered the ballroom and
motioned for the audience of about 1,000 to leave, Clinton calmly walked out
with Commerce Secretary William Daley.
</P>
<P>
	   They were taken down a stairwell to Clinton's limousine and driven back to
the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Upon arriving at the White House,
Clinton stepped out of his limousine and waved to reporters before walking to
the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Apparently a contract welder working near the laundry room set off a small
fire in the laundry room,'' Lockhart said. ``The fire marshals responded and
made the decision to evacuate the hotel. The president evacuated and came back
to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Brian Lee, spokesman for the city's Department of Fire and Emergency
Medical Services, said the blaze was confined to a laundry room below the
basement and ``ended up not being that major in nature.'' No injuries were
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee said the fire marshal, working with the Secret Service, decided to
evacuate because of a possibility that the fire might spread through the hotel's
air ducts. He said the decision was not based on the president's presence in the
building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would evacuate for anybody, including any citizen, whether it was the
president or not,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
	   The alarm had sounded earlier during introductory remarks by Daley, but it
stopped then. It resumed when Clinton began to speak.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Post-Hurricane Aid Needed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton asked Congress on Friday for an
additional $124 million to pay for damage from Hurricane Floyd and $56 million
to help fishing communities suffering unexpected losses on the west and east
coasts.
</P>
<P>
	   If the latest request is approved, the federal government will have spent
nearly $3 billion to help states hurt by Hurricane Floyd. Most of the damage was
in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The hurricane money would be allocated among the Agriculture Department, the
Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Army Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government has made more than $2.6 billion available in grants
and loans. The new request includes $223 million announced Feb. 7 and $124
million requested Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest installment includes $81 million for forgiveness of farm loans to
producer-owner marketing associations that suffered losses and $30 million for
low-interest loans for rental housing units and rental assistance.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also asked Congress for $600 million to replenish a federal fund
that helps needy families buy home heating oil. He had announced at a news
conference earlier this month that he would make such a request.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Clinton said communities on both the west and east coasts
are facing severe economic threats due to a decline in important fishing stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In Long Island Sound, the lobster catch has fallen sharply this year,''
the president said. ``On the West Coast, in Oregon, Washington and California,
there has been a serious decline in groundfish stocks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said the requested $56 million would be used to help those whose
economic welfare is threatened, and to finance research to restore the long-term
health of the fishing industry.

<HEADLINE> Oil Output Hike Said Unlikely in 2Q  </HEADLINE>
    By TAREK AL-ISSAWI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Producing nations likely won't raise oil
output before July because they fear a sharp fall in revenue, a Saudi oil
official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The remarks were likely to confirm market suspicions that producers' talk of
"stable prices" won't mean fast relief for consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, crude oil for April delivery rose 38 cents to $30.35 on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude closed at $27.48, up 11 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saudi official said there was an implicit agreement between producing
countries from inside and outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to increase production "gradually as of the third or fourth quarters
of the year."
</P>
<P>
	   Countries that import oil had hoped that OPEC ministers, scheduled to meet
at the end of March, would increase production to bring down prices starting in
the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two weeks, some oil producers, such as Mexico, have called for
OPEC to increase production beyond the current 22.976 million barrels a day set
by an agreement in March last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The market has closely watched the flurry of meetings held over the past
three days, and will be closely monitoring a March 2 meeting in London involving
the oil ministers of Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela -- the three nations
that put together the March 1999 agreement, which slashed producers' output by
more than 4 million barrels per day and sent prices soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices have nearly tripled since then, surging to the highest levels since
the eve of the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saudi oil official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
producing nations feared that increasing output in the second quarter would
result in a sharp fall in prices, adversely affecting their revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   He said oil producers wanted to make sure that oil stocks in major
industrialized nations were low before an increase is implemented, otherwise,
prices would fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi said there was a possibility
demand would fall in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We cannot specify a stance now by producing countries on whether to
continue with the production cuts agreement or to increase production," Naimi
told reporters after receiving U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who
arrived from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson was to hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Naimi on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, the world's largest oil market, has been at the forefront
of calls to producing countries to raise their rates of production to increase
the world's supply of oil and bring down prices.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday in Kuwait, Richardson said Washington does not want to
manipulate markets or dictate prices.
</P>
<P>
	   While a price of $10 a barrel was "much too low," $30 a barrel was too high,
Richardson said. "What we want to see is stability in the oil market," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a meeting of Gulf oil ministers in the Saudi capital of Riyadh on
Wednesday, officials said the ministers favored a daily increase in production
of between 2 million and 2.5 million barrels -- about 8 percent to 10 percent.
That, they calculated, would lead to a price of crude oil of $20 to $25 a
barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   Some analysts have said an increase of at least 2 million barrels a day is
needed to stabilize markets and make a sufficient impact on oil stocks.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Sen. Condemns Bob Jones U.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., called Bob
Jones University ``a national embarrassment'' and said he might support a Senate
resolution condemning the fundamentalist Christian college for its views on
Catholicism and interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollings said Thursday he would consider supporting the resolution, which
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., plans to introduce. Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., said Friday he would introduce a similar resolution in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's worded properly, I might support it,'' Hollings said. ``I'm
embarrassed by the racism, the bigotry, the prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a national embarrassment to the state, I can tell you,'' Hollings
said. ``Racism and prejudice down there has been under the radar for years, and
I've had to face it in these elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina's senior senator, Republican Strom Thurmond, said he would
not support the resolution, decrying what he called ``a manufactured
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's resolution says university officials have made ``openly racist
remarks'' toward blacks and Asian-Americans and says officials have ``branded
Catholicism as a 'Satanic system and religion of the Antichrist.' '' It also
says the school ``enforces a segregationist policy by prohibiting the free
association of interracial couples on the Bob Jones University campus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones University was thrust into the national spotlight when Texas Gov.
George W. Bush made the school his first campaign stop after losing to Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., in the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary. McCain's
presidential campaign has criticized Bush for speaking at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Jonathan Pait said the school shouldn't have to defend
the policy. ``The issue is, does a religious institution in the United States of
America have the right to believe something? That goes to the top of the
Constitution,'' Pait said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., on Thursday called Torricelli's resolution
``opportunistic partisan sniping.'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and co-director
of McCain's South Carolina campaign, dismissed it as ``political
grandstanding.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graham, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., each
received an honorary degree from Bob Jones University last year. Hutchinson and
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, both R-Ark., are Bob Jones University graduates.

<HEADLINE> Judge denies reverse racial discrimination claim by State Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge Friday denied attempts by five
white men to stop a State Police entrance exam they say smacks of reverse racial
discrimination.
<P>
	   The college-educated plaintiffs complained they were unfairly weeded out of
the selection process when State Police officials launched a recruitment drive
for more minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
	   The drive comes on the heels of a controversy over racial profiling and
lawsuits alleging that State Police discriminated against minority and female
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge Anne E. Thompson denied the plaintiffs' request
that the exam, scheduled for Saturday, be halted.
</P>
<P>
	   The men were among 5,000 people who applied to take the entrance exam, but
were not among the 2,000 who were invited to take it.
</P>
<P>
	   State Police officials who screened the initial list were not aware of the
names, race, ethnicity or gender of the applicants, said State Police spokesman
John Hagerty.
</P>
<P>
	   The first 3,000 of the original applicants were disqualified for a variety
of reasons not related to race or gender, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those who did not get an invitation to test were screened out based on any
number of criteria, including a failure to outright meet the qualifications,"
Hagerty said, declining to specify what took the five plaintiffs out of
consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   The new color- and gender-blind screening process "is by far the most
equitable system in the marketplace today," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs' attorney, Stephen E. Klausner, did not immediately return a
phone message Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr., whom the plaintiffs
sued, said the judge did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that the suit was without merit and we are pleased that the
judge agrees with us," said spokesman Chuck Davis.
</P>
<P>
	   The men are Edward Joseph Dowgin Jr. of Hightstown, David Gosweiler of
Bridgeton, John Kirk of Smithville, Kevin Kirk of Little Egg Harbor Township and
David Ocello of Bloomfield. It was not clear if John Kirk and Kevin Kirk are
related.
</P>
<P>
	   All had earned either four-year or two-year college degrees. In addition,
Dowgin is a former special police officer in North Wildwood and Ocello is an
Essex County sheriff's officer.
</P>
<P>
	   In their complaint, the plaintiffs say they all met or exceeded State Police
entrance requirements and can think of no reason why they were not invited to
take the test other than reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "To increase the odds of others satisfactorily passing the written
examination, qualified Caucasian candidates such as plaintiffs were culled,
while less qualified women and minorities remained in the selection process,"
their complaint read.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint offered no evidence to back up their claim, however.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors gather outside Diallo's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A sometimes heated crowd gathered Friday night outside
the Bronx home of Amadou Diallo as the news quickly spread that four policemen
had been acquitted in his death.
<P>
	   "Murderers!" a dozen protesters chanted as they surrounded a parked car and
beat on it with their fists. A dozen police officers watched silently. More than
100 other people, mostly from the neighborhood, milled around on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate, the Rev. Al Sharpton issued a televised plea: "We do not want to
tarnish his name with any violence. Let not one brick be thrown."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, a sad-looking 11-year-old Francelin Ruiz
stood alone in the rain, watching the crowd. "He was just coming out of his
house," he said of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said another resident
of the Soundview neighborhood, Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to
young cops: They can get away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two hours, the crowd diminished. But dozens still came and went,
sharing their opinions and paying their respects. One knelt on the vestibule
steps and yelled, "Justice from Allah."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's message is, 'Don't move or you might get shot,"' said Robert
Torres, 33, a truck driver who lives two blocks from Diallo's home in the
Soundview section. "The first thing to do when you get to your door is thank
God."
</P>
<P>
	   Candles, flowers, press clippings and written messages filled the vestibule
where Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, fell in a hail of 41 bullets.
"Justice for Diallo," read one poster.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when shot, but the police
defendants said they thought it was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Rivera, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years, said
the verdict would have been different if a black or Latino had been charged in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it had been one of us, they would have hung us," said Rivera. "They just
murdered him; they knew they were going to get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Garvin Richardson, 21, who is black and wears his hair in dreadlocks, said
he has been searched by police without cause. "I work; I'm a college student.
You can't judge me. Everybody bleeds just like me."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad that no one can come out after dark" because he might be suspected
as a criminal," said 14-year-old Danny Melino.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, at Police Headquarters, the majority of televisions and radios
were tuned in to the verdicts. Most officers there showed visible signs of
relief. But a black officer had a blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse in Albany, about 40 Diallo supporters congregated as
the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Police supporters outside the courthouse cheered as each verdict was read.
But they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted, "Shame,"
and "They say justified, we say homicide."

<HEADLINE> Whitman meets with Parsons executive; both pledge strict oversight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Whitman administration officials said Friday that a
private contractor's "recovery plan" to end long lines at New Jersey centralized
auto inspection centers needs to revised, and that top officials from the
company and the state will personally monitor efforts to get the system working.
<P>
	   Gov. Christie Whitman and Transportation Commissioner James Weinstein said
they had "frank discussions" Friday with James F. McNulty, the chairman and
chief operating officer of the Pasadena, Calif.-based Parsons Corp., the parent
company of vendor Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have both bumped up the level of management involvement in this project,
and we've done that because it is critically important to both of us," Weinstein
said. "It's pretty clear some things broke down in our system, and there were
things, frankly, that we should have known about sooner. We're going to make
sure we know everything on a timely basis."
</P>
<P>
	   The auto inspection system forced long lines at many stations when it was
implemented Dec. 13 to help New Jersey meet is federal mandate to clean the air.
The Whitman administration says Parsons failed to live up to provisions of a
seven-year contract worth at least $400 million. The firm says the Whitman
administration bears some of the responsibility for making last minute changes
for computer software demands. Attorney General John Farmer is investigating why
a subcontractor's warnings about problems for Parsons weren't heeded.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has suspended the tougher auto emissions test and a complicated
computer system at the 15 centralized stations that had the biggest problems.
Cars at these stations are getting an old tailpipe test.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials are withholding a scheduled $10 million capital construction
payment from the firm until they are satisfied with the plan to make the system
work by June 30. In the plan, Parsons promises to fix computer software and
hardware problems, hire more people, improve training, and revamp how the lanes
are run.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein and Whitman said they want more detail on when everything will be
accomplished, and more specifics about how Parsons will train employees and
extinguish bugs in the computer system. Weinstein said the state is continuing
to withhold the $10 million payment.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, a spokesman for Parsons Infrastructure and Technology Group,
said the firm "will comply with whatever requests the state has for greater
specificity."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden said McNulty's meeting with Whitman and Weinstein "demonstrates that
top management of Parsons is committed to making this contract work."
</P>
<P>
	   Weinstein said he will assign deputy transportation commissioner Al Ari to
oversee the recovery plan. Parsons will assign top officials for the same
purpose, he said.

<HEADLINE> UPDATES grafs 7-9 with details from state, Pataki quote  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - There are few worries about critical Y2K computer
glitches popping up in New York on Tuesday, Feb. 29 - the "extra day" this leap
year.
<P>
	   Technology experts have said the addition of Feb. 29, 2000 to the calendar
could pose a potential problem for computers not programmed to deal with the
extra date. But the same state government and business officials who braced for
Y2K-related disasters on New Year's Eve expected little trouble this time
around.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials plan a limited activation of their Albany-based emergency
center, with about 20 workers monitoring the power grid and other key systems
Monday through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our Y2K efforts last year included preparing for the leap year transition
this year, so we're confident that there will be no disruptions to critical
state services that New Yorkers depend on," Gov. George Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is expected that if any problems do arise, they would affect billing or
record-keeping software not prepared for the leap year.
</P>
<P>
	   The state dispatched more than a hundred Y2K emergency workers to its
underground emergency center on Dec. 31 and in the days after. New York state,
like most of the world, made it into 2000 without serious computer problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Other computer-sensitive businesses such as power utilities and banks that
had taken extraordinary precautions two months ago appeared confident that Feb.
29 would be just another day. Officials with those companies, such as Niagara
Mohawk and Key Bank, said they had prepared for the leap year as part of their
overall Y2K readiness plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're confident that our systems are going to perform flawlessly," said
Central Hudson Gas and Electric spokeswoman Denise Van Buren.
</P>
<P>
	   Feb. 29 is one of the final Y2K-related hurdles for computers, but not the
last. Dec. 31, 2000, is also considered problematic because some computers might
not be expecting 366 days this year.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors gather outside Diallo's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A sometimes heated crowd gathered Friday night outside
the Bronx home of Amadou Diallo as the news quickly spread that four policemen
had been acquitted in his death.
<P>
	   "Murderers!" a dozen protesters chanted as they surrounded a parked car and
beat on it with their fists. A dozen police officers watched silently. More than
100 other people, mostly from the neighborhood, milled around on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate, Diallo's parents called for "calm" and the Rev. Al Sharpton issued
a televised plea: "We do not want to tarnish his name with any violence. Let not
one brick be thrown."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, a sad-looking 11-year-old Francelin Ruiz
stood alone in the rain, watching the crowd. "He was just coming out of his
house," he said of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said another resident
of the Soundview neighborhood, Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to
young cops: They can get away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two hours, the crowd diminished. But dozens still came and went,
sharing their opinions and paying their respects. One knelt on the vestibule
steps and yelled, "Justice from Allah."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's message is, 'Don't move or you might get shot,"' said Robert
Torres, 33, a truck driver who lives two blocks from Diallo's home in the
Soundview section. "The first thing to do when you get to your door is thank
God."
</P>
<P>
	   Candles, flowers, press clippings and written messages filled the vestibule
where Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, fell in a hail of 41 bullets.
"Justice for Diallo," read one poster.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when shot, but the police
defendants said they thought it was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Rivera, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years, said
the verdict would have been different if a black or Latino had been charged in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it had been one of us, they would have hung us," said Rivera. "They just
murdered him; they knew they were going to get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Garvin Richardson, 21, who is black and wears his hair in dreadlocks, said
he has been searched by police without cause. "I work; I'm a college student.
You can't judge me. Everybody bleeds just like me."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad that no one can come out after dark" because he might be suspected
as a criminal, said 14-year-old Danny Melino.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, at Police Headquarters, the majority of televisions and radios
were tuned in to the verdicts. Most officers there showed visible signs of
relief. But a black officer had a blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse in Albany, about 40 Diallo supporters congregated as
the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Police supporters outside the courthouse cheered as each verdict was read.
But they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted, "Shame,"
and "They say justified, we say homicide."

<HEADLINE> Bush stresses "Reaganesque" tax cut; Gore soars in poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Texas Gov. George W. Bush launched a pre-primary
television blitz in New York on Friday, including an ad stressing his
"Reaganesque" tax cut plan "worthy of a new president."
<P>
	   The ad calls Bush "a once-in-a-generation leader with a bold agenda" who
comes with a' fresh leadership style."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's New York campaign team, headed by Gov. George Pataki, said the ad
offensive is part of a $1.5 million effort by the Texas governor to sweep New
York's March 7 GOP primary and blunt Sen. John McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ad appeared designed to battle McCain for the Ronald Reagan mantle.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the McCain camp launched a new ad that said: "You can't turn on
your TV without seeing an ad from the establishment trying to fool you about me.
Here's some straight talk: I'm a proud Reagan Republican."
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown McCain closing fast on Bush in New York or having
already caught up to the Texas governor who has the backing of most of the
state's GOP hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, a new statewide poll showed Al Gore with a massive
and widening lead over Bill Bradley in New York among enrolled Democrats.
Nonetheless, the poll found the vice president's lead among those who definitely
plan to vote in the state's March 7 Democratic primary had narrowed.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, where Bradley once starred for the New York Knicks basketball
team, is considered a must-win state for the former senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll found that among
registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the
15-point lead the vice president held in a Marist poll released Feb. 8.
</P>
<P>
	   Among likely primary voters, Gore led Bradley, 59 percent to 33 percent, in
the new poll, up from a 21-point lead in the Feb. 8 poll.
</P>
<P>
	   But among those Democrats considered definitely set to vote in the
Democratic primary, Gore led, 53 percent to 38 percent, a slip from the 25-point
margin the vice president enjoyed among such voters in the earlier poll.
</P>
<P>
	   It is all a far cry from December, when the Marist poll showed Gore and
Bradley in a statistical tie among New York Democrats. In that poll, Gore was
favored by 43 percent of voters to 40 percent for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were Gore, I would be spending a lot more time in California and the
Pacific Northwest" than in New York, veteran Democratic campaign consultant Hank
Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest poll, Gore's favorable rating among New York Democrats rose to
74 percent, up from 68 percent in December. Bradley's favorable rating stood at
69 percent in the new survey, statistically unchanged from the 67 percent
positive rating he enjoyed in December.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest Marist telephone poll of 526 enrolled Democrats was conducted
Feb. 20-22 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Make 'Bionic Chip'  </HEADLINE>
    By CLIFF EDWARDS AP Technology Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Don't look for the Six Million Dollar Man just yet,
but researchers say they have found a way to mate human cells with circuitry in
a "bionic chip" that could play a key role in medicine and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
	   The tiny device -- smaller and thinner than a strand of hair -- combines a
healthy human cell with an electronic circuitry chip. By controlling the chip
with a computer, scientists say they can control the activity of the cell.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer sends electrical impulses to the cell-chip, triggering the
cell's membrane pores to open and activating the cell. Scientists hope they can
manufacture cell-chips in large numbers and insert them into the body to replace
or correct diseased tissues.
</P>
<P>
	   The cell-chip also gives them greater control over the difficult process of
gene therapy because they can more precisely open the cell's pores, said lead
researcher Boris Rubinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've brought engineering essentially into the field of biology," said
Rubinsky, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of California,
Berkeley, which funded his research. "We can introduce DNA, extract proteins,
administer medicines -- all without bothering other cells that might be around."
</P>
<P>
	   The cell-chip, profiled in the March issue of the journal Biomedical
Microdevices, rests on a long-known phenomenon: Cell membranes become permeable
when exposed to certain voltages.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists for years have been conducting genetic research in a
time-consuming trial-and-error process of bombarding cells with electricity in
an attempt to introduce foreign substances such as new drug treatments or
genetic material.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers hope eventually they can develop cell-chips tuned for the
precise voltage needed to activate different bodily tissues, from muscle to bone
to brain. That way, cell-chips could be applied by the thousands to correct a
variety of health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the past, any electricity applied to the cell was like hitting it with a
hammer in the hopes that something would happen, or it would open for us. Now,
we know just how to make it work," Rubinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mauro Ferrari, director of the Biomedical Engineering Center at Ohio State
University, called Rubinsky's invention a "potentially useful laboratory tool in
the early stages of development."
</P>
<P>
	   "The method for opening cells has been around a long time, but this makes it
more exact and easier to do in large throws," Ferrari said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems to me that we have a ways to go before you'd see a bionic man," he
said, but the ability to program cells quickly could accelerate genetic
research.

<HEADLINE> Ford Extends Vehicle Warranties  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said Friday it would extend engine warranties
again on 717,680 vehicles after complaints that a defective part was creating
huge repair bills.
</P>
<P>
	   The warranty on head gasket failure in 3.8-liter V6 engines will now last
seven years and 100,000 miles for engines installed in 1994 Lincoln
Continentals, 1995 Ford Windstar minivans, and 1994-95 Ford Tauruses and Mercury
Sables.
</P>
<P>
	   The warranty already had been extended once in 1998 from the original length
of three years and 36,000 miles to five years and 60,000 miles on the same
Taurus, Sable and Windstar models and to six years or 75,000 miles on the
Continental.
</P>
<P>
	   The head gasket is a seal that directs coolant in the engine. If it fails,
the loss of coolant can ruin the engine.
</P>
<P>
	   Owners of the vehicles whose head gaskets failed during the new warranty
period will be eligible for a refund of their repair bills or a $4,000 coupon
towards the purchase of a new Ford, Mercury or Lincoln. Vehicle owners will be
notified by mail in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer advocates contend that other Ford vehicles not covered by the
extended warranty have also suffered from early head gasket failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Auto Safety wrote Ford in November, saying it had received
more than 115 complaints about early head gasket failures in Ford vehicles
dating back to 1988. The average repair bill was $1,648, with engine replacement
costs running as high as $4,200.
</P>
<P>
	   CAS said the average reported mileage when the gaskets failed was 65,750,
rather than the expected 120,000 miles. CAS cited several cases where it said
the head gasket had failed just outside the extended warranty.
</P>
<P>
	   No one at the center could be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ann O'Neill, the director of vehicle service for Ford customer service, said
Ford made the original extension with the belief that it would cover most head
gasket problems in that engine.
</P>
<P>
	   "But, as these vehicles have aged, we have received new data that indicate
that some owners are having failures outside the original warranty extension,"
she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford declined to specify how many complaints it had received about the
engine.

<HEADLINE> Nine now charged in hazing incidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) - Nine Trumbull High School wrestlers have been
charged in a series of hazing incidents which allegedly included the insertion
of a plastic knife handle in a sophomore teammate's rectum.
<P>
	   Trumbull police Detective Sgt. Mike Harry said Christopher Ricci, 16, was
charged as an adult Friday with unlawful restraint, attempted assault and
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other team members, both 18, were also charged as adults this week.
Jeremy Dommu and Daniel Scinto, both seniors, are two of the team's three
captains.
</P>
<P>
	   Dommu was charged with felonious assault, unlawful restraint, conspiracy and
reckless endangerment. Scinto was charged with assault, two counts of conspiracy
and one count each of first- and second-degree unlawful restraint.
</P>
<P>
	   Six other team members, all under the age of 16, were charged as juveniles
last week; their names and the details of the charges against them were not
released.
</P>
<P>
	   An affidavit filed in the case did not identify the students allegedly
involved in the sodomy attack.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the affidavit, one hazing victim - a 15-year-old, first-year
wrestler - was locked in his locker at least twice, spat upon and hit with a
plastic stick.
</P>
<P>
	   On one occasion, he was held down by several teammates while others
sodomized him with the handle of a plastic knife.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the victim was also bound with athletic tape, placed on a device
used to roll wrestling mats and pushed into a wall, suffering an injury to his
knee.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, three students were hazed, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harry said Friday no further arrests were expected, and said no other
students, past or present, have complained about hazing.
</P>
<P>
	   "These are not bad kids in the school," he said. "They're smart kids,
well-behaved."
</P>
<P>
	   First-year wrestling coach Josh Tolk, who was not present when the alleged
hazing took place, will not face criminal charges but is subject to disciplinary
action by the school district. Superintendent Ralph Iassogna said last week he
could not discuss the Tolk case.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has had a severe impact on the school," Iassogna told The New York
Times in a story published Friday. "It has resulted in a disruption of the
educational process, and we expect to enact new measures to ensure nothing like
this happens again."
</P>
<P>
	   Expulsion hearings were held this week for several of the team members and
are expected to continue next week. School officials refused to disclose the
results until all the cases are decided.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar incidents were reported earlier this month involving the Newtown
High School wrestling team. The Nighthawks were forced to forfeit four matches
after some team members were caught trying to initiate a freshman by dunking his
head into a toilet bowl.

<HEADLINE> Bradley fills the TV airwaves as Gore lies low  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - With a comfortable lead in the polls, Vice President
Al Gore has significantly slowed his campaign spending since the New Hampshire
primary, conserving money for a last-minute advertising blitz before more than a
dozen states vote on March 7.
<P>
	   Rival Bill Bradley is trying to take advantage of the lull, outspending Gore
by 2-to-1 on TV. The former New Jersey senator is concentrating on California,
New York and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got to make a last stand," said Evan Tracey of Campaign Media
Analysis, who tracks ad spending. "There's no tomorrow if he gets routed on
Super Tuesday."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Iowa and New Hampshire contests, Bradley has spent a total of
about $2.6 million on television commercials, while Gore has spent just
$950,000, according to Tracey's tracking.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign officials say they'll catch up, with plans to spend hundreds
of thousands of dollars in the final week before voting. It's part of the plan,
they said, to conserve money until the end, when voters begin to focus on the
race.
</P>
<P>
	   If Bradley ups his spending or makes a strong play for another battleground
state, the Gore camp plans to follow, campaign officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ads are designed to appeal to Democrats on education, health care, gun
control, the environment and abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Gore began airing two new TV spots - one featuring footage of
James Brady trumpeting Gore's gun control efforts and another for Washington
state with a mountaineer recalling what it was like to climb Mount Rainier with
the vice president and his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent Bradley ads have contrasted his consistent record for abortion rights
with Gore's muddled past.
</P>
<P>
	   Nowhere is the mismatch in spending more striking than the biggest March 7
prizes: New York and California. Bradley has spent about $1 million in each
state, Tracey reports, compared to less than $300,000 for Gore in New York and
$450,000 in California. A Democratic official who also is tracking ad buys says
recent purchases in California have bumped Bradley up to $1.9 million and Gore
to $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has also outspent Gore in Maryland, mostly in the Baltimore market.
And he's spent more modestly in Connecticut, Maine, Ohio, Rhode Island,
Missouri, Minnesota, Florida and Illinois - all states where Gore ads have yet
to appear. Most of those states saw an ad featuring Michael Jordan for a few
days.
</P>
<P>
	   The spending is closer in Washington state, which Bradley has targeted as
his best chance for a boost in a beauty contest primary on Tuesday, a week
before Democratic delegates actually are awarded in caucus meetings. Bradley has
spent some $500,000 there, double Gore's spending. A Gore aide said his campaign
is outspending Bradley on radio.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley and Gore each began February with just under $16 million remaining
in their accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   But, confident that he will get the nomination, Gore is hoping he won't have
to spend all his money competing against Bradley. Anything left for the eventual
nominee can be spent on feel-good ads leading up to the summer's convention.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in a position right now where we need to plan for the long-term,"
said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. "We're going to compete as vigorously as
possible on March 7, but we can't go for broke. We're planning to be around a
little longer."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's team said it is also thinking long term.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a long-term plan and we're executing it," said Bradley spokeswoman
Kristen Ludecke. "The real point is the Gore campaign has wasted their money on
overhead and not in a position to spend that kind of money on television."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who began the GOP contest with a
tremendous financial advantage, has outspent Arizona Sen. John McCain in states
with upcoming primaries. But McCain is catching up, having dramatically narrowed
the gap.
</P>
<P>
	   With plenty of time to buy ads before March 7 voting, the two appear to be
virtually even in recent spending for Virginia, California, Ohio and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   So while observers once believed that Bush would secure his party's
nomination with millions to spend in the spring and summer, that seems less
likely now.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, if Gore wins his race, he could wind up with the financial edge
going into the summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's camp professes no concerns, saying fund raising continues.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll have plenty of resources," said spokesman Scott McClellan. "We're
continuing to build upon our support."

<HEADLINE> Neighbors gather outside Diallo's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A sometimes heated crowd gathered Friday night outside
the Bronx home of Amadou Diallo as the news quickly spread that four policemen
had been acquitted in his death.
<P>
	   "Murderers!" a dozen protesters chanted as they surrounded a parked car and
beat on it with their fists. A dozen police officers watched silently. More than
100 other people, mostly from the neighborhood, milled around on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   Scores of protesters walked three-quarters of a mile from Diallo's home to
the 43rd Precinct police station, which was guarded by 40 officers in riot gear.
Then they headed back to his home, where two dozen anti-riot officers briefly
stood by, chatting casually and keeping a block's distance.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two people were arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest as they ran through the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate, Diallo's parents called for "calm" and the Rev. Al Sharpton issued
a televised plea: "We do not want to tarnish his name with any violence. Let not
one brick be thrown."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, a sad-looking 11-year-old Francelin Ruiz
stood alone in the rain, watching the crowd. "He was just coming out of his
house," he said of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said another resident
of the Soundview neighborhood, Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to
young cops: They can get away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two hours, the crowd diminished. But dozens still came and went,
sharing their opinions and paying their respects. One knelt on the vestibule
steps and yelled, "Justice from Allah."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's message is, 'Don't move or you might get shot,"' said Robert
Torres, 33, a truck driver who lives two blocks from Diallo's home in the
Soundview section. "The first thing to do when you get to your door is thank
God."
</P>
<P>
	   Candles, flowers, press clippings and written messages filled the vestibule
where Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, fell in a hail of 41 bullets.
"Justice for Diallo," read one poster.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when shot, but the police
defendants said they thought it was a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Rivera, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years, said
the verdict would have been different if a black or Latino had been charged in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it had been one of us, they would have hung us," said Rivera. "They just
murdered him; they knew they were going to get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Garvin Richardson, 21, who is black and wears his hair in dreadlocks, said
he has been searched by police without cause. "I work; I'm a college student.
You can't judge me. Everybody bleeds just like me."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad that no one can come out after dark" because he might be suspected
as a criminal, said 14-year-old Danny Melino.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, at Police Headquarters, the majority of televisions and radios
were tuned in to the verdicts. Most officers there showed visible signs of
relief. But a black officer had a blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse in Albany, about 40 Diallo supporters congregated as
the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Police supporters outside the courthouse cheered as each verdict was read.
But they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted, "Shame,"
and "They say justified, we say homicide."

<HEADLINE> Cops acquitted on all counts in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Their faith in an upstate jury rewarded, four white
New York police officers were acquitted of all charges Friday afternoon for
killing an unarmed West African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 bullets - a case
that polarized the city.
<P>
	   "Not guilty," the jury forewoman, a transplanted Bronx resident, intoned 24
times in clearing the four members of murdering Amadou Diallo, 22, as he stood
in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquitted officers - Sean Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth
Boss, 28; and Richard Murphy, 27 - hugged one another and their lawyers after
the verdicts were returned at 4:45 p.m. inside an overheated, emotionally
wrought courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   On either side of the courtroom aisle, families of both the defendants and
the victim listened intently to the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers' families began weeping and hugging when it became clear that
all four would be acquitted of all charges, ranging from murder to reckless
endangerment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo family and its supporters sat quietly through the verdict, but
the slain man's mother, Kadiatou, had her cheeks streaked with tears as she
exited the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse, a composed Mrs. Diallo called for calm in the wake
of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was transferred upstate after an appeals court ruled that finding
in impartial jury in New York City was impossible. The jury agreed with the
defense lawyer's repeated contention that the slaying was a tragic mistake, not
a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police officers have to be able to do their jobs," said Stephen Worth,
attorney for McMellon. "When the evidence supports them, a jury will support
them."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rev. Al Sharpton blamed the change of venue, by taking the case out
of the Bronx, for the acquittal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had no chance of real justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury - four black women, one white woman and seven white men -
deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days after a month-long trial in
the case that provoked nearly a month of protests over police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-mayor David Dinkins and actress Susan Sarandon were among hundreds
arrested in demonstrations outside police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The jurors, through the trial judge, said they would not speak with
reporters about their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, whose shout of "Gun!" prompted the shooting on Wheeler Avenue in
the Bronx, sat dazed in his chair as the courtroom emptied. During the reading
of the verdict, tears ran down Murphy's cheeks; Boss closed his eyes and dropped
his head in relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The reaction in Diallo's neighborhood was swift and almost unanimous in its
condemnation of the verdict. Several hundred local residents marched on the 43rd
Precinct to protest the acquittal, with two of them arrested for disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's an attack on the black and Latino community," said Rico
Berrios, who lives two blocks from Wheeler Avenue. "It's time to respond."
</P>
<P>
	   The acquittal didn't end the legal problems for the officers, members of a
roving unit of plainclothes officers that allegedly stopped and frisked young
black men without cause.
</P>
<P>
	   A civil suit was expected against the officers and the city in the next few
weeks, and there was also the chance of a federal civil rights investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been monitoring the trial," said Justice Department spokeswoman
Myron Marlin. "Now we will review the case to see what, if any, federal action
is required."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking at City Hall after the verdict, called the
shooting "a great tragedy. We express once again our sympathy to Mrs. Diallo,
Mr. Diallo, to the Diallo family."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said the verdict followed "an eminently fair trial under very,
very difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-nine witnesses testified in the three-week trial, but the most
important were likely the four officers themselves. Each told a similar tale of
Diallo acting strangely as they combed the neighborhood for violent suspects
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, they said, ignored repeated warnings by Carroll and McMellon to
"Stop!" and "Show your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-foot-6, 150-pound Diallo darted into the dimly lighted entrance of his
building and drew a black object that looked like a gun. Boss recalled that
Diallo was in a "combat stance." The officers, fearing for their lives, opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon, the first to shoot, emptied their 16-shot guns. Boss
fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their partners. Diallo was hit
with 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll wept on the stand while recalling the shock of realizing the black
object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Although one witness said she heard an officer shout "Gun!" before the
shooting started, several prosecution "ear witnesses" - mainly neighbors of
Diallo - testified they never heard the officers' voices before gunfire erupted.

<HEADLINE> Gore spanning nation, Bradley focusing on Washington - and McCain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CLEVELAND (AP) - Al Gore took off for a week of hopscotching states with
big primary jackpots Friday, picking up liberal endorsements on his way. Bill
Bradley camped in Washington state, trying to wrest primary voters from
Republican John McCain as well Democrat Gore.
<P>
	   McCain has gained support from independents and Democrats in his primary
battles with George W. Bush, and Bradley was trying hard to keep that from
happening in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   In campaign handouts and in his public remarks, Bradley was contrasting his
record with McCain's on the environment, an important and emotional issue in the
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   "McCain is a reformer and I'm a reformer," Bradley said. "We both want
campaign finance reform. There's no question about it. But when it comes to the
environment there's a vast difference between John McCain and me."
</P>
<P>
	   He criticized McCain for calling a West Coast salmon project "pork barrel"
spending, and he said he had an 84 percent vote rating from the League of
Conservation Voters compared with McCain's 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't spare Gore, either, saying the vice president "never saw a dam he
didn't like."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was endorsed by local environmental leaders as a champion of Pacific
Northwest concerns such as pipeline safety, salmon restoration and prevention of
oil tanker spills. He was accompanied by Marlene Robinson, mother of Liam Wood,
a teen-ager killed in a petroleum pipeline explosion in Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's campaign strategy - ignore the delegate-rich states with March 7
primaries and hunker down for a symbolic victory in Washington's nonbinding Feb.
29 contest - confounded California-based Democratic consultant Bill Carrick.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's ridiculous. He should be spending all his time here or New
York," Carrick said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's smooth sail, buoyed by a growing lead in polls, was delayed only
slightly Friday when the plane chartered for his campaign press entourage was
grounded at Andrews Air Force Base because of hydraulic failure.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's Secret Service agents and military valets squeezed into
the forward cabins on Air Force Two to make room for stranded reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The mix of campaign and government showed up again when reporters were
handed "Gore 2000" press releases bearing the stamp of the official fax machine
in Gore's White House communications office.
</P>
<P>
	   One release trumpeted his endorsement by Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del. Another
promoted Gore's campaign stop at Cleveland's Eliza Bryant Center, the first
senior citizens housing center in Cleveland to accept black residents.
</P>
<P>
	   There, Gore pushed his plan for a huge, open-ended expansion of Medicare to
cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll bet you know some people who sometimes take out their prescriptions,
put 'em out on the table and try to figure out which one they can cut back on or
cut out," Gore told about 75 senior citizens. "Has anyone here ever done that?
Have you?"
</P>
<P>
	   Biden breakfasted privately with Gore before he left Washington. The vice
president also was being endorsed by Jerry Brown, the Oakland, Calif., mayor and
three-time failed presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown was expected to appear with Gore - but not definitely so, aides
cautioned - at an Oakland longshoreman's union hall very late on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Both endorsements were expected to help dampen some of Bradley's most barbed
criticisms of Gore - that he's a closet conservative who pays lip service to
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, who left the Democratic Party to be independent, made campaign
finance a principal cause as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also was endorsed Friday by Colorado Rep. Mark Udall, son of the late
Mo Udall, who ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   In the next week, Gore plans to visit Washington state, Colorado, Arizona,
Georgia, New York and Massachusetts in addition to Friday's Ohio and California.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest New York poll released Friday showed Gore's lead widening among
enrolled Democrats there but narrowing among those who definitely plan to vote
in the state's March 7 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's primary is considered a must for Bradley, the former senator
from New Jersey who once starred for the New York Knicks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
	   Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion poll found that among
registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the
15-point lead the vice president held two weeks ago. Among those Democrats who
said they will definitely vote on March 7, Gore's lead slipped to 53-38, down
from the 25-point margin he enjoyed earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, it was a far cry from December, when the Marist poll showed Gore and
Bradley in a statistical tie in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I were Gore, I would be spending a lot more time in California and the
Pacific Northwest" than in New York, veteran Democratic campaign consultant Hank
Sheinkopf said.

<HEADLINE> Columbia Univ. senate votes for stronger stance against sexual  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In hopes of inoculating the campus against sexual
misconduct, a Columbia University panel of students and faculty voted Friday to
strengthen the school's response to violations.
<P>
	   For starters, they agreed to hire someone to oversee complaints and make it
easier for victims to seek justice.
</P>
<P>
	   The student and faculty senate decided in favor of the sweeping changes -
including better training for university personnel and more student education -
after a grassroots group drafted several changes to Columbia's existing
policies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Under the old policy, sexual assault was dealt with the same way as any
other infraction," said Ashley Burczak, one of the coordinators.
</P>
<P>
	   "The policy was very ineffective, there was no due process, and those
dealing with these issues weren't very well trained."
</P>
<P>
	   Teaching the responsible use of alcohol will be one idea stressed under the
new program.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, the faculty and student senate approved five new resolutions on
sexual assault and harassment. One calls for creating an oversight committee;
another for hiring someone full-time to coordinate all university response to
sexual misconduct. Advocates were particularly concerned that Columbia police
might be under-reporting sexual crimes and hoped a coordinator could better
monitor the statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   And to make things easier for victims, defendants in university misconduct
cases will no longer be allowed in the same room when an accuser outlines his or
her allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Student organizations - led by Students Active for Ending Rape (SAFER) - had
argued that the university's old policy on sexual misconduct was ineffective and
largely defunct. It was adopted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The first four resolutions passed without much debate Friday, but discussion
snagged on the precise definition of sexual misconduct and certain aspects of
the grievance procedure, particularly the issue of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   One version called for students and faculty who engaged in the university's
grievance procedure to be barred from talking about it to the media or anyone
else. In the end, the panel decided to allow such conversations, as long as the
identities of other participants remain confidential.

<HEADLINE> Report Cites Some Human Rights Gains  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright accused Russia of
brutality in Chechnya and demanded Friday a full and open investigation into
reports of massacres in the rebellious region.
</P>
<P>
	   She said whole Chechen neighborhoods had been devastated through
indiscriminate attacks by Russian troops in their offensive to quell the
uprising.
</P>
<P>
	   In releasing the State Department's annual global human rights report,
Albright singled out not only Russia but Sudan, Cuba, North Korea and Burma as
countries whose governments must change their ways.
</P>
<P>
	   And at this end, she said, ``We have a responsibility to keep the spotlight
turned on high until they do.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the bright side in 1999, free elections in Indonesia and Nigeria, two of
the world's most populous states, put more people under democratic rule than at
any time since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   In Russia, which the report said has built well-defined constitutional
structures, the government's human rights record last year was described as
uneven and even worse in some respects.
</P>
<P>
	   Government forces killed numerous civilians through the use of
indiscriminate force in Chechnya, the report said, and security officials beat
many people to death.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the report said, human rights groups allege that 10,000 to 20,000
people die annually in extremely harsh Russian prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   In other areas, Harold Koh, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
said abuses in China multiplied even as the Clinton administration attempted to
promote reform through engagement with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities intensified efforts to suppress those considered threatening to
the government, and political and religious dissenters faced widespread
repression, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright also rejected calls by critics for restrictions on U.S. trade with
China. She said prospects for progress through ties with China were better than
if ties were cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Koh said there was marked deterioration in China last year. ``There
is a limit to how much you can do,'' he said when reminded at a news conference
that President Clinton has pursued an engagement policy for years.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said his faith was unshakable that contact with China is the best way
to foster human rights improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   Yugoslavia's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Cuba's suppression of
opponents and other critics of President Fidel Castro's government, North
Korea's near-total ban on organized opposition, the disappearance of two
well-known dissidents in Belarus, summary executions in Iraq and murder of human
rights activists by paramilitary forces in Colombia were among abuses listed in
the report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certain countries seem to take particular pleasure in restricting the
right to democratic dissent,'' the report said, citing Cuba and Yugoslavia's
Serbian republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also said international intervention in the Serbian province of
Kosovo and in East Timor, a region where a vote for independence from Indonesia
in August led to a crackdown, ``demonstrated that the international community
has the will and the capacity to act against the most profound violations of
human rights.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday night, the Senate moved to bring increased international
monitoring of the human rights situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   A resolution proposed by Sen. Paul D. Wellstone, D-Minn., also urged Russia
to halt its military operations in the republic and begin peace talks with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We must fully condemn the use of indiscriminate force against the
civilians in Chechnya and denial of humanitarian relief to Chechen civilians,''
Wellstone said. ``We must remind the Russian leadership that the world is
watching.''

<HEADLINE> S.C. Sen. Condemns Bob Jones U.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Sen. Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, D-S.C., called Bob
Jones University ``a national embarrassment'' and said he might support a Senate
resolution condemning the fundamentalist Christian college for its views on
Catholicism and interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
	   Hollings said Thursday he would consider supporting the resolution, which
Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., plans to introduce. Rep. John Conyers Jr.,
D-Mich., said Friday he would introduce a similar resolution in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's worded properly, I might support it,'' Hollings said. ``I'm
embarrassed by the racism, the bigotry, the prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a national embarrassment to the state, I can tell you,'' Hollings
said. ``Racism and prejudice down there has been under the radar for years, and
I've had to face it in these elections.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Charlie Condon on Friday criticized Hollings'
comments, calling them ``nothing but an attempt to help Al Gore and the
Democrats at the expense of Bob Jones University and its many fine graduates.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina's senior senator, Republican Strom Thurmond, said he would
not support the resolution, decrying what he called ``a manufactured
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli's resolution says university officials have made ``openly racist
remarks'' toward blacks and Asian-Americans and says officials have ``branded
Catholicism as a 'Satanic system and religion of the Antichrist.' '' It also
says the school ``enforces a segregationist policy by prohibiting the free
association of interracial couples on the Bob Jones University campus.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Jones University was thrust into the national spotlight when Texas Gov.
George W. Bush made the school his first campaign stop after losing to Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., in the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary. McCain's
presidential campaign has criticized Bush for speaking at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokesman Jonathan Pait said the school shouldn't have to defend
the policy. ``The issue is, does a religious institution in the United States of
America have the right to believe something? That goes to the top of the
Constitution,'' Pait said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., on Thursday called Torricelli's resolution
``opportunistic partisan sniping.'' Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and co-director
of McCain's South Carolina campaign, dismissed it as ``political
grandstanding.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graham, Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., each
received an honorary degree from Bob Jones University last year. Hutchinson and
Sen. Tim Hutchinson, both R-Ark., are Bob Jones University graduates.

<HEADLINE> Police scour city for murder suspect as pregnant teen recovers from  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - What Christopher Segars has seen over and over
again on the news finally hit too close to home, and he's having a hard time
believing it all.
<P>
	   Two of his neighbors - a brother and sister - were murdered in their
apartment on the city's north side Thursday afternoon and their pregnant sister
was stabbed during a six-hour rampage.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was totally in shock," Segars said. "You hear about this, but you never
think it will happen to you."
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the suspect, armed with a shotgun and knife, shot 25-year-old
Margarita Salvador in the chest and stabbed 17-year-old Ruminego Jacinto to
death. Their bodies were found inside the apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the suspect also stabbed 18-year-old Nancy Jacinto three times
in the upper chest. She escaped when the attacker chased a witness out the back
door of the apartment, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another man and woman were tied up and gagged inside the apartment, and
three small children were trapped inside with them during the long ordeal,
Police Capt. Richard Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   Segars, who was arriving home from work just after 4 p.m., said he heard a
man yell "somebody got shot" before Jacinto, pregnant and bleeding heavily while
clutching an infant, approached him.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacinto followed Segars up his porch as he went inside to call 911, he said.
After placing the call for help, Segars said he grabbed a blanket to help keep
them warm.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacinto was transported to University Hospital in critical condition and
underwent emergency surgery. Doctors said Friday that her condition had
stabilized and that her fetus was not injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were searching for 38-year-old Angel Carrasquillo, the ex-boyfriend
of Nancy Jacinto and father of her 9-month-old daughter. They said Carrasquillo
killed Jacinto's brother when he tried to break up an argument the estranged
couple was having.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the attacker shot and killed Salvador when she walked through
the back door hours later with her husband, who managed to escape.
</P>
<P>
	   Police believe Carrasquillo was angry about his break-up with Nancy Jacinto.
A helicopter, cruisers and police dogs combed the city looking for the attacker,
who police believe lives on the west side of Syracuse. He was still at large
Friday and considered dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have been notified nationwide to look for the suspect, but police
said Friday night that they have no evidence that he has left the city, said
Sgt. Joe Sweeny.
</P>
<P>
	   the shotgun believed to be used in the crime was found in a yard down the
street, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attacker is described at 5 feet, 10 inches to 6 feet tall, 170 to 190
pounds, wearing a black leather jacket, jeans and baseball cap. He is wanted for
two counts of murder, attempted murder, and other charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents of the normally peaceful neighborhood said the Salvadors, who have
two young children, were migrant farm workers from Mexico who had lived in the
neighborhood for six years but spoke little English.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the Salvadors were family oriented and would do anything for
their children. And like Segars, disbelief gripped them, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "They were good people," said Frank Williams, who lives upstairs from the
crime scene. "That's why I can't believe this is happening."

<HEADLINE> Neighbors gather outside Diallo's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A sometimes heated crowd gathered Friday night outside
the Bronx home of Amadou Diallo as the news quickly spread that four policemen
had been acquitted in his death.
<P>
	   "Murderers!" a dozen protesters chanted as they surrounded a parked car and
beat on it with their fists. A dozen police officers watched silently. More than
100 other people, mostly from the neighborhood, milled around on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   Another group - eventually about 150 - walked three-quarters of a mile from
Diallo's home to the 43rd Precinct police station, which was guarded by 40
officers in riot gear. The protesters shouted angrily but remained peaceful,
then headed back to Diallo's home, where two dozen anti-riot officers stood by,
trying to keep protesters from blocking nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two people were arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting
arrest as they ran through the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate, Diallo's parents called for "calm" and the Rev. Al Sharpton issued
a televised plea: "We do not want to tarnish his name with any violence. Let not
one brick be thrown."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, a sad-looking 11-year-old Francelin Ruiz
stood alone in the rain, watching the crowd. "He was just coming out of his
house," he said of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said another resident
of the Soundview neighborhood, Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to
young cops: They can get away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two hours, the crowd diminished. But dozens still came and went,
sharing their opinions and paying their respects. One knelt on the vestibule
steps and yelled, "Justice from Allah."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's message is, 'Don't move or you might get shot,"' said Robert
Torres, 33, a truck driver who lives two blocks from Diallo's home. "The first
thing to do when you get to your door is thank God."
</P>
<P>
	   Candles, flowers, press clippings and written messages filled the vestibule
where Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, fell in a hail of 41 bullets.
"Justice for Diallo," read one poster.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when shot, but the police
defendants said they thought it was a firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Rivera, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years, said
the verdict would have been different if a black or Latino had been charged in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it had been one of us, they would have hung us," said Rivera. "They just
murdered him; they knew they were going to get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Garvin Richardson, 21, who is black and wears his hair in dreadlocks, said
he has been searched by police without cause. "I work; I'm a college student.
You can't judge me. Everybody bleeds just like me."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad that no one can come out after dark" because he might be suspected
as a criminal, said 14-year-old Danny Melino.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, at Police Headquarters, the majority of televisions and radios
were tuned in to the verdicts. Most officers there showed visible signs of
relief. But a black officer had a blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse in Albany, about 40 Diallo supporters congregated as
the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Police supporters outside the courthouse cheered as each verdict was read.
But they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted, "Shame,"
and "They say justified, we say homicide."

<HEADLINE> Shock and relief, anger and frustration at Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Shock mixed with anger, relief with frustration Friday
as New Yorkers responded to a stunning verdict in the case that touched some of
the city's deepest-running tensions.
<P>
	   Many in the Bronx - where four white police officers shot 41 times at West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo - were outraged by the patrolmen's acquittal in
Albany. Minorities particularly complained that the verdicts meant police could
walk free after reacting violently against black and Latino New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   At City Hall, a visibly tense Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the verdict
confirmed his belief that Diallo's death was "a great tragedy," not a crime.
Giuliani's administration suffered some of its worst days after Diallo's death,
which sparked massive protests and strained the mayor's already cool
relationship with the black community.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was an eminently fair trial under very, very difficult circumstances,"
Giuliani said at a hastily convened news conference after the verdict was
announced.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this jury reaffirms our confidence in the American system of
justice. There are going to be people who have very, very different viewpoints
of this case. That's to be expected."
</P>
<P>
	   Outside Diallo's home in the Soundview section of the Bronx, hundreds
gathered to protest and some chanted "Murderers!"
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Eric Adams, co-founder of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, said the verdict "cut like a knife."
</P>
<P>
	   "The courts have made a very clear decision that the taking of a life of an
African-American because of the created fears of white officers is permissible
in the state of New York," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many blamed the verdict on the appeals' court decision to move the trial to
Albany because of intense publicity here.
</P>
<P>
	   "We said from the beginning that the change of venue was set up for this,
and it was," said the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also called for supporters to eschew violence and urged federal
officials to file criminal civil rights charges against the acquitted officers:
Sean Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth Boss, 28; and Richard Murphy, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe the federal government will turn this around," Sharpton said.
"Any man in this nation has the right to look down his street, any man has the
right to expect the police to protect him, not to shoot him."
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said she would review the case and decide
whether to file civil rights charges, as prosecutors did when a white suburban
jury acquitted the officers in the videotaped beating of black Los Angeles
motorist Rodney King. White said in a statement that such a review was a matter
of course.
</P>
<P>
	   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman in Washington, said the
department had monitored the trial and would review the case to see if federal
action is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Others calling for a federal civil rights investigation included NAACP
president Kweisi Mfume, Rep. Charles Rangel, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone,
Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields and the New York Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said federal charges would be
inappropriate, since the state trial was clearly fair.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know those rules like the back of my hand," he said. "This case doesn't
fall within those rules. The crux of those rules is a conclusion ... that a
person did not receive a fair trial."
</P>
<P>
	   Police Commissioner Howard Safir called Diallo's death "a terrible tragedy"
but agreed that the trial was "extremely fair."
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that anybody who's fair-minded believes that those four
police officers left their homes that morning with any intention of shooting
anybody," Safir said. "I think that the verdict in this case is the proper one."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki urged people to remember the life of Diallo, a
22-year-old street vendor, and accept the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   "After a fair and complete trial of the facts, a cross-section of New
Yorkers has heard all the evidence and entered their verdict," the governor said
in a statement. "We must have confidence in our judicial system and respect the
jury's verdict."
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said the verdict must not divide New
Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must honor Amadou Diallo's memory by coming together to build a stronger
community," she said in Chicago. "We must all work together towards the day when
all citizens and all police treat each other with mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said he would not second-guess jurors, but that it was impossible to
understand why 41 shots were fired at Diallo. Like many others, he said the case
highlighted major problems with police training and officers' relationships with
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am angry at the verdict because I know that the tragic death of Amadou
Diallo could not have occurred in a white community, or if the victim was not of
color," he said in a statement. "If indeed the officers were in fear for their
lives, it means that they were untrained, unprofessional and unfamiliar with the
community which they were charged to protect."

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Sues IRS  </HEADLINE>
   By SONJA BARISIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Christian Coalition filed a federal lawsuit Friday
accusing the Internal Revenue Service of discriminating against the conservative
group by denying it tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS unfairly denied the coalition's application for tax exemption while
granting that status to ``liberal'' groups such as the Democratic Leadership
Council and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel
of the American Center for Law and Justice, which is representing the coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The basis of our complaint is that the IRS is applying two standards --
one for the organizations they think are politically palatable and one for the
organizations they don't think are politically palatable,'' Sekulow said.
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, became a
major force in Republican politics in the 1990s by mobilizing conservative
voters through grass-roots activities.
</P>
<P>
	   The IRS concluded in a ruling revealed last year that some of the
activities, such as the distribution of voter guides at churches across the
country, were too partisan for the coalition to enjoy tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit contends the coalition's activities provide educational
information, are nonpartisan and promote social welfare. It also says the IRS
discriminated against the coalition based upon the content of the group's speech
and viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
	   Last August, a federal court in Washington dismissed most of the charges in
a lawsuit by the Federal Election Commission that challenged the coalition's
voter guides and accused the coalition of illegally aiding Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The government had claimed that the voter guides, phone banks and other
get-out-the-vote operations were partisan activities that should be treated as
contributions under federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once we cleared that hurdle, this was our next logical approach,'' Sekulow
said of the lawsuit filed Friday. ``We're taking very direct and aggressive
action to stop what we think is unjust treatment by the Internal Revenue
Service.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Justice Department had no comment on the lawsuit, said spokesman
Charles Miller.

<HEADLINE> Airline Crash Rate Said Up in 1999  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of accidents and fatalities involving
U.S.-registered airline and commuter aircraft rose last year, the government
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A report by the National Transportation Safety Board said 12 people died
last year in accidents involving commercial aircraft that carry at least 10
passengers. That includes 11 people who were killed when American Airlines
Flight 1420 crashed in Little Rock, Ark., last June.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, there were no airline passenger deaths for the first time in the
history of U.S. commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of air taxis accidents fell by one in 1999 to 76, and fatalities
dropped from 48 to 38.
</P>
<P>
	   General aviation accidents also fell by one last year, to 1,908, and the
number of fatal accidents dropped to 342 from 365.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the number of general aviation accidents decreased, total
fatalities increased slightly, from 623 to 628. There were 12 commuter airline
deaths in 1999; there were none in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Some critics said the study does not reflect the full range of American air
accidents that took place last year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The numbers we have are strictly U.S. What about the hundreds of foreign
crashes where Americans are on board, or military crashes?'' said Gail Dunham,
president of the National Air Disaster Alliance, a Washington, D.C.-based group.
``I think plane crashes are far more frequent than people realize.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're working to continue to raise the bar on aviation safety,'' said
Frazier Jones, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman. ``The FAA takes all
accidents seriously, and takes steps to see what can be done to prevent them in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the report, foreign-registered aircraft were involved in only
six accidents, down from 18 the previous year, and no deaths. Since only crashes
that occur on U.S. soil are included in the report, those numbers do not reflect
the 100 Americans who died in the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990, which took off
from an American airport but crashed in international waters.
</P>
<P>
	   Also not reflected are the American servicemen who died in a string of
military aircraft accidents last year, mostly during training exercises.

<HEADLINE> Jeers and cheers accompany Diallo verdict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Unfazed by a cold, pouring rain, angry protesters
shouted "Shame!" outside the court where four New York City police officers were
acquitted Friday on all charges in the death of Amadou Diallo, while the slain
man's family appealed for calm.
<P>
	   "It is in the name of Amadou and his parents that I ask for your calm and
prayers," said Diallo's mother, Kadiatou Diallo as police on horseback patrolled
the fringes of the growing crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   About 40 Diallo supporters stood in the rain outside the court and taunted
local police on hand for the verdict by raising their hands and yelling, "Don't
shoot!" They chanted, "No justice, no peace" and counted to 41 - the number of
shots fired by officers at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, 15 demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct for blocking a
downtown road between the state Capitol and City Hall, police said. They were
released and issued appearance tickets for arraignment on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury - four black women, one white woman and seven white men -
deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days before acquitting Sean
Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth Boss, 28; and Richard Murphy, 27.
</P>
<P>
	   The policemen and their families refused to acknowledge the pro-Diallo
protesters or their supporters, immediately hustling into a waiting van as they
left the courthouse. But once the crowd saw them, protesters began shouting
"guilty" and "murderers" and continued the chant as their lawyers stayed behind
to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're outraged and very angry at the verdict, but we're not surprised,"
said Vickie Green of the Capital Region Justice for Diallo Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's parents appeared grim outside of court in their brief remarks to
reporters. Saikou Diallo said moving this trial from the Bronx to Albany was
"the second murder" for his son.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of police supporters cheered outside the court as each verdict was
read, but they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted,
"Shame," and "They say justified, we say homicide."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll's lawyer Bennett Epstein blamed protesters like the ones in Albany
for prompting Bronx's District Attorney Robert Johnson to put the policemen on
trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "The prosecutors heard the yelling and the guys were indicted for murder,"
he said as the crowd grew louder.
</P>
<P>
	   A scuffle briefly broke out among factions of Diallo supporters. One faction
was shouting in protest and the other wanted demonstrators to remain silent.
Police quickly moved in and stopped the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Al Sharpton, while harshly critical of the verdict, urged the
Diallo supporters to remain calm.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not want to tarnish his (Diallo's) name with any violence," Sharpton
said. "Let not one brick be thrown, not one bottle be thrown, not one evidence
of violence come from us."
</P>
<P>
	   Leaving reporters to address the gathered protesters personally, Sharpton
vowed that the Albany trial was only the beginning of the fight for justice in
the Diallo case. "We don't take defeat," he said to huge cheers. "This is just
the beginning of the story."
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd eventually totaled more than 100 people following the verdict.
Protesters later started an impromptu march up from the courthouse and past the
nearby state Capitol chanting "No justice, no peace."
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx resident Anthony Esposito said he came up for the trial to support the
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   "These police officers had no support," he said. "I wanted to be there, and
I'm glad to see that they had their fair day in court."

</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse in Albany, about 40 Diallo supporters congregated as
the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
</P>
<P>
	   Police supporters outside the courthouse cheered as each verdict was read.
But they were often drowned out by the Diallo supporters who shouted, "Shame,"
and "They say justified, we say homicide."

<HEADLINE> SEC Accuses Sports Agent of Scams  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prominent sports agent William "Tank" Black has been
accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission of defrauding his clients of
at least $5 million in investment scams.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Tampa, Fla., issued a restraining order Thursday against
Black and his business partner, the SEC said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Black denied the SEC's accusations, saying they are "false and do not
reflect actual events."
</P>
<P>
	   "We will respond vigorously with the facts at the appropriate time," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Black's clients are pro football players. In return for helping them
get NFL contracts, he expects them to help him recruit other players to his
agency. He's built a multimillion-dollar business using this network.
</P>
<P>
	   Clients or former clients include Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor, New
York Giants wide receiver Ike Hilliard and Philadelphia running back Duce
Staley.
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor recently accused Black in a newspaper interview of cheating him of $3
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Black also represents Vince Carter of the NBA's Toronto Raptors, one of the
game's brightest young stars.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm behind him," Carter said in Toronto Friday night after the Raptors'
game against Minnesota. "He didn't do anything to me. I'm not worried about it
and I'm sticking behind him, plain and simple."
</P>
<P>
	   A former client, ex-Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth, has been charged
in the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
	   Black became the center of an investigation by University of Florida police
last spring for possible illegal inducements he gave to former university
players.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida authorities charged him in October with unlicensed agent activity in
the state. If convicted, he could face a $5,000 fine and up to 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC filed a lawsuit Thursday against Black; his firm, Professional
Management Inc.; James Franklin Jr., the firm's general counsel; and
Professional Management Consulting Inc., an affiliate of the firm owned by Black
and Franklin.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC had requested the temporary restraining order against Black,
Franklin and the two firms. It freezes their assets, bars them and their
employees from exercising any control over their clients' accounts, and requires
them to account for and bring back to this country all assets they hold
offshore.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC also is seeking unspecified fines and repayment of allegedly illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
	   In its suit, the SEC said Black "repeatedly provided false evidence" during
its investigation that contradicted statements by his clients.
</P>
<P>
	   The 42-year-old Black, who got his nickname as a 10-pound, 15-ounce newborn,
grew up poor in Johnson City, Tenn. But he became a three-time NAIA All-American
at Carson Newman as a wide receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Several of the athletes were interviewed by SEC investigators preparing the
case against Black.
</P>
<P>
	   In one case, Clarence Anthony, father of client Reidel Anthony, said Black
had recommended an investment as a good opportunity, telling him that prominent
people, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson, were involved in the venture.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an SEC document, Anthony, Carruth, Hilliard, Terry Allen and
Robert Brooks invested a total $6.1 million in one scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC contended that beginning in early 1996, Black and his business
partner Franklin defrauded some two dozen athletes, reaping at least $5 million
through various schemes.
</P>
<P>
	   In one scheme, the SEC said, Black and Franklin advised clients to invest
millions in high-yield promissory notes that they said would finance an auto
title loan company called Cash 4 Titles.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, the SEC said, Black and Franklin had a secret arrangement with the
promoters of the promissory notes that allowed them to skim their clients'
profits and put the money into a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme run out of the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Ponzi scheme, money from recent investors is used to pay returns to
earlier investors.

<HEADLINE> Cops acquitted on all counts in Diallo case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Their faith in an upstate jury rewarded, four white
New York police officers were acquitted of all charges Friday afternoon for
killing an unarmed West African immigrant in a fusillade of 41 bullets - a case
that polarized the city.
<P>
	   "Not guilty," the jury forewoman, a transplanted Bronx resident, intoned 24
times in clearing the four members of murdering Amadou Diallo, 22, as he stood
in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquitted officers - Sean Carroll, 37; Edward McMellon, 27; Kenneth
Boss, 28; and Richard Murphy, 27 - hugged one another and their lawyers after
the verdicts were returned at 4:45 p.m. inside an overheated, emotionally
wrought courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   On either side of the courtroom aisle, families of both the defendants and
the victim listened intently to the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers' families began weeping and hugging when it became clear that
all four would be acquitted of all charges, ranging from murder to reckless
endangerment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Diallo family and its supporters sat quietly through the verdict, but
the slain man's mother, Kadiatou, had her cheeks streaked with tears as she
exited the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the courthouse, a composed Mrs. Diallo called for calm in the wake
of the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was transferred upstate after an appeals court ruled that finding
in impartial jury in New York City was impossible. The jury agreed with the
defense lawyer's repeated contention that the slaying was a tragic mistake, not
a homicide.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police officers have to be able to do their jobs," said Stephen Worth,
attorney for McMellon. "When the evidence supports them, a jury will support
them."
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rev. Al Sharpton blamed the change of venue, by taking the case out
of the Bronx, for the acquittal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had no chance of real justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury - four black women, one white woman and seven white men -
deliberated for more than 20 hours over three days after a month-long trial in
the case that provoked nearly a month of protests over police brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   Ex-mayor David Dinkins and actress Susan Sarandon were among hundreds
arrested in demonstrations outside police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The jurors, through the trial judge, said they would not speak with
reporters about their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, whose shout of "Gun!" prompted the shooting on Wheeler Avenue in
the Bronx, sat dazed in his chair as the courtroom emptied. During the reading
of the verdict, tears ran down Murphy's cheeks; Boss closed his eyes and dropped
his head in relief.
</P>
<P>
	   The reaction in Diallo's neighborhood was swift and almost unanimous in its
condemnation of the verdict. Several hundred local residents marched on the 43rd
Precinct to protest the acquittal. Throughout the neighborhood at least nine
people were arrested and charges were pending.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's an attack on the black and Latino community," said Rico
Berrios, who lives two blocks from Wheeler Avenue. "It's time to respond."
</P>
<P>
	   The acquittal didn't end the legal problems for the officers, members of a
roving unit of plainclothes officers that allegedly stopped and frisked young
black men without cause.
</P>
<P>
	   A civil suit was expected against the officers and the city in the next few
weeks, and there was also the chance of a federal civil rights investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have been monitoring the trial," said Justice Department spokeswoman
Myron Marlin. "Now we will review the case to see what, if any, federal action
is required."
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking at City Hall after the verdict, called the
shooting "a great tragedy. We express once again our sympathy to Mrs. Diallo,
Mr. Diallo, to the Diallo family."
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said the verdict followed "an eminently fair trial under very,
very difficult circumstances."
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-nine witnesses testified in the three-week trial, but the most
important were likely the four officers themselves. Each told a similar tale of
Diallo acting strangely as they combed the neighborhood for violent suspects
after midnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, they said, ignored repeated warnings by Carroll and McMellon to
"Stop!" and "Show your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   The 5-foot-6, 150-pound Diallo darted into the dimly lighted entrance of his
building and drew a black object that looked like a gun. Boss recalled that
Diallo was in a "combat stance." The officers, fearing for their lives, opened
fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon, the first to shoot, emptied their 16-shot guns. Boss
fired five times and Murphy four while backing up their partners. Diallo was hit
with 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll wept on the stand while recalling the shock of realizing the black
object "was just a wallet. ... I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Although one witness said she heard an officer shout "Gun!" before the
shooting started, several prosecution "ear witnesses" - mainly neighbors of
Diallo - testified they never heard the officers' voices before gunfire erupted.

<HEADLINE> Neighbors gather outside Diallo's home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A sometimes heated crowd gathered Friday night outside
the Bronx home of Amadou Diallo as the news quickly spread that four policemen
had been acquitted in his death.
<P>
	   "Murderers!" a dozen protesters chanted as they surrounded a parked car and
beat on it with their fists. A dozen police officers watched silently. More than
100 other people, mostly from the neighborhood, milled around on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   Another group - eventually several hundred - walked three-quarters of a mile
from Diallo's home to the 43rd Precinct police station, which was guarded by 40
officers in riot gear. The protesters shouted angrily but remained peaceful,
then headed back to Diallo's home, where two dozen anti-riot officers stood by,
trying to keep protesters from blocking nearby streets.
</P>
<P>
	   At least nine people were arrested in the Bronx for disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest as they ran through the streets, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Upstate, Diallo's parents called for "calm" and the Rev. Al Sharpton issued
a televised plea: "We do not want to tarnish his name with any violence. Let not
one brick be thrown."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx, a sad-looking 11-year-old Francelin Ruiz
stood alone in the rain, watching the crowd. "He was just coming out of his
house," he said of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
	   "This community is going to be hurting for a while," said another resident
of the Soundview neighborhood, Freddie Montalvo. "It sends the wrong message to
young cops: They can get away with it."
</P>
<P>
	   Within two hours, the crowd diminished. But dozens still came and went,
sharing their opinions and paying their respects. One knelt on the vestibule
steps and yelled, "Justice from Allah."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's message is, 'Don't move or you might get shot,"' said Robert
Torres, 33, a truck driver who lives two blocks from Diallo's home. "The first
thing to do when you get to your door is thank God."
</P>
<P>
	   Candles, flowers, press clippings and written messages filled the vestibule
where Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, fell in a hail of 41 bullets.
"Justice for Diallo," read one poster.
</P>
<P>
	   Two people held up black wallets. "It looks like a gun!" someone shouted
sarcastically. Diallo had been pulling out his wallet when shot, but the police
defendants said they thought it was a firearm.
</P>
<P>
	   Tina Rivera, who has lived in the neighborhood for more than 30 years, said
the verdict would have been different if a black or Latino had been charged in
Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it had been one of us, they would have hung us," said Rivera. "They just
murdered him; they knew they were going to get off."
</P>
<P>
	   Garvin Richardson, 21, who is black and wears his hair in dreadlocks, said
he has been searched by police without cause. "I work; I'm a college student.
You can't judge me. Everybody bleeds just like me."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's sad that no one can come out after dark" because he might be suspected
as a criminal, said 14-year-old Danny Melino.
</P>
<P>
	   Downtown, at Police Headquarters, the majority of televisions and radios
were tuned in to the verdicts. Most officers there showed visible signs of
relief. But a black officer had a blank look on his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the trial was conducted fairly, and I do think what happened to
Amadou Diallo was a tragedy. But I can't help thinking how the minority people
will take this," the officer said, asking his name not be used. He said he
feared reprisals from his superiors for speaking to a reporter.

the verdict was read, taunting police officers by raising their hands and
yelling, "Don't shoot." Shouting Diallo supporters scuffled briefly with other
supporters who wanted them to remain quiet; police broke it up.
