PETTITTE YANKS BLOW OUT TWINS  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Pettitte hardly gazed at the scoreboard in
left-center field while pitching against the Minnesota Twins Friday
night, even though the numbers were incredibly positive for the
Yankees. Pettitte kept his eyes mostly on the grass and rarely
moved an inch away from the pitcher's rubber at Yankee Stadium. He
had to keep working, no matter how lopsided the score. And it was
very lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   By the third inning, the Yankees were ahead by six runs. By the
fourth, the lead had grown to 10. By the fifth, the only drama
remaining was whether Pettitte could throw a complete game, whether
Joe Girardi could join the other starters with a hit and whether
the Twins would volunteer to impose the 10-run mercy rule. By
game's end, the Yankees had a 14-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch slugged a grand slam against his former team,
Bernie Williams and Luis Sojo stroked two-run homers and Derek
Jeter socked three hits in the softball-type atmosphere. But the
most important development for the Yankees was Pettitte's revival.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre knows the Yankees can score and, against the
dismal Twins, a trouncing like this was not surprising. But the
Yankees are monitoring Pettitte closely, hoping that his prolonged
drought is a memory and that he can be a stellar contributor in the
postseason. It seemed very likely Friday night as Pettitte stifled
the Twins on one run and five hits while striking out 11 in eight
strong innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Pettitte halted the team with the fourth-worst batting
average in the American League, but he looked precise and powerful
enough to tame the Indians or the Rangers. Since the nonwaiver
trade deadline passed on July 31 and Pettitte learned that he would
be staying with the Yankees, he is 3-0 and has allowed two earned
runs in 23 innings for a tiny 0.78 earned run average. ``I really
think a turning point was the 31st,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who did not have outdoor batting practice because
of the afternoon rain, treated LaTroy Hawkins and Benj Sampson like
batting practice pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins was battered for nine runs and 12 hits in 3 1/3 innings
while Sampson allowed five runs and 10 hits in 2 2/3 innings
</P>
<P>
   Williams was 3 for 4 with three runs batted in and is batting
.512 (21 for 41) with six 6 homers and 25 RBIs this month.
Knoblauch had three hits, scored three runs, drove in five runs and
was in the middle of all three rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch hit a bloop single off shortstop Cristian Guzman's
glove in the third to begin a six-run burst that included Paul
O'Neill's two-run double, Williams' two-run homer and Sojo's
two-run homer. Sojo, who started at third because Scott Brosius is
handling personal matters with his ailing father, had two hits.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Knoblauch started another rally with an infield
single that traveled about 60 feet. Williams, Tino Martinez, Chili
Davis and Sojo all ripped run-scoring singles in the inning as the
Yankees grabbed a 10-0 lead. Hawkins had won five straight
decisions, but he is now 0-4 with a 7.83 ERA in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's grand slam, off Sampson in the sixth, switched the
theme from softball to football by making the score 14-0.

<P>
   The Glock semiautomatic pistol that police say Buford O. Furrow
Jr. used to kill a mail carrier after shooting five people at a
Jewish community center in Los Angeles was sold last year by an
unlicensed vendor at a gun show near the north Idaho compound of
the Aryan Nations, the neo-Nazi group to which Furrow belonged,
according to interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The path of the Glock model 26, which was sold new by Glock in
1996 to a small police department in western Washington state, ran
from the department to a gun dealership owned by an officer in that
department to a paint dealer to a friend of that businessman.
</P>
<P>
   That friend, according to law-enforcement authorities in
Washington, is the person who sold the Glock in early 1998 at a gun
show in Spokane, Wash. That city is near Hayden Lake, Idaho, the
town that serves as the home enclave for the Aryan Nations and
other white supremacist groups.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, gun collectors and others who do not have
federal firearms licenses can legally sell guns at gun shows _ and
they are not required to do background checks on buyers, as gun
stores must. The disclosure that the gun used by Furrow to kill the
letter carrier, Joseph Ileto, was bought from such a vendor may
restart a stalled debate in Congress over whether buyers at gun
shows should first undergo background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill requiring that all
dealers at gun shows, including the 40 percent who do not have
federal licenses, conduct background checks on customers, allowing
three days for completing those checks. The House also approved
mandatory background checks though allowing only one day for them,
but the bill containing that amendment was defeated. The issue of
how much time to devote to background checks remains a political
flashpoint between lawmakers because it will come up when a
juvenile-justice bill is considered in conference.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether Furrow was the person who bought the
Glock 9-mm pistol early last year at the Spokane show.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Chester, a spokesman with the Seattle office of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency still had not
determined how Furrow had acquired the Glock pistol or six other
weapons, including an Uzi assault-style submachine gun, that were
recovered from a car he had hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   However, Chester said Furrow may have recently traded for some
of those guns using others he had acquired while he was a federally
licensed firearms dealer between 1992 and 1995. Chester said there
were ``indications'' that some of those trades had occurred after
this May when Furrow was released from jail and was prohibited from
owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Haymon of the Aberdeen, Wash., police department
said that when ATF agents came to that town on Thursday to
interview the man said to have sold the Glock at the gun show, they
found that the man and his wife were on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow had to acquire the weapon between January and October
1998 or after this May, because he spent the intervening time in
jail for threatening to stab a nurse at a psychiatric hospital. He
had gone to the hospital for help, saying he was having fantasies
of committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal complaint filed on Wednesday in Los Angeles,
federal officials said Furrow had confessed to killing Ileto, who
was of Filipino descent. Furrow described Ileto as a good ``target
of opportunity'' because he was ``non-white'' and worked for the
federal government, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Ileto on Tuesday came soon after Furrow had
sprayed a Jewish day center in Los Angeles with gunfire from an Uzi
assault-style machine gun. Five people were wounded in that attack,
including three children.
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged Friday that Furrow had spent considerable
time planning the Los Angeles attacks in a city that he apparently
knew little about, prompting some to wonder if he had help from
other conspirators, one of the major unanswered questions this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center here said that
police told him they had found maps in Furrow's possession on which
he had circled the Wiesenthal center, as well as other Jewish
sites, as potential targets for his attack. The Los Angeles Times
said that one of the other sites was the Skirball Cultural Center,
a complex next to the Getty Museum that is dedicated to Jewish
culture. Police would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used to kill Ileto, which bore the serial number BSM901,
was one of two Glock model 26 guns that were purchased in January
1996 by the police department in Cosmopolis, Wash., from Glock
Inc., the Atlanta-area distributor for the Austrian gun producer.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Eisenhower, chief of police in Cosmopolis, a town of 1,600
near the port city of Aberdeen, said in an interview Friday that
the weapons were bought by his predecessor, Donald Lapacek, to
determine whether they were suitable for police work.
</P>
<P>
   After it was determined that the guns were too small, the
department swapped them for larger Glock models at Don's Guns, a
federally licensed gun store in Cosmopolis then owned by Donald
Dineen, a reserve officer in the town's police department.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dineen said he was with Eisenhower when police
in Cosmopolis were reached Wednesday by ATF agents tracing the
Glock 26. Dineen said he recognized the gun's serial number and
recalled that he had sold it to an area resident in February 1996
soon after getting it from police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun went to a local resident,'' said Dineen. ``Someone
I've known for 14 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dineen declined to disclose that person. But both Eisenhower and
Haymon said that person was Dave Wright, who works at the House of
Colors, a family-run paint store in Aberdeen.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview, Wright would only say that he
had given all his ``information'' when interviewed by an ATF agent.
</P>
<P>
   Those Seattle-based agents had arrived Thursday in Aberdeen to
interview Wright and a friend, Andy Palmer, said Haymon. He said
that Wright had told the ATF agents that he had given Palmer
several guns including the Glock to sell at a Spokane gun show in
early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Haymon said that when authorities tried to contact Palmer's wife
on Thursday they were told that she and her husband had just left
on a week's vacation. Palmer's telephone number is unlisted.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen, the former firearms dealer, also said that the person
who had bought the gun from him, Wright, had said that he had given
it to a friend, Palmer, to sell at a Spokane gun show. He said
Palmer worked as a food broker and was a gun enthusiast, adding
that he did not believe he had a federal firearms license.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not a gun dealer, he is a collector,'' Dineen said.
</P>
<P>
   John D'Angelo, an ATF spokesman, said the only record that the
agency has for a licensed dealer named Andrew Palmer is for the
operator of a pawn shop in Bainbridge, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and House lawmakers on a conference committee that is
expected to hammer out new gun control legislation are scheduled to
start that work when they return on Sept. 7 from a monthlong
congressional recess. In early August, when the conference
committee met, the lawmakers postponed any decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's latest round of debate over gun control started in
April after two teen-age gunmen at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., killed 12 students, a teacher and themselves.

L.A. GETTING CONVENTION PLANS IN ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The one-year countdown to the Democratic National
Convention coming to Los Angeles begins Saturday, and officials
said they are on target to host the three days of events leading to
the nomination of the party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   With events of the past week, security came up as a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are already planning for the convention and are prepared to
have more than $7 million in overtime set aside to deal with
security,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention, however, was on the status of the
convention planning.
</P>
<P>
   Billionaire Eli Broad, co-chair of the 2000 Host Committee, said
the group has raised $19.4 million of the $34 million it has
pledged to stage the event through a private-public partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using a unique model -- the Olympic model -- and I hope
it serves as a model for the Democratic and Republican conventions
of the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time a convention was held in Los Angeles was in
1960, and John F. Kennedy was elected to begin the New Frontier.
Next year, we will elect the president for the New Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles bid relies heavily on private contributions,
with government providing in-kind services of planning, security
and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said a list of contributors would be made available in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy McCoy, president of the committee, said the effort has
received bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever we call up and tell them what we're doing, all they
ask is what can they do,'' McCoy said. ``I have never been involved
in a project where there is so much enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the committee is working on a variety of fronts to
build community involvement in the event, to be held at Staples
Center, which is set to open in October.
</P>
<P>
   Former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, who is general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said he was pleased with the
preparations and looked forward to a convention where the party
could outline its issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to talk to voters about our differences on education,
on health care and how to keep the economy booming,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention means big business for the city, with an
estimated take of $137 million in revenue. It also provides a
chance to showcase the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been estimates that this will be worth $1 billion
in advertising,'' McCoy said. ``You just can't buy that kind of
exposure. And, it gives us a chance to let the world see that Los
Angeles is more than movies and beaches, that there is a real
community here.'' &QL;

CHIMP-NAMING CONTEST HAS HUMANS GOING APE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KATHRYN COMBS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The project to name the Los Angeles Zoo's
2-month-old chimp is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials already have collected some 300 names for the
infant ape whom, keeper Katherine Jaynes says, has a certain quiet
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have a dignified name,'' Jaynes said. ``But he's
also a cute baby.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the promoter Radio Disney has received about 300 entries
including names such as Chimpy, George, Baby Tarzan, Joey and Max.
</P>
<P>
   Other, perhaps less dignified, suggestions: Abu, Toko, Bongo or
even Bingo. One little girl has suggested Lazoo.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Disney spokeswoman Natalie Eig expects many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids love animals and now they have a chance to be part of a
community where they can name the chimp and then go to the zoo and
see it,'' Eig said.
</P>
<P>
   Eig expects thousands of entries by the deadline of 5 p.m. Aug.
22. After that, officials will narrow the list and make a final
choice within a week or two after the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The contest winner will get a behind-the-scenes tour of the
Chimps of Mahale Mountain exhibit, to get a closer and more
personal look at the chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   Kids interested in participating can call (877) 534-7710 or mail
entries to Radio Disney at P.O. Box 710, Los Angeles, CA 90016.

YOUNG SHOWS HE'S RESTLESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eric Young returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers
lineup Friday night after 15 days on the disabled list and opened
the first inning with a single and a stolen base. In the third, he
walked, raced all the way to third on a wild pickoff throw and
scored on a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Young, who missed 18 games with a lingering
ankle sprain, did in three innings what the Dodgers hoped he would
do all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm healthy now,'' said Young, plagued with leg problems
during his two seasons with the club. ``It was good to step back
and get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Young, who also had hamstring problems as a result of the ankle
injury, spent the past week in a rehabilitation assignment at
Single-A San Bernardino. He batted .250 (3 for 12) in three games
for the Stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Before going on the DL, Young created a stir by saying the club
was using him as a scapegoat by refusing to let him rest his
injuries. Manager Davey Johnson said Friday, he was just trying to
evaluate Young's ability to hit and play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for him to go on the DL,'' said team
orthopedist Frank Jobe. ``The ankle problem was affecting the rest
of his legs. I am very pleased with the way he has responded.''
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Young on the roster, the Dodgers sent
right-hander Matt Herges to Triple-A Albuquerque. Herges, who
finally reached the majors at age 29, was called up July 30. He
appeared in four games for the Dodgers and allowed two earned runs
in 42/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching update: Mike Judd, who pitched 61/3 innings in
Thursday's 10-5 victory, will get another start for the Dodgers,
next Wednesday against Florida. Judd, recalled before his start in
Montreal, is in the rotation for now but Robinson Checo is getting
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Checo, acquired from Detroit earlier this season, strained his
right groin during a July 28 start against Cincinnati. He pitched
five impressive innings against the Reds and the club was hoping to
make him the fifth starter in place of demoted left-hander Carlos
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Checo threw for 15 minutes in the Dodgers bullpen before
Friday's game and will throw again Sunday. If all goes well, he
will make a rehabilitation start Wednesday for San Bernardino and
return to the rotation by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Jamie Arnold was eligible to play Friday after
serving a four-game suspension for his part in the July 11 brawl
with the Seattle Mariners. Arnold will return to the bullpen after
making last Friday in New York.

41 YEARS LATER, MAN IS CHARGED IN KILLING OF NEW JERSEY OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Penn.) (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting an end to an investigation that has spanned four
decades, a Pennsylvania man was arrested Thursday night in the 1958
killing of a police officer in Rahway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Theodore Schiffer, 61, was taken into custody by
Pennsylvania and New Jersey law enforcement officers without
incident at his room in an apartment complex for the elderly in
Peckville, Pa., the authorities in both states said.
</P>
<P>
   In Superior Court in Scranton, Pa., Friday morning, Schiffer was
charged with murdering Officer Charles Bernoskie. He is being held
in Pennsylvania without bail until a hearing next week to determine
when he will be returned to New Jersey, where the case will be
presented to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28, 1958, Bernoskie, who was 30 and had been a policeman
for four years, was gunned down by an unknown assailant while
responding to a burglary call at a Pontiac dealership in Rahway,
said Richard Rodbart, a spokesman for the Union County prosecutor's
office. Though the officer was shot several times, he managed to
stagger to a nearby home, where he collapsed and ultimately died,
Rodbart said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Kevin White of the Rahway Police Department said that
witnesses reported seeing two men flee the dealership on the night
of the shooting and that investigators are looking for a second
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Since the day of the shooting, local detectives and
investigators in the Union County prosecutor's office have been
working to solve the murder, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Schiffer's cousin came forward and told
investigators that he may have committed the crime, said Kathleen
Granahan, an assistant district attorney in Lackawanna County, Pa.,
who helped capture Schiffer. Both Rodbart and White declined to
release the cousin's name and refused to offer any reason why the
woman had chosen to turn Schiffer in.
</P>
<P>
   The Scranton Times reported Friday that, according to a police
affidavit, a woman named Judith Sapsa told police that Schiffer and
her brother, Robert Zarinsky, came to her home with gunshot wounds
on the night Bernoskie was shot.
</P>
<P>
   According to the account of the affidavit, Ms. Sapsa watched as
her mother removed bullets from Schiffer's chest and Zarinsky's
buttocks. Zarinsky told her that he had shot Bernoskie after the
officer shot Schiffer, the affidavit reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a scar on Schiffer's chest where Ms. Sapsa
said a bullet had been removed, the affidavit reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Zarinsky, who has not been
charged in the killing of Bernoskie, has been serving a life prison
sentence since 1975 for the murder of a 17-year-old girl from
Atlantic Highlands, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Granahan said law enforcement officials had initially looked
for Schiffer in Florida before tracking him to Lackawanna County
through motor vehicle records. His fingerprints matched those
collected at the crime scene 41 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of Bernoskie's peers have long since retired, White
said he had a reputation as being honest and hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Tilton, the chief of the Rahway police, said that the
officer's widow, Elizabeth Bernoskie, was ``gratified'' by the
arrest. Mrs. Bernoskie lives in Rahway but has an unlisted phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bernoskie, who was 5 years old when his father was
killed, said he was stunned and happy when he learned Friday
morning of Schiffer's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was: Boom, it's over,'' said Bernoskie, 45,
who lives in Holmdel, N.J., and works as a mechanical engineer.
``It brought some closure to all of this.''

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial observer for Saturday,
Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Adolf Eichmann, hanged by Israel in 1962 for organizing the Nazi
deportation of millions of Jews eastward to the gas chambers, was
by his own description the epitome of the bureaucratic mass
murderer. This week the German daily Die Welt began publishing
excerpts from a recently discovered diary Eichmann wrote during his
imprisonment. Eichmann details a life of obedience _ to his father,
to the military and to his Nazi superiors, a life in which
apparently even the prospect of freedom to choose his own path left
him panicked and bereft.
</P>
<P>
   Eichmann's memoir echoes what he told his examiners at the time
of his trial. Hannah Arendt, who chronicled the trial, aptly
described the ``banality of evil'' that Eichmann seemed to
represent. He was not a psychopathic killer, nor a personal enemy
of Jews, he said, and some psychiatrists who evaluated him
concurred. He was normal _ ``more normal, at any rate, than I after
having examined him,'' Ms. Arendt quotes one of them. The Eichmann
trial was chilling in part because he showed that an ordinary
person, whose most fervent desire was to fulfill the role his
society assigned him, could be made to participate in the murder of
millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Today his memoirs chill Germany for a different reason. Perhaps,
he speculated in the diary, his need to obey orders was also ``the
attitude of many Germans.'' Certainly the rigid organization of
Communist East Germany proved that Germans can still be
indoctrinated to ignore the voice in their heads in favor of the
one coming through the loudspeaker. East Germany's largest
employers were the army and the Stasi, or secret police. Perhaps a
million people acted as occasional Stasi informants. Border guards
were persuaded to shoot fellow citizens who committed no other
crime than possession of a thirst for freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But Eichmann was wrong about the German nature. Overwhelming
propaganda can persuade normal people to kill their neighbors in
many places _ Serbia and Rwanda are two examples. East Germany's
petty conformists would not likely have sunk to the level of mass
murder, and West Germany shows that under a different system,
Germans can be as self-critical and questioning as anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   East Germany created a birth-to-death cocoon for its citizens.
The state took care of all aspects of what was a fairly comfortable
existence. Many, especially those in small towns far from the
contamination of West German television, had little exposure to
people or ideas that countered the official story.
</P>
<P>
   The least curious among them were drafted as border guards, and
then saturated with propaganda about the aggressive West and told
that only dangerous criminals tried to flee. (Even so, thousands of
border guards themselves made successful escapes to the West.)
Stasi collaborators had more diverse backgrounds. Some were victims
of extortion. Others informed for money, or were expertly
manipulated to feel that their relationship with the Stasi or their
handlers filled some psychological need in their lives. Many
informed because they were told it was their duty as citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not adults,'' a dissident, Wolfgang Templin, once
told me of his fellow East Germans. ``What fascinated me about the
West when I was kicked out (of East Germany) was not the technology
or standard of living, it was that people were strong within
themselves ... they took their lives into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   When Germany decided to open the Stasi files to its victims, it
inadvertently hit on a productive way to stir the conscience of
those who followed orders and informed for the Stasi. Conscious
that they will be caught, they have come forward to confess to
those _ often close friends _ they spied on. This has produced a
torrent of soul-searching, as spies and victims met in smoky bars
and in televised confrontations. The national conversation has not
always been satisfying, but it has caused many Stasi informants to
face their acts for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   West Germany, whose habits dominate Germany today, still has a
culture that loves bureaucracy and order. No one eats on the
subway, and jaywalkers are scolded. It is unlikely that Germany
would ever produce a Solidarity movement like that of Poland, where
a history of rebellion is a source of national pride.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany would be unrecognizable to Eichmann today, and his
trial helped to change it. In 1961, after years of silence about
Nazi crimes, Germany was just beginning trials of war criminals.
The embarrassment of the Eichmann prosecution abroad gave them
momentum. The trial of Auschwitz camp guards in 1964 provided many
Germans with their first exposure to Nazi crimes _ in part because
it took place at a time when German youth, like youth around the
world, were in rebellion. Their parents never talked about the
crimes of the Nazis. The children, it seemed, spoke of little else.
In total, Germany has convicted more than 7,000 of its own citizens
for war crimes, many of them committed against foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sentences have been extremely lenient, this is a
record of self-criticism no other country has approached. If
democracy has not exactly created a land of free spirits, it has
transformed the nation's political culture into one that Germans
cling to, in large part because they remember the crimes of
Eichmann and those Germans like him who followed orders.

GIANTS IMPRESSIVE IN 36-21 WIN OVER VIKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ With a rookie's blazing burst up the middle, with
a looping pass fired precisely over a defender into the arms of a
leaping receiver and with a defense that swarmed and befuddled a
record-setting offense, the Giants Friday night fashioned an
impressive and startlingly explosive beginning to their 1999
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Such a start may prove meaningless in four months, but in about
one hour of football against the Minnesota Vikings, the Giants
displayed new confidence on offense and renewed resolve on defense.
</P>
<P>
   By the game's end, both teams had their third-stringers in
action in the Giants' 36-21 victory. But the Giants dominated both
lines of scrimmage in a little more than a quarter of play when
each team's first unit was on the field.
</P>
<P>
   No play epitomized these rejuvenated Giants more than running
back Sean Bennett's 53-yard, first-quarter sprint through the heart
of the Vikings' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a little-known, fourth-round draft pick this spring
from Northwestern who started the game only because of injuries to
several other running backs, caught a middle screen pass and then
sliced through a half-dozen Minnesota defenders. Benefiting from
superb blocks by guard Lance Scott and wide receiver Amani Toomer,
Bennett showed outstanding acceleration, running right past
Minnesota safeties Robert Griffith and Orlando Thomas for the
game's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the injury jinx dogging Giants running backs in training
camp continued into the exhibition season when Bennett left the
game early in the third quarter with a concussion. Bennett carried
up the middle for nine yards on his first carry of the second half,
but as he slid on the artificial turf at the end of the play he was
hit in the head by Minnesota safety Don Morgan, whose blow snapped
Bennett's head backward.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett got up slowly but did not return to the game, finishing
with 35 yards rushing on 10 carries and two receptions for 65
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants played the game without coach Jim Fassel, who was in
Arizona with his critically ill mother, Dorothy. Jim Skipper, the
offensive coordinator, and John Fox, the defensive coordinator, ran
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Giants' offense didn't let Bennett have the
spotlight all to himself. On the team's next possession,
quarterback Kent Graham, who completed five of six passes for 145
yards and two touchdowns, led the Giants on a five-play, 67-yard
drive. Graham connected with Toomer for nine yards, Ike Hilliard
for 18 yards on a perfectly executed underneath post pattern, and
then found Joe Jurevicius where the goal line meets the sideline
for his second touchdown, a 37-yard completion.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, in turn, was harassing the Vikings' offense
into two turnovers. With frequent pressure on Minnesota quarterback
Randall Cunningham, the Vikings _ the most productive offense in
National Football League history a year ago _ generated only 51
yards in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Phillippi Sparks had a sack of Cunningham on a blitz
and also broke up a pass intended for Minnesota's Randy Moss. The
Giants' left defensive end Michael Strahan also repeatedly caused
trouble for the Vikings' front line, disrupting a handful of
running plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and played well,'' Strahan said of the game's
beginning. ``We were fast and kept them in check. You don't want to
get too excited about the preseason but the first team really
played well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew coach Fassel was watching. We want to make him
proud and our hearts go out to him and his family.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also said he was thinking of Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our leader and he's not here so it hurts,'' Graham said.
``We worked efficiently and effectively as a first unit. I felt
comfortable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Giants' starting defense left the field, Jeff George
and the rest of the Vikings' second-string offense moved the ball
successfully, scoring 14 second-quarter points. The Giants, with
cornerbacks Jason Sehorn and Conrad Hamilton out with injuries, had
trouble defending some pass routes and were victimized by a 40-yard
pass interference penalty on the rookie defensive back Reggie
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants also added two Brad Daluiso field goals of 48 and
24 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Tiki Barber gave the Giants a 29-14 lead in the third quarter
with a shifty, darting run on a draw for a 6-yard touchdown run.
The backup quarterback Kerry Collins led that drive and another in
the fourth quarter that ended with a 5-yard touchdown pass to David
Patten. Earlier, Patten had dropped what would have been a
touchdown pass from Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, working exclusively with the second string, completed 5
of 17 passes for 127 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions.

 EDITORIAL: FLAWED PAIN-RELIEF BILL  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   In a misguided effort to legislate against physician-assisted
suicide, a bill awaiting action in the House Judiciary Committee
could discourage doctors from providing aggressive pain relief to
patients with terminal illnesses. Last year's version of the bill,
which was worse, would have allowed the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration to investigate and punish any doctor who prescribed
drugs with the intent of assisting in a patient's suicide. That
bill would have caused doctors to withhold medication for fear of
federal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill tries to address that concern by declaring that
alleviating pain through drugs is a legitimate medical purpose,
``even if the use of such a substance may increase the risk of
death.'' But doctors would still have reason to worry that they
could be investigated and charged with intent to cause death even
when no such intent existed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also undo the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, a
voter-approved statute that allows physician-assisted suicide in
narrow circumstances for terminally ill patients. There is no
reason for the federal government to usurp the right of Oregon or
any other state to regulate medical practices according to the will
of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does contain useful provisions to increase education
and research on pain management. It authorizes a small grant
program through the Department of Health and Human Services that
would provide more training in medical schools and hospices. The
way to reduce suicides among terminally ill patients _whether
assisted by physicians or not _ is to increase pain treatment
options. The House should help desperate patients by dropping the
ill-conceived restrictions on doctors, and focus instead on more
federal support for palliative care.

DETAILS EMERGE OF FURROW'S BLOODY RAMPAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, runs with SHOOTING-SERGEANT, SHOOTING-HOPE, SHOOTING-KIDS,
SHOOTING-HATE) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A woman heard the ``pop, pop, pop'' of gunfire
outside her home about noon Tuesday and looked out her bedroom
window as postal carrier Joseph Santos Ileto ran for his life, she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran at an angle. I thought, Oh, my God, this is real. I
grabbed the boys and made them go under the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   She immediately called 911 and said, ``Somebody shot my
mailman!''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later that she learned she had witnessed the end
of Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.'s rampage through Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The woman was home with her son and a nephew when a ``target of
opportunity'' emerged for Furrow: a nonwhite federal employee,
according to his confession to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   She said she couldn't get a clear view of the gunman because he
was behind thick bushes. She hurried outside to help but realized
it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I became hysterical,'' she said, adding that she and her son
are getting help to deal with the emotional trauma and did not want
their names used.
</P>
<P>
   More details have emerged of the rampage that began with the
shooting of three small boys and two staff members at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center at 10:49 a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the shooting, Furrow is accused of hijacking a
Korean waitress' car and then threatening her four Korean
co-workers at gunpoint before fleeing, they said in interviews
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until later Tuesday night that the waitress and
sandwich shop workers realized they had come face to face with the
white supremacist who is accused of rampaging through the San
Fernando Valley, shooting five people at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center and killing a Filipino mail carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so lucky,'' said the owner of Captain's Sub Sandwiches,
still visibly shaken from the encounter and unwilling to have his
name published. ``He's got the gun pointed at us. I don't want to
think about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the shop, Furrow shot Ileto.
</P>
<P>
   Why Furrow didn't shoot the waitress and workers remains a
mystery to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would speculate that he was intent on getting away from the
location, and he probably didn't want to create any more
attention,'' said Los Angeles police Detective Brian Carr of the
Robbery-Homicide Division. ``But who knows, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow dumped his van in back of the sandwich shop on Roscoe
Boulevard about 11:05 a.m., 16 minutes after the shooting at the
North Valley Jewish Community Center. He walked up behind the
waitress as she got out of her car to go to work and at gunpoint
demanded her car keys.
</P>
<P>
   She complied and somehow managed to get into the restaurant as
Furrow moved her car and began transferring his belongings,
including several firearms and ammunition, from his van to the
victim's car.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into the shop and hollered, ``Please help me, somebody
just took my car!'' the shop owner said.
</P>
<P>
   They ran outside and peeked around the corner of the building,
only to see Furrow loading bags of weapons into the 23-year-old
woman's green Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Get back in!''' the shop owner said.
</P>
<P>
   They ran into the store and locked the doors, while a customer
called 911 and then fled, fearing the gunman would somehow get in
and kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The sandwich shop encounter was among the details that began to
emerge about Furrow's shooting rampage, as police trace his bloody
trail through the San Fernando Valley and then to Hollywood and Las
Vegas, where he surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   After gunning down the postal worker, Furrow abandoned the
carjacked car at the 7-Star Suites hotel, walked to a Latino-owned
shop where he bought a new shirt and went to a Supercuts for a
haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he needed a haircut,'' according to a police source.
</P>
<P>
   He then took a cab to Hollywood, where he had a few beers before
finding another cab that ultimately took him to Vegas. The source
also said that Furrow spent time in Chatsworth on the Sunday
evening before the shootings, drinking at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich shop customers and the workers reflected on their good
fortune but expressed grief for the other victims of Furrow's
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``The postman did nothing. These people are working very hard
for a good life here in the United States. Why do these kind of
people hate them?'' asked one Korean customer.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sandwich shop owner, the waitress plans to
return to Korea and return to school for a degree in landscape
architecture. Although she recently wanted to return to her
homeland, Tuesday's rampage made up her mind, friends said.
</P>
<P>

STANLEY MORTIMER, 86, SPORTSMAN AND AD EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Grafton Mortimer Jr., a sportsman, advertising executive
and member of one of the founding families of the exclusive enclave
of Tuxedo Park, N.Y., died on Wednesday after a long illness at his
home in Harriman, N.Y. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer was a member of an illustrious American family. Through
his father, a Wall Street broker, he was a descendant of John Jay,
the first chief justice of the United States and a signer of the
Declaration of Independence. His mother, the former Kathleen
Tilford, was the daughter of Henry Morgan Tilford, a founder of
Standard Oil Co. of California.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer grew up in Tuxedo Park in Keewaydin, a Stanford White
house that once belonged to Pierre Lorillard. The Mortimers and
Lorillards were the founding families of Tuxedo Park. Sally Bedell
Smith, in her book ``In All His Glory: The Life of William S.
Paley,'' noted that Mortimer's grandmother, the widow of Henry
Morgan Tilford, was for four decades one of the reigning dowagers
of Tuxedo Park, and that her annual debutante dinners before the
Autumn Ball determined which young women were approved for New York
society.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer was educated at St. Mark's School and graduated from
Harvard in 1936. He served in the Pacific in World War II, rising
to lieutenant commander in the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous sportsman, he was a member of the Jockey Club, and
his Keewaydin racing stable was successful for many years in
France. He was also a tennis player and low-handicap golfer, and he
took part in hunting-dog field trials.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, he was director of advertising for both Trans
World Airlines and Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer was a member of the Racquet and Tennis Club in New
York; the National Golf Links and the Southampton Club on Long
Island, and the Tuxedo Park Club, where he served on the board of
governors.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, in 1940 to Barbara Cushing, ended in divorce
in 1946, and she later married Paley, the longtime leader of CBS.
The following year, Mortimer married Kathleen Harriman, daughter of
W. Averell Harriman and the granddaughter of E.H. Harriman, the
railroad tycoon.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; five children, all of Manhattan _
Stanley Mortimer III and Amanda Mortimer Burden from his first
marriage, and David Mortimer, Jay Mortimer and Averell Mortimer
from his second marriage; two sisters, Eve Mortimer Ledyard of
Unionville, Pa., and Katherine Mortimer Blaine of Manhattan; two
brothers, Richard Mortimer of Southampton, N.Y., and John Jay
Mortimer of Manhattan, 10 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

LOS ANGELES: ``mind, friends said.'' The possibility that Furrow may have cased high-profile Jewish
institutions also has been raised.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center and its Museum of Tolerance, said police told him that a map
found in one of the vehicles Furrow used had the center, the
University of Judaism and another well-known Jewish institution
identified by sources as the Skirball Cultural Center.
</P>
<P>
   Hier said that museum staff believe Furrow visited there about
six weeks ago. The man showed no interest in the exhibits but was
constantly looking at the ceiling and left after security guards
moved close to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite possible we would have been the target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and the University of Judaism have increased security
since the attack. ``People ask whether security pays,'' Hier said.
``I think it does.''
</P>
<P>
   While Furrow was held in the federal detention center, Los
Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti said Friday he was
continuing to meet with U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas to
determine who would get to try the case first.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow faces federal charges of murder of a federal employee and
weapons possession while a felon. State charges include murder with
the special circumstances that the slaying was motivated by hate
and while fleeing a crime. If convicted of either state or federal
charges, he could receive the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow also is charged with five counts of attempted murder for
wounding the three children and two staff workers at the Jewish
Community Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that justice is served in the best
manner,'' Garcetti said. ``We will continue to meet to resolve
jurisdictional issues and legal issues and hope to resolve that
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said he is also concerned that Furrow will attempt to
use the trial as a forum to espouse his views _ and that not much
could be done to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he intends to use it as a forum, there isn't much we can do
to prevent him from taking the stand and explain why he did what he
did,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100 people _ children in the center during the shooting
and their parents _ have applied for victims assistance through a
state program that offers up to $10,000 for private psychotherapy
and counseling, officials announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other people, including those wounded in the shooting, the young
woman who was carjacked and family members of slain U.S. Post
Office worker Joseph Ileto, are also eligible for this assistance. &QL; 
The wounded can also qualify for up to $46,000 for out-of-pocket
medical costs, said Los Angeles City Attorney spokesman Mike
Qualls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to provide whatever assistance that the victims
need to get through this tragedy,'' Qualls said. &QL; 
Anyone traumatized by coming to the aid of victims can apply for up
to $10,000 in ``Good Samaritan'' grants, although no one has done
that yet, he said. &QL; 
Staff with the City Attorney's Victim Assistance Unit met Friday
with the injured and their families, who are expected to sign up
for the assistance next week, Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   The money is made available through the state Victim of Crimes
Fund, which is raised from fines imposed in criminal cases. &QL; 
Appearing before the Los Angeles City Council, Chief Bernard C.
Parks and other top police and fire officials detailed the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of the men and women of the Los Angeles Police
Department and Los Angeles Fire Department for their
professionalism and their courage,'' said Mayor Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Parks vowed to continue working closely with federal agents to
seal the case against suspect Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very cowardly act to take advantage of some very
young people,'' said Parks. ``We will do all in our power to bring
him to justice to the fullest extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Police responded in four minutes, and 16 firefighters, including
seven paramedics, were at the site within eight minutes, Los
Angeles fire and police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Every major agency involved in the event had officers on scene
within an hour _ an unusual feat of cooperation that resulted from
two years of intensive planning and training among local and
federal agencies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 15 years of law enforcement, the professionalism
displayed by the L.A. Fire Department, L.A. Police Department and
U.S. (law-enforcement agents) was of the highest caliber I have
ever witnessed,'' said Virginia O'Brian, assistant special agent
with the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Council members praised officers and proposed solutions,
including a call by Councilman Mike Feuer to tighten gun control
laws and a demand by Councilman Alex Padilla to hire more police
officers and build new police facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan released a statement urging residents to reflect on the
events of this past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we begin to heal from the tragic events of this week, I
hope Angelenos take a few moments to reflect on the precious nature
of life,'' Riordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I urge Angelenos to attend services at their places of worship
and pray for the victims, their families and for our city. Let us
also renew our commitment to work together, to respect each other
and to celebrate our diversity through knowledge and understanding.
By reaching out to one another, we will move beyond this dark
moment and emerge a better, stronger community.''

BARRY SHOULD FIT RIGHT IN WITH NEW, NASTIER SONICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not even a game played yet, and already Brent Barry
has a Sonics record: Quickest cringe from management after hearing
a player's opening press conference remarks.
</P>
<P>
   At his first media chat Friday at the Sonics practice facility,
the newcomer guard, acquired for the venerable Hersey Hawkins, was
explaining how delighted he was to be leaving the Chicago Bulls,
the NBA's third-worst team last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound abrasive,'' said Barry, ``but you can't
make chicken salad out of chicken (poop).''
</P>
<P>
   After Wally Walker, Paul Westphal and Billy McKinney
collectively blanched, Barry apologized to the TV cameras for his
barnyard bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cringe record, Barry also raised the bar for next
season on what will constitute abrasiveness, proved he inherited
more from his dad than merely a passion for offense, and provided
more color in one sentence than Hawkins did in his four years as a
Sonic.
</P>
<P>
   Say this about the 1999-2000 Sonics: They may not be able to
play a lick, but in a heckle contest against Chris Rock, Dennis
Miller and David Letterman, take the Seattles and spot the
entertainers a Sam Kinison CD.
</P>
<P>
   With Barry, Gary Payton, Vernon Maxwell, Ruben (``The Kobe
Stopper'') Patterson, Jelani McCoy and even little rookie guard
Shammond Williams, Seattle may become the world capital of smack.
Move over, Starbucks: Here comes Swearbucks.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means for wins and losses is dubious. Sonics coach
Paul Westphal, good Christian man that he is, nevertheless will own
up to an abstract appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to rein people back,'' he said, ``than to
light a fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That observation summarizes as well as anything what the Sonics
have tried to do this offseason. If anything can summarize it.
</P>
<P>
   The curious, almost desperate moves made by the Sonics after
missing the playoffs as well as Mitch Richmond are at first hard to
comprehend, particularly with perspective still fresh from the
free-agent debacles of eight months earlier in preparation for the
lockout-degraded 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have so far failed to land an impact player, or a
name that will sell tickets, or a guy that will make the rest of
the NBA take Seattle seriously again as a contender.
</P>
<P>
   What they have acquired are provocateurs who are, to use
Walker's words, ``mean, ornery and tough.''
</P>
<P>
   If Westphal finds he can't handle it, here's a suggestion for a
replacement: Jack Palance.
</P>
<P>
   But if Westphal maintains control of this milling snarl, the
possibility exists that the group will at least be entertaining, in
a pro wrestling sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   This new mix of personalities and talents is so abrupt and
volatile that no one, including Walker and Westphal, can say with
much authority how it will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is on record as guaranteeing the playoffs, and Friday
Westphal said, ``I'll back him on that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, the Sonics last season would have been a
playoff team with one more win. So forecasting a one-game
improvement is not exactly leaping to the distant end of the limb.
</P>
<P>
   What is more significant is whether the Sonics can make the
final four in the West, which requires winning a first-round
series. That reasonable goal is what the Sonics not only missed
last year, but nearly blew the two previous years under George
Karl.
</P>
<P>
   After making the Finals in 1996, the Sonics had to go to five
excruciating games in 1997's first round to get past undermanned
Phoenix. Same thing happened in 1998 against even more undermanned
Minnesota. After those narrow escapes against more youthful,
energetic teams, the conclusion was that the Sonics looked old and
slow, which the second-round defeats bore out.
</P>
<P>
   So the departures of Detlef Schrempf, 36, Dale Ellis, 39, Hersey
Hawkins, 33 next month, along with the previous season's departures
of Sam Perkins and Nate McMillan, were as necessary from a
strategic standpoint as they were regrettable from a personality
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Things change faster in the NBA than they do in any other sport,
and the Sonics stayed pat longer than most, thanks mostly to Karl's
reluctance to use younger players. The league changed even more in
'99 with the new labor agreement as well as the impending rules
changes emphasizing quickness over strength, and offense over
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Walker's free-agent blunders with Jim McIlvaine, Craig
Ehlo and Billy Owens, and the Sonics' rigidity and mistakes made
the fall from eminence swift and brutal.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Payton now finds himself the only player remaining
from the '96 team. But it's hardly unique. The only remaining
member of the Bulls team that beat them will be Toni Kukoc.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Sonics needed help on so many fronts, the failure
to acquire Richmond might turn out to be a help simply because the
Sonics will spread out more salary to more players on the rise,
such as Barry and Patterson, instead of a star in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Next season likely won't be pretty, but it will be much like
your average grunge or hip-hop show: Noisy and wild.
</P>
<P>
   Check your sensitivities at the KeyArena door.

SEAHAWKS KICK OFF HOLMGREN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Mike Holmgren's face is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In newspaper ads and on TV spots promoting season-ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   On the cover of the Seahawks media guide.
</P>
<P>
   On a 10-by-20-foot banner that hangs from the side of the field
house at Eastern Washington University, overlooking the practice
fields and giving a ``Big Brother is Watching'' feel to the team's
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   And, even more noticeably, in the faces of his new players as he
prepares them for the most anticipated season in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's game against the Buffalo Bills is only the
preseason opener. But like everything else that has transpired
since Holmgren was named executive vice president of football
operations/general manager and head coach, his first game looms
with the allure of Mount Rainier on a sunny afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   With all eyes on Holmgren, what does he need to see from his
team?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win, first,'' Holmgren said Friday after the team's
light 45-minute workout. ``But almost more importantly is to be
able to come away from the preseason making fair, honest, good
decisions on who we keep. So I have to get answers out of the
preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes kill that evaluation process, so Holmgren wants during
this game the same things he demands in practice _ efficiency and
crispness, not mistakes and sloppiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're going to be working hard on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren admits he always feels pressure before a game. If he is
experiencing it more because of the heightened expectations that
are rooted in his presence, he isn't showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I've ever walked out of a tunnel and on the field
for a game, preseason or regular season, I realize how fortunate I
am,'' Holmgren said. ``I love what I do, and I get to do that
because it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game as a Seahawks coach, there will be a lot of
stuff running through my mind, but I'll be very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren was somewhat bewildered by his last visit to the
Kingdome. It was in 1996 and he was on the opposite sideline as
coach of the Green Bay Packers. The Packers undressed the Seahawks,
31-10. But an even bigger embarrassment to the team and the
franchise were the green-and-gold clad Packers fans who nearly
outnumbered and definitely out-yelled the ``hometown'' fans,
turning the Kingdome into Lambeau West.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very unusual day,'' Holmgren said. ``I trust that
won't be the case (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   But just how many fans will turn out for Holmgren's debut? Will
the buzz generated by his arrival, when 904 orders for season
tickets were taken on the day he was hired, translate into bodies
in the stands for a preseason game?
</P>
<P>
   More than 55,000 season tickets have been sold _ a far cry from
the 62,000 that was the norm in the mid-1980s but also far better
than the 34,000 total when billionaire Paul Allen bought the
franchise in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren has become the pitch man. Or at least his face has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had to be the focus point in selling tickets
before,'' said Holmgren, a slight smile spreading across that
ever-present face. ``I think if we put a really good product on the
field, the people will want to come and watch us.''

EX-BAYLOR PITCHER HELPS WHITE SOX SWEEP RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

Ex-Baylor pitcher helps White Sox sweep Rangers
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Rangers and the Chicago White Sox had to dip into
their minor leagues last night for a starting pitcher to get them
through a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox chose their No. 1 draft pick from last year, a
former All-American out of Baylor. The Rangers had to settle for
Ryan Glynn, whose first trip to the majors earlier this summer
wasn't exactly stellar.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage worked both ways for the White Sox in a
doubleheader sweep over the Rangers last night at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Wells, making just his second major-league start, held the
Rangers to one run on three hits through five innings, and the
White Sox went on to a 4-2 victory in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2, the White Sox pounded Glynn for seven runs in
five-plus innings and completed the sweep with a 7-4 victory. White
Sox starter James Baldwin held the Rangers scoreless for six
innings while his teammates were working over Glynn.
</P>
<P>
   The two losses and the Oakland Athletics' 9-8 victory over the
Toronto Blue Jays cut the Rangers lead to 5 1/2 games in the
American League West. That's their smallest lead since July 21,
when they were five ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating all the way through,'' first baseman Rafael
Palmeiro said. ``We just didn't execute tonight. We've got a good
hitting team, but overall we were flat tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played both games without right fielder Juan
Gonzalez, who was sidelined for a third consecutive day with
tightness in his left hamstring muscle. They also rested catcher
Ivan Rodriguez and third baseman Todd Zeile in the second game and
had to make do in both games with left fielder Rusty Greer and
center fielder Tom Goodwin, both of whom are obviously not 100
percent healed from their leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``Short-handed? No.
Banged up? Yeah. But I don't think that had anything to do with the
way we played.''
</P>
<P>
   Glynn, who allowed nine hits, three walks and a balk, is 2-4
with an 7.24 earned-run average in 13 major-league games, and he'll
likely be sent back to Triple-A Oklahoma. Danny Kolb is expected to
rejoin the team as a long reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glynn threw more strikes,'' Oates said. ``I know he gave up
seven runs _ he missed location, got some balls up and it hurt him
_ but he wasn't ball two, ball three every time. He was around the
plate, I was glad to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was optioned back to the minors last night, but there's
little doubt he'll be back for an extended stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very impressive,'' Oates said. ``He moved the ball
around, it looked like the ball went where he wanted it to go. We
had some ugly swings against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was taken 16th overall in last year's draft, six spots
after the Rangers used their first-round pick to take Northeastern
University first baseman Carlos Pena. He won his only other
major-league start Aug. 2, beating the Detroit Tigers, and the only
reason he doesn't have a permanent job in the majors is that the
White Sox have been unable to trade veteran starter Jamie Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew coming in there would be a good chance I'd be going
back,'' said Wells, who is 6-1 with a 2.18 ERA at Birmingham. ``I
just wanted to give them a good performance out there. I'm not
down. It's part of the game. This is my first year, I didn't expect
to walk in and take over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had Wells in trouble a couple of times but failed to
deliver a punishing blow. Instead they let him slip through five
innings, allowing just one run before turning it over to the White
Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Wells started the third by giving up a double to Roberto Kelly
and walking Royce Clayton. But Goodwin fouled off two bunt
attempts, then _ after the rain delay _ struck out. Wells then got
Mark McLemore on a fly to short left and Ivan Rodriguez on a
grounder to short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got a run off Wells in the fourth but, with runners
at first and third, he escaped a bigger mess by striking out Kelly
and Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kip came in with a big outing at a time we sorely needed a
lift,'' White Sox manager Jerry Manuel said. ``It's impressive he
knows how to pitch when he gets in trouble. He has a very good
presence on the mound.''

FOES RECALL GRAF'S TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ It is apropos that the WTA Tour played
down the road from Hollywood. Studios, celebrities and limelight
were just a brief drive from women's tennis and its stars.
</P>
<P>
   It also is apropos that Steffi Graf wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   As Graf announced her retirement Friday in her hometown of
Heidelberg, Germany, WTA players at Manhattan Country Club in the
Acura Classic reacted mostly with surprise and sadness to Graf's
announcement, using the words ``professional,'' ``hard-working''
and ``quiet'' to describe her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi was remarkable in that she played tennis, but she
didn't want anything to do with the politics of it,'' Lindsay
Davenport said. ``She just wanted to get out there and play tennis,
and that was admirable. She just loved to play tennis and that was
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, in all, it's a sad day for tennis,'' said Aranxta
Sanchez-Vicario, one of Graf's top rivals from 1989 to 1996. ``I am
kind of sad because I have great memories playing against Steffi.
It's hard to think she's not going to be there any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Austin, who beat Graf in her professional debut in
Filderstadt, Germany, in 1982, recounted the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was this 14-year-old kid who hit the ball so hard I
couldn't believe it,'' Austin said, at the tournament working for
TV. ``I said to myself, `Who is this kid? I've never heard of her.'
She was painting the lines, but I ended up winning 6-4, 6-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Graf won her first professional tournament,
beating Chris Evert in Hilton Head. That victory was the beginning
of a storied career in which she held the No. 1 ranking from Aug.
17, 1987 to March 10, 1991 and won a Grand Slam, all four major
tournaments, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis, who staked her claim as the top player in the
world during Graf's recent absence, could never control Graf on the
court, losing seven of nine matches against her. But after her
return, while Graf was playing well, she was no longer dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was like an icon when I played her,'' Hingis said. ``You
always want to beat the No. 1 player, but I barely had a chance in
the beginning. She always killed me. ... She was a great legend and
still is.''

FENWAY FOLLIES CONTINUE FOR MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Built 87 years ago, the dull green ballpark is on its
last legs. People come for the history. Unless you are the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Fenway memories are getting tiresome as well.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to a long list of unpleasant visits, the Mariners twice
battled back to take the lead and a third time to tie, then settled
into old habits Friday night and lost 11-6 to the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was a three-game win streak. Gone were any whispers of wild
card. Still there is the Green Monster and its fondness for
anything wearing blue with Seattle stitched across the front of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you can't walk people,'' manager Lou Piniella said. ``In
this ballpark, you can't put people on _ they score.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Brian Daubach was a large part of the Boston
welcoming committee, doubling twice, homering once and driving in a
career-best five runs. Teammates Troy O'Leary had a bases-clearing
triple and Darren Lewis a career-high five runs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Mariners' 10th in their past 12 appearances in
the tea party city, their 85th in 138 games here. The Mariners have
won only two season series at Fenway in franchise history, 1984 and
1989, and unless they sweep the next two games, that dry spell is
going to stretch to 10 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play well at home; they're a tough team to beat at
home,'' catcher Dan Wilson said. ``But I can't see any reason for
their consistency against us. Tonight, we just didn't do the things
we needed to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ken Griffey Jr. of franchise-long Fenway failures, ``That's
too much stuff to pay attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's a little more tangled than all that.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' woes extend well beyond the 420-mark in deep
center at Fenway. Simply put, this Seattle club can't play with the
big boys this year, no matter where the ballpark is located, even
if it's on Royal Brougham Way (see recent Yankee series, an 0-for-4
effort).
</P>
<P>
   Entering this matchup, the Mariners had won just four of 15
series against teams now with winning records, splitting three.
Their overall record against teams in the plus-column was 18-26.
Since late June, the Mariners had won just two series against clubs
over .500, sweeping Texas and taking two of three against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Piniella used the first of three rookie pitchers
he intends to start against the Red Sox. Freddy Garcia lasted just
four innings. Which doesn't bode well, considering he's the most
established of the first-year mound trio.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia left with a 5-4 lead and two runners on in the fifth. His
replacement? The once-hearty, since-smarting Jeff Fassero, now
working on his second bullpen banishment. Fassero's third pitch was
ripped to right by Daubach for a double to put the Red Sox up 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell's grounder tied the game at 6-6 in the sixth, but
Fassero gave it right back with a four-spot in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The lefty walked the leadoff hitter, watched a sacrifice bunt
get thrown into center field by replacement first baseman Raul
Ibanez and, with one out, walked Nomar Garciaparra intentionally.
O'Leary socked an 0-1 Fassero pitch into the right-field corner to
clear the bases and leave no questions, then O'Leary scored on
Jason Varitek's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Ibanez, subbing for an injured John Mabry, made no excuses for
his miscue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I blew it,'' he said quietly. ``I just threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to more Fenway misery, as well as Fassero's 14th
loss in 18 decisions, the setback tying his high in the majors. He
was 13-14 for Montreal in 1995. He is just five from the Mariners
record for losses by a pitcher in a season, shared by Matt Young
(1985) and Mike Moore (1987).
</P>
<P>
   Besides the game, the Mariners lost Mabry to a bruised knee,
leaving them in a manpower predicament. The club already was one
player short on the bench, choosing to keep a full bullpen while
reliever Jose Paniagua first serves a fight-related suspension,
then fellow reliever Frankie Rodriguez follows suit.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry fouled a ball hard off his right knee in the second
inning, tried to keep playing, but had to leave two innings later
after reaching base with a single. His status will be evaluated
daily, but his immediate availability appears shaky at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he feels, but I doubt if he'll be able to play
(today),'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   As the manager relayed that bit of news, outfielder Charles
Gipson was headed out the door with a bag over his once-injured
shoulder. He was headed up the road, to Class AA New Haven, for a
rehab assignment. Guess it was too late to call him back.
</P>
<P>
   But Gipson might have been the smart one, making an early exit
from Fenway.

TRAVIS REED TRANSFERS TO LONG BEACH STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Former UCLA basketball player Travis Reed said
Friday he has decided to attend Long Beach State rather than
Oklahoma, ending a summer of speculation where he'd wind up.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 forward will become eligible to play for the 49ers
in the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach State is closer to home,'' Reed said, explaining
the decision he's been mulling most of the summer. ``I also have a
family situation to take care of, and I couldn't do that back there
(in Oklahoma).''
</P>
<P>
   Reed previously signed financial-aid agreements with Long Beach
State and Oklahoma, though neither was binding. Reed said he will
be on the Long Beach State campus for the beginning of school
Aug.30.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had committed to the 49ers while he was at Fontana High,
then changed his mind and ended up at UCLA, where he played for two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA had always been a dream of mine,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   So, why transfer now from UCLA to Long Beach State?
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for me to get to the next level I have to play my
total game,'' Reed said. ``I wasn't playing my total game at UCLA.
At Long Beach State, I believe I'll be able to show my skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he sees no problem switching from the fast-paced
Pac-10 Conference to the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 is a fast conference, probably the fastest
conference in the country,'' Reed said. ``The Big West will be a
change. But there are good teams and good players in the Big West.
Players do get drafted out of the Big West.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the idea of playing for Coach Wayne Morgan and
assistant Tom Lewis, who has been recruiting Reed since his high
school days, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting,'' Reed said. ``They're two great coaches
on the way up.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Reed played in 27 games his freshman year, 31 games
last season, altogether starting just seven. He averaged 4.0 points
per game as a freshman, 5.4 points as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's transferring, Reed must redshirt the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be that tough,'' Reed said. ``In the Olympics, they
train four years for one event, right? The year will go by fast.''

WALKS, ERA ASIDE, MECHE MESHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He is the youngest player in the Mariners clubhouse,
often alone in his thoughts and pregame workouts. But after seven
outings on the mound, 20-year-old Gil Meche feels like he belongs
in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Meche, who will pitch again Sunday at Fenway Park, has won three
of five decisions and demonstrated rare poise for someone so young.
The downside is a 6.61 earned run average and 23 walks in 322/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm just being too fine,'' he said of his frequent
free passes. ``I'm not trusting my stuff like I should be. It seems
like if I get through the first few innings, I'm OK. I know I have
good stuff, I just have to use it. That's why I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche pitched just once for the Mariners during spring training,
but it was enough to make a lasting impression. Manager Lou
Piniella liked his composure, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really a good looking young pitcher; he's a
blue-chipper,'' Piniella said. ``Remember, he's a young man, just
20 years old. He's still got to find himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche says he's not making adjustments quickly enough when he
runs into trouble. Against the Chicago White Sox for instance, he
walked a batter on four pitches. Rather than regroup, he walked the
next batter on four pitches. Then he straightened himself out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the kind of pitcher I am,'' Meche said. ``But if
that's the worst it can get, and I keep winning games, that's all I
can hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngster has been to Fenway once before; in 1995, he was a
member of the U.S. Junior Olympic Team. He didn't get a chance to
pitch on that trip.
</P>
<P>
   That will change Sunday, when he opposes Boston's Mark Portugal,
a veteran pitcher 16 years older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am definitely looking forward to pitching here,'' Meche
said. ``I think about all the legends who have pitched here, and
I'll be on the same mound. Babe Ruth pitched here.''
</P>
<P>
   HUSKEY REVISITED: A former Mariner for three weeks now, Butch
Huskey got effusive hugs from Piniella and Ken Griffey Jr. during
pregame workouts. He chatted up several other Seattle players
behind the batting cage. A big bear of a man with a wide smile, he
was the same old Huskey, except for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey wore No. 44, rather than his trademark 42.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder is one of the few players allowed to wear the
latter digits, receiving grandfathered rights after the number was
retired league-wide two years ago to honor Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Huskey wore the number in deference to Robinson. He passed this
time because he saw potential conflict; former Red Sox standout Mo
Vaughn, who was immensely popular at Fenway, wore 42. Boston
catcher Lenny Webster did the same when acquired earlier in the
year; he wears 38 instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to come in and make a name for Butch Huskey instead
of being compared to Mo Vaughn,'' Huskey said. ``I knew it would
happen if I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Huskey initially inquired about No. 36, his high school jersey,
but it belongs to injured reliever Tom Gordon. Huskey can reclaim
42 at any time, in Boston or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   HURT FEELINGS ONLY: This time Red Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg is
the one shaking off the signs. The Tacoma resident and one-time
Washington State University player has been told to go back on the
60-day disabled list after missing all but six games this season
with a shoulder injury,
</P>
<P>
   His answer: He's healthy, ready to play and going to fight this.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg, the Red Sox's starting catcher the past two seasons,
says he has done all that's been asked. He has rehabilitated
himself, tested his shoulder in the minors and received medical
clearance from team physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel they're saying I can't help the team this year,'' he
said. ``But there are rules to protect the players and keep them
from getting passed down. I'm not going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg, Boston's alternate players' representative, says he
has contacted the Major League Baseball Players Association
regarding the matter and won't sign anything indicating he's not
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   By taking this somewhat radical action, the catcher says he
expects to be activated or waived this weekend.

TWO 12-YEAR-OLDS CHARGED WITH SLASHING NECK OF 8-YEAR-OLD BOY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two 12-year-old Queens boys have been arrested and
charged with slashing the neck of an 8-year-old boy as he played in
the front yard of his family's home in Long Island City, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Adis Lucevic, was playing with a younger cousin
about 7 p.m. Thursday at his home on 35th Street when the two boys,
wearing bandannas over their faces, entered the fenced-in yard and
drew a single-edge razor blade across his throat, the investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, they didn't have any motive,'' said
Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Adis' father, Amer Lucevic, heard the commotion from inside the
house and ran after the two boys. A passing police car joined the
chase, and the two boys were caught a few blocks away, at 36th
Street and 34th Avenue, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Adis was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where the doctors
used 75 stitches to close the wound, which was on the left side of
his neck, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was released Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lucevic said his son did not provoke the incident. ``He told me,
`Daddy, I never saw these boys before in my life,''' Lucevic said.
``They just passed by and did what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The youths, whose names were not released because of their ages,
have been charged with assault and attempted murder, Pentangelo
said. The youths will be prosecuted in Family Court, the Queens
District Attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the boys may have had a previous brush with crime. As the
boys were being arrested by the police, a passer-by identified him
as one of five youths who mugged him on July 29 outside a health
club on 38th Street in Astoria. The youth has been charged with
robbery for his role in that incident, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucevic, speaking from his home, said his son has made a
remarkable recovery. ``He's happy to be back,'' he said. ``The only
thing is that he doesn't want to play outside anymore.''

OREGON STATE JOB NO STEP DOWN TO ERICKSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ Did he lose his job and then his mind?
Questions were as persistent as the reporters asking them, and
Dennis Erickson stood there Friday like Alex Rodriguez, fielding
and firing, flawlessly handling all of the curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Although many believe otherwise, Erickson said he has not made
an error in becoming the head coach at Oregon State, that it is not
a step down, just a proper move at this time in his 52-year-old
life.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for a dubious touchdown awarded to the New York Jets
that prevented the Seahawks from advancing to the playoffs,
Erickson could be standing in the Kingdome tonight, wearing the
customary headset and quizzical look, coaching against the Buffalo
Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he will be on the sidelines at Reser Stadium, formerly
Parker Stadium, conducting his first fall workout with the Beavers.
Erickson is delighted with the opportunity, spurred by the
challenge, and it doesn't matter if the cynics think he's gone mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job, the least of my worries was what other
people thought in the, quote, public,'' he said. ``When I talked to
other coaches, they said it was a chance to put your signature on
something and leave a legacy. Nobody said: `Hey, you're a dummy.'''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, given the chance, brain surgeons and rocket
scientists would fail here, too, but Erickson is a coach known for
resurrecting sluggish programs.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson appeared relaxed as he gave his Beavers briefing to the
media Friday. He assessed his team's few strengths and many
weaknesses from the Valley Football Center, which looks down upon
the new artificial turf and bright orange Oregon State end zones.
</P>
<P>
   Reser still resembles an overgrown high school stadium, but
there will be plenty of people in the seats this year. Erickson's
hiring and a 5-6 record last year have ignited a season-ticket
sales record; more than 10,000 fans want to see every home game.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson has gone from Jon Kitna as his starting quarterback to
Jonathan Smith, who threw for 469 yards against the Huskies last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This is how much things have changed: Rather than discussing the
Seahawks' first three opponents _ Detroit, Chicago and Pittsburgh _
Erickson talked about the importance of getting off to a good start
against Nevada, Fresno State and Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the ease with which Oregon State defeated Nevada last
year, Erickson was asked if the Beavers might be caught looking
past the Wolfpack. At that moment Erickson showed he knew where he
was, in Corvallis, where losing has reigned for 27 straight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to be complacent at Oregon State,'' he said.
``You've got to be kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   As coach of the Seahawks, Erickson seemed uptight at times,
recognizing the uncertainty of his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard year,'' said Gregg Smith, former Seahawks
assistant head coach who has joined Erickson here. ``There is
always that thing in the back of your mind. You wonder: `Can you
really coach?' You second-guess yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson was decisive and even humorous, poking fun at himself,
acknowledging that he had seen a picture of himself at his last
Pac-10 stop at Washington State in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had black hair, a little buffed up, it wasn't bad,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his first return to the Palouse to face the Cougars
on Oct. 30, Erickson said: ``Martin Stadium? It will be
interesting. From what I understand, they've got long memories in
Pullman. They threw stuff at me when I was coaching there, so
what's the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   His best line was this one: ``This team can win more games than
it loses and go to a bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone laughed, it was inaudible, because Erickson was
serious this time. If you want to buy into this laughingstock, your
shares are about to soar, or so Erickson believes.
</P>
<P>
   There were many reasons why he came to Corvallis, and Erickson
rehashed them all: his ties to the Northwest, his desire to return
to college football, to call the plays, to help shape the lives of
his players, to experience the campus excitement on game days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove I can do it,'' he said. ``That's as big a part
of me as there is, to turn around something that hasn't been turned
around for 28 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He will follow the Seahawks, read about them on the Internet and
watch their games on Sunday. But it will not be his focus. If that
was the mountaintop, this is the Willamette Valley, and Erickson
plans to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   Why can't it happen here, just like it did in Moscow and Laramie
and Pullman, where he revived Idaho, Wyoming and Washington State
before maintaining the high standards at Miami?
</P>
<P>
   Erickson reluctantly talks about the situation in Seattle, not
wanting to discuss leftovers when he's got a new main course in
front of him. He says he is proud of his four years with the
Seahawks, inheriting a 2-14 team and making it respectable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think I did a very good job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson could have sat out a season and considered other
options while earning more than a million dollars from the
Seahawks. Because he is a coach who relishes improbable tasks,
Erickson chose to tackle the ultimate renovation project.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted this opportunity, it wasn't like he needed to do
this,'' said Ron Davis, Oregon State's director of football
operations, who also came with Erickson from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   If he can succeed here, they just might name a street after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique challenge,'' Smith said. ``The first coach that
takes this team to a bowl game, his next job might be governor. I
know one thing: If it can be done, Dennis will do everything in his
power to make sure it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe no one in Seattle can believe the Everett native's
apparent downward mobility, but the move is intriguing, turning
Corvallis into a fascination station where Erickson hopes to avoid
train wrecks past.
</P>
<P>
   In a mutually beneficial way, even if neither is deserved,
Erickson and Oregon State will search for respect together in what
is generally viewed as a strange convergence of coach and team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things are applicable at certain times of your
life,'' he said. ``This is a fun place for me to be. I could be
perfectly happy here a long time.''

FIRST OFFICER AT SCENE DESCRIBES HORROR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDS, runs with SHOOTING-RAMPAGE, SHOOTING-HOPE, SHOOTING-KIDS,
SHOOTING-HATE) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As LAPD Sgt.Timothy Surette arrived at the North
Valley Jewish Community Center, glass was still falling from
shot-out windows, and people were screaming that the gunman had an
Uzi machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke hung so thickly that Surette _ the first officer at the
scene _ could smell, and even taste, the gunpowder, he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years on the police force and despite a stint as a
surgical orderly, Surette said nothing could have prepared him for
the devastation he found.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the destruction, Surette's thoughts flashed to his own home
in Santa Clarita, to his own 3-year-old son and the new baby he and
his wife are expecting.
</P>
<P>
   What if they had been here, he remembers thinking, and
shuddering. But if they were, he reasoned, they would want him to
concentrate on the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were there, they wouldn't want me to stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day-care center, a haven of safety and comfort that he
passed daily on his beat, was shattered into an inferno of
gunsmoke, wreckage and bleeding children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive by there every day and see kids playing, birds
singing,'' he said. ``To drive up and see broken glass, kids
screaming and smoke still in the air _ it was heart-wrenching. It's
traumatic, it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Surette and about 40 other police and fire personnel received
commendations at City Hall on Friday from city officials who
praised their swift, skilled response. More than 300 law
enforcement and fire officers converged on the site in the hour
after a lone gunman blasted the center with 70 gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   Surette was the first to respond after he heard the call while
cruising up Balboa Boulevard shortly before 11 a.m. Tuesday. He
raced to the scene, aware only that there was a shooting on Rinaldi
Street and Hayvenhurst Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at the center, he saw 16-year-old camp counselor Mindy
Finkelstein collapsed on the ground, comforted by a weeping friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in a lot of pain,'' Surette said. ``I just said, stay
with us, stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for the gunman but did not see him and now feels
certain he fled even as police were arriving. ``That's the most
amazing part _ some of us had to drive right by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Surette cautiously entered the building, scanning for potential
cover in case the gunman emerged. What he saw burns in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were brass casings all over, impacts on the wall and
glass on the floor,'' he said. Blood pooled in an adjacent
classroom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The receptionist, 68-year-old Isabelle Shalometh, was bleeding
and crying, her arm grazed by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Another staffer was on the phone, frantically calling for help.
The woman was so distraught, he said, that she failed to recognize
him as an officer and implored him to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, I know ma'am, I'm here, I'm here,'' he reassured her.
</P>
<P>
   Most horrifying, however, was the face of 5-year-old Benjamin
Kadish, the youngest and most critically injured in the attack. The
boy was pale, so stunned by pain that he wasn't crying, merely
struggling to breathe. As his color drained, his eyes rolled
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see him sick, see him hurt, and when his eyes rolled in
the back of his head and he went gray, I thought, Oh my God, he's
going under,'' Surette said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighter paramedic Todd Carb reached young Benjamin moments
later and began working to save him. The boy's pulse was nearly
undetectable, his eyes vacant and his blood so low that Carb was
unable to start an intravenous line.
</P>
<P>
   When the boy's eyes rolled back again, ``I thought he had gone
into traumatic full arrest,'' Carb said. ``I thought I had lost
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carb and his partner delivered the boy to Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center in a harrowing ambulance ride. The boy, later
transferred to Childrens Hospital, is in critical condition, but
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Carb said the event was the among the most intense and stressful
episodes of his 19-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving to the scene, (I thought) we could have potentially a
massacre on our hands,'' he said. ``It was a very frightening, very
terrifying dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The chilling image of the child's fading face stays with
Surette, replaying in his mind like the television broadcasts of
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   He had worked as an operating room orderly, witnessing heart and
brain surgery, operations on infants and the elderly. That
controlled chaos was unlike the carnage of the streets, though.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing could compare to the horror of a child stricken by
gunfire, he said. Only the children's trust and courage cheered him
on.
</P>
<P>
   While adults panicked, ``the kids did better,'' the sergeant
said. ``They were brave. They were upset, they knew something had
happened (but) they were holding each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they saw the uniform and the badge, all big and shiny,
and you see the little glimmer of hope, that's what kept me
going,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: A WORSENING CRISIS OVER TAIWAN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   With tensions mounting dangerously across the Taiwan Strait,
both sides need to step back and consider the risks they are
courting _ Taipei by its reckless declarations and Beijing by its
unacceptable military threats.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and the mainland have escalated the crisis by repeatedly
flying warplanes in the direction of each other's territory.
Chinese publications now regularly report on Beijing's preparedness
to assault Taiwanese-held territory, and Taiwan's president, Lee
Teng-hui, holds to his provocative demand that China deal with his
island as a separate sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
   Any military clash between China and Taiwan would imperil
Taiwan's prosperity and democracy, threaten China's economic
development and gravely damage relations between Washington and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, like most countries, recognizes Beijing's as
the only lawful government of China. Washington considers Taiwan
geographically part of China, but not currently subject to mainland
political rule. That widely accepted formula leaves the question of
China's eventual reunification to be resolved peacefully, at a
later date, by people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
Meanwhile, America is committed to providing Taiwan with adequate
means to defend itself against attack.
</P>
<P>
   That sensible arrangement was deliberately challenged last month
by Lee with his new formula of two separate sovereign states.
Beijing predictably and unjustifiably responded with threats of
military force. Concern has centered on the possible blockade,
shelling or occupation of several small islands controlled by
Taiwan just off the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades ago, Chinese shelling of the two offshore islands
Quemoy (now called Kinmen) and Matsu brought American warships to
the Taiwan Strait and Washington and Beijing close to military
confrontation. Relations between the United States and China have
come a long way since that unhappy era. Beijing should not risk
reversing that progress with a new episode of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of Chinese military action against Taiwan,
President Clinton would have little choice but to chill relations
with Beijing, freeze economic talks and consider whether American
military intervention was warranted. The administration must be
sure that Beijing understands these likely consequences before
China resorts to force.

OMAK STAMPEDE JUST NOT THE SAME WITHOUT FAMED SUICIDE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   OMAK, Wash. _ As daylight began to fade at the Omak Stampede,
Christopher Newman pointed toward Suicide Hill and explained how it
should look.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, he told Maxime Vroman, his friend, people would
be lining the riverbed to watch the Suicide Race.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a nervousness in the air, he said, as spectators
waited for the horses to come flying over the top of the
near-vertical hill.
</P>
<P>
   But the description was the best he could do for Vroman, who
came all the way from France to watch the race, only to learn it
had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you explain that experience?'' Newman asked, unhappily.
``It's one you have to see for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he turned to Vroman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you come again next year?''
</P>
<P>
   The Stampede, which began Thursday and runs through Sunday,
still features a rollicking rodeo and a lively carnival.
</P>
<P>
   But attendees and organizers agree: It just isn't the same this
year without the Suicide Race and Native American encampment that
have been highlights for more than a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm left-handed, and it feels like I don't have my left arm,''
said Jack Miller, the Stampede's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede officials canceled the race after the Colville
Confederated Tribes boycotted the Stampede in an 11th-hour dispute
over parking and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members normally make up most of the riders in the race _
the Stampede's most popular and controversial event. During the
races, which take place each night of the Stampede, horses barrel
over the hill and swim across the Okanogan River.
</P>
<P>
   The event draws tens of thousands of visitors to Omak, and they
spend $3.5 million on motels, restaurants, gasoline, Stampede belt
buckles and other knicknacks.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Miller estimates ticket sales are down 20 percent to 30
percent from the 30,000 people who normally attend the Stampede.
</P>
<P>
   It will take some time to gauge whether lower attendance this
year would significantly affect the sales-tax revenues that help
bolster Okanogan County's $42 million budget, said John Rayburn,
director of the county's Economic Development Council.
</P>
<P>
   His initial impression _ judging from the patches of empty grass
he saw on the camping grounds normally packed bumper-to-bumper _
was that the county would notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know,'' said Cheryl Lampe, president of the Omak
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Stampede, she said, is never a sure bet, with bad weather
sometimes discouraging visitors from shopping downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Suicide Races have been crossed out by hand on the
thousands of printed Stampede schedules, but there's nothing to be
done about the emblem featured on everything from the Stampede
banners strung along Main Street to the menus at a downtown pub.
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy field at the Stampede grounds downtown, normally
crowded with Native American singers and dancers and games, one
empty tepee stands alone, pitched as a symbol by a tribal member.
</P>
<P>
   It was the field that caused the tension between Stampede
organizers and the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal members said they objected to plans to restrict tribal
parking on the field. They were concerned, too, because they felt
the encampment was being moved around too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks just bare here,'' said Pearl Charley, a member of the
Yakama tribe, as she cooked golden fry bread in bubbling oil at a
picnic table on the field's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Charley drove to the Stampede with her daughters to sell the
bread, and she was amazed to see the encampment grounds vacant.
</P>
<P>
   She had heard talk of a boycott, she said, but she didn't
realize it was that serious.
</P>
<P>
   More than the field was emptier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Stampede President Fred Winningham attributed some of the
decline in attendance to the area's soft economy.
</P>
<P>
   Orchard owners who normally bought blocks of tickets for
employees couldn't afford it this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribe's boycott clearly caused others to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Cook, who was manning the Omak Food Bank table at the
Stampede, said her son normally attends each year, but he balked
this time because he has friends among the tribal racers. ``He said
no, I'm going to stay away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The race's loss was a psychological blow for many in town, who
said the race put Omak _ population 4,400 _ on the map and made the
Stampede different from other rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   The race is an attraction for visitors from as far as Holland
and Japan. Vroman heard about the race in France, where he met
Newman, an exchange student who was studying abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible without the Suicide Race ... it kind of makes
the town what it is,'' said Amanda Shafer, the desk clerk at the
Omak Lodge, the town's largest hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be clear until Saturday, traditionally the
Stampede's biggest day, whether the impact will be a serious
financial blow as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big shot in the arm for a lot of the businesses in
this town ... they're pretty nervous,'' said Max Frazier, who set
up a table downtown to sell inspirational ornaments as a church
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   At the Omak Lodge, the effect was already dramatic, said manager
Russ Huppert.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-room hotel, which can normally name its price on Stampede
weekend, cut rates by 25 percent after fielding 15 or 20
cancellations when the race was called off.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was booked solid again by Friday, but the cut rates
translated to a $1,200 loss _ the equivalent of two or three days'
receipts on a normal weekend, Huppert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time of year when it gives us a major boost to
live out the rest of the year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was crushed to see the race gone.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones of the Progressive Animal Welfare Society, which has
campaigned against the Suicide Race for years, strolled quietly
around the Stampede grounds Friday with PAWS communications
director Richard Huffman.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had told race officials he would encourage tourists to
come to Omak if the race were canceled, he said, and wanted to show
his support for the Stampede's decision.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were visitors such as Lisa and Ernest Lenz of
Marysville, who bought Stampede tickets in November after years of
anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they were looking forward to the race, but they never
considered canceling their plans after hearing the race had been
called off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have come anyway just to see the rodeo,'' Lisa Lenz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets ranged from $5 to $12, and organizers were not issuing
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   And there was plenty of excitement in the rodeo stands Thursday
night as the first horses pounded into the ring. Cheers and
whistles erupted as riders held fast to animals bucking so wildly
all four feet seemed to dance in midair.
</P>
<P>
   Supportive cheers came even when a rider fell after one wild
ride, his cowboy hat rolling off his head and into the dusty ring.
</P>
<P>
   Teenage rodeo queens waved gracefully to their clapping fans as
they raced in a tight circle, with the stampede's queen the
evening's clear star.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have a Miss Rodeo America in front of you!'' the
announcer gushed.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as the Stampede box office sells tickets for next
year's event, there's talk and hope that the race and encampment
will return next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Thile, an Okanogan County commissioner and Stampede board
member, said he's working on brokering a meeting among the city,
tribe and rodeo committees.
</P>
<P>
   They will likely bring in a mediator to help work through their
misunderstandings and miscommunications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's enough blame to go around on everyone's
part....''
</P>
<P>
   For Stampede Vice President Miller, whose wife and children are
tribal members, he's not sure he would want to stay involved if the
race and encampment don't return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of healing that needs to be done,'' he said. ``I
think when it's all over, we'll all say `How did we let this
happen?'''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Prayer and song at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center Friday replaced the overshadowing tragedy left
behind by a racist shooting rampage at the center just three days
before.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 family members of the 36 children and staff who
were there during Tuesday's shooting gathered to celebrate the
Sabbath, pray for peace and tighten community bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of coming together to heal and bringing us back
to normal when the kids come back to camp on Monday,'' said Mike
Doner, whose 10-year-old daughter Samantha was at the center the
day of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Doner's 13-year-old son Mike summed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to know that everyone is here for the same
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's shooting gripped the nation for nearly 24 hours as
police searched for suspect Buford Furrow. Furrow turned himself in
the next day in Las Vegas and allegedly confessed to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Police later linked Furrow to white supremacist hate groups,
including the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those present at the gathering in Granada Hills were
connected in some way to the center or the adjacent Episcopal St.
Andrew and St. Charles churches.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Lebowski, a local resident and member of the center, said
the tragedy should serve as a reminder that dangers exist
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as Americans need to be more aware, because it can happen
to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the lesson is that residents need to ``elect the right
politicians'' who ``aren't afraid to push for strong gun control
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Dreyfuss has three children in the camp, including one
who was present at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his children had 16-year-old Mindy Finkelstein,
who was wounded in the shooting, as a counselor. All three of his
children were shaken up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping a close watch on our kids,'' he said. But
Friday's gathering served to give them a sense of security
``knowing that there's a lot of us out here supporting each
other,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Gregory Frost, from the Episcopal church next door,
spoke at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians are not called to kill Jews or hate Jews,'' he
said. ``When people target Jews, they target us.''
</P>
<P>
   Prayers were offered for the families of the five wounded,
including three children, and for Filipino-American mail carrier
Joseph Ileto, who was shot dead the same day, allegedly by the same
gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky and members of the
Los Angeles police and fire departments also came out to show
support for the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for the lives that were spared and regretful of
the life that was lost,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was glad that ``L.A.'s diverse population has come
together to heal and demonstrate what we as human beings have in
common with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   All of those wounded were in fair condition, except for
5-year-old Benjamin Kadish, who was wounded in the abdomen and leg
and remained in serious condition. &UR;  &QL;

POLICE SAY WEAPON USED BY FURROW WAS SOLD AT SPOKANE GUN SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON AND JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The pistol that police say was used to kill a U.S.
postal worker in Los Angeles on Tuesday traded hands several times
before it was sold last year at a gun show in Spokane, near the
north Idaho compound of the Aryan Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The gun is a key piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation
of Buford O. ``Neal'' Furrow Jr., an avowed separatist and white
supremacist who confessed to police that he attacked the North
Valley Jewish Community Center, and then shot and killed the postal
worker with a 9mm Glock model 26 semiautomatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents investigating the slaying of Joseph Santos Ileto
on Friday were retracing the ownership of the 9mm pistol, trying to
pinpoint when and how Furrow obtained it.
</P>
<P>
   The gun, which bore the serial number BSM901US, was first bought
in 1996 by the Cosmopolis Police Department in Grays Harbor County,
Wash. The police traded it to a gun dealer, who also was a reserve
officer in the department, who then sold it to a local businessman
who passed it on to a friend to sell.
</P>
<P>
   That friend, according to local law-enforcement authorities, is
the person who sold the weapon in early 1998 at a gun show in
Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the gun was bought from an unlicensed vendor at a
gun show may restart the stalled debate in Congress over whether
background checks should be mandatory on all purchases at gun
shows, as they are now required at gun shops. It may also renew
debate in Washington state over how police departments dispose of
unwanted weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is set to debate a series of modest gun control
measures as part of a juvenile crime bill when it returns after the
Labor Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Senate passed a bill requiring that all
dealers at gun shows, including the 40 percent who do not have
federal licenses, conduct background checks on customers, allowing
three days for completing those checks. The House defeated such
legislation, which was also opposed by the National Rifle
Association as too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow, a 37-year-old felon convicted of a knife assault last
year at a Kirkland, Wash., mental health facility, was not legally
permitted to own a gun. Authorities say it is not clear whether he
was the person who bought the Glock 9mm pistol early last year at
the Spokane show.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Chester, a spokesman with the Seattle office of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the agency
still had not determined how Furrow acquired the pistol or six
other weapons, including an Uzi assault-style submachine gun, that
were recovered from a car he had hijacked Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF also was searching Friday for a gun dealer who was the
registered owner of the semiautomatic rifle that Los Angeles police
found in a van that belonged to Furrow.
</P>
<P>
   Chester said Furrow may have recently traded for some of those
guns using others he had acquired while he was a federally licensed
firearms dealer between 1992 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Chester said there were ``indications'' that some of those
trades had occurred after this May when Furrow was released from
jail and was prohibited from owning firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow had to have acquired the weapons between January and
October 1998 or after this May, because he spent the intervening
time in jail for the assault at the Kirkland psychiatric hospital.
He had gone there for help, saying he was fantasizing about
committing a mass killing.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow could face the death penalty for federal murder and
attempted-murder charges.
</P>
<P>
   The gun used to kill the postal worker was one of two Glock
model 26 guns that were bought by the Cosmopolis police, from Glock
Inc., the Atlanta-area distributor for the Austrian gun producer.
</P>
<P>
   The department purchased the stubby handgun to evaluate it, said
Police Chief Gary Eisenhower. ``It just wasn't to our liking,'' he
said Friday after ATF agents called him to say the weapon was
involved in a ``high-profile case.''
</P>
<P>
   After a month of testing, the department traded it to Don
Dineen, a reserve police officer and the owner of Don's Guns Store
in Cosmopolis, a town of 1,600 near the port city of Aberdeen. In
return, the department received a Glock model 17, a larger sidearm,
and the department's standard issue to its officers.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Dineen sold the pistol to David Wright,
owner of a paint and home-decorating supply store in nearby
Aberdeen. Wright kept it for two years, until January 1998, when he
transferred the gun to Andy Palmer, a local friend who collected
antique guns.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents tried to reach Palmer Friday but he was
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Aberdeen Police Capt. Michael Haymon said Wright had told ATF
agents who interviewed him that he had given Palmer several guns,
including the Glock, to sell at a Spokane gun show in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Cosmopolis Police Department's decision to trade the Glock
model 26 troubled gun control advocates Friday, although state law
allows police chiefs to determine how they dispose of unwanted,
unclaimed or forfeited weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that law enforcement agencies should be in the
business of selling guns. Whether they're new or old, guns just end
up back at crime scenes,'' said Bruce Gryniewski, executive
director of Washington Cease-fire Foundation, a gun-control
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The department should have destroyed the gun rather than trade
it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have the option, under state law, of destroying, selling,
using or trading guns in for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   When most departments upgrade their standard weapons _ many in
recent years have changed from revolvers to automatic pistols _
they trade them in to manufacturers or dealers to reduce costs,
according to Larry Erickson, executive director of the Washington
Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   An exception is Seattle, where local laws prohibit police from
returning guns back to the market. A Seattle police spokeswoman
said a property room has been filled with nearly new .38-caliber
revolvers since the department adopted another Glock automatic as
standard issue a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what police should do with seized weapons is a
long one. In 1989, the Legislature passed a law that prohibited
police from destroying confiscated weapons, while requiring them to
auction them to licensed gun dealers and use the proceeds for gun
safety programs.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the Legislature changed the law to give local
authorities more options, including destroying the weapons. Some
guns, including antiques, cannot be destroyed, however.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sponsored by then-Rep. Gary Locke, now Washington's
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes that police departments should not act
as a revolving door for guns confiscated from criminals,'' said
David Chai, a Locke spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's departments in at least three counties _ King, Pierce
and most recently Snohomish _ destroy at least some of the guns
they seize. The Washington State Patrol destroys about half the
estimated 450 guns it seizes each year, and trades in the rest to
acquire new weapons, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   In King County, Sheriff David Reichert recently sought the
authority to destroy more guns, including rifles, shotguns and
assault weapons. But the County Council balked because members
believed that would violate state law, which they interpret as
requiring such weapons to be sold or traded.
</P>
<P>
   The Snohomish County Council recently ordered the sheriff's
department to stop selling confiscated weapons, restricting options
to destruction or use by the department.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Rick Bart opposed the restrictions, arguing the sales
provided income for the cash-strapped department.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Waldron, a lobbyist for two Washington gun owners groups,
said Friday that it doesn't make sense to stop the sales of
confiscated guns, since they are sold only to licensed dealers,
subject to all state and local firearms laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think its stupid to turn off a source of revenue.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Reacting to the hate-driven shooting
rampage in Los Angeles, a coalition of politicians, activists,
religious leaders and entertainers urged Gov. Gray Davis to create
a task force to combat hate groups and violent paramilitary
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   While battling street gangs has gotten attention, white
supremacists haven't received enough scrutiny, said Sen. Tom
Hayden, D-Los Angeles, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ask ourselves why we have failed to recognize and
confront the pattern of violence that has arisen from white male
Christian hate groups and militias in America,'' Hayden said. ``We
don't seem to acknowledge there's a mass movement of Aryan natives
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Davis received a letter from the coalition requesting the task
force Friday and is ``reviewing the possibility,'' said Davis
spokeswoman Hilary McLean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is appalled, shocked and saddened by the hate
crimes we've seen unfortunately too often thus far in his
administration and earlier this century,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter calls on Davis to combat paramilitary extremists ``by
every means, ranging from law enforcement to public education to
addressing the underlying causes of this organized hatred and
bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Coalition members include Cecil ``Chip'' Murray of the First
African Methodist Episcopal Church of Los Angeles, actor and
environmentalist Ed Begley, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke and labor leader Miguel Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   David A. Lehrer, regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League, was not among those who signed the letter but said he
supports the call for action, saying it is ``ripe for
examination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help focus public attention on this issue,'' Lehrer
said. ``The task force needs to explore hate groups in California,
focus the spotlight on their activities and recommend additional
laws, if necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   While attention to hate groups has been episodic throughout the
country, Lehrer said white supremacist groups are growing more
organized and gathering increasing numbers of recruits. The
Internet has been instrumental in the change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cheap and easy way to communicate and get the message
out like they've never been able to do before,'' Lehrer said.

LEGENDARY TALE OF BODACIOUS: A HALL OF FAME BULL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bull bucked legendary cowboy Tuff Hedeman to the prime-rib
ride of his career.
</P>
<P>
   And the bull made the former world champion wear titanium plates
in his face after knocking him out quicker than Muhammad Ali
dropped Sonny Liston.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the barnyard brute had become so ferocious that
Hedeman, the world's toughest bull rider, refused to lock his spurs
into Bodacious at the most lucrative rodeo in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletically speaking, Bodacious was the 275-pound lineman who
also could star at cornerback,'' said Hedeman, a four-time world
champion who lives in Morgan Mill. ``But if Bodacious would have
kept on bucking, he would have killed someone.''
</P>
<P>
   After clubbing many a cowboy and sending only a handful to the
pay window from 1992 though 1995, the lore of the light
coffee-colored Charolais-Brahman crossbreed bull, all 1,800 pounds
of him, transcended his sport.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Bodacious will be among six inductees into the
ProRodeo Hall of Fame in Colorado Springs, Colo. He is the lone
livestock inductee this year. He is arguably the most dangerous
world champion-caliber bucking bull of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious could vault a rider into the elite 90s in points after
staying on for an eternal eight seconds. But near the end of his
career, he habitually hit riders in the face with his massive front
end as the cowboy leaned forward to stay in sync as the bull
reared.
</P>
<P>
   After staying on the bull twice in four tries, Terry Don West
said he's thankful that he didn't have to face Bodacious over the
past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep my teeth, and he's the type of bull that will
take them away,'' said West, who suffered rib injuries during the
two failed attempts. ``He's like playing with a rattlesnake: If you
keep on he'll bite you.'' Next to impossible Bodacious was
discovered by Phil Sumner who raises bucking bulls at his Goldtree,
Okla., ranch. Sumner, in turn, sold the 1,500-pound whippersnapper
to East Texan Sammy Andrews, one of the most renowned rodeo
livestock contractors in the sport, at the beginning of the 1992
season.
</P>
<P>
   Like a coach starting a feisty freshman on the varsity squad,
Andrews immediately put Bodacious on the card at the Houston
Livestock Show Rodeo, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's
largest regular-season show.
</P>
<P>
   In the Astrodome, Bodacious burst out with Cody Lambert aboard
and put the seven-time National Finals Rodeo qualifier on the ropes
early during the eight-second attempt. After six seconds, Bodacious
jerked Lambert down on his then-wiry front end and hit him in the
face, a mere prelude of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I've got a scar on my face as a result of that
accident,'' Lambert said. ``When I shave every morning, I think of
that bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious continued to accelerate that rookie season, and at the
NFR he bucked off champions Ty Murray and Jim Sharp. The bull was
selected as the top bull of the 10-day rodeo, the first stamp on
his Hall of Fame passport.
</P>
<P>
   All the hype over Bodacious whetted Hedeman's appetite. Hedeman
faced the bull in Memphis, Tenn., and Tampa, Fla., in 1993. He was
bucked off in both attempts after having his hand jerked out of the
rope.
</P>
<P>
   When Hedeman faced Bodacious at the 1993 championships for a now
defunct organization dubbed as Bull Riders Only in Long Beach,
Calif., he threaded the tail of his tightly braided bull riding
rope through his fingers. Then, he wrapped the tail around his hand
tighter than a hangman's noose, a bull rider's equivalent of
playing double or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   With a deerskin glove, Hedeman also had rubbed an overabundance
of heated rosin into the rigging handle, equivalent to a football
receiver spraying stickum on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the chute, Hedeman eased down on the bull, nodded, and
Bodacious began a rapid fire of explosive rears and sledgehammer
drops. Hedeman countered the bull's every move and received 95 out
of 100, a score as rare as a perfect game in baseball, but a tally
that Andrews said was not high enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really amazing was Bodacious just got stronger and
stronger at the end of the ride,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   After 135 attempts, only six riders completed a total of eight
rides on Bodacious in the professional ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Hedeman, West is the most noted rider to conquer
the bull. The first was at a show in Ponca City, Okla., when
Bodacious was several hundred pounds smaller and was yet to embark
on a pro career. West's second qualified ride was in the San
Antonio Livestock Show Rodeo final round when West claimed the
title and $10,000 in February 1995, the last time a cowboy made the
eight-second count on the bull.
</P>
<P>
   West discovered a method of enduring Bodacious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to bending my knees and I wouldn't let go,'' he said.
``He was wanting to pull me down on his head, and so I pushed my
knees in him to alleviate the pressure. It was like I floated on
top of him. But he was no fun to ride. He was real strong and had a
lot of jerks and skips. I just had to bounce on my knees jump for
jump to stay on him.'' A lethal legend Unlike some of his pasture
mates who flaunted ``Flintstone'' clubs for horns, Bodacious' ivory
stubs sprouted only a few inches from his head. The bull's high
jumps, in unpredictable and impromptu patterns, however, were his
greatest asset to intimidate the roughest of bull riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch Bodacious highlights on tape, it's apparent
that a lot of the riders are not really trying to stay on him,''
Hedeman said. ``You can see it in their eyes. They're just looking
for a place to get off.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bodacious seemed to have a sixth sense of just who was
cinching a rope and cowbell around his oil drum of a midsection.
When Hedeman climbed on for a final ride of a clinched '95 PBR
world championship in Las Vegas, Bodacious seemed to hear
eight-time champion Don Gay's commentary for TNN:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is matchup of the season and maybe even the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman exuded confidence. He had conquered Bodacious in Long
Beach and was excited to culminate a banner season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I could be at least 95,'' Hedeman said. ``But I
didn't realize how bad of a habit he had developed of hitting
riders since I had last been on him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the gate opened, Bodacious reared and leaped several feet
from the arena floor, sucked back and skipped unevenly in between
two soaring jumps. Each jump climaxed with a toward-the-moon kick.
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman countered the first two jumps with a perfect seat, the
same precision moves that had enabled him to snare a gold buckle in
Long Beach. But as the bull reared and Hedeman leaned forward to
stay in rhythm and alleviate the pressure of the jumps, Bodacious
threw his head back and struck Hedeman in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was where I was supposed to be, but all of a sudden:
crash,'' Hedeman said. ``He proved that his head was harder than
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hedeman tumbled, his face collided with bull's massive
shoulders. Then, as Hedeman rolled on the dirt floor, Bodacious
came face to face with the fallen star.
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman clutched his bleeding face, and paramedics rushed in
with bandages to plug the gap. Hedeman refused a stretcher and
walked out of the arena with blood drenching a top portion of his
starched white shirt, making a spot almost the size of the
garment's stylish red-plaid elbow patch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember being in that much pain, I guess because I
had so much adrenaline going through me,'' Hedeman said. ``But
people gave me the most horrified looks, as if they had encountered
Frankenstein.'' The divorce Hedeman underwent reconstructive facial
surgery in a Las Vegas hospital. When he returned to his Morgan
Mill ranch home, his 4-year-old son, Robert Lane, didn't recognize
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Dad, the next time that you draw Bodacious, you'd
better chicken out,' '' Hedeman said. ``And I said, `Deal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After being battered at the 1995 PBR championships in October,
Hedeman was sidelined for two months and entered the 1995 NFR, also
in Las Vegas, weighing in 20 pounds lighter.
</P>
<P>
   During the middle of the NFR, a neon night in which organizers
feature the ``rank pen'' of bulls, the odds of Hedeman drawing
Bodacious was 15 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before the National Finals, somehow we just knew that
Tuff was going to draw Bodacious,'' Carolyn Andrews said. ``It was
like Bodacious was a magnet that Tuff couldn't break away from.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman drew Bodacious and faced a dilemma. When he was called
to ride, Hedeman mounted Bodacious in the chute, put his hand in
the rope handle and called for the gate to be opened.
</P>
<P>
   As the panel swung and Bodacious began exiting, a stalwart stock
contractor yanked Hedeman off Bodacious and planted Hedeman on the
walkway behind the chute. As a riderless Bodacious loped across the
arena, Hedeman stood among a sea of Stetson-capped competitors and
reverently tipped his hat toward the bull.
</P>
<P>
   Hedeman received affirmation from the 17,000 Las Vegas fans in
the Thomas and Mack Center. Andrews retired Bodacious at the
conclusion of the 1995 National Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was denied the world title at the end of the 10-day
championships, Hedeman said that he wisely threw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had become impossible to ride,'' Hedeman said. ``There just
wasn't any use in getting on him anymore.'' A smash hit Though it
has been four years since the bull bucked off his last cowboy, the
Andrews family receives an abundance of inquiries about Bodacious.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous glossy spreads on Bodacious have graced publications,
including ``Sports Illustrated'' and ``GQ''.
</P>
<P>
   After pairing and parting with legends like Hedeman, Bodacious
requires a $2,500 appearance fee at rodeos and fairs. There's an
abundance of Bodacious memorabilia, including posters, T-shirts,
caps and belt buckles. For Internet addicts, there's even a
Bodacious mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've even had one person write and say that they would like a
jar of his snot,'' Carolyn Andrews said. ``When we have him in a
pen for viewing, people want him to `autograph' their T-shirt by
throwing it down in the pen and letting him stomp on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious, selected as the bull of the year by the PRCA (1994,
1995) and PBR (1995), also became a prominent breeder and has sired
an abundance of offspring. The breeding is managed by Buckers Inc.,
which is based in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Bodacious calves are beginning to surface at junior
competitions. Seven of his sons were pitted against junior cowboys
at a 1998 benefit rodeo in Fort Worth, and some of them bucked in
hoof prints similar to their sire.
</P>
<P>
   Though his offspring are expected to flood rodeos during the
next decade, Hedeman said he doubts that Bodacious' charismatic
appeal will be duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one Secretariat in horse racing, and there's only
one Muhammad Ali in boxing,'' Hedeman said. ``And I think rodeo
will have only one Bodacious.''

RUMORS ANIMATE DISNEY STOCKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street gave an endorsement Friday to Walt
Disney Co.'s expected sale of its Fairchild Publications magazines,
in hopes that the entertainment giant is following through on
promised restructuring plans.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has been lagging on poor earnings for the past
year, bounced up more than 4 percent, gaining $1.0625 to $27.1875.
The stock has edged up from its 1999 low close of $25.50 a week ago
but remains down 28 percent from its all-time high 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had no comment on a New York Times report that it is in
talks to sell Fairchild, which includes W, Women's Wear Daily, Los
Angeles and Jane magazines, to either Conde Nast or Hearst for as
much as $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fairchild deal is more than rumors,'' said Barry
Hyman, managing director at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``It would
not be for a great deal of money. So the reaction of the stock
today is more psychological and reflects the belief that Disney may
be responding to pressure to get out of its doldrums and become
more focused on its entertainment properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney Chairman Michael Eisner promised in late April that the
Burbank-based entertainment giant would examine its cost structure.
Since then, a hiring freeze has been imposed and it has started to
streamline its film and video staffs, but Wall Street has remained
impatient with Eisner's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Disney acquired the magazines as part of its $19 billion buyout
of Capital Cities/ABC in 1995. It sold off several newspapers and
trade magazines in separate deals in 1997.

   LOS ANGELES _ Beverly Hills 90210 is down and out, at least when
it comes to sales of palatial homes, and the new address that
glitters these days in the Golden State is Hillsborough 94010.
</P>
<P>
   That trend emerged Friday in a survey of sales of million-dollar
homes in California, which reached a record level 2,130 properties
during the year's second quarter for a whopping 34.4 percent
increase on an annual basis.

Products Division said. During the April-June period, Hillsborough
recorded 79 sales of residential properties selling for $1million
or more compared with 46 such sales in the 1998 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Hills finished sixth on the list with 40 sales, down
from 51 in the 1998 period, marking the second consecutive quarter
in which the legendary haven for movie stars has been down and out.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hillsborough has always been the kind of place money
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillsborough has been a tony address since the '20s or '30s,''
said DataQuick market analyst John Karevoll. ``It's just been
cooking lately because of all the windfall high-tech money coming
into the area and the new millionaires are buying homes like
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the state's better neighborhoods should all feel like a
million bucks compared to the rest of the nation. Karevoll
estimates that 90 percent of the nation's million-dollar
transactions take place in California.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, towns like Greenwich, Conn., and Vail, Colo., have
seven-figure addresses. But they don't have the kind of dollar mass
California does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are million-dollar markets, but they just don't have the
numbers. If Vail has three sales in a month, it's high. The sales
volume is here,'' Karevoll points out.
</P>
<P>
   The market up north is tighter in terms both housing stock and
available land, which pushes prices up, Karevoll noted.
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive home sold during the second quarter was a $10
million house in Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, size lives in the Golden State, too. The
largest home sold during the period was a 16,599 square-foot,
10-bedroom, 6-bathroom house in Pasadena. It sold for $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the surge in sales of high-priced properties is
the appreciation of California real estate. Karevoll notes that the
price spike has simply pushed more homes past the $1 million
barrier, especially in the more prestigious neighborhoods in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Karevoll does not believe the sales pace will slow, either, and
he expects this quarter to set a new record for the pricey homes.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprising development was the rate of appreciation _
just under 10 percent _ which means buyers are not getting carried
away and trying to outbid one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The values in that (prestige) market are going up at about the
same rate as that little home in Palmdale. It's uniform across the
board,'' Karevoll said of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley did not get left out of this home hit
parade, either. Calabasas finished 22nd on the list of the 25
hottest markets with 24 sales of homes priced at $1 million or
more, up from 23 in the 1998 second quarter. The most expensive
home sold for $2.73 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp.
of Los Angeles County, said that Beverly Hills residents should not
feel slighted by their slip on the prestige scale. After all, this
is a city where million-dollar homes are torn down to make way for
new digs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they have million-dollar tear-downs up there, too,''
Kyser said of Hillsborough. ``But Beverly Hills is somewhat unique.
If you went to London and stopped a person on the street and said,
`Hillsborough' they would look at you and probably say it's in the
north (of England.) But Beverly Hills is an international brand.''

sure. But with the Web growing at a rate that defies human and

spread, and that both consumers and purveyors of facts _ which
includes most everyone, really _ have squared off over how and how
much to regulate the proliferation of raw and packaged knowledge.

HOME RUNS POWER GIANTS; SEND METS RIGHT BACK TO SECOND PLACE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For much of Friday evening, Masato Yoshii did
his part. But he also allowed two solo home runs, which was one too
many, and the New York Mets are back in second place.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start in two weeks, Yoshii allowed just four hits
and three runs (two earned) in six innings. But San Francisco
starter Russ Ortiz (two runs in seven innings) fared a little
better, and the Giants held on for a chilly 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Atlanta's 7-3 victory in Los Angeles, Friday
night's defeat dropped the Mets (71-46) a game behind the Braves in
the National League East. The Mets now lead Houston by a game in
the NL wild card race. Houston dropped percentage points behind
Cincinnati in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position. They had
the bases loaded when they were down by 3-1 in the seventh against
a faltering Ortiz (13-8), but Rickey Henderson was robbed of a
single in the hole at short by Rich Aurilia, who turned the play
into a run-scoring force at third. Roger Cedeno grounded to second
to leave runners on first and second and the Mets down by 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had not started since he allowed seven runs in 1 1/3
innings in Chicago on July 30. With the July 23 acquisition of
Kenny Rogers, the Mets had six starters, and Yoshii became the odd
man out.
</P>
<P>
   In two relief appearances after his demotion, Yoshii allowed
five runs in four innings. But Rick Reed injured his finger on
Sunday and Yoshii got the starting assignment Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Mets manager Bobby Valentine was asked if
Yoshii's start could be viewed as a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is his job,'' Valentine said. We told him we
wanted him to be in the bullpen, ready to start when we needed him
in case of injury or other misfortune. He's just doing what he's
been preparing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yoshii could not have been prepared for what happened in the
first inning. The right-hander surrendered a one-out double to
Ramon Martinez, who is filling in at second base for the injured
Jeff Kent. An out later, Yoshii walked two batters to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bill Mueller rolled a slow grounder toward second, it
looked as though Yoshii would escape the inning unscathed because
the Mets have the most reliable infield defense in the major
leagues. But Edgardo Alfonzo, who has not made an error since May
20, was in Venezuela for a funeral, not at second base. Luis Lopez,
who had not started at second since July 2, tried to barehand the
ball. He muffed it for an error and an unearned run. Yoshii came
back to strike out Aurilia and strand three Giants' baserunners,
but the Mets were down, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team scored until the fourth, when Ortiz, who had
allowed just two singles to that point, tried to sneak a 1-2
fastball past Piazza. Piazza, who was booed loudly here before each
of his at-bats, blasted the ball into right-center field for his
24th home run of the season, which tied the score at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants recaptured the lead, 2-1, in the bottom of the inning
when Yoshii surrendered a two-out homer to Aurilia (his 17th). And
when Marvin Benard hit a one-out home run in the fifth, the Giants
had a 3-1 lead. Yoshii had allowed his 21st homer in 21 starts this
season. &QL;

REDSKINS BEAT PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ It wasn't until seventh-round pick Michael Bishop,
the third-string quarterback, threw a pair of touchdown passes in
the fourth quarter and nearly pulled out a comeback victory with a
third score as time ran out that there was any semblance of
excitement Friday night at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the stadium was half empty, as New England lost its
exhibition opener, 20-14, to the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first- and second-stringers failed badly and
quarterback Drew Bledsoe injured his right ankle, though it doesn't
seem to be serious and Bledsoe is expected to be able to play in
next week's game against the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It took the third-string offense and defense to show any signs
of life, and it was Bishop, with his scrambling and energized play,
that added some zip to a flat night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was fun to watch,'' said Bledsoe, who was 7 of 10 for 87
yards with one interception _ by rookie Champ Bailey, who raced 46
yards for a touchdown in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fiery competitor who can run fast, and he has a
powerful arm,'' said Bledsoe, who may not have to worry about a
quarterback controversy now but may see the day when Bishop is
inserted as a change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said his ankle was ``not an issue.'' He iced it for a
while during the first half but said he would have played only one
more series anyway and sat out just to be on the safe side.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd at Foxboro Stadium wasn't too pleased with a
first-half effort that saw the Patriots trailing, 20-0. Coach Pete
Carroll was beside himself on the sideline, upset with the defense
that let the Redskins run up the middle with ease. That's where
rookie linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer roamed, but the Big Cat played
more like a kitten. He also was beaten on a 7-yard pass play from
Brad Johnson to Larry Centers for the second Redskins score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed in the first three quarters,'' said
Carroll. ``On defense we missed a lot of fundamental things. In the
first half they had six yards a carry, and that's not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was injured in the first quarter as he dropped back to
throw a pass to Vincent Brisby on the right side only to have a
defender roll on his ankle as Bailey stepped in front of Brisby to
pick off the errant pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vincent did what he was supposed to do,'' said Bledsoe. ``The
kid (Bailey) made a good play. I thought the first drive was a good
drive, and I thought Kevin Faulk looked very good. There's things
we can build off of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also lost fullback Chris Floyd, who started but
suffered a sprained right ankle, while defensive end Willie
McGinest didn't start as a precaution, nursing his oft-injured
groin.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk ran 11 times for 44 yards and caught an 8-yard touchdown
pass from Bishop in the fourth quarter. Faulk showed power,
elusiveness, and what Bledsoe called ``the ability to hit the
middle of the line and then start making his cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took the opening kickoff and moved from their 21 to
the Washington 12. Bledsoe hit Lamont Warren for 17 yards and Terry
Glenn for 15 along the way. But once the Patriots got into the red
zone, they couldn't push it across, and Adam Vinatieri's 29-yard
field goal try was wide right.
</P>
<P>
   John Friesz took over for Bledsoe late in the first quarter and
was erratic at best. He was 10 of 20 for 102 yards and one
interception in the first half. His interception came in the second
quarter when tight end Rod Rutledge had a perfectly thrown pass
bounce off his hands into the arms of Darryl Pounds, who ran 16
yards to the Patriots 25. Brett Conway would hit the second of two
field goals to make it 20-0.
</P>
<P>
   One of Friesz's best moments was a 26-yard pass play to Tony
Simmons over Bailey that got the Patriots to the 49 midway through
the second quarter, but the drive stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins broke a big play on a slant pattern from backup
quarterback Rodney Peete to Albert Connell. Tebucky Jones held
Connell as he was making the catch and Vernon Crawford missed the
tackle before Connell finally was brought down at the Patriots 21.
This led to a 39-yard field goal by Conway.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, who was 9 of 17 for 148 yards, hit a 43-yard pass to
Sean Morey, who made a diving catch. Harold Shaw finished the drive
with a 4-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   With the score 20-7, Bishop went to work again, hitting a
45-yard pass to Mike Sheridan followed by an 8-yard touchdown to
Faulk with 1:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots still had time, and the fans were ready for
heroics. With Vinatieri and punter Lee Johnson on the field at the
same time, the Patriots tried an onside kick, and it worked.
Bernard Russ, who had nine tackles, recovered the ball, giving
Bishop 1:48 with which to work.
</P>
<P>
   He moved the team downfield, scrambled for 13 yards, converted a
fourth down, and got to the Redskins 20 with two seconds left, but
he couldn't make the connection with Troy Brown at the end.
</P>
<P>
   And even if he had, it was the third unit. And the third unit
won't be playing against the Jets Sept. 12.

MYSTERY: WHY IS MONDY MOODY?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What's eating Raul? To think you know Raul Mondesi
is to wonder if you can stomach the answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder, despite all he recently
has said and done, can count many stalwart supporters inside the
organization. Supporters who to a man are at a loss to reconcile
the player's sudden fits of temper with his inherently sweet soul.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the lurch-right-out-of-his-cleats cuts he sometimes
takes at the plate, it's Mondesi's mood swings that are most
disquieting to those in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what all is bothering Mondy,'' manager Davey
Johnson said Friday before the Dodgers' game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was worried about the player who is being paid
beaucoup bucks to hustle the Dodgers into the next millenium,
Johnson rubbed his forehead and wearily, warily replied, ``Yes. I
want to help him. I don't have the answers. I wish I did.''
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame Johnson for worrying. He was managing the New
York Mets in the late 1980s when another tremendously talented
outfielder under his sway, Darryl Strawberry, started behaving
erratically.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson tried coddling, cajoling, cautioning and chastising
Strawberry. Always, Strawberry's standard reply was a contrite,
``Yes, Skip.'' His actions, though, screamed, ``No, No, Never,
Never, Naah ahh ahh.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was in the dark about the demons competing with
him for Strawberry's soul right up until the day the player was
admitted to a drug-and-alcohol rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope Mondy doesn't have issues like Darryl,'' said
Johnson, who was quick to add the outfielder has given him no
reason to suspect that is the case.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, missing a practice during the All-Star break,
turning up late for batting practice, lashing out in frustration,
even drinking too much on at least one occasion, doesn't exactly
constitute a preponderance of evidence of guilt on any charge.
Except immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind he's an immature person,''
Johnson said of Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson would just as soon leave it at that. But will Mondesi's
malevolent storm, which tore through the visiting clubhouse in
Montreal the other day, let him?
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is, I want Mondy to be happy,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear to be a tall order at the moment. Mondesi
clearly wasn't enjoying himself when the Dodgers were winning five
of six on the road and his mood didn't improve when he returned
home to vociferous boos every time he batted in the Dodgers' 7-3
loss.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Mondesi to wear such a monotone expression. His
normal game face is a grin. That's why the anger that spewed out of
him like lava from a volcano the other day in Montreal shocked his
supporters within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is entitled to a bad day. But Mondesi, until recently,
exuded the attitude that a bad day at the ballpark was better than
a good day most anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   No mystery, that. To grow up dirt poor, as Mondesi did in the
Dominican Republic, is to appreciate early on that there are a lot
worse ways to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's joie de vivre is central to his success. And now,
inexplicably, it has left him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone would gladly
lead a search party, if only either had a clue where to start
looking.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi has provided few clues. He was mum before the game. He
issued a standard written apology on Thursday but has yet to offer
a satisfactory explanation for his expletive-laced condemnation of
Johnson and Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always going to be there to help and support our
players,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, sounding more like a parent than a GM, he added,
``Sometimes they have misguided anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers can't diffuse Mondesi's fury until they get to the
root of it. At this point, all Johnson knows is, ``You can't play
this game and not be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Baseball players are not like painters who can
express their anger with violent brushstrokes on a canvas and
create something for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are obliged to help Mondesi get his inspiration
back. But first they have to figure out where it has gone and why.

RED SOX BEAT MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the forgotten man of the MVP race. But it's no wonder Troy
O'Leary has a legion of supporters among the Fenway Faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by rookie Brian Daubach (a career-high five RBIs)
for most of the evening, O'Leary came through with the biggest hit
of an 11-6 Red Sox victory over the Seattle Mariners Friday night
at Fenway. O'Leary brought a sellout crowd of 33,653 to its feet
with a bases-loaded triple in the seventh inning to break a 6-6
tie.
</P>
<P>
   The blow sent Boston not only to a wild victory but to the
wild-card lead. With Toronto losing to Oakland, the Sox took over
the top spot on the also-ran playoff race, a half-game in front of
the Blue Jays and two games ahead of the A's.
</P>
<P>
   In three previous trips, O'Leary had struck out twice and popped
up with men on base. In the seventh, he made up for it in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman led off with a walk, and Darren Lewis, who scored
a career-high five runs, reached on a sacrifice bunt, with the
runners moving up on first baseman Raul Ibanez's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   After Daubach grounded to second, the Mariners elected to walk
Nomar Garciaparra and test O'Leary, who made them pay with his
triple down the right-field line. O'Leary scored the fourth run of
the inning on a double by Jason Varitek. Boston picked up an
insurance run in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make contact,'' said O'Leary. ``He
(reliever Jeff Fassero) throws the ball hard, but he just happened
to leave the forkball up where I could do something with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need this. We know the A's and Toronto have been playing
well. We're playing well also. If we can continue, we'll be all
right. This was an interesting game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed interesting if you didn't mind several periods of
sloppy play. The ball was sailing around Fenway thanks to a strong
breeze. Each side made two errors, and neither starter, Freddy
Garcia for Seattle or Pat Rapp of Boston, made it through five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 1-0 lead on a Daubach double in the first, Boston
overcame deficits of 3-1 and 5-4, with Daubach showing the way. The
rookie's two-run homer in the third gave the Sox a 4-3 lead, and
his two-run double in the fifth made it 6-5, Boston, though he was
thrown out trying to stretch the hit into a triple.
</P>
<P>
   But, as is usually the case with the Red Sox, nothing came easy.
Closer Tim Wakefield started the ninth and loaded the bases with a
two-out walk to Jay Buhner. It was Lewis who should be credited
with the save, as he ended the game with a leaping catch on an
Ibanez shot to the wall in left center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of big catches,'' said Lewis. ``But to end the
game on a play like that is something. I know when the ball is hit
I have to basically give myself up. I know if it's anywhere near
the wall, I've got to jump up and do whatever I can to catch it. In
that situation, you're going to get banged up a little bit. But
you've got to go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't draw the attention of Garciaparra, O'Leary is
popular with the fans and solid as a rock on offense and defense.
The triple, his only hit in five at-bats, extended his hitting
streak to 14 games, tying a career best. O'Leary is batting .293
with 24 home runs and 82 RBIs. He has at least one hit in 38 of his
last 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems relaxed and confident,'' said manager Jimy Williams.
``He's a very durable kid. He doesn't like days off. Righthanders,
lefthanders, it doesn't matter. He's a very good RBI guy, and he
plays an outstanding outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the opportunity to bat against lefthanders started in
1997. All last year and then coming into spring training, his
mindset was pretty good. It seemed to me he was going to have a
good year, just by the way he came to the park. This kid has a
chance to have a very good year just based on the way he is.''

PIERCE UPSET BY HALARD-DECUGIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The Acura Classic semifinals are set.
Three names No.1 Lindsay Davenport, No.2 Martina Hingis and No.6
Serena Williams may have been expected to be there. But one name
Julie Halard-Decugis probably was not.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis, ranked 16th in the world, beat No.3 Mary Pierce
7-5, 6-1 Friday in the quarterfinals of the Acura Classic at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce was unsatisfied with her unforced errors and termed her
performance ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kept making the same mistakes over and over,'' Pierce
said.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis won by serving well, never allowing Pierce to
break her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit easy,'' Halard-Decugis said. ``She made
many unforced errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierce, 0-3 against Halard-Decugis, led 5-4 in the first set,
but Halard-Decugis won eight of the next nine games to demoralize
the fellow Frenchwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie has a very erratic game,'' Pierce said. ``You can never
get any rhythm on the court. Either there's a quick winner or
mistake from either one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport survives marathon: Davenport won a 2-hour, 12-minute
night match against Conchita Martinez 6-7 (7-4), 6-3, 6-2. Martinez
dropped to 7-3 against Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with how I hung in there,'' Davenport said.
``I could have easily folded. I don't have a good record against
her, and that's the one player I haven't beaten in a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set, Davenport broke Martinez to take a 5-3 lead.
To get the break point, Davenport had a winner that the linesman
called out, then changed the call to good. The umpire upheld the
change, even though Martinez may have been thrown off when the
linesman yelled out.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez threw down her racket and yelled at the umpire. From
that point, the match turned drastically to Davenport's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bizarre,'' Davenport said. ``The guy called it out and
changed it, and when that happens it's a judgment call for the
umpire. It was a big turning point. She got really upset then.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Martina Hingis recovered to beat No.7 Barbara Schett 6-7
(7-5), 6-3, 6-3. After the first set, Hingis controlled the match.
In the first set, Schett broke Hingis to take a 5-3 lead. But
Hingis battled to force a tiebreaker. There Schett took a 5-0 lead,
but again Hingis rallied, pulling to 6-5 before the Austrian won.
... Hingis will face a different style tonight against powerful
Serena Williams. Hingis beat Williams' older sister, Venus, in the
TIG Classic in San Diego. ``I beat Venus last week and consider her
toughest of the two,'' Hingis said. ``You have to take Serena very
serious, but she's not as consistent as Venus yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's matches:At noon, Davenport vs. Halard-Decugis,
Halard-Decugis/Mirjana Lucic vs. Larisa Neiland/Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario. ... At 7 p.m. Williams vs. Hingis, Lisa
Raymond/Rennae Stubbs vs. Winner of Ines Gorrochategui/Elena
Tatarkova Kimberly Po/Anne-Gaelle Sidot.

   FOXBOROUGH _ To rework a phrase from the old Brooklyn Dodgers,
``Wait till next week!''
</P>
<P>
   That's all you can really say about the Patriots' performance
Friday night against the Washington Redskins. The score is
unimportant (although for the record it was 20-14 Washington, 20-0
at halftime). The game itself was unimportant as well because the
starters came out in relatively the same state of health that they
went into it, which is always a victory at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   So the only thing that bears watching is that the run defense
that had been an anchor of New England's system last year was
dreadful, allowing the Redskins to rush for 5.8 yards a carry in
the first half and for 127 yards (6.4 a carry) by the end of the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Too often New England's young defensive tackles failed to
protect the linebackers behind them, allowing the Redskins line to
fire out and bury Andy Katzenmoyer and Tedy Bruschi. At times they
were all but defenseless to do much about it when the ballcarrier
passed by them because they were attached to an offensive lineman
the way a bumper is to the grill of an Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer in particular often seemed lost, but how else was he
supposed to look? After spending two minicamps and the first two
weeks of training camp working to master the ``plugger'' position,
Todd Collins's old spot, he was suddenly thrust into Ted Johnson's
middle linebacker position this week and asked to compensate for
the loss of the team's best tackler. He did not do well. No one
should have been surprised by that.
</P>
<P>
   So what is important is not this steamy night or the performance
of the Patriots' defense. What will be important is next weekend's
steamy night and the defense's performance in the season's second
meaningless game because one thing about that game will have
meaning regardless of what else happens _ the progress, or lack
thereof, of the run defense.
</P>
<P>
   For that to improve, other things must happen as well. Will the
mistakes be decreased? Will people line up in the right place more
often than they did Friday night when, quite frankly, they too
often did not? Will the defensive tackles do a better job
protecting the linebackers, and will those linebackers all get into
position to make plays as a coordinated unit, which they did not do
often enough against the Redskins?
</P>
<P>
   If they do these things better next Saturday than they did on
Friday the 13th, what happened Friday night can be forgotten by
Patriot fans. But if the Cowboys come in and average six yards a
carry after a week spent working on how to prevent that, then it's
time to worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to do better against the run,'' said Bruschi, who
has replaced Collins at outside linebacker. ``If we don't, it'll be
a long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to point to Ted Johnson not being there as the
problem, I'll point to that, too, but he's not going to be back
there for a while so we've got to buck up regardless. But before we
throw a panic fit, let's see if we can improve against Dallas. I
think we'll improve. If we don't, then you can say we've got a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it was not a good start Friday night because the
defense that was the strength of the Patriots the past few years
had a hole in the heart of it. It was a hole that made the Grand
Canyon look like a pothole.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, it is a given that you have to be strong up the
middle to win. Catcher, pitcher, shortstop, center field. That's a
key to victory in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   So what if you try to play football with rookies at running
back, center, middle linebacker, and, for all intents and purposes,
safety?
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, it wasn't strong enough. Not strong enough to
survive for long in the most competitive division in the AFC, the
East, where four teams made the playoffs a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots didn't run well enough when they had the ball. And
the Redskins didn't just run through the middle of New England's
defense _they floated through it, often without being touched until
their backs were well past the line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   But there were acceptable reasons for the defensive problems, at
least on this night.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Chad Eaton played sparingly, and Brandon
Mitchell played with a broken hand wrapped in a huge cast that made
it near impossible for him to defend himself let alone protect
Katzenmoyer behind him. An assortment of other linemen were rolled
in and out so often that mistakes were almost guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, head coach Pete Carroll made clear his disappointment
when he said, ``I know some of you are waiting for me to find
something positive in this game tonight, but we're not talking
about that right now,'' Carroll said. ``The first half was a
classic screw-up. I was really disappointed with the first three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first three quarters we couldn't get them down (tackle
them). A lot of it was fundamental defense. We play run defense
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   What Carroll didn't say _ because he didn't have to _ was that
they didn't play run defense Friday night. Not when you give up 149
yards on 30 carries, a 5-yard average, to a team that was 19th in
the NFL in rushing a year ago at a time when your own running game
was sadly already in midseason form _ rushing for only 3.4 yards a
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the run defense) felt soft,'' Carroll said. ``We were not
close enough to the inside gaps. It was poor run defense.''
</P>
<P>
   It was. No one can argue otherwise. But as Bruschi correctly
pointed out, it was the first game, and the defense basically had
not really tackled anyone since last January, in a playoff loss to
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they have gone through the motions of hitting but
done little of it. That is how it is in training camp, when
throwing your teammates on the ground is usually frowned upon
except during goal-line drills.
</P>
<P>
   So let us reserve judgment for seven more days, difficult as
that will be for the denizens of talk radio. There was a problem in
the heart of the Patriot defense Friday night. It was an obvious
problem born from the absence of Johnson, Collins, and Willie Clay
_ who are gone and won't be back _ and from the absence of Willie
McGinest and Henry Thomas _ who were held out for precautionary
reasons and soon will be back.
</P>
<P>
   When the missing are present and Katzenmoyer has a few more
weeks to figure out where to stand and where to go after the ball
is snapped and those defensive tackles remember how to protect the
linebackers behind them, the picture will be clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Until then it might be wise to shop for some worry beads before
there's a run on them. But don't start using them yet. Wait till
next week, and let's see what happens with the Cowboys.

CASTOFFS BUCK SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Michael Holley  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am taking a break from a protest to write this. And when I
resume my defiant stand, I think you should join me. I'll even give
you your own sign and let you have ample shouting time on my
official, boycott megaphone.
</P>
<P>
   My issue is that I no longer believe in baseball's system. I
think there are too many scouts who spend millions of dollars on
evaluating talent, even if they don't know what they're watching. I
do not believe that the best players will immediately be given a
fair chance to perform. I do believe that there are players who
have subtle skills that the current system cannot recognize.
</P>
<P>
   I could go on. Instead, let me introduce you to three Red Sox.
Their names are Brian Daubach, Troy O'Leary, and Darren Lewis. The
system doesn't understand them. If they hadn't been at Fenway Park
Friday night, the Sox wouldn't have beaten up on the sad Seattle
Mariners, 11-6. And they certainly wouldn't have their slim,
half-game lead over the Toronto Blue Jays for the American League
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   This is why I protest: If the system had its way, Daubach would
be in Japan right now; O'Leary would be somewhere in California
wondering why the Milwaukee Brewers released him; and Lewis still
might be thinking why the San Francisco Giants traded him to
Cincinnati for a football player named Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Do you mind holding this ``Free Daubach!'' placard for me?
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the 27-year-old rookie first baseman was 3 for 5
with 5 RBIs. He hit his 18th home run of the season and fifth in
his last six games. He will receive several votes for AL Rookie of
the Year. But after having the best season of his career last
season in Triple A, the Florida Marlins released him. Some guys are
released for hitting .216. Daubach was released for hitting .316
with 35 homers and 124 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I wasn't very good,'' Daubach said of his time in
Charlotte. He was still wearing his uniform when he spoke. The
front of it was covered with infield mud. That came when he tried
to turn a fifth-inning double into a triple, doing a belly slide
into third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad baserunning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. But there is no doubt Daubach is an above-average
hitter. I didn't spend a dime on scouting last season and I can see
that. You mean to tell me that neither the Mets nor Marlins could
figure that out? Daubach said he was close to going to Japan when
Sox general manager Dan Duquette invited him to spring training.
Now he is close to receiving a plaque for first-year excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy to be here,'' he said. ``I'm probably too old
to win Rookie of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, anybody want to buy a ``Put Your Money on Yummy'' T-shirt?
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary sits across from Daubach. His teammates call him
``Yummy.'' The Brewers didn't think Yummy could hit for power. They
also doubted that he could have success against lefthanders. Friday
night, Yummy had a three-run triple in the seventh that broke a 6-6
tie. He hit it off a mysterious lefty named Jeff Fassero. A couple
of years ago, Fassero was a valued member of baseball's system. He
won 15 games and was a No. 2 starter, behind Randy Johnson. Now, he
has something in common with former Patriots cornerback Chris
Canty. That is, he gives up 6s and 7s. His earned run average is
7.11.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two at-bats, O'Leary appeared to be overmatched.
After Fassero intentionally walked Nomar Garciaparra to load the
bases, O'Leary connected with one of his pitches and sent it down
the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let Troy win the game tonight,'' Daubach said. ``That was a
big hit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary now has a career-high 14-game hitting streak, which
shouldn't surprise the Brewers. If they look at their archives,
they will see that the left fielder hit .334 and .329 in the
minors. If he continues his current pace, he will finish with 100
RBIs for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, brother, would you like to wave this ``D-Lew'' Flag?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Sox went into the ninth with an 11-6 lead, the
33,653 fans in the park were nervous. Tim Wakefield, a natural
starter, was on the mound trying to be a closer. He got two outs in
the inning, but he also loaded the bases. Raul Ibanez threatened to
make things interesting when he blasted a Wakefield pitch to deep
center field. If it had dropped, three runs would have scored and
Ibanez could have been on third.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped in the glove of Lewis. He stops several balls from
dropping. Friday night, he ended the play by crashing into the
center-field fence and falling on his backside, glove extended in
the air. That's what the man known as D-Lew does. But we live in a
baseball era where hitting home runs receives more attention than
preventing runs.
</P>
<P>
   Some Sox observers say Lewis is one of the smartest men on the
team. During the offseason, he takes classes at Cal-Berkley. He
loves to read. He also likes preparing for endings such as Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   And so I protest. I am now a baseball anarchist. The system has
failed us. But if the system failures continue for the Sox, they'll
be in the playoffs.

MONDESI BOOED IN DODGERS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If Raul Mondesi thought fans would love him for
doing what they might want to do _ cuss out his employers and get
away with it _ he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after unloading on manager Davey Johnson and general
manager Kevin Malone in a profanity-laced tirade, Mondesi returned
to Dodger Stadium for the first time Friday night and was loudly
booed each time he batted in a 7-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 40,353, most of which have been supportive during
Mondesi's turbulent season, sounded like they are hoping the Los
Angeles Dodgers right-fielder gets his wish to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Johnson said he considers the incident closed
and hopes Mondesi, who did not speak Friday, can rebound to finish
the season on a high note. Malone, however, said Mondesi's words
still sting and hopes to receive a personal apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a formal apology and that was important,'' Malone
said. ``In time, you will forget. We all love Mondy.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who fined but did not suspend Mondesi, said he has no
immediate plans for a trade, but did not rule anything out in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new situation,'' Malone said. ``I think we will do
what is in the best interest of the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone had nothing but praise for left fielder Gary Sheffield,
who said he wants out if the Dodgers don't make significant changes
during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he wants to do is win,'' Malone said. ``He always has put
the team first in everything he has done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Malone conceded that will be difficult with many of his
underachieving veterans locked up in multi-year contracts. Mondesi
still is owed $20.5 million for the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has said he will drop his no-trade clause, was
paid $7.5 million to waive the no-trade clause last May when he was
sent to the Dodgers in the Mike Piazza deal. Sheffield still has
four years left on his contract worth $39.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the game today, teams place a high value on young talent,''
he said. ``They are not likely to give up young talent for veterans
with long contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the boos, Mondesi played little role in Friday's
loss, which was just the Dodgers second in the last seven games. He
struck out in the second, flied to deep center in the fourth and
grounded to third in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's final at-bat came with one out in the ninth against
former Dodger teammate Rudy Seanez. He singled to center and
received a smattering of cheers along with the boos. He later
scored Dodger final run.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi initially was charged with an error in the Braves'
four-run fourth inning when his throw back to the infield on Bret
Boone's RBI double sailed past shortstop Mark Grudzielanek and
allowed Gerald Williams to score.
</P>
<P>
   But the call was changed when replays showed Mondesi actually
made an accurate throw to second, but Grudzielanek was grossly out
of position.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention in the game went to Dodgers starter Darren
Dreifort, who was coming off an impressive 10-4 victory over the
New York Mets. Dreifort (9-12), attempting to keep his spot in the
rotation for next year, did not have the control problems that
plagued him most of the season, but he was hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed five runs and nine hits in the first four innings,
including the first of two homers by Chipper Jones and two-run
double by Boone in the fourth. Dreifort opened the fourth by
allowing three consecutive hits.
</P>
<P>
   After a sacrifice bunt by Braves starter Kevin Millwood (13-7),
Williams lined a two-run single past Eric Young, who came off the
disabled list (left ankle) before Friday's game. Boone's double
made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on Dreifort had been his inability to pitch late into
games. In this one he settled down after the fourth and retired the
next eight batters until Boone walked to open the seventh and Jones
crushed a 2-0 fastball over the center-field fence. It was the
fifth multi-home run of Jones' career and fourth this season. He
now has 31 homers.
</P>
<P>
   When Brian Jordan, who stared down Dreifort after he was hit by
a pitch in the third, followed Jones with a single, Dreifort was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the things we will be watching the rest of the
way,'' manager Davey Johnson said. ``He needs to go deeper into
games.''

TRAVIS REED TRANSFERS TO LONG BEACH STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing fifth graph) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former UCLA basketball player Travis Reed said
Friday he has decided to attend Long Beach State rather than
Oklahoma, ending a summer of speculation where he'd wind up.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-8 forward will become eligible to play for the 49ers
in the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach State is closer to home,'' Reed said, explaining
the decision he's been mulling most of the summer. ``I also have a
family situation to take care of, and I couldn't do that back there
(in Oklahoma).''
</P>
<P>
   Reed previously signed financial-aid agreements with Long Beach
State and Oklahoma, though neither was binding. Reed said he will
be on the Long Beach State campus for the beginning of school
Aug.30.
</P>
<P>
   Reed had committed to the 49ers while he was at Fontana's A.B.
Miller High, then changed his mind and ended up at UCLA, where he
played for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA had always been a dream of mine,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   So, why transfer now from UCLA to Long Beach State?
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for me to get to the next level I have to play my
total game,'' Reed said. ``I wasn't playing my total game at UCLA.
At Long Beach State, I believe I'll be able to show my skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he sees no problem switching from the fast-paced
Pac-10 Conference to the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pac-10 is a fast conference, probably the fastest
conference in the country,'' Reed said. ``The Big West will be a
change. But there are good teams and good players in the Big West.
Players do get drafted out of the Big West.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the idea of playing for Coach Wayne Morgan and
assistant Tom Lewis, who has been recruiting Reed since his high
school days, is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting,'' Reed said. ``They're two great coaches
on the way up.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Reed played in 27 games his freshman year, 31 games
last season, altogether starting just seven. He averaged 4.0 points
per game as a freshman, 5.4 points as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's transferring, Reed must redshirt the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be that tough,'' Reed said. ``In the Olympics, they
train four years for one event, right? The year will go by fast.''

   JAPAN-CHILD-ABUSE (Tokyo) _ Authorities in Japan are beginning
to face up to the ugly challenges of family violence and child
abuse, problems that have been so clandestine that most Japanese
believed they existed only in the West. By Sheryl WuDunn.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-DAGESTAN (Moscow) _ Russia has carried out its threat to
bomb guerrilla bases inside Chechnya, widening its war against the
Islamic rebels in the North Caucuses, a spokesman for Russia's
Interior Ministry said Saturday. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CLAMPDOWN (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ International
peacekeepers in Kosovo are clamping down hard on the Kosovo

   BONN-BONVOYAGE (Bonn, Germany) _ After half a century when this
modest city on the Rhine was a government center, years when
Germany was stabilized and the cold war ultimately won, the United
States is leaving town. Behind the trucks headed for Berlin lies
the sprawling evidence of a vast mission that symbolized America's
assumption of great-power commitments in the postwar years. By
Roger Cohen. (With a map.)

   RWANDA-DEPORT _ Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Rwandan under

   SPAIN-BASQUES (Bilbao, Spain) _ Like the peace talks in Ireland

   PERU-ECUADOR (Lima, Peru) _ As recently as one year ago, Peru
and Ecuador were preparing to go to war _ something they have done
with unfortunate regularity ever since the Peruvian Navy blockaded
Ecuador's principal port in 1860. But in a sign that the squabbling
neighbors are inally learning to live together, President Jamil
Mahuad of Ecuador completed a three-day, whirlwind visit through
Peru on Friday. By Clifford Krauss. (With a map.)

Laurie Goodstein. (With a photo.)

<P>
   CUBAN-SPY (Miami) _ To Ana Margarita Martinez, an avowed
anti-Communist Cuban-American, the dashing young jet pilot seemed
to have dropped from heaven. Juan Pablo Roque, a disenchanted
officer in the Cuban air force, escaped the Communist-controlled
island by swimming to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in
February 1992. The two later married. Then in 1996, Roque, who was
really a Cuban spy, returned home. Now Ms. Martinez is suing the
Cuban government for sexual battery. By Rick Bragg.

   BOSTON-COLLEGE-FEMINIST (Boston) _ For nigh on 20 years, Mary

   COLUMBINE-REOPEN (Littleton, Colo.) _ Inside Columbine High
School, where two teen-agers shot and killed a dozen other students
and a teacher last April 20, the library, where much of the mayhem
occurred, has disappeared. When students return to classes on
Monday for a new school year, not quite four months after the chaos
ended with the young gunmen turning their weapons on themselves,
Columbine faces the rather daunting challenge of seeking normalcy
in a place that could never be the same after what happened there.

<P>
   RENO-PARKINSONS (Washington) _ As an advocate for people with
Parkinson's disease, Joan Samuelson has pounded on many a Capitol
Hill door trying to increase financing for research into the
incurable disorder. In August 1996, she found herself with a rare
opportunity to make her pitch to a member of the Clinton Cabinet:
Attorney General Janet Reno, a fellow Parkinson's sufferer. But any
illusion the advocate may have had about enlisting the nation's
highest law-enforcement officer in her cause was quickly dispelled.
``She didn't feel she should make Parkinson's a part of her public
agenda,'' Samuelson said. Three years later, Reno has little
choice. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg.
</P>
<P>
   PHONE-INTERNET-FEE (Washington) _ Two years ago, when the
government imposed a new fee on long-distance telephone companies
to raise money for Internet connections at schools and libraries,
the reaction from some quarters was ferocious. But the program,
officially called the e-rate, has proved to be so popular that even
the harshest critics now agree that further complaints are futile.

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Out of gas, out of money and 200 miles from
home, Roland Pahland had good reasons to regret his passion for
seeing a solar eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   He had battled traffic jams for nine hours driving south from
Hannover to Stuttgart to get directly in the eclipse's path
Wednesday. When he got there, rain clouds blocked his view and that
of hundreds of thousands of others. Now, having failed to calculate
how much gas he would burn sitting in traffic, Pahland, an
unemployed truck driver, was drumming up donations by singing
country-and-western songs at a highway rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all that, he spoke with wide-eyed wonder about watching
the sky turn dark and then light again. ``This was a
once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' he said. ``We didn't get to see
the corona of the eclipse, but we did see the sky become totally
dark and then suddenly turn light two minutes later. I will never
forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eclipses do that to people. Millions of Europeans drove for
hours, just for the chance to put on paper glasses with blackened
lenses and gape at an event that lasted two-and-a-half minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was something wondrous about the wonder itself. Between
horrible weather and ghastly traffic in much of Europe, it was as
if the Grinch had tried to steal the eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   German autobahns were clogged all day with more than 200 miles
of traffic jams. Yet there were few signs of bitterness or
frustration. Even though they woke up to warnings of both bad
weather and bad traffic, thousands of people decided they simply
had to take a chance to witness the event, which won't repeat
itself in the area until 2081.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, which was almost directly in the path of the eclipse,
traffic stopped almost entirely and office workers poured into the
streets. Trading came to a near halt at stock exchanges in
Frankfurt, Paris and other cities. In Rome, Pope John Paul II
shortened his weekly general audience in order to watch the
eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans drove as close as they could to the eclipse's path,
then parked along shoulders of the autobahn or at gas stations and
rest areas. Parking areas became picnic spots. Astronomy buffs
compared notes on their solar-shielded cameras and telescopes.
Strangers shared their spectacles, which had become all but
impossible to buy by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And as the moon slowly crept in front of the sun, novices and
experts alike grew quieter and more reverent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had the feeling that people had put everything behind them
for the two minutes when it was happening,'' said Marcel Wenderoth,
23, a hotel receptionist who decided Tuesday night to drive with
his wife and 2-year-old son several hours from Dortmund. ``It was
euphoric.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Is Russian President Boris Yeltsin crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a lame-duck president _ whose zombie-like public
appearances reinforce fears about his state of mind _ suddenly
jettison his latest prime minister, his fourth in 17 months, and
name as his political heir an unknown KGB officer who has no
political party, no popular support and the charisma of a
well-mannered Doberman Pincer?
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as the Mad Czar theory may be, there are other
explanations for Yeltsin's latest gyrations that may be even more
disturbing. According to those who know him well, Yeltsin probably
has a plan, possibly a flawed plan, which like most of his plans
has to do with holding on to as much power as he can, for as long
as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister and preferred
successor last week, Yeltsin signaled that he is not going to sit
by idly while his opponents, either on the left (the Communists) or
those in the political center sweep up the remnants of his tattered
authority, and claim it as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who for months now
has been in the Kremlin's ``enemies'' camp, formed a coalition with
a handful of autocratic governors, which perhaps, and most
importantly, may be joined this week by former Prime Minister
Yevgeni Primakov, Russia's most popular political figure.
</P>
<P>
   In dumping former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, the president
apparently decided that the mild-mannered 47-year-old former
commissioner lacked the gumption to tackle opponents like Luzhkov.
The 68-year-old president also stated firmly that he intends to
leave office in July 2000, as the Russian constitution requires him
to do at the end of his second term.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians believe him. But in a sign of their deep distrust
of their willful and capricious president, many others are not
convinced, fearing, for instance, a declaration of a state of
emergency or some other series of events that could disrupt the
first constitutional transfer of power in Russian history.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do many Russians necessarily believe that Putin, 46, will
still be Yeltsin's preferred choice as a successor by the time the
presidential elections roll around, several months after December's
parliamentary elections. Russian politics are littered with men
who, at one time or another, held the mantle that has now been
bestowed on Putin.
</P>
<P>
   One ace up Yeltsin's sleeve could be, oddly enough, Sergei
Stepashin, who served as prime minister for 82 days, and who last
week passed the ultimate test of loyalty: In an emotional
appearance before his Cabinet, Stepashin thanked the man who had
just fired him. Now courted by center-right parties still friendly
to the Kremlin, Stepashin may end up with the covert backing of the
Yeltsin entourage and as a bonus, a popular image as a man wronged
by an erratic czar.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin is determined to keep his hand in the elaborate
chess game that is Russian politics. His latest move was described
by one analyst as ``castling,'' where the king and castle swap
places. ``Yeltsin is very good at grasping the political
situation,'' said Gavril Popov, a former Moscow mayor and a
one-time Yeltsin ally in Russia's early democratic movement, in the
weekly newspaper Argumenti I Facti last week. ``He finds a decisive
solution which his administration cannot. The level of his physical
incapacities should never be overestimated.''
</P>
<P>
   In Putin, Yeltsin will have a loyal servant _ and a recent boss
of Russia's domestic intelligence service at that _ who will be
more ready than his predecessor to pull the kind of levers of power
that might make even Russia's most brazen regional bosses, an
increasingly independent lot, think twice. Often portrayed as the
kingmakers in the coming elections, they are still sensitive to the
granting of funds and the release of compromising information _
tools at the Kremlin's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bald use of power does not contradict the widely held
view that Yeltsin's influence as a political leader is almost
exhausted. Nor does it discount the fact that his team of advisers
has now shrunk to the size of a ``family'' _ the term used to refer
to the small circle of Kremlin insiders that includes his staff,
his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko and a smattering of power-hungry
oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   But power is a tangible commodity in Russia, used every day, in
many ways across the society _ in the way bosses belittle their
subordinates, in the way petty bureaucrats grant or withhold
meetings and signatures, in the way traffic police browbeat drivers
to cough up ``fines'' for tenuous violations. And Yeltsin, who has
used up advisers and staff like Kleenex, understands this better
than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's young, imperfect democracy has no system of checks and
balances. As in the days of the czars and commissars, if you lose
power, someone else will grab it. Power-sharing is only on the
winner's terms.
</P>
<P>
   When Luzhkov teamed up with the governors, analysts dubbed the
alliance Russia's new ``party of power'' _ a label pinned on ``Our
Home Is Russia,'' a political party formed in 1995 by Yeltsin's
prime minister, Victor Chernomyrdin, in reality the home of the
then-dominant political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a phrase from the old Soviet propaganda machine, it is
no accident that Yeltsin fired Stepashin after the alliance was
forged Aug. 4, making his prime minister the scapegoat for failing
to stop a bandwagon threatening to slip out of the Kremlin's
control. By numerous accounts, Yeltsin tried to fire him Aug. 5 but
was dissuaded _ by his longtime adviser, the reformer Anatoly
Chubais, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday the president made his choice.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Is Russian President Boris Yeltsin crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Why else would a lame-duck president _ whose zombie-like public
appearances reinforce fears about his state of mind _ suddenly
jettison his latest prime minister, his fourth in 17 months, and
name as his political heir an unknown KGB officer who has no
political party, no popular support and the charisma of a
well-mannered Doberman Pincer?
</P>
<P>
   As tempting as the Mad Czar theory may be, there are other
explanations for Yeltsin's latest gyrations that may be even more
disturbing. According to those who know him well, Yeltsin probably
has a plan, possibly a flawed plan, which like most of his plans
has to do with holding on to as much power as he can, for as long
as he can.
</P>
<P>
   In naming Vladimir Putin as his new prime minister and preferred
successor last week, Yeltsin signaled that he is not going to sit
by idly while his opponents, either on the left (the Communists) or
those in the political center sweep up the remnants of his tattered
authority, and claim it as their own.

HUNTING FOR THAT ELUSIVE SURPLUS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert went to a nuts and
bolts factory outside Chicago last week and waved four $1 bills in
the air. The money was supposed to represent a trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the surplus,'' he said, and then promised to give
three of the dollars back to Americans in the form of a whopping
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the surplus right now is as real as a $3 bill. This year was
supposed to bring the first surplus in three decades. But when
Congress comes back from vacation in September, a ritual dance
around this pot of money will resume. And when the dance is done,
the pot will be empty. Its fate does not augur well for the
21st-century surpluses that are supposed to underwrite the
Republican tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   The tussle over the public treasure is shaping up as a war.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, the conservative major domo, said in
an interview last week that draining the surplus was a deliberate
strategy designed to force President Clinton to submit to the
Republicans' political will.
</P>
<P>
   He said the president had three choices. One: get down ``on his
knees'' and sign the spending bills the Republicans are writing,
which cut or kill many of Clinton's favorite programs. Two: raid
another pot of money, the sacrosanct Social Security surplus, to
restore those cuts. Three: shut down the government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded: ``I can think of nothing more cynical or
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the White House play chicken, and Republicans
and Democrats vie for advantage in next year's elections, this will
be one of the only serious political games in town next month.
``Both sides are just maneuvering, and we throw an occasional stone
at each other,'' said Jim Dyer, staff director of the House
Appropriations Committee, where the spending bills originate.
``Frankly, it's just a terrible way to do business.''
</P>
<P>
   With the future of the U.S. economy, control of the Congress and
the next presidency at stake, each side is accusing the other of
bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   First, Clinton submitted a budget balanced with theoretical
money, like $10 billion in proposed new cigarette taxes. The
Republicans, who would sooner publicly convert to paganism than
pass such a tax, wrote their own version of a budget balanced with
more theoretical money, mainly cuts in domestic programs so deep
that Congress would never approve them.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the only rule that both sides are supposed to play by
in this game is the 1997 law that imposed spending limits, or caps,
on Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the game now is how to evade the caps. Congress has
dug deep into a bag of tricks that Stan Collender, the managing
director of the Federal Budget Consulting Group at
Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm, called ``the biggest
collection of budget gimmicks ever put together in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   First, they're calling anything that moves an emergency,'' said
Collender, whose job is explaining government spending to corporate
clients. This allows Congress to dip into the projected $14 billion
surplus. So far, the emergencies include $4.5 billion for the 2000
census and $7.4 billion in farm subsidies. The Republicans also set
aside $4.5 billion to finance the first year of their tax cut. Do
the math: no more surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you have directed score keeping,'' Collender said,
``which is essentially lying about the numbers, playing with
accounting.'' This maneuver, by some lights, created the $14
billion surplus in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there's forward funding,'' he said, ``maybe $12 billion
this year, which is borrowing from a future year.'' This is the
government's equivalent of Popeye's pal Wimpy saying he will gladly
pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up, Collender said, and the Republicans will spend
``about $30 billion more than they're saying they will spend,''
while claiming they are keeping the caps on tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't live with the caps,'' the White House budget
director, Jacob J. Lew, said in an interview. ``They're having to
do ridiculous kinds of things to keep the process moving along.
We're clearly headed toward some difficult days.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress left town with 11 of this year's 13 spending bills
incomplete. Clinton has threatened to veto 7 of them over
Republican cuts. After Labor Day, 16 working days remain for
Congress before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no budget by then, the Republicans and the president
are going to have to cut a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will negotiate with the president, after he vetoes the
bills, on his knees,'' DeLay said, daring him to raid Social
Security funds or risk a government shutdown. This could prove
either a brilliant ploy or a paralyzing blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``It's kind of cynical,'' said Lew. ``They're going
to have to decide whether they want to create a sense of mounting
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision seems to have been made. If there is no deal by
Oct. 1, DeLay said, Congress can pass a ``continuing resolution''
that essentially finances the government at this year's levels.
Clinton can give up and sign it. Or he can unleash a political
nuclear weapon and veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Then the government shuts down _ or, as DeLay put it, ``the
president will have shut down the government.'' The last time that
happened, in 1995, the Republicans took the blame, and lost
congressional seats all over the country in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look forward to this,'' said Dyer. ``It's really hard
to figure how this plays out in September.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For as long as anyone here can remember, the
common response to being pulled over for a traffic violation has
been to slip a few pesos to the police officer and watch him
quietly walk away, case closed.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a new police chief in town, Alejandro Gertz
Manero, a former university rector, and he is surprising everyone
by seriously going after corruption in the sprawling capital as
well as its out-of-control crime.
</P>
<P>
   After firing 120 unit commanders and 1,000 officers in his force
of 37,000, Gertz has turned to the 900 men in the traffic squad
who, by all accounts, have been nicely supplementing their
$400-a-month salaries with a kind of bribe that is so endemic hat
it has become a part of the language: the mordida, or bite.
</P>
<P>
   For help, Gertz has turned to female officers, who make up five
percent of his force. To the sputtering outrage of the 900 male
traffic officers, Gertz has taken away their lucrative
ticket-writing authority and handed over their pens and pads to 64
women. The reason was simple, Gertz said: ``I trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for the men and not so great for Mexican
feminists, Gertz has created teams of two women, and four men. The
women, sharing a squad car, are in charge, and only they can write
tickets _ for anything from double-parking to speeding. One of the
duties of the men, who follow along on motorcycles and in other
vehicles, is to act as bodyguards for the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to protect the women in case something rough
happens,'' Gertz said. And he likes the team approach, he said,
because ``it's very difficult to bribe a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertz, 59, has no illusion that women are fundamentally immune
to corruption. He, of course, has heard accounts of the corruption
of women like Imelda Marcos in the Philippines and Benazir Bhutto
in Pakistan. Still, he says, ``You very seldom have any corruption
problems with women in Mexico.'' But the relative purity of Mexican
women may have more to do with lack of opportunity than moral
superiority. ``Women traditionally have not been in positions of
power,'' said Lucia Lagunes, the head of the nonprofit Women's
Communication and Information group here. And therefore, she says,
``We are not accustomed to corrupt practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as Francisca Reyes Castellanos sees it, Mexican women
can be every bit as corrupt as their male counterparts. ``I don
think it's a problem of gender,'' said Ms. Reyes, who is the
president of the National Union of Women, a legal rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But she adds, ``Of course it is easier to communicate with a
woman than with a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, Gertz says, is very much what he had in mind. ``We are
trying to regain the confidence of the people,'' he said in an
interview. ``And I think it will be easier for women to get closer
to the people. In Mexico we see women as more gentle, more
polite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious,'' he said. ``If a group of men has been
perceived for so many years as being corrupt, and you don't have
that perception of corruption among women in the police force, why
not give them a chance?''
</P>
<P>
   So far only the displaced men are complaining. And, Gertz says,
no wonder. ``They're protesting because their income has been
cut,'' he said. As Ms. Reyes sees it, Gertz is ``making a great
effort to improve the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women on the traffic detail are young, in their 20s
and 30s. Some Mexicans say male officers are more susceptible to
bribes because they are more often the main breadwinner in a
family. But Gertz said that had not figured into his enlisting the
women.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the women will turn out much differently than the men is
a matter of speculation. ``This is really about wage-earning
power,'' said Federico Estevez, a political science professor.
``Strictly in terms of numbers, women have been edged out of the
market for bribes. But now these women are being given a monopoly.
They are the only ones who can write tickets. Are you kidding?
They're being handed a gold mine.''
</P>
<P>
   And they are not likely to face less temptation. ``Drivers like
the system the way it has been,'' said Estevez. ``It's cheaper and
doesn't take as much time.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine for speeding, for example, is about 500 pesos, roughly
$55. Often, the mordida can be as little as 20 pesos, or about $2,
depending on how prosperous the driver looks.
</P>
<P>
   Even with bribes commonplace, Gertz said, the police wrote 1.6
million traffic tickets in 1997, the latest year with full data.
With the much smaller force, ticket-writing has plunged 75 percent.
But, Gertz said, the women are being much more productive.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, he said, volume is not so important. In 1997, he
said, only 10 percent of those who were given tickets bothered to
pay them. ``People just ignored them,'' he said.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For as long as anyone here can remember, the
common response to being pulled over for a traffic violation has
been to slip a few pesos to the police officer and watch him
quietly walk away, case closed.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a new police chief in town, Alejandro Gertz
Manero, a former university rector, and he is surprising everyone
by seriously going after corruption in the sprawling capital as
well as its out-of-control crime.
</P>
<P>
   After firing 120 unit commanders and 1,000 officers in his force
of 37,000, Gertz has turned to the 900 men in the traffic squad
who, by all accounts, have been nicely supplementing their
$400-a-month salaries with a kind of bribe that is so endemic hat
it has become a part of the language: the mordida, or bite.
</P>
<P>
   For help, Gertz has turned to female officers, who make up five
percent of his force. To the sputtering outrage of the 900 male
traffic officers, Gertz has taken away their lucrative
ticket-writing authority and handed over their pens and pads to 64
women. The reason was simple, Gertz said: ``I trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse for the men and not so great for Mexican
feminists, Gertz has created teams of two women, and four men. The
women, sharing a squad car, are in charge, and only they can write
tickets _ for anything from double-parking to speeding. One of the
duties of the men, who follow along on motorcycles and in other
vehicles, is to act as bodyguards for the women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to protect the women in case something rough
happens,'' Gertz said. And he likes the team approach, he said,
because ``it's very difficult to bribe a team.''

IT'S A FACT: FAITH AND THEORY COLLIDE OVER EVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by
special arrangement only. Asian and European points: contact Karl
Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

<P>
   Educators and scientists may find it shocking or merely tedious
that politicians are still fighting over whether evolution should
be taught in school. But those who champion scientific over
religious explanations might strengthen their case if they conceded
a point to the opposition: Since evolution is indeed a theory and
not a fact, it can be taught side by side with creationism. The
result would be a wider appreciation that creationism isn't even a
theory, and that what evolution's opponents consider its weakness
is actually its strength: Like all of science, it is based on
malleable human knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   When the Kansas Board of Education voted last week to discourage
the teaching of evolution and eliminate questions about the subject
from student evaluation tests, the rationale was familiar. Since no
one can rewind the universal clock and be present at creation, any
idea about how life began is, at best, informed speculation. Using
the same reasoning, the board also cut the Big Bang, cosmology's
unifying vision, from the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The implication was that, in Kansas, students will be considered
educated if they learn to accept only what is directly evident to
their senses or what they trust was observed by competent witnesses
_ with an exception made for what they believe because it is
decreed by their particular religion. Taken to the extreme, this
would eliminate not only the reigning theories of biology and
cosmology but almost all of science, including the atomic theory of
matter and the heliocentric model of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   The skewed view of science that won over the Kansas school board
is epitomized by the warning used in Alabama classrooms: ``This
textbook discusses evolution, a controversial theory some
scientists present as a scientific explanation for the origin of
living things, such as plants, animals and humans. No one was
present when life first appeared on Earth. Therefore, any statement
about life's origins should be considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sentence is false. Most scientists, by far, accept the
theory; the controversies are over details. But the second part of
the warning is undeniably true, and science would benefit if it
were more often presented this way.
</P>
<P>
   Science consists entirely of theories _ tentative, fluid
proposals based on people's best bets for how the world works. It
is because they are not set in stone that these ideas have a chance
of being nudged closer and closer toward describing reality, or
discarded in favor of something better. Last week, two days after
the Kansas school board decision, paleontologists published
evidence that may push back the appearance of complex life _ single
cells with nuclei _ by as much as a billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever setbacks like the one in Kansas occur, scientists leap
forth to point out the fallacy of the creationist position: There
is no compelling reason to single out the evolution of life or the
cosmos as being less than absolute. It would be just as sensible
for school boards to affix a warning inside physics books: ``No one
has directly observed the detailed substructure of matter.
Therefore, any statement about it being made of atoms should be
considered as theory, not fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the dynamic view of science doesn't come
across strongly enough in the classroom. For reasons of expediency,
scientific theories are presented as done deals. Little
appreciation is conveyed for the intellectual struggle that went
into interpreting the data or examining the assumptions _ always
open to question _ that lurk behind the experiments. Lost from most
explications is the exhilarating possibility that a theory that
seems undeniable today could be overturned tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   With science presented almost as though it were received wisdom,
it's little wonder that some legislators and school board members
confuse it with a competing religion, and misconstrue a religious
belief like creationism as an alternate scientific theory.
</P>
<P>
   They're encouraged to do so by a new wave of creationists who,
in an act of intellectual jujitsu, promote their belief in absolute
knowledge by invoking the relativistic arguments of post-modern
philosophy: While creationism is built on belief in a caring,
all-powerful, constantly intervening creator, who completed his
work just thousands of years ago, evolution has its own tenets of
faith. The most fundamental is the belief that the world consists
of insentient matter unfolding on its own over vast eons of time _
eons that can only be inferred from indirect evidence. One is still
free to believe in a deity, but it's not a necessary part of the
equations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other fundamentals of science is the doctrine of
uniformity, that the physical laws are the same now as they were in
the past. And this is closely related to another unprovable
assumption, Occam's razor: Given two explanations for a phenomenon,
the simpler one is more likely to be true. If one chooses to reject
these assumptions, then evidence taken to support evolution, like
radiocarbon dating, can be rearranged to support creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed this way, science may seem like just another religion _
based on things one chooses to believe because they seem deep down
to be true. But giving creationism equal time in the classroom
would undermine the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that it is possible, starting from naturalism or
supernaturalism, to draw different pictures of the world, which
one, the lesson plan could ask, seems more ad hoc, more a case of
special pleading? Can you envision evidence that would cause
science to support a much younger Earth? The answer is yes. It
would take very convincing data coming from many different
directions, but the mechanisms used to measure geological time are
not unshakable truths.
</P>
<P>
   Then the teacher could ask, Is there any conceivable experiment
that would cause creationists to accept a 4-billion-year-old planet
or the evolution of human life from a single-celled ancestor?
Maybe. But then it wouldn't be creationism anymore. For something
to be called a theory, it has to be falsifiable, capable of being
overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Students could also be taught the dangers that come when a
scientist mistakes a theory for eternal truth, shoring up flimsy
hypotheses by contorting the data. They could learn of cases in
which a religion flexibly adjusted its doctrines because of new
social realities, allowing, for example, homosexuals into the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, by giving creationism equal time with evolution,
students would see a powerfully subtle difference. Science is,
foremost, a method of interrogating reality _ proposing hypotheses
that seem true and then testing them; trying, almost perversely, to
negate them, and elevating only the handful that survive to the
status of a theory. Creationism is a doctrine, whose adherents are
interested only in seeking out data that support it.
</P>
<P>
   In making sense of the world, one is always free to start from
different assumptions. But part of a good education is learning
what you are trading off in the bargain.

<P>
   As this summer's drought hangs on like an unwanted guest at the
cottage, the cherished American pastime of lawn watering has been
criminalized by states desperate to change people's behavior and
save water.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared a state of
emergency Aug. 5, invoking extraordinary powers that threaten
people with fines up to $5,000 for disobeying water-use rules.
State Environmental Protection Commissioner Robert Shinn even
called on citizens to snitch on one another. ``We depend on
neighbors to monitor their neighbors because there aren't enough
police to do what we have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials also said more severe measures could be
imposed, including the monitoring of home water use.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions may be helping. New Jersey's water supply has
improved slightly since the emergency decree and with the help of
recent scattered thunderstorms. But a basic question remains: How
did this rap get pinned on the average citizen?
</P>
<P>
   After all, when a power blackout hit a big chunk of Manhattan
during July's heat wave, no one blamed apartment-dwellers for
running air conditioners. Instead, politicians denounced
Consolidated Edison for not planning better and investing more to
anticipate surges in demand.
</P>
<P>
   But during the current drought, virtually the only official
response has been to point a finger at homeowners and issue
emergency measures. While cutting back sharply on nonessential
water use makes obvious sense, some experts say state and local
governments and the news media have failed to recognize drought as
a complex set of phenomena that demand long-range regional planning
and hard decisions after the inevitable rains come and the
emergency decrees fade away.
</P>

   ``Government should have a greater role in planning for water
resources rather than just blaming people,'' said Wenonah Hauter,
the director of the Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project,
a Washington organization founded by Ralph Nader that lobbies for
better technological and political approaches to the use of energy
and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we're hearing is haphazard responses about
lawns,'' Hauter said, ``but there are longer-term issues such as
the effect of urban sprawl on water resources that government
should be paying attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans are willing to make sacrifices in crises. There is
widespread support, for example, for providing emergency relief to
the farm industry, which is exempt from most emergency water
restrictions. But there is often little public discussion about
emergency powers exercised by governors on matters like home water
use and lawn watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, there should be a more robust public debate about
how about government functions in a liberal democracy in times of
emergency _ especially about the amount of power that moves to the
central authority, whether in Trenton, Albany or Washington,'' said
Andrew Grossman, a political science professor at Albion College in
Albion, Mich., citing the potential for civil rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has set up a commission to study the
drought. But so far the government's chief response has been to
declare disaster emergencies in New Jersey, Connecticut, West
Virginia and parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia,
Kentucky, Ohio and New Mexico. These decrees provide federal
emergency subsidies to the farming industry, which has lost
billions of dollars in withered summer crops.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just food crops at stake. In New Jersey, for
example, the leading cash crop category is nursery, greenhouse and
lawn-sod products _ mainly decorative plants, shrubs and bushes
sold at garden centers for home use _ which accounted for $255
million in sales last year. So while homeowners are restricted in
watering their shrubs and plants, farmers are able to continue
producing such plants for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Even with their beloved lawns, Americans have shown a
willingness to voluntarily reduce water use without the threat of
criminal prosecution, said Professor Gordon Geballe, an associate
dean of the Yale University School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies. ``In the New Haven area, there are a large number of lawns
that are brown, and we don't have a water shortage yet,'' he said,
noting that lawns account for about 30 percent of water use in
metropolitan regions.
</P>
<P>
   Geballe said some people are reappraising the real costs of
their emerald-green expanses of grass _ and are adjusting their
behavior to ``escape the lawn-must-always-be-green addiction'' in
favor of an ``ecological approach'' that takes into account both a
lawn's use of water and the contribution that lawn mowers make to
carbon dioxide emissions, which may contribute to climatic
phenomena like drought.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plant experts say there is a practical way to
mitigate future droughts without the threat of criminal
prosecution. Karen Snetselaar, a professor of biology at St.
Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said the overwatering of grass
and plants encourages them to keep their roots close to the soil
surface, where they are most vulnerable during droughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to water every day,'' she said, ``and most of the
time that's the wrong thing to do, unless you are trying to get
seeds to germinate or when you have very young plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, by watering grass, shrubs and plants no more than once
a week the plants will modify their behavior and ``send their roots
farther down in the soil,'' she said. ``That way, when it doesn't
rain for a while, the plants have extensive root systems and
they're OK for a longer period the next time there's a drought.''

<P>
   As this summer's drought hangs on like an unwanted guest at the
cottage, the cherished American pastime of lawn watering has been
criminalized by states desperate to change people's behavior and
save water.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman declared a state of
emergency Aug. 5, invoking extraordinary powers that threaten
people with fines up to $5,000 for disobeying water-use rules.
State Environmental Protection Commissioner Robert Shinn even
called on citizens to snitch on one another. ``We depend on
neighbors to monitor their neighbors because there aren't enough
police to do what we have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials also said more severe measures could be
imposed, including the monitoring of home water use.
</P>
<P>
   The restrictions may be helping. New Jersey's water supply has
improved slightly since the emergency decree and with the help of
recent scattered thunderstorms. But a basic question remains: How
did this rap get pinned on the average citizen?
</P>
<P>
   After all, when a power blackout hit a big chunk of Manhattan
during July's heat wave, no one blamed apartment-dwellers for
running air conditioners. Instead, politicians denounced
Consolidated Edison for not planning better and investing more to
anticipate surges in demand.
</P>
<P>
   But during the current drought, virtually the only official
response has been to point a finger at homeowners and issue
emergency measures. While cutting back sharply on nonessential
water use makes obvious sense, some experts say state and local
governments and the news media have failed to recognize drought as
a complex set of phenomena that demand long-range regional planning
and hard decisions after the inevitable rains come and the
emergency decrees fade away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government should have a greater role in planning for water
resources rather than just blaming people,'' said Wenonah Hauter,
the director of the Public Citizen's Critical Mass Energy Project,

COURTS GROW MORE RECEPTIVE TO SUITS CHALLENGING QUALITY OF MANAGED
HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ill., Mass., N.Y., Ohio, Pa., Texas) (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a string of rulings over the last 20 months,
judges across the country have begun allowing patients to sue
health maintenance organizations for medical malpractice, after
decades in which such claims were repeatedly rejected by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, federal and state judges often allowed HMOs and
other managed-care companies to avoid liability for their
decisions, saying patients had no right to sue for damages. But
rulings by judges in U.S. District Courts and appeals courts in
recent months show that they have become more receptive to lawsuits
attacking the quality of care provided by health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The suits have become common as patients chafe under the
cost-control restraints of managed care, now the dominant form of
health insurance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether patients should have the right to sue their health
insurance companies has been the most divisive issue before
Congress as the Senate and the House debate legislation known by
its backers as the patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently passed a bill that would expand protections
for a limited number of Americans in managed-care plans, after
rejecting Democratic efforts to guarantee the right to sue.
President Clinton said he would veto the measure because it offered
``toothless, half-hearted protections.'' A move is afoot in the
House to draft a version that would include new rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law that regulates employee benefits has long formed
a protective shield around HMOs. The law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, made it difficult for
consumers to win liability claims for the denial of benefits,
primarily because Congress wanted employers to establish health and
pension plans without being exposed to expensive litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and their lawyers have recently found ways to get
around a provision of the law that allows patients to recover only
the value of denied benefits, not punitive damages or compensation
for lost wages or pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a U.S. District Court in Urbana, Ill., ruled this
year that a woman could sue a health plan, Health Alliance-Midwest,
on the ground that its nurses failed to diagnose her husband's
cardiac distress over the telephone. A nurse told the 42-year-old
man, Gary L. Crum, that his chest pain was probably a result of
``excess stomach acids,'' the lawsuit said, but Crum died of a
heart attack a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kelly A. Crum, is challenging the ``quality of medical
care,'' not a denial of benefits, so she may press her claim under
Illinois' wrongful death statute, Judge Michael P. McCuskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995, the Supreme Court emphasized the broad reach of
ERISA, which pre-empts ``any and all state laws insofar as they may
now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.'' But since
1995, the court has emphasized its presumption that states may
exercise their ``historic police powers'' in ``fields of
traditional state regulation,'' including health care and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to hold health plans more accountable, state
insurance commissioners recommended this month that all states
establish appeal procedures for people who want to contest the
denial of care by health maintenance organizations. Model
legislation, issued by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, would allow consumers to appeal to an independent
panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that without a change in federal law, it is
difficult to sue an insurer for denying care to a patient under the
terms of an employee benefit plan. But plaintiffs are already using
novel arguments to win damages for inadequate quality of care _ in
short, for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when a patient sued for malpractice, the target was
usually a doctor. But Promutual Group, a malpractice insurer based
in Boston, says ``managed care organizations are being held liable
in more and more medical malpractice cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly D.E. Temchine, a Washington lawyer who represents managed
care organizations, said patients and their lawyers liked to name
HMOs as defendants because the health plans were seen as having
``deep pockets.'' In recent months, judges in states from
California to Texas to New York have forced HMOs to defend their
actions in cases involving suicide, heart attacks, sudden infant
death syndrome, cancer and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have said HMOs can be sued on a variety of legal
theories. Some courts have held HMOs legally responsible for the
negligence of their doctors, especially if the doctors act like
agents of the HMO. Other courts have allowed patients to sue HMOs
for ``breach of fiduciary duty,'' meaning their obligation to act
in the interest of participants and beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Judge Christopher F. Droney of U.S. District
Court ruled recently that one of the state's largest HMOs could be
sued for negligence by a man whose son had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Stewart R. Moscovitch, said the HMO had stopped
paying for psychiatric care at Danbury Hospital for his severely
depressed son, Nitai, and arranged for the youth to be transferred
to a drug treatment center, where he hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the lawsuit could go forward in state court
because it involved ``claims for medical negligence, not claims for
the improper denial of plan benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Moscovitch said: ``I felt that the
HMO in this case had to be held accountable. I do believe, and know
in my heart, that they killed my son by making a medical decision
for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice C. Ferreira, a spokeswoman for the HMO, Physicians Health
Services of Shelton, Conn., said, ``The tragic outcome of this case
saddens us all.'' But she added, ``Once all the facts are presented
in court, they will prove that PHS fulfilled its obligation'' to
the Moscovitch family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Democrats in Congress and some House Republicans say
the right to sue is an essential element of any managed-care
legislation, because health plans often decide what kind of care
patients receive. But Senate Republicans, HMOs, insurance companies
and employers adamantly oppose any new right to sue, saying it
would increase the cost of insurance and lead to an increase in the
number of Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ralph J. Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
addressed such concerns in a recent ruling. ``We acknowledge that
by allowing negligence claims, there will be a financial impact on
HMOs,'' he wrote. But, he insisted, ``patients enjoy the right to
be free from medical malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Trueman, a New York lawyer who has represented scores
of patients, said, ``The courts' willingness to protect the
consumer is consistent with changing public attitudes toward
managed care and the need to hold HMOs responsible for actions that
harm patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania this year allowed a lawsuit
against an HMO by a man who said he had become a permanent
quadriplegic because of a three-hour delay in his transfer to a
university hospital for treatment of an infection in his spinal
column.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan said the federal law on employee benefits barred
such claims, and to support its contention it cited several
decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court in the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the U.S.
Supreme Court ``noticeably changed tack'' in 1995. As a result, he
concluded, ``Congress did not intend to pre-empt state laws which
govern the provision of safe medical care,'' nor did it intend to
block lawsuits making negligence claims against an HMO.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, a California jury returned the largest verdict to
date against an HMO: $120.5 million for a woman whose husband had
died of stomach cancer. The woman, Teresa Goodrich, was allowed to
sue because her husband, David, had been a county prosecutor, and
Erisa's limits on damages do not apply to health plans for
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rulings have pleased consumer advocates and caused
concern among managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans say the court decisions show there is no need for
changes in Erisa, because patients can vindicate their rights under
existing law.
</P>
<P>
   But patients' rights and judge's rulings are, at the moment,
somewhat unpredictable, and patients often must shuttle back and
forth between federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Trueman, the New York lawyer, said that despite recent court
victories for consumers, ``the law in this area is in flux, often
limited and at times confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Ohio State
University, said: ``It's still pretty clear that you cannot
directly sue a plan for denial of benefits, no matter how egregious
the denial is. That protects much of what health plans do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a consumer
group based in Santa Monica, Calif., said congressional action was
needed to clarify patients' rights.

CHILD ABUSE HAS JAPAN RETHINKING FAMILY AUTONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIBA, Japan _ What Miho Kakuno hated worse than the beatings
was the bathtub treatment. It took place once or twice a week, even
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Miho says that she and her younger brother were placed in the
tub, while their stepfather filled it with cold water and covered
them with a wooden top, leaving only a couple of inches of air for
them to breathe. They could never push off the cover, she said,
because there was something heavy on top.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several years later, Miho, 12, is one of the lucky ones.
Her grandmother eventually won custody of her, and she is living
quietly trying to recover her equilibrium. Her brother, Hiroki, now
10, eventually ran away and, like his sister, lives in a location
that is being hidden from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Miho and Hiroki's story of abuse is just one of many that have
come to light as Japan begins to confront a problem many Japanese
did not believe existed. Japan's unusually strong families are
being strained, aggravated by the long recession and record
unemployment, which have undermined stability in the home. In
addition to economic pressures, divorce rates and remarriages are
rising, which experts say has led to abusive behavior by some
stepparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pediatric circles we thought there wasn't much child abuse
and that we were different from the United States because our
culture was different,'' said Dr. Seiji Sakai, a child psychiatrist
and director at the Center for Child Abuse Prevention. ``The single
biggest problem was society realizing that there is child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But efforts by doctors, lawyers and welfare workers, as well as
a recent campaign by the Mainichi Shimbun, a national newspaper,
have begun to raise awareness. For the first time, the Parliament
focused recently on the increase in child abuse cases by
questioning bureaucrats and ministers. Lawmakers now are
considering relaxing rigid laws that give considerable power and
autonomy to families and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics suggest a rise in child abuse, although experts are
uncertain whether it is actually increasing or whether more are
instances now being reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child abuse is on the rise in Japan,'' said Machiko Ayukyo, a
lawyer who handles child abuse cases and is a director of the
Center for Child Abuse Prevention. ``Superficially, it seems the
trend is rising,'' she said, because more is coming to light. ``I
feel that this has been happening for a very long time and it is
finally just coming to the surface,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare commissioned its
first child abuse survey. It also plans to start specialized
training for social workers in child abuse, to provide increase
psychological support for abused children and to distribute a video
to publicize the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are also increasing their coverage of individual
cases like the one where a couple left their 5-month-old infant in
a coin locker one night last May, and then went to eat at a nearby
noodle shop. A passer-by heard the infant's cries and summoned
police.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, police rarely investigated accusations of child
abuse or wife beating, believing these were issues best left to the
head of the household _ meaning the father or grandfather.
Authorities are now struggling to figure out when and how to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that in 1997, there were 5,352
reported cases of child abuse, a 30 percent rise from the previous
year. But statistics may not present a full picture because the
government has not traditionally kept track of cases and few are
reported to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These figures are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Satoru
Saito, director of the Institute of Family Functioning in Tokyo,
who said that changes in the family are leading to more child
abuse. ``The family's relationship with relatives and the community
is not so close anymore. Parents rarely seek support outside and
they tend to be isolated from society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakai, the psychiatrist, says that doctors often see injured
children but do not investigate enough. A couple once brought in a
5-month-old baby who died from a cerebral hemorrhage _ but even
after an autopsy, the death was not attributed to child abuse but
rather to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   He also cannot forget the case of a young girl, now 7, whose
parents he described as ``highly educated'' and ``well-to-do.''
They brought her to the hospital with a bone fracture when she was
6 months old. Then a year later, they brought her in with a
cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a child would have died from the injury, but this girl
lived. Now, protected in a special school for the handicapped, she
is paralyzed and mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked that the second time, when the child had a
hemorrhage, the doctor didn't report it as child abuse,'' Sakai
said. ``We have tried to ask about what happened and why, but the
problem is that the mother doesn't speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miho and Hiroki, the two children held down in the bathtub,
the problems began when their father died and the mother, Mieko,
quickly moved to the distant city of Nagano from Osaka to live with
Kiichiro Kakuno, a small-time shop owner who was tall, handsome and
charming.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko's mother, Misako Ishibashi, objected to the relationship,
partly because Kakuno was married. But Mieko persisted and
eventually married Kakuno, and Mrs. Ishibashi gradually began to
wonder what was happening to her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko sometimes visited with her children, and Hiroki once came
with a big bruise on his head and what looked like a small burn on
his back. Mieko said that Hiroki had stumbled on the street, but
when it was time to climb into the car to return to Nagano, he
wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day in 1992, Mrs. Ishibashi received a call from Miho's
nursery school teacher. Could she please come to Nagano to see what
was happening?
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, she was shown two large volumes of photographs
that the teachers had taken of her grandchildren, both with
bandages, bruises and cuts all over their bodies. In one picture,
Hiroki's face was so black and blue that it was swollen like the
moon, Mrs. Ishibashi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They waited until Mieko came to pick up Miho and took her to a
nearby restaurant to ask her about the children. Mieko dodged their
questions, repeatedly changed topics and then left.
</P>
<P>
   The Kakunos have no lawyer and no listed phone number in the
Tokyo area, and could not be reached for comment. They have refused
to accept court documents and have not appeared in court. Two years
ago, Kakuno denied all accusations of child abuse in questioning by
a lawyer. Asked about the bathtub treatments, he told the lawyer
that he was teaching his stepdaughter Miho how to swim and never
tortured her, court documents say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The children's grandparents went to the local police, who told
them that unless they could prove how the injuries were inflicted,
the police could do nothing. Moreover, if Mrs. Ishibashi were to
take the children away, she would be arrested for kidnapping. When
she called the local child consultation center, which has the power
to shelter an abused child, she was told that even suing in the
courts would be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has tried to keep its family structure relatively intact
with laws that give enormous authority to the family. The tradeoff
has been that abused children are sometimes stuck with abusive
parents because authorities do not want to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Japanese believed that children were like
possessions and that parental authority was virtually supreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the right of the family head was very strong,'' said
Toru Arichi, a professor of family law at Kyushu University. Until
the 1860s, he said, ``When a father unintentionally killed a child,
by being too strict or too violent, he was not questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, authorities do not know how to handle mistreatment by
parents. On May 15, a 23-month-old girl was brought unconscious to
a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She was only 11 pounds,
less than half the average weight of a typical 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who was 18, was arrested after admitting that she
had not fed her baby much that month and had given her nothing
during the previous few days. The mother had separated from her
husband after giving birth, and had a nighttime job, but simply had
lost interest in caring for the child.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating a court sent the mother to a juvenile home.
</P>
<P>
   Even when authorities are aware of mistreatment, it often takes
years before the children can be rescued because of rigid laws that
protect the right of parents. In the case of Miho and Hiroki, it
took about nine years before their grandmother won custody of both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid laws coupled with a cultural deference to the parents
helped prolong the agony for Miho and Hiroki, even though neighbors
repeatedly reported sightings of abuse to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated everything,'' said Miho, who seems shy and hesitant
throughout a long interview.
</P>
<P>
   The first time she ran away, with the help of a teacher, school
director and a police official, she was kept for a few days at the
local child consultation center. But then she was returned home
when her mother and stepfather demanded her back.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the family moved to Tokyo, and after Miho began playing
with a friend downstairs she ran away to her friend's family, who
reported the problem to the local authorities. But she went back
home soon after because the authorities declined to help her. When
she tried to escape again, the child center recommended that she
not be returned home but since it had no legal authority to keep
her, Kakuno was able to collect the child.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after months of silence, a neighbor reported to a child
center that Hiroki had been found one morning wandering near a
large train station in muddy pajamas. Miho secretly had helped her
brother escape.
</P>
<P>
   The child consultation center ultimately protected Hiroki and
called a lawyer who helped Mrs. Ishibashi sue her daughter for
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Miho spent many hours plotting her own escape a year after
Hiroki left. She had been to school, where she told her teachers
about her plan, and then she went to a friend's house. She prepared
clothes and a small bag and left it with them.
</P>
<P>
   She had once tried to escape from the front door, but had been
caught. So this time, she tried the window from her third-floor
room. She piled up furniture in front of the window to climb out,
taking her in-line skates so that she could make a swift getaway
over the hills. She climbed sideways on the veranda to get to a
hallway window, which she entered to go down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   As she recalls the whole period of mistreatment, Miho gets a
faraway look in her eyes, and it is clear that it still haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I was a little worried,'' she said. ``I
worried about whether I can belong here, about whether I can
survive here, and about what I should do if Dad or Mom and those
kinds of people come here to get me.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ The United States is far from alone when it
comes to worrying about how to sustain a long-term Social Security
system in an era of aging populations _ or how to insure that there
will be enough new talent to fill the work place as fewer babies
are born and more people retire. Around the world, but particularly
in Europe and richer Asian nations, the situation is even more
alarming, and so are the choices governments may soon have to make.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading people to retire later may seem like the easiest
alternative, but planners worldwide are finding that cultural and
social attitudes toward leisure, family, old age and status have a
great effect on policymaking. Along with economic globalization and
urbanization, the idea of a hard-earned, dignified and pleasurable
retirement is catching on in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the space of about 100 years, people have not only
accepted, but grown to believe that retirement is a right somehow,
a human right almost,'' said Dalmer Hoskins, secretary-general of
the International Social Security Association in Geneva. ``Working
with these 150 countries that have pensions system, I'm struck more
by the commonalities among them than the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what a decent level of retirement living
is, he said, ``but it's written into the constitutions of country
after country.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, as Hoskins frames it, is whether more retirement
is really what most economies really need, particularly in
industrialized Europe, where populations are shrinking and aging,
and most people are retiring before the age of 60 and living
another 20 years or more. He suggests that in Europe and the United
States, national interests and those of private enterprise may be
dangerously out of sync.
</P>
<P>
   ``The private sector is retiring people at consistently earlier
ages,'' he said, adding that forcing people to retire in the name
of downsizing and reorganization has gone hand in hand with the
shirking of responsibility for pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   Big, even cosmic, ideas float around the subject of retirement.
Peter Peterson, an investment banker and chairman of the Institute
for International Economics, argued in ``Gray Dawn: How the Coming
Age Wave Will Transform America _ and the World'' (Times Books
1999) that ``We are confronting demographic changes so substantive
that they could redefine economic and political systems in the
developed countries over the next generation.'' Early retirement,
he asserted, is already undermining the survival of developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Unless people can be persuaded to work longer into old age, say
Peterson and others, like Joseph Chamie, director of the U.N.
Population Division, developed countries will have to accept a loss
of productivity, creativity and even general economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Or they will be forced to accept waves of immigration from
poorer nations, a policy that Japan, Germany and other European
countries would like to avoid for social and cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, one serious hurdle is ageism, Peterson
says, reflecting on the youth culture that pervades many American
companies. ``Overcoming ageism will requiring ongoing education and
commitment, much as overcoming racism in American work places has
over the past few years,'' he writes. ``An entire stereotype will
have to be reversed, along with all the institutional rules and
habits of thought that perpetuate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother, a lot of retirees seem to be saying, as they
settle into country club retirement communities or book another
cruise.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, where the proportion of people 60 or older will
rise to 26 percent from the current 10 percent in the next 30
years, the government hopes to push the retirement age from 62 to
67. But Singaporeans, who must contribute to a national savings
plan, can take their accumulated retirement package at age 55, and
a fair number do, said Dr. Kanwal Jit Soin, a former independent
member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they deserve retirement by the age of 55 or 60,''
she said in an interview, adding that this is particularly true of
older people with few or no professional qualifications or skills,
born before Singapore's economy took off. ``And we are also a
society with strong filial ideals,'' said Dr. Soin, an orthopedic
surgeon. ``Children take care of their parents and grandparents
look after their grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   With Singapore's standard of living now rivaling southern
Europe's, retirees also go on cruises and vacations they could
never have afforded in earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore _ with a dominant Chinese population but a mix of
people of Indian, Malay and European ancestry _ is almost alone
among Asian nations in changing its immigration policy to allow
more foreigners with skills to settle in the small country, really
an island city-state. It also allows unskilled workers, most from
poorer Asian nations, to work for limited periods, filling manual
jobs that Singapore's 3.5 million people have largely outgrown
through education and training for a technological future.
</P>
<P>
   Japan takes a different approach, rejecting increased
immigration. It tries to keep people working longer through
incentives to their employers, said Linda Martin, president of the
Population Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government has a fairly aggressive policy to
encourage employers to retain older workers,'' she said. ``It
provides some financial incentives to companies that maintain a
certain percentage of older employees, and sometimes older workers
retire and are rehired by the same company, often with a lesser
title or lower stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese,'' she added, ``are a bit ahead of the United
States in how to make productive use of older people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Third World, where most people keep on working to
survive, the formal retirement situation is very mixed, and
sometimes more complicated. A survey of retirement ages by the U.N.
Population Division shows the lowest ages in the poorest countries,
mostly African, but also several in South Asia. Yet these are also
often places where there are no pensions or other benefits, no
social security systems and no subsidized health plans. A low
national retirement age _ the lowest is 40 in the Solomon Islands _
often reflects short life expectancy, the pressure of younger
working-age populations, or both.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the employed are squeezed from both ends of the age
scale, with millions of young people joining the work force every
year, while older people are living longer than ever before and are
beginning to demand retirement programs. Since independence in
1947, India has raised life expectancy to 63 from 39. But until
very recently it retained a 58-year-old mandatory retirement age
for government employees, opening places for younger people but
forcing even experienced ambassadors and key civil servants to
search for work. The age has now been raised to 60.
</P>
<P>
   ``In countries like India and China, people can't or don't want
to be reliant on their children now,'' said Hoskins of the
International Social Security Association. But they remain in
retirement limbo, waiting for governments and the private sector to
act.

<P>
   A madeleine dipped in lime-blossom tea sent Marcel Proust off on
an eight-volume reminiscence. A visit from a highly perfumed
Parisian prompted a one-sentence rant. ``My dear friend,'' Proust
wrote, ``the last time you were so good as to come and see me _ for
nobody comes any more to see the wretched invalid that I am _ I was
obliged to take the chair you sat in and keep it out in the
courtyard for three days: it was impregnated with the scent.''
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine the blast Proust would have sent the friend
who gave him a subscription to a glossy magazine packed with
``scent strips.'' But if Proust lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he
would have less to complain about, perhaps. Some buildings and
businesses there have declared themselves fragrance-free zones. The
Halifax Herald newspaper has a no-scent policy: Employees may not
wear perfume, after-shave lotion or scented hairspray at work.
Schoolchildren may be sent to the principal's office if the teacher
can smell them. A telephone customer-service center enacted a
similar policy; it sends employees home to bathe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some people who are sensitive to smells _ so sensitive that
they can be paralyzed by perfume, but not in the provocative way
Madison Avenue promises _ say Halifax has not gone far enough.
``It's very, very minor compared to what I see as absolutely
required for people with chemical sensitivities,'' said Susan
Molloy, who has been on disability for multiple chemical
sensitivity more than 10 years, ``and yet it's the best thing
that's happened so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Nelson of the National Foundation for the Chemically
Hypersensitive in Rhodes, Mich., who estimates that he has advised
25,000 people on fragrance problems, concurred. ``In California,
they made it a courtesy, not a law, not to wear over-heavy
fragrances that cause these problems,'' he said. That's not going
far enough for Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, efforts to provide fragrance-free zones _ which
gained steam in the early 1990s, before the passage of the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act _ appear to have slacked off. The
2,500-member First United Methodist Church in Boise, Idaho, dropped
its fragrance-free service after the minister who organized it (and
whose wife was fragrance-sensitive) moved to another church. The
75-seat chapel where the service was held is made of untreated
materials _ the walls are Arizona sandstone, the floors are made of
marble and flagstone, not covered with chemical-laden carpeting
like the main sanctuary. The pews are natural wood.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Molloy, 50, describes her life as a struggle
to avoid nearly everything _ including densely populated places.
Eight years ago, she left the San Francisco Bay Area for a remote
corner of Arizona. There, she and a handful of other people with
multiple chemical sensitivity have bought 400 acres in chunks of 20
or 40 acres. ``It's overgrazed ranchland,'' she said. ``The
ranchers can't make much use of it. We are letting the native
grasses grow back.'' Unlike allergy sufferers who worry that the
great outdoors aggravates their sneezes and sniffles, Ms. Molloy
said, ``Natural things are for the most part not too bad, at least
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She works for a disability organization, advising others with
similar symptoms by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And employment? Forget it, she said. ``It's impossible to get
hired if you have this,'' she said. ``If you develop MCS after you
have a good position and they can't get rid of you, there is the
possibility that effective accommodations can be approached, but
there's no way to apply for a job after you have this disease.
Imagine calling a prospective employer and saying, `Hi, will you
come outside to interview me?' The first time a truck goes by or
somebody lights a cigarette and you fall or lose the ability to
speak, the employer figures you probably can't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molloy avoids moviehouses and malls. And the zoo? Forget it
_ at least the Dallas Zoo. Reuters reported that researchers there
have found a scent that drives the endangered ocelot positively
wild _ Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about what would work with them and used things
like rat feces and ocelot scent,'' the zoo's research curator, Dr.
Cynthia Bennett, was quoted as saying. ``Then on a lark my research
technician brought in cologne because a lot of other animals like
it and we put Obsession out and our ocelots went wild over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have passed their findings along to Calvin Klein
Cosmetics Co., she said. ``They thought it was cute,'' she said.
``I think they were grateful we weren't trying it on vultures.''

25,000 people on fragrance problems, concurred. ``In California,
they made it a courtesy, not a law, not to wear over-heavy
fragrances that cause these problems,'' he said. That's not going
far enough for Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, efforts to provide fragrance-free zones _ which
gained steam in the early 1990s, before the passage of the federal
Americans with Disabilities Act _ appear to have slacked off. The
2,500-member First United Methodist Church in Boise, Idaho, dropped
its fragrance-free service after the minister who organized it (and
whose wife was fragrance-sensitive) moved to another church. The
75-seat chapel where the service was held is made of untreated
materials _ the walls are Arizona sandstone, the floors are made of
marble and flagstone, not covered with chemical-laden carpeting
like the main sanctuary. The pews are natural wood.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Molloy, 50, describes her life as a struggle
to avoid nearly everything _ including densely populated places.
Eight years ago, she left the San Francisco Bay Area for a remote
corner of Arizona. There, she and a handful of other people with
multiple chemical sensitivity have bought 400 acres in chunks of 20
or 40 acres. ``It's overgrazed ranchland,'' she said. ``The
ranchers can't make much use of it. We are letting the native
grasses grow back.'' Unlike allergy sufferers who worry that the
great outdoors aggravates their sneezes and sniffles, Ms. Molloy
said, ``Natural things are for the most part not too bad, at least
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She works for a disability organization, advising others with
similar symptoms by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   And employment? Forget it, she said. ``It's impossible to get
hired if you have this,'' she said. ``If you develop MCS after you
have a good position and they can't get rid of you, there is the
possibility that effective accommodations can be approached, but
there's no way to apply for a job after you have this disease.
Imagine calling a prospective employer and saying, `Hi, will you
come outside to interview me?' The first time a truck goes by or
somebody lights a cigarette and you fall or lose the ability to
speak, the employer figures you probably can't do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molloy avoids moviehouses and malls. And the zoo? Forget it
_ at least the Dallas Zoo. Reuters reported that researchers there
have found a scent that drives the endangered ocelot positively
wild _ Calvin Klein Obsession for Men cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about what would work with them and used things
like rat feces and ocelot scent,'' the zoo's research curator, Dr.
Cynthia Bennett, was quoted as saying. ``Then on a lark my research
technician brought in cologne because a lot of other animals like
it and we put Obsession out and our ocelots went wild over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers have passed their findings along to Calvin Klein
Cosmetics Co., she said. ``They thought it was cute,'' she said.
``I think they were grateful we weren't trying it on vultures.''

   IRON-GIANT (Los Angeles) _ What in the world happened to the
``Iron Giant''? Despite universally positive reviews of the Warner
Bros. animated movie, the ``Iron Giant'' opened with a massive thud
last weekend. It finished with $5.7 million at 2,171 theaters _
barely one-fifth of the business generated by Bruce Willis' ``Sixth
Sense.'' That's a flat-out disaster for a project that racked up a
tab estimated at $50 million and an embarrassment for the studio
considering ``Iron Giant'' debut during a supercharged summer in
which grosses have risen an astounding 20 percent over last year's
record-setting pace. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``e''
entertainment and ``n'' California news file.)

   LOS ANGELES _ From Mark Twain's place-switching ``Prince and the
Pauper'' to Audrey Hepburn's footloose royal highness in ``Roman
Holiday,'' the notion that the mighty might find a way to move
unknown _ or at least unnoticed _ among the masses has an enduring
romantic appeal. Now comes word that Jordan's new young King
Abdullah II has actually done it, posing as a taxi passenger and a
television reporter, in fake beard and ordinary clothes, to see
what life is like for his subjects on Amman's busy streets.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a president like Theodore Roosevelt rode
horseback in Rock Creek Park, and Harry Truman walked Pennsylvania
Avenue relatively unencumbered by cameras or bodyguards. But in the
age of the choreographed photo-op and the scripted ``listening
tour,'' it seems unimaginable that an American politician, even a
president as populist as Bill Clinton, could pull off such a stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impossible,'' says George Stephanopoulos, the former senior
White House aide. ``Simply impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the president couldn't wear a kaffiyeh, the
distinctive red-and-white Arab headdress that obscures anyone's
face. For another, the ethos of White House press coverage is
heavily invested in dogging the president's every step, and news
executives would howl if a president tried to ditch his protective
motorcade, with its camera van, doctor, decoy limousine and heavy
weapons truck. So would the Secret Service, which strongly
discouraged Clinton's early penchant for jogging through the
streets of Washington, a practice that eventually stopped
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service would be a problem in many ways,'' said
Marlin Fitzwater, who was White House press secretary under
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. ``One, they would object,
in line with their responsibilities. They'd say, `It's our job to
protect you and we can't protect you under those circumstances.'
Then they'd put enough people on the squad that the president
couldn't get away with it. No matter how you dress six agents down,
they'd look like agents. Plus, American presidents are so well
known on television that it would be tough, and there would be
suspicion by the press and public that they were trying to get away
with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, former FBI agent Gary Aldrich caused a stir three years
ago when he suggested in a best-selling book that Clinton had
sneaked out of the White House for trysts in a Washington hotel _
an allegation that was never remotely substantiated and that
Aldrich later conceded was ``hypothetical.'' About the only time
anyone can recall Clinton ever leaving the White House without his
full entourage was the night his aide and childhood friend, Vincent
Foster, committed suicide and the president and a small Secret
Service detail visited the Foster home.
</P>
<P>
   Unplanned presidential movements are not impossible, and Clinton
regularly goes to restaurants or stores, in Washington and on
trips, but only after the Secret Service has checked out the sites.
In 1970, Richard M. Nixon made a famous pre-dawn visit to the
Lincoln Memorial to chat with students protesting the Vietnam War.
In 1979, at the height of his warnings about a national malaise,
Jimmy Carter would occasionally sneak away from Camp David to chat
with ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once the president was supposed to be at Camp David
and we suddenly got wind that he was in Wheeling, W.Va. talking
with some family,'' recalled Mark Knoller, the veteran radio
reporter who then covered the White House for the Associated Press
and now works for CBS. ``And the AP rented a small aircraft at
National Airport and put me and a wire guy on it, and we went to
interview the people that Carter had met with, but he was long gone
by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Less recognizable officials have more options. When she was New
York City's welfare commissioner in the early 1990s, Barbara Sabol
sometimes dressed in wigs and sweatshirts to apply for welfare
benefits, then described the indignities and shortcomings of the
process. As chairman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine
Commission in the same era, Jack Lusk periodically drove a cab to
better understand the hacking life.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years as mayor of New York City, Ed Koch lived a more or
less normal life, attending movies and dining out, though never
incognito. Quite the opposite, Koch demanded endlessly of one and
all: ``How'm I doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I created a climate where people were not at all
fearful to talk to me,'' Koch recalled. ``That's not always true
with public figures. People became accustomed to me. I'd walk down
the street and somebody across the street would yell, ``Don't ask!
You're doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians' attempts at undercover operations have
produced comic results. When Rudolph Giuliani was the federal
prosecutor in Manhattan in the mid-1980s, he and Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato donned sunglasses, vests and jeans for a drug raid in
Washington Heights and wound up looking like refugees from a
middle-aged road company of ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   In this town, the local version of royalty _ movie stars _
manages to move largely unmolested. Just last Sunday, Shirley
MacLaine and Tom Hanks separately strolled the beaches of Malibu.
Ms. MacLaine's brother, Warren Beatty, is toying with running for
president, and it's easy to imagine ``Bulworth'' in a hip-hop
stocking cap and shades rapping through Georgetown. But could
Clinton go for a burger in bomber jacket and baseball cap?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the caveats being said, and for all of these enormous
pressure, you certainly could do it,'' Fitzwater said. ``And you
could do it easily if the Secret Service cooperated. You'd have the
agents go in advance, mingle with the crowd, have only one go with
him and take him out the back of the White House in a plain,
unmarked car. And indeed the best evidence for that is that we
snuck a lot of people in and out of the White House _ including
President Nixon _ without the press or anybody knowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I guess the honest answer might be that I don't know if my
two presidents ever did that,'' he said. ``I don't think so, but I
don't know.''

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ These are high holy days for Elvis fans: the
end of a week of commemorations leading up to the anniversary
Monday of the pop icon's 1977 death here at Graceland amid
overindulgence and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This year, attention is being drawn to long-mothballed artifacts
of the singer's odyssey from mere mortal to flawed deity. Lisa
Marie Presley, Elvis' only child and primary heir, has decided to
auction off thousands of her father's personal items and documents
_ most of which have never been publicly displayed. Her aim is to
raise millions to build a homeless shelter in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding, handled by the New York auction house Guernsey's,
will take place Columbus Day weekend at the MGM Grand casino in Las
Vegas. Bids on the items, organized in more than 1,000 lots, will
also be taken online at icollector.com.
</P>
<P>
   For sale are not only Elvis artifacts like guitars, costumes,
posters, credit cards, the 1956 Lincoln in which he squired around
Natalie Wood and even the King's blue velvet beanbag chair, but
also contracts he signed and hundreds of other unpublished
documents and letters illuminating the singer's rise and fall. Here
is a small sampling from the Elvis archives.

<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Early on, the King had a hard time getting
bookings. In 1954, his manager and guitarist, Scotty Moore,
received this reply from an assistant to Col. Tom Parker (who was,
curiously enough, soon to take over as Elvis' manager):(END ITALICS

</P>
<P>
   Mr. Scotty Moore . . . Thank you so much for your letter
regarding your artist, and while we are a booking and promotion
agency, I don't have anything at present where I could place your
artist. There are few outlets for hillbilly entertainers in this
area around Chicago.

went to Hollywood. But the future bankable star couldn't land the

they could name their price. In a letter to Elvis, the manager
reveals himself as a tough bargainer. (He calls Elvis ``Wallaby,''
after the gift of a pet from Australian fans):(END ITALICS HERE)

   I have been bombarded befuddled befogged bewildered and snowed

spectacular for RCA.NBC in color. . . . They came up with a pretty
good offer several times but I turned them all down, with respect
to our motion picture work and for the reason (sic) I know are best
for us. So I told them that our next TV show for any sponsor we do
would be $50,000 fifty thousand dollars as I want to do only one or
two TV shows this year. . . . At least you will not be overexposed
like some of the top stars that are now working for nothing as they
are worn out on TV. . . . Please indicate by marking either Yess

should keep snowing for the $50,000. . . .

   If I had information on the money matter you may be sure I would
have passed it on. However, I mentioned it to the people out there
and they said they would look into it and that they would advise if
anything was forthcoming. . . . It is not likely that they are

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. _ These are high holy days for Elvis fans: the
end of a week of commemorations leading up to the anniversary
Monday of the pop icon's 1977 death here at Graceland amid
overindulgence and drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   This year, attention is being drawn to long-mothballed artifacts
of the singer's odyssey from mere mortal to flawed deity. Lisa
Marie Presley, Elvis' only child and primary heir, has decided to
auction off thousands of her father's personal items and documents
_ most of which have never been publicly displayed. Her aim is to
raise millions to build a homeless shelter in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding, handled by the New York auction house Guernsey's,
will take place Columbus Day weekend at the MGM Grand casino in Las
Vegas. Bids on the items, organized in more than 1,000 lots, will
also be taken online at icollector.com.
</P>
<P>
   For sale are not only Elvis artifacts like guitars, costumes,
posters, credit cards, the 1956 Lincoln in which he squired around
Natalie Wood and even the King's blue velvet beanbag chair, but
also contracts he signed and hundreds of other unpublished
documents and letters illuminating the singer's rise and fall. Here
is a small sampling from the Elvis archives.

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Early on, the King had a hard time getting
bookings. In 1954, his manager and guitarist, Scotty Moore,
received this reply from an assistant to Col. Tom Parker (who was,
curiously enough, soon to take over as Elvis' manager):(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Scotty Moore . . . Thank you so much for your letter
regarding your artist, and while we are a booking and promotion
agency, I don't have anything at present where I could place your
artist. There are few outlets for hillbilly entertainers in this
area around Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kindest regards, Tom Diskin

household name, as this letter to Parker from a West Coast promoter
attests:(END ITALICS HERE)

   Dear Tom: There is a good possibility I may be able to use ALVIN
PRESLEY during April, (starting approximately April 10). Please let
me know if he is available and the price for one date, as well as
for a series of dates. . . .

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)1956: With his career gathering steam, Elvis
went to Hollywood. But the future bankable star couldn't land the
first part he auditioned for, that of Jim in ``The Rainmaker.'' (It
went to Earl Holliman in a film starring Burt Lancaster and
Katherine Hepburn.) Still, the screen-test script seems to have
Elvis-style gravitas. Here Jim (Elvis) is about to reveal his
engagement to Snookie:(END ITALICS HERE)

   JIM (with a lordly gesture): Out - out - out!
</P>
<P>
   NOAH: What's wrong with you? Are you drunk?
</P>
<P>
   JIM (with mighty superiority): No big brother, I ain't drunk.
But if I cared to be drunk, I'd be goggle-eyed! . . .
</P>
<P>
   H.C. (secretly amused): Where'd you get the stogie, Jim?
</P>
<P>
   JIM: It ain't a stogie. It's a Havana panatella. Eighty-five
cents. And it's a present.
</P>
<P>
   NOAH: Who the Sam Hill gave it to you?
</P>
<P>
   JIM: I-the-Sam-Hill gave it to me! . . . For bein' a big boy! .

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)By 1957, with hits like ``Heartbreak Hotel''
and national TV successes behind them, Elvis and the Colonel felt
they could name their price. In a letter to Elvis, the manager
reveals himself as a tough bargainer. (He calls Elvis ``Wallaby,''
after the gift of a pet from Australian fans):(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Dear Wallaby; The First:
</P>
<P>
   I have been bombarded befuddled befogged bewildered and snowed
under the past few months to have you do a television show on a
spectacular for RCA.NBC in color. . . . They came up with a pretty
good offer several times but I turned them all down, with respect
to our motion picture work and for the reason (sic) I know are best
for us. So I told them that our next TV show for any sponsor we do
would be $50,000 fifty thousand dollars as I want to do only one or
two TV shows this year. . . . At least you will not be overexposed
like some of the top stars that are now working for nothing as they
are worn out on TV. . . . Please indicate by marking either Yess

should keep snowing for the $50,000. . . .

   If I had information on the money matter you may be sure I would

overall coat of tan on your body as well as your face and said also
that you should watch your weight and your physical condition and
that you should look very much like you did for ``GI Blues.'' He
enclosed a folder on an ultraviolet lamp . . . and suggested that

Hope you have a good time _ really, true, true. If you didn't get a

recorded about 15 years ago and my voice was much higher. I have to
be careful singing it 'cause I'll break something, you know.
(Evidently to an audience member) Honey, I couldn't come over
during that number. I can just see me trying to hug you. OK, want a
kiss? You might catch the crud or something. Hey, wait a minute.
Tough way to make a living, I'll tell you. I'd like to intro _
Well, it's like the day . . . and there it goes . . . the voice,

KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING FORCE GETS TOUGH WITH KLA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NOTEBOOK) 
(mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The international peacekeeping force in
Kosovo is clamping down hard on the Kosovo Liberation Army, seizing
arms caches almost daily and confiscating documents and even cash
in what some officials say is a determined effort to break the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.N. officials maintain that the tougher action is
routine, and part of an agreement signed almost seven weeks ago
that aimed to dismantle the rebel operation completely within three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until now, the NATO-led peacekeeping force here has given
the guerrillas a fairly wide berth. With the recent crackdown, the
NATO force is demonstrating that it will no longer tolerate
violations of the agreement and that it expects the rebels to turn
over their weapons and come to heel behind NATO and U.N.
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Kosovar army and the provisional government of
Hashim Thaci, who is the political leader of the movement, are
growing increasingly unhappy as many of their aspirations are
brushed aside. Those include forming a kind of national guard and
being incorporated within any police force for Kosovo, as well as
gaining social respect that they feel they have earned.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' leadership says that it will continue to
cooperate with the NATO-led peacekeeping force and the U.N. mission
here, but warns that it may not be able to control disconsolate
members of its rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   The next six weeks will be a crucial test for cooperation
between the peacekeepers and the guerrillas. If things go wrong,
the peacekeepers may find themselves with an insurgent army turning
against them, some foreign military observers here warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems could become bigger, more serious,'' said
Bajram Kosumi, leader of the Parliamentary Party and minister of
information in the provisional government. ``Then we would have
wide-scale chaos. I cannot even imagine what it would be like.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers insist that they are merely acting according to
the agreement signed by their commander, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson,
in June. At that time, the chief of staff of the KLA, Gen. Agim
Ceku, undertook to hand in all heavy weapons, and 30 percent of
small arms weapons within 30 days _ that is, by July 21.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrilla army apparently failed to hand over the bulk
of its weapons. Jackson gave them two extra days to comply, but has
since conducted tough search-and-seizure operations across the
province.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day last week saw the peacekeeping troops seize
weapons in four or five different locations. On Thursday, they
confiscated anti-tank grenade launchers, assault rifles, grenades,
mines and mortar rounds in several premises and intercepted a truck
carrying several rifles and ammunition into Kosovo from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping troops also arrested Rexhep Selimi, the minister of
public order in the provisional government, and seized money,
weapons and ministry identification cards at his home. Selimi was
forced to issue a statement a day later acknowledging the authority
of the peacekeepers and the United Nations in the province and
admitting that his ministry's identification cards were
inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force clearly established its authority but the
incident was humiliating for Selimi and may bode ill for future
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force has been acting energetically to curb the
general criminal activity in Kosovo and is quick to point out that
many of the arms seized do not necessarily belong to the Kosovo
Liberation Army or Serb paramilitaries, which were originally
perceived as the two main parties to be disarmed, but to criminal
gangs or rogue elements that do not want to demobilize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now more and more there is some kind of evidence to suggest
there is a third actor,'' said a peacekeeping spokesman, Maj.
Roland Lavoie. ``The amount of money and material confiscated
suggests a more criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet whoever the criminals are, it is the guerrilla movement that
is taking the heat for the perceived noncompliance with NATO
demands. Peacekeeping soldiers on the ground appear to have little
sympathy for the guerrilla fighters. The atrocities committed by
the Serb forces are no longer foremost in their minds. What
preoccupies them now is the intimidation and revenge killings
committed daily by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a soldier on the ground there is a natural
evolution to find an opponent,'' a British military observer
explained, working with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. ``The soldiers are coming up against
nastiness and see the Albanians as the bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is not lost on the guerrilla force and its
sympathizers. ``They are treating our war heroes like dogs,'' said
Kosumi, who never joined the KLA but sought its protection in the
mountains during the war.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it is as if the U.N. mission in Kosovo, known as
UNMIK, and NATO ``want to allow the image of the KLA to be
ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are in a dilemma,'' he said. ``Should we allow our
image to be ruined or should we say to UNMIK to stop? Should we
take action?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He argues that NATO and the U.N. authorities are becoming
dismissive of the guerrilla movement, which he said is wrong and
dangerous. Officials in the two organizations are attempting to
bypass the two most controversial paragraphs in the disarmament
accord, which agree to give consideration to former guerrillas who
want to take part in the police force and form their own national
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Those paragraphs were agreed to by James Rubin, assistant to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to help clinch the
demilitarization agreement with Thaci, the KLA leader, in June. Yet
many in the United Nations and at NATO do not agree with those
paragraphs and have no intention of letting them be realized,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have considered it and they are not going to do it,''
said a Western diplomat in Pristina of the U.N. and NATO
authorities. The guerrillas ``are not being encouraged to think it
is going to happen,'' the diplomat continued.
</P>
<P>
   The provisional government knows it is being brushed off every
time it tries to talk about the national guard, and is not happy,
Kosumi said, not least because many of the rank and file are
expecting some sort of future employment.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign observer responsible for liaison with the KLA over
the last nine months warns that leaving the former guerrillas out
in the cold would invite trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He said any attempt to round them up by force would be like
``herding cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to hold them by the hand and walk them into civilian
life,'' he said.

SOMETIMES ALL YOU CAN DO WITH A FLICKERING MONITOR IS GET RID OF
IT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My son recently gave me a hand-me-down Windows 95 computer so
we can communicate by e-mail. I like it a lot, but I am having a
hard time looking at the monitor for very long. It seems to be
flickering, but it's something I can really only see out of the
corner of my eye. How can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like the computer hasn't properly identified the kind
of monitor you have, or it's a very old and/or cheap monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Using beams of electrons, monitors actually draw an image on the
screen line by line, but it happens so quickly that it appears to
be one big picture to you. The faster it draws the image _ known as
the refresh rate _ the better it looks. The refresh rate is
expressed in hertz.
</P>
<P>
   (Some older models draw the image by painting every other line
on the screen. The electron beams then go back and pick up the
remaining lines on a second pass. This is called interlacing, and
it can also lead to nasty flickering. Most modern monitors are
non-interlaced, in which all the lines are painted in a single
pass.)
</P>
<P>
   If it draws the image at a refresh rate of under 72 hertz,
you're apt to detect a flickering. This can cause eyestrain and
ultimately lead to a headache.
</P>
<P>
   You can change the refresh rate in the Windows display
properties control panel. Right-click on the open desktop, and
choose Properties. Click on the Settings tab, and then click the
Advanced button.
</P>
<P>
   What happens from here depends on how your video drivers are set
up, or what version of Windows you have. In most cases, you'll
click on the Adapter tab, where you'll see a drop-down titled
Refresh Rate. If your monitor is properly supported in Windows, and
if it's capable of higher refresh rates, you should have options in
this box that let you set the refresh rate at 72 hertz or higher.
</P>
<P>
   If you have only a couple of choices, none of them above 72
hertz, your monitor may not be properly recognized.
</P>
<P>
   You should see a Monitor tab at the top of this dialog box.
Choose it and see if the system has identified your monitor
correctly. If not, click the Change button and follow the
instructions to set up your monitor.
</P>
<P>
   If the monitor is correctly identified and you still don't have
access to higher refresh rates, it's likely that this is an older
model and you may want to consider replacing it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently bought a new computer that came with Windows 98. I
had been using Windows 3.1. Try as I might, I can't get used to
using My Computer to see what's on the hard drive. I want the old
File Manager back. Is there some way I can use File Manager on my
new machine? What files would I have to copy from Windows 3.1?
</P>
<P>
   A: None. The File Manager is still present in Windows 98 _ it's
just not obvious.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft introduced Windows 95, the company knew that
people had grown accustomed to the File Manager _ even though it's
a pretty klunky way to work with files. Microsoft decided to leave
the program in the operating system, but not point to it with a
shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   You can invoke the File Manager by going to Start, Run and enter
WINFILE, then hit Enter.
</P>
<P>
   The old Program Manager is there, too, but it likely won't have
any program groups in it. From Start/Run, enter PROGMAN.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been thinking about getting a new iMac to replace my
aging Apple Performa, but I really like my printer, and I
understand the iMacs don't have a traditional printer port. Is
there a way I can use my old printer with an iMac?
</P>
<P>
   A: Check with the maker of your printer. Many manufacturers have
come out with adapters and drivers that let you plug an older
printer into the Universal Serial Bus port on a newer Macintosh.

<P>
   A group of wealthy Roman Catholic entrepreneurs, concerned that
the nation's religious radio programming is dominated by
evangelical Protestants, has started a radio network intended to
broadcast a conservative Catholic spin on politics, news, personal
problems and spiritual questions.
</P>
<P>
   The network, Catholic Family Radio, began broadcasting in
January and has already bought stations in eight cities and expects
to take over stations in six more next month. The format is
all-talk, and the hosts include pundits, psychologists and
politicians like Dan Lungren, a Republican who was California state
attorney general and a gubernatorial candidate, and Raymond Flynn,
a Democrat, formerly mayor of Boston and U.S. ambassador to the
Vatican. Each has his own three-hour show.
</P>
<P>
   The talk often sounds like the fare served up on secular
conservative talk shows like Rush Limbaugh's: taxes, abortion and
traditional family values, the Clintons, the Kennedys and the
candidates for president. In fact, the network has hired as a
consultant Bruce Marr, the radio programmer who helped make
Limbaugh a household name.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to stealth evangelize,'' said John Lynch,
president and chief executive of Catholic Family Radio, ``as
opposed to the Christian evangelicals who do hitting-over-the-head
evangelizing. There are probably too many people who had
hit-over-the-head Catholicism imposed on them, and that's not the
approach we want.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of nominal, fallen-away Catholics and
non-Catholics,'' Lynch said. ``That group is who we want to
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Evangelical Christian programs are heard regularly on 1,616
radio stations in the United States, said Karl Stoll, a spokesman
for National Religious Broadcasters. But before Catholic Family
Radio emerged, there were only six radio stations run by Catholic
dioceses, said Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't have to do with the lack of Catholic interest in
media,'' Maniscalco said, ``but with the fact that the church has
run into this major problem that the opportunities for free air
time are closing, and that's why we see less and less of Catholic
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, whose words are featured on compact discs and
in the Vatican Web site, has called on Catholics to expand the use
of media to spread the faith. But since the death in 1979 of
Archbishop Fulton Sheen, the voice of ``The Catholic Hour'' on
national radio and later on television, the Catholic Church has
lacked a ubiquitous nationwide presence in the American media.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Angelica, an abbess in Birmingham, Ala., runs the Eternal
Word Television Network, which reaches millions worldwide over
satellite television and radio. But she is not well known outside
her audience of committed Catholics attracted by her traditionalist
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Family Radio is not run by the Roman Catholic Church
itself, but by a board of investors who are among the nation's most
successful Catholic businessmen, some billionaires. They include
Thomas Monaghan, former chairman of Domino's Pizza; David Weyrich,
former owner of Martin Media LP, a billboard advertising company,
and John Saeman, founder of Medallion Enterprises. Peter Lynch, the
well-known former money manager of Fidelity Magellan Fund, is also
an investor, but not a board member.
</P>
<P>
   The investors' goal is to own stations in 40 of the 50 top radio
markets and to take the company public next year. The stations that
already broadcast Catholic Family Radio programs are in
Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Denver, Kansas City,
Kan., Los Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We came to peace, our group of investors, with the idea that
we could make a little money and do a little good,'' John Lynch
said. ``Hopefully, it's make a lot of money and do a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishops have been asked to contribute two-minute commentaries,
and some have, including Cardinal John Cardinal O'Connor, the
archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee, a liberal-leaning
prelate, declined the invitation and said that the station was not
welcome in his archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``He finds the people involved have a track record of being more
combative than in the spirit of dialogue,'' said Jerry Topczewski,
spokesman for the Milwaukee archdiocese. ``Some of them have a
track record of criticizing bishops throughout the country and the
world on various doctrinal issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the Catholic network originated with the Rev.
Joseph Fessio, a Jesuit who heads Ignatius Press in San Francisco.
Fessio is an influential conservative who has criticized bishops
who proposed using sex-neutral language in the revised Catholic
catechism. He also voiced his disapproval of the Vatican's decision
to allow altar girls.
</P>
<P>
   Fessio said that he sought help from Nicholas Healey, then vice
president of Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, a campus
also known for its conservative orientation; Archbishop Charles
Chaput of Denver, and Frank Hager, the managing director of Morgan
Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   They proposed the idea for a Catholic radio network to John
Lynch, a former linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers who became
president of the Noble Broadcast Group, a network of 12 radio
stations that was sold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Lynch raised $50 million from investors for Catholic Family
Radio, and last year bought the first seven stations from
Children's Broadcasting Corporation for $37 million. The investors
recently added the station in San Francisco, and are awaiting
approval from the Federal Communications Commission next month to
take over stations in Boston, Providence, R.I., Springfield, Mass.,
Rumfords, Maine, and two in Portland, Maine The network's corporate
offices are in San Diego, and its programming headquarters is in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All the hosts, commercials and programs produced by outside
sources must be approved by a contents committee composed of
Fessio, Chaput and Healey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no topic that's not appropriate,'' Fessio said. He has
proposed inviting Dr. Jack Kevorkian on the air to debate assisted
suicide, he said. He said the festering intrachurch controversies,
like ordination of women or married men, could be discussed but are
not encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did not want to emphasize very much inner-church
controversies, but they come up, so we don't exclude them,'' Fessio
said. ``We'd rather deal with ordinary people's ordinary
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Listeners who have questions about potty training or teen-age
dating call in to Dr. Ray Guarendi, a psychologist and author of
books on parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   The network has been vulnerable to criticism that it is too
conservative and too Republican. One host was Alan Keyes, a
Republican presidential candidate and staunch social conservative.
When Keyes missed dozens of his broadcasts because of campaigning,
Lynch said he made sure to find a Democrat as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure that this didn't come off as a far
right-wing effort,'' Lynch said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's show veers from political talk about the Clintons'
marriage to theological discussion about the second coming of
Christ. In an interview, he said he always tried ``to express what
the Catholic Church's position is on a particular issue,'' and he
also shares his own. Lungren supports the death penalty, while the
pope says it is ``cruel and unnecessary'' and inconsistent with the
church's ``pro-life'' teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that I am conservative and I am Republican,''
Lungren said, ``and I make that clear. But I also make clear that
the Republican conservative position is not necessarily the
Catholic position, if there is a the Catholic position.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Catholic Radio Network, said the Rev.
Thomas Reese, editor of America, a weekly Jesuit magazine, is
whether it can be consistently Catholic in its content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's a cafeteria Catholic, whether they're liberal or
conservative,'' picking and choosing which teachings to embrace,
Reese said. ``There are lots of issues in terms of welfare reform
and peace and justice where the bishops and the pope are way to the
left even of liberal Democrats, let alone Republicans. Will this
radio network be Catholic in that sense?''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``That's going to be very difficult to do.''

COLUMBINE STUDENTS _ WARY, YET EAGER _ PREPARE TO RETURN

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Inside Columbine High School, where two
teen-agers shot and killed a dozen other students and a teacher
last April 20, the library, where much of the mayhem occurred, has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Once pockmarked by bullets and splattered with blood, it now
remains hidden behind a wall of blue-painted lockers as part of
efforts by local officials to remove evidence and memories of one
of the deadliest school shootings in American history.
</P>
<P>
   When students return to classes on Monday for a new school year,
not quite four months after the chaos ended with the young gunmen
turning their weapons on themselves, Columbine faces the rather
daunting challenge of seeking normalcy in a place that could never
be the same after what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are experiencing a range of emotions, the most
universal of them, anxiousness,'' said Krista R. Flannigan, a
victim counselor from Idaho Springs, Colo., who worked with many
families of Columbine students over the summer. ``Some students are
really looking forward to going back. Others are afraid. Some think
something could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students, like Kasey Ruegsegger, a junior last year who was
shot in the shoulder as she hid behind a desk in the library, grew
so uncomfortable with the prospect of returning that they have
transferred to other schools or turned to home-schooling. Ms.
Ruegsegger said she planned to attend a small private school for
``a fresh start,'' adding, ``But I'm happy for the ones going back
to Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings traumatized a town and stunned a nation that is
fast growing accustomed to episodes of savagery in which the
victims are young and only loosely connected, if at all, to their
attackers. At Columbine, the teen-agers who armed themselves with
four weapons and a cache of bombs, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, members of the so-called trench coat mafia, were known
to many other students as relatively unremarkable, which made their
final exploits that much more chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to say that their crimes changed much in the nation would be
an exaggeration. While Congress raised the specter of Columbine and
other school shootings in the long debates on tougher gun-control
measures, the last session ended with no new legislation. Nor have
sociologists, psychologists and other experts agreed on the reasons
that teen-agers from apparently stable, financially secure families
would act out aggressions against peers in such a violent manner.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Columbine, school officials have invited parents,
teachers and other residents of Littleton to form a ``human chain''
outside the school early Monday morning to project a sense of
support and safety for the 1,900 new and returning students who are
expected. A 45-minute rally in the student parking lot has been
scheduled to follow, with Columbine's principal, Frank DeAngelis,
planning to urge the students to ``take back our school.''
</P>
<P>
   A flag that has stood at half-staff since the shootings will be
raised; a ribbon wrapped around the school will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   But even with changes intended to make Columbine safer than ever
_ a $1 million investment by the Jefferson County school district
that includes a new surveillance system, student identification
badges and additional mental-health workers _ anxieties persist
among many Columbine parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting feelings within the Wilson family are typical.
Stuart, a 10th grader who is trying out for the football team as a
defensive end, said he and many of his friends were eager to
reconvene as a group, forget what happened last April and ``be back
like normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, Annie, a native of South Africa who brought her
family to Littleton six years ago ``to be safe,'' described herself
as ``extremely anxious'' about sending Stuart and her two other
children back to Jefferson County schools this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are fine, but I'm neurotic about this,'' she said,
standing outside Columbine one day last week with Stuart, 14, and
his siblings, Cameron, 13, and Holly, 8, after Stuart registered
for the new school year. ``I admire the kids' courage, coming back,
but for me, it's been really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to psychological scars, the shootings left a wide
path of destruction well beyond bullet holes in walls and library
books stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the 15 who died, nearly two dozen students were wounded
by gunshots, three of whom remain paralyzed below the waist and
face the almost certain prospect of life in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Anne Marie Hochhalter, 17, who was shot in the
back, left the hospital only last week to join her family living in
temporary quarters until they move soon into a house that is
wheelchair accessible. A spokesman for Craig Hospital in Denver,
where the most seriously injured people were treated, said Ms.
Hochhalter was planning to return to Columbine for her senior year,
although not right away.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth student, Patrick Ireland, 17, who escaped from the
library by climbing out a window after he was shot in the head,
still has a bullet lodged in the back of his brain. Ireland, who is
expected to return to classes on Monday, has partial paralysis on
his right side and problems speaking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families of injured students were caught with
insufficient medical coverage and are struggling to pay bills.
Churches and other local community groups have helped raise money
to defray the costs, and a ``healing fund'' was created to
distribute the $3.8 million that was collected for families of
people who were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few cases, support arose from unlikely sources. Rashid
Williams, a 15-year-old student in San Francisco who never met
Lance Kirklin, 16, raised $18,000 in pledges to help him by running
in a race across the Golden Gate Bridge. Lance was shot five times
at close range, causing major damage to the left side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruegsegger suffered a less serious injury. As the shootings
continued, she said, she drew herself under a desk and pulled a
chair in front of her. ``I heard a lot of it,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't let myself watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was shot in the right side of her body, and this
summer, therapy is helping her regain full motion of her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also led to a swirl of activity by law-enforcement
agencies investigating how the killers got their guns. The
authorities decided not to prosecute Robyn Anderson, a Columbine
student who bought a shotgun _ legally, they determined _ used in
the shootings. Ms. Anderson went to the prom with Klebold three
days before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But two others involved with getting weapons for the gunmen,
Mark Manes and Philip Duran, who were not students at Columbine,
face gun charges and have arraignments scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   For all the measures undertaken to heal the mental and physical
wounds of the Columbine community, Dr. Donald Bechtold, a child
psychologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said
it was unlikely anyone affected by the shootings would soon forget
them.
</P>
<P>
   He said some students would prove ``remarkably resilient'' but
that others would continue to be haunted by the tragedy, emotions
triggered by a sight, a sound or even a smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to expect them to resolve their feelings 3
1/2 months after the fact,'' Bechtold said. ``I don't think any of
them have completed the recovery process.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility has left teachers and administrators expecting
a wide range of emotions when the rally ends on Monday and students
re-enter the building as a group for the first time since the
shootings. Students finished out the spring semester at nearby
Chatfield High School.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Johnson, a psychology teacher who taught both of the gunmen
and was a close friend of the teacher who was killed, Dave Sanders,
said he was looking forward to returning when classes resume. But
he conceded that he did not know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there will be some tears for friends and the
memories of what happened,'' he said. ``But I also think that kids
are geared up to do what they need to do to have a real school
again.''

   `Rocky' and a Little Cannoli
</P>
<P>
   Most of the movies of Baltimore's open-air film festival are
available around the corner in the video shop for anyone who wants
to curl up alone for escape. So the likely reason for 800 people
gathering in the streets of Little Italy to watch the movies play
20 feet tall on the side of a wall would seem to be for the novel
pleasure of one another's company.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the weekend al fresco movies this summer is
astonishing the neighborhood, which, like other turn-of-the-century
ethnic ghettoes, has nobly dwindled to a bulwark of good
restaurants and determined old people. But a young woman who has
stuck with the neighborhood, Mary Ann Cricchio, proprietor of Da
Mimmo's restaurant, was pondering the piazza social scene in a
visit to Palermo last summer. She decided to try and duplicate the
simple beauty of people strolling, talking, laughing, eating and,
finally, plopping down together to watch an outdoor movie.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cricchio is as delighted as the newcomers seem to be. The
Friday sun sets in Little Italy and hundreds arrive packing lawn
chairs and extended families. Many are returning from suburban
warrens for a reminder of the grit and warmth of the old
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody gets down to earth,'' explains John Pente, an
89-year-old native of Little Italy. His third-floor bedroom window
opposite the parking lot wall is the only practical spot _ the
perfect spot, it turned out _ to set up the theater-sized projector
and sound system for the crowd below. At the July inaugural, the
offer of free treats from Vaccaro's bakery saw 1,000 cannolis
scarfed down during ``Rocky.'' Next week, it's ``The Bicycle
Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ci vediamo al cinema!'' beams Ms. Cricchio. ``See you at the
movies!''

<P>
   It Was Lead, Not Mercury
</P>
<P>
   People keep the strangest souvenirs. In 1815, an admirer of
Andrew Jackson was given a snippet of the great man's hair, and
those revered strands somehow survived to the present day. They
never blew away in a gust of wind, never got lost in the sock
drawer _ and eventually found their way to the Hermitage, Jackson's
Tennessee home.
</P>
<P>
   But could that long-ago admirer have imagined what the tireless
scientists of 1999 would do to those venerable relics? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Our seventh president's tale, you see, was set in stone: he was
done in by foolish doctors. Over the course of his life, they gave
him medicines containing mercury that poisoned and finally killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   But with historical revisionism and micro-medicine running amok,
scientists have now cast a fresh eye on that hair, and on an 1839
sample, and now proclaim _ in a study in The Journal of the
American Medical Association _ that it was in fact lead poisoning
that caused Jackson's chronic kidney problems. Neither hair sample
showed toxic levels of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   In an 1813 gunfight, a bullet landed in Jackson's shoulder _ and
stayed there for nearly 20 years. The 1815 sample showed enough
lead to cause problems, but by 1839, years after the bullet was
removed, the lead was down to a safe level. And one expert not
involved with the study said Jackson's symptoms were indeed
consistent with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   So how far will revisionism go? Now that mercury is off the hook
in this celebrated case, will innovative doctors propose that we
again dose ourselves with Jackson's old remedy, mercury-laden
calomel, which one scientist called ``the aspirin of the early 19th
century''?
</P>
<P>
   You never know.

   ``Everybody gets down to earth,'' explains John Pente, an
89-year-old native of Little Italy. His third-floor bedroom window
opposite the parking lot wall is the only practical spot _ the
perfect spot, it turned out _ to set up the theater-sized projector
and sound system for the crowd below. At the July inaugural, the
offer of free treats from Vaccaro's bakery saw 1,000 cannolis
scarfed down during ``Rocky.'' Next week, it's ``The Bicycle
Thief.''

   It Was Lead, Not Mercury
</P>
<P>
   People keep the strangest souvenirs. In 1815, an admirer of
Andrew Jackson was given a snippet of the great man's hair, and
those revered strands somehow survived to the present day. They
never blew away in a gust of wind, never got lost in the sock
drawer _ and eventually found their way to the Hermitage, Jackson's
Tennessee home.
</P>
<P>
   But could that long-ago admirer have imagined what the tireless
scientists of 1999 would do to those venerable relics? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Our seventh president's tale, you see, was set in stone: he was
done in by foolish doctors. Over the course of his life, they gave
him medicines containing mercury that poisoned and finally killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   But with historical revisionism and micro-medicine running amok,
scientists have now cast a fresh eye on that hair, and on an 1839
sample, and now proclaim _ in a study in The Journal of the
American Medical Association _ that it was in fact lead poisoning
that caused Jackson's chronic kidney problems. Neither hair sample
showed toxic levels of mercury.
</P>
<P>
   In an 1813 gunfight, a bullet landed in Jackson's shoulder _ and
stayed there for nearly 20 years. The 1815 sample showed enough
lead to cause problems, but by 1839, years after the bullet was
removed, the lead was down to a safe level. And one expert not
involved with the study said Jackson's symptoms were indeed
consistent with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   So how far will revisionism go? Now that mercury is off the hook
in this celebrated case, will innovative doctors propose that we
again dose ourselves with Jackson's old remedy, mercury-laden
calomel, which one scientist called ``the aspirin of the early 19th
century''?

   Eichmann, in Memoirs, Tries to Explain His Psyche
</P>
<P>
   Adolf Eichmann, seeking to explain his central role in the
killing of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis, was moved to
organize the mass murders by a visceral sense of duty rather than
hatred, according to memoirs published by the German newspaper Die
Welt. ``Obeying an order was the most important thing to me,''
Eichmann wrote. ``It could be that is in the nature of the
German.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was contained in 127 pages of handwritten
reflections that Die Welt said it found at the Center for Research
on Nazi Crimes in the southern German town of Ludwigsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Justice Ministry announced that 1,200 pages of notes
by Eichmann would be released to German researchers for scholarly
publication. Eichmann was captured in Argentina by Israeli agents
in 1960 and executed in Israel two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I look back,'' Eichmann wrote, ``I realize that a
life predicated on being obedient and taking orders is a very
comfortable life indeed. Living in such a way reduces to a minimum
one's own need to think.''

   China-Taiwan Tensions

   China and Taiwan are sending military planes flying over the

United States is urging both sides to calm down. The situation is
``dangerous'' and ``very delicate,'' said one official. Washington
fears an accident or a misunderstanding could set off acts of war.
China has considered Taiwan a renegade for 50 years, and refuses to
renounce violence as a means to bring it back under mainland
control.

   Warren Beatty Hints At a Presidential Run
</P>
<P>
   Eyes rolled when Ronald Reagan first ran for California governor
and when Sonny Bono said he wanted to be a congressman. So it was
probably inevitable that Warren Beatty's toying with running for
president would draw some laughs. But the movie star's hints that
he is weighing a bid either as a Democrat or a Reform Party
contender also drew some praise from liberals who think they are
not adequately represented by Vice President Al Gore or his rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's involvement in politics is far deeper than his role as
a senator who could not help but speak the truth in the film
``Bulworth.'' He was an early supporter of Robert F. Kennedy, and
he was also a confidant of former Sen. Gary Hart, who has publicly
encouraged a Beatty candidacy. Beatty has said his central issue
would be campaign reform.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not explained why he showed up this summer at a
Hollywood fund-raiser for Texas Gov. George W. Bush.

   Tax Court Hits U.P.S. With A Huge Bill
</P>
<P>
   A Tax Court judge ruled that United Parcel Service took inflated
tax deductions in 1984 and must pay taxes, penalties and interest.
The company said the total might be close to $300 million for 1984
alone, and it could owe hundreds of millions more for later years.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a rare victory for the IRS in its efforts to
prevent companies from claiming deductions when they move money to
subsidiaries overseas for the sole purpose of avoiding taxes.

   In Iraq, Good and Bad News On Child Mortality
</P>
<P>
   The first large survey of the mortality rates of Iraqi children
living under international sanctions since Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 produced mixed findings from Unicef. In areas of the country
where President Saddam Hussein controls the distribution of relief
food and medicines, babies and children under 5 are dying at twice
the rate they were in the late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   Where relief goods are distributed by the United Nations in the
autonomous northern Kurdish areas, child mortality rates are
falling. Unicef urged Iraq to spend more on child and maternal
nutrition and asked the United Nations Security Council to put a
higher priority on getting aid to the youngest Iraqis.

   GLOBAL-RETIREMENT-REVIEW (United Nations) _ When it comes to
worrying about how to sustain a Social Security system in an era of
aging populations _ or how to insure that there will be enough new
talent to fill the workplace as fewer babies are born and more
people retire _ the United States is far from alone. Around the

creationism. The result could be a wider appreciation that
creationism isn't even a theory, and that what evolution's

   BUDGET-SURPLUS-REVIEW (Washington) _ There is no budget surplus
this year, and at the rate Congress is going, there may not be one

For when Congress comes back from vacation, a ritual dance around
an enormous pile of money will resume. And when this dance is done,
the first pot of black ink the government was supposed to have

   PRESIDENTS-IN-PUBLIC-REVIEW (Undated) _ There was a time when

news all the time and blanket Secret Service protection, it seems

cherished American activities of plant and lawn watering have been

people's behavior and save water. While the goal may be justified,
a basic question remains: How did this rap get pinned on the

to being in positions of power, are less susceptible to corruption.
Also, it is felt, women are easier to communicate and deal with. By

seemingly erratic behavior in naming a virtual unknown as his new

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia has carried out its threat to bomb guerrilla
bases inside Chechnya, widening its war against the Islamic rebels
in the North Caucasus, a spokesman for Russia's Interior Ministry
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials insisted the bases were being used by the
Islamic rebels to support their insurgency in neighboring Dagestan.
The bombing raids came as four Russian soldiers were killed and 13
wounded in a seven-hour clash in the mountains of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, was a measure of the intensified fighting. Before
Saturday, Russia's casualties in its military campaign against the
rebels had stood at 10 killed and 27 wounded. A Russian military
spokesman insisted that rebel casualties were far greater, but
there was no way to confirm those claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic fighters have vowed to seize the Russian region of
Dagestan and turn it into an Islamic nation. Russia's acting prime
minister, Vladimir Putin, has staked the credibility of his new
government on thwarting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's appointment was announced by Yeltsin just last week.
Russia's Parliament is scheduled to vote Monday on whether to
confirm him.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is broad agreement among Russian politicians that
the Islamic rebels need to be stopped. Putin's main political
adversary, Mayor Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, has also taken that stand.
</P>
<P>
   But while there is little debate about the goals of the military
operation, there is considerable anxiety that the Russian military
may repeat the mistakes of its violent and, ultimately, fruitless
campaign in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Although Russia insists that Chechnya is still formally part of
Russia, it has achieved a de facto independence. Compounding the
insult, one of the leaders of the new insurgency in Dagestan is
Shamil Basayev, the Chechen commander who defeated the Russians in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   As Putin vowed to battle the rebels and to achieve the sort of
victory that eluded the Russian military in Chechnya, Russian
officials rushed to tout their gains.
</P>
<P>
   They said the military had intercepted radio communications
indicating that the rebel commanders were in a state of panic and
were pleading for reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military, they also said, had captured the
interpreter for Khattab, the Jordanian militant who is also one of
the commanders.
</P>
<P>
   That, Russian officials insisted, should silence the rebel
boasts that they have suffered only a relative handful of
casualties. But the Russian military reported similar success
during the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating the Russian military's tactics is not easy since only
a few intrepid reporters have ventured into a lawless region rife
with bandits and kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazetta observed Saturday that the
military had also created an ``information blockade'' by issuing
terse reports on the fighting and requiring that reporters near the
battle area be accompanied by representatives of the Russian
military command.
</P>
<P>
   The official accounts, the newspaper complained, have sometimes
raised more questions than they have answered since occasionally
they have been contradictory. Moreover, Russian reporters do not
appear to have got close to the latest fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All television channels are showing the same and mostly old
footage,'' the newspaper observed.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, however, is that the fighting is intensifying.
There have been conflicting estimates about the size of the rebel
army. But one recent Interior Ministry projection said the
militants had about 1,200 fighters, one-third of whom were still
based in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said their military campaign will be completed
within two weeks, though they appear to be preparing the Russian
public for skirmishing that will last long after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We assume the anti-terrorist operation in Dagestan will be
completed within two weeks,'' Lt. Gen. Igor Zubov, the deputy
interior minister, told the newspaper Kommersant. ``Its goal is to
clean the regions now seized by the bandits, liberate the villages
and restore the legitimate power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be clear that some of the militants may go up to the
mountains to continue their terrorist activities,'' Zubov added. .
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Ministry officials said Saturday that Russian
helicopters and bombers carried out 19 airstrikes on guerrilla
positions on Friday, including one near the Chechen village of
Kenki, which is close to the border of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic rebels have not only used bases in Chechnya to supply
and reinforce their insurgency in Dagestan, the Russian spokesman
said, but have fired across the border as well.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the military was making progress in routing
the rebels from their villages and strongholds in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Russia continued to send reinforcements to
Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan. Five planes arrived there on
Friday with soldiers and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Vyacheslav Ovchinnikov, the commander of the Russian Interior
Ministry forces in the region, said that the military campaign
against the rebels was just getting under way and that the
large-scale operation would begin Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas, for their part, have threatened to make Russian
leaders their targets. That talk is being taken seriously in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russian journalists and Western diplomats reported the movement
of Russian armored personnel carriers around the capital last week,
apparently a precaution against a terrorist attack.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ The first pitch moved through the night
like a butterfly drunk on tequila, floating blithely past the
catcher. The second pitch sailed about like a party balloon
sputtering helium. The sixth pitch tripped and fell somewhere near
home plate, bouncing off a batter's shin.
</P>
<P>
   Six pitches into a New Jersey Jackals game against a lowly team
from Connecticut called the Waterbury Spirit, Mark Lemke found
himself with nobody out, runners on first and second base, and
3,000 spectators wondering what business he had being on the
pitcher's mound.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, didn't this guy used to play second base for the
Atlanta Braves when it won four National League pennants and a
World Series? What was he doing at a bandbox called Yogi Berra
Stadium, where foul balls prompt the recorded sound of breaking
glass and the recommendation to visit ``Mulligan Motors in Nutley
for all your automotive needs?''
</P>
<P>
   Such questions are beyond the concerns of this baseball
knight-in-training. At 34, Lemke is attempting a comeback by
embarking on the most offbeat path known to the sport, a path that
requires years of practice and the ability to embrace the mystical,
to entrust to the air the cowhide sphere that you offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke wants to be a knuckleball pitcher. And in that quest, he
becomes an almost mythical character in not one but two of the
game's most seductive story lines. The fallen baseball veteran
seeking redemption on backwater ball fields far from the glittering
baseball diamonds where he once starred. And the baseball Everyman,
pinning his major-league hopes on an improbable pitch that, with
enough practice, an overweight plumber in his 40s conceivably could
master.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the tiny clubhouse after the game, his right arm
wrapped in ice and his left hand clutching a can of beer, Lemke
pondered the question of whether he hoped this might lead to a
return to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say no,'' he said softly. ``But I don't think that
on the other hand it would crush me'' if no offer came. ``To be
honest with you, I enjoy playing the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The few knuckleball pitchers in the major leagues today are the
counterculture cousins to all other pitchers. Instead of
overpowering batters with spinning fastballs and curveballs, a
knuckleballer holds the baseball in an entirely different fashion _
essentially by the fingernails and fingertips _ and then lofts it
toward home plate with as little spin as possible.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, the leisurely pitch will veer this way, that way
and any way that catches its fancy, all while giving what seems to
be the Bronx cheer to physics. If it doesn't, the pitcher might as
well have thrown the ball underhand for the batter to hit over the
fence.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, many scientists wrote off confounded hitters _ ``a
butterfly with hiccups,'' the great hitter Willie Stargell once
called the knuckleball _ as victims of optical illusions. But in
recent years physicists have determined that the protruding
stitches on a barely spinning ball disrupt the air flow, cause
aerodynamic distress, and dramatically alter the ball's trajectory.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that can cause the baseball to act, in the vernacular of
baseball, as though it is fluttering,'' said Dr. Joel W. Hollenberg
of the Cooper Union School of Engineering. Hollenberg spent many
years addressing the aerodynamic questions posed by the
knuckleball, but has moved on to matters that he suggests are of
more value to humankind _ like trying to make hydrogen from water
by using sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   But the lure of the knuckleball is known to children and
scientists alike. Growing up in Utica, N.Y., Lemke joined the
legions of backyard ball tossers who spend waning summer days
trying to unlock the mystery of the knuckler. In addition to
wanting to make a ball jitterbug, they harbor the seductive fantasy
that learning to throw an effective knuckleball, a pitch that does
not tax the arm, might lead them to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Some of its masters, including the Hall of Famers Phil Niekro
and Hoyt Wilhelm, pitched well into their 40s; others have
displayed physiques more reminiscent of groundskeepers than of
professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a giant killer,'' said Jim Bouton, the former New York
Yankees fastball pitcher whose use of the knuckleball allowed him
to extend his career by several years. ``It's like David with a
slingshot. It allows a small man to humble a big man and do it
humorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching for that slingshot now is another small man, Mark
Lemke.
</P>
<P>
   In the 11 years he spent in the majors, Lemke never bathed in
the adulation that washes over the likes of Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa. Although his catlike quickness made him a premier second
baseman, he was not much of a hitter. Under the Ralph Kiner law
that home-run hitters drive Cadillacs, Mark Lemke drove a Yugo.
</P>
<P>
   But Lemke had certain traits that endeared him to students of
the game. He played so hard and with such boyish joy that he was
nicknamed ``Dirt.'' He was an integral member of the Atlanta
Braves, perhaps the dominant team of the 1990s. And in 62
post-season games, including appearances in four World Series, the
light-hitting Lemke seemed to will himself to greatness, hitting
well above his batting average and coming through at crucial
moments time and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a superstar on a team full of superstars, and he
didn't get much recognition,'' Tom Glavine, the Braves' star
pitcher, said in a telephone call to Yogi Berra Stadium the other
night. ``But he was a clutch player in the postseason, and
extremely underrated. And as a defensive player, he was as good as
it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   But professional baseball offers no promise of lifetime
membership. A slap-hitting second baseman who loses a half-step in
his 30s _ his hard style of play took its toll on his ankles and
his vision _ can suddenly find that hustle and attitude are not
enough. At the end of the 1997 season, the Braves brushed off their
beloved ``Dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemke hooked on for another year with the Boston Red Sox. But as
last winter gave in to spring, the silence of the telephone helped
him to realize that his major-league career, however remarkable,
apparently had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   There did come one telephone call, though, from Kash Beauchamp.
Beauchamp, a minor-league teammate of his in the 1980s, was now the
manager of the New Jersey Jackals of the independent Northern
League. Its players, from young prospects to aging veterans, hope
to attract the interest of a major-league franchise with the feats
they perform on ball fields in Allentown, Pa., Fargo, N.D. _ and
Little Falls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The two friends struck a deal. Lemke, who lives outside Atlanta
with his wife and family, would spend the summer coaching
Beauchamp's young infielders if he got to pitch his knuckleball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he told me he wanted to be a knuckleball pitcher, it hit
me,'' Beauchamp recalled. ``That's all he used to do. Everyone
messes around with it, but he would throw it every day. And when he
throws a good one, it's as good as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine had the same recollection. ``If I was having a catch
with him and he started throwing it, I'd stop having a catch with
him,'' he said. ``It was that good. But I wasn't about to take one
off the kneecap.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the mechanics of throwing the knuckleball, however, Lemke
must learn what Bouton calls the ``Zen quality'' of letting the
ball go.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the fastball and other pitches, you're controlling
everything,'' he said. ``The knuckleball, on the other hand, is the
opposite of all that. You can't make a knuckleball happen. There is
nothing you do with your hands except release it and leave it up to
the wind and the air and the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   The student Lemke said that he understood the concept. When he
strode toward the pitcher's mound this night, he did not hear the
cajun music being played to promote ``Mardi Gras Night,'' or notice
the mascot, Jack the Jackal, cavorting in the stands, or see the
Little Leaguers clutching his Atlanta Braves baseball card.
</P>
<P>
   He was concentrating on his mantra _ trust your knuckleball _
but it was mentally taxing. ``You can throw the greatest one in the
world,'' he explained, not bothering to hide his awe. ``And then
the next hundred don't do anything. It's the challenge of saying to
yourself, `How did I throw that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lemke got out of that first-inning jam with only one run scored
against him, and his teammates rallied to his cause by scoring 12
runs over the next two innings. By the fourth inning, he seemed to
have command of his knuckleball, consistently releasing it in the
general direction of the plate. The Spirits of Waterbury flailed
and whiffed and grunted.
</P>
<P>
   But when he started the sixth inning with his sixth walk of the
night _ the bane of knuckleball pitchers _ Beauchamp came out to
the mound to pull his friend from a game that the Waterbury Spirit
had all but conceded.
</P>
<P>
   According to the game's official scorer, Lemke had given up two
earned runs and only three hits in five innings, a success by any
measure. But there was also the unrecorded gift that he had
presented to those fans paying attention: knuckleball after
knuckleball, dancing summertime waltzes on a muggy night in New
Jersey.

SABBATH MOVE THREATENS COALITION IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel permitted the
truck transport of a huge metal turbine part on the Jewish Sabbath
on Aug. 14, defying an Orthodox party that forms a crucial part of
his coalition government and raising concerns over a possible
government crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Eliahu Suissa, the minister of national
infrastructure and a leader of the Orthodox Shas party, tried to
prevent the transport _ Jewish law prohibits vehicular travel on
the Sabbath. He threatened to take his party's 17 seats in
Parliament and leave the government.
</P>
<P>
   It was then announced that the turbine part would be moved on a
different day. But then the police said the 14-hour job would begin
on Friday night and be completed Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians were waiting until Saturday night, when the Sabbath
ends, to see whether Suissa would try to make good on his threat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak governs Israel with a 75-member coalition, providing more
than the majority he needs in the 120-member Parliament. But if
Shas were really to leave _ possibly followed by the five-member
United Torah Judaism party, which might not wish to seem less
concerned over violations of religious law than its colleagues _
Barak would no longer hold a majority.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear on Friday how seriously Suissa viewed the affair,
but there was analysis on Israel Radio suggesting that he had his
own internal party reasons for provoking a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His words, when the original plan was announced to move the
turbine part to an electrical power station in the coastal city of
Ashkelon, were unambiguous. He said that if the move went ahead he
could not imagine ``that there will be anyone with a kippa'' _
yarmulke, or skullcap _ ``on his head who will be willing to sit at
the government's table.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak responded that ``transporting oversized cargo on the
Sabbath has been the custom for 50 years and there is nothing new
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 250-ton turbine part moved at a pace of 10 mph and took up
nearly three lanes for the journey from an Israel Military
Industries plant near Tel Aviv to the electric company station in
Ashkelon.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making the move overnight on the Sabbath was to
avoid the traffic jams that would result at any other time. Some in
Israel do not drive on the Sabbath, and virtually nobody works
then.
</P>
<P>
   Some rabbis had called on their followers to protest if the
Sabbath transport went ahead, but perhaps because the move was
called off and suddenly revived, very few did so. About two dozen
strictly Orthodox followers shouted ``Shabbos!'' (Sabbath) at the
truck as it passed near the religious neighborhood of Bnei Brak.
</P>
<P>
   But secular Israelis who came to support the move far
outnumbered them. Perhaps 200 secular backers near Bnei Brak
cheered the flatbed, accompanied by 15 police cars and numerous
police motorcycles. Scores of others greeted it as it crawled down
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Transport of the turbine part had been held up for days because
of religious Jews' opposition to moving it on the Sabbath. On
Friday, Suissa said, ``An evil spirit has entered the decision
makers, including those at the prime minister's office, and it is
causing them to desecrate the Sabbath.''
</P>

   But on Thursday, the nation's High Court of Justice gave the
go-ahead to a Sabbath move on the grounds of public safety after
various efforts to find alternatives were rejected as impractical.
The proposals included transporting the part between midnight and 4
a.m. over three nights, with special parking areas reserved for the
truck.

   The political motives behind Suissa's move may have to do with
his loyalty to Aryeh Deri, the party's longtime chairman, who was
ousted after his conviction on charges of corruption. Other parties
had told Barak they would not sit in a coalition with a convicted
felon, so Shas dropped Deri, who is now in New York, and became
part of the government. Since Deri's departure, the party has been
rife with factionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some political analysts say they believe that Suissa's
calculation is that if a crisis ensues, the party will call on Deri
to return and save it.
</P>
<P>
   Religious concerns have long plagued Israeli governments that
have needed the participation of religious parties to govern.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Barak said Saturday that he did not believe this
issue should be permitted to cause a crisis, especially considering
that Shas had already participated in four governments that
permitted Sabbath transport of such objects.

   BONN, Germany _ ``It kind of reminds me of Saigon,'' said Tom
Jackson as he surveyed the dismal evidence of U.S. withdrawal here:
the closed American diner, the shuttered American bookstore, the
movie theater advertising its last movies, the emptying shelves of
the general store, where just two Butterball turkeys remained.
</P>
<P>
   After half a century when this modest city on the Rhine was a
government center, years when Germany was stabilized and the Cold
War was ultimately won, the United States is leaving town. Behind
the trucks headed for Berlin lies the sprawling evidence of a vast
mission that symbolized America's assumption of great-power
commitments in the postwar years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson _ ``U.S. Embassy Bonn, Ret.'' was the only way he would
describe his role _ said he supposed he too would move at some
point. ``It's like losing a chunk of your life,'' he remarked,
evidently unbuoyed by the fact that Bonn's abandonment stems from a
victory over communism, whereas Saigon fell to its advancing tide.
</P>
<P>
   What a war it was, the one quietly orchestrated here and
immortalized in John le Carre's spy novel of Bonn, ``A Small Town
in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the struggle to anchor a democratic Germany in Europe,
the cloak-and-dagger fight with the Soviet bloc, the battle over
the Berlin blockade and the Berlin wall, the confrontations with
the millions of Germans who were opposed first to Vietnam and later
_ in the 1980s _ to the deployment of U.S. missiles in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of things in Bonn,'' said Michael Polt, the
embassy's deputy chief, who has just moved to the new German
capital in Berlin, ``the number of staff in the embassy rose as
high as 1,400, our largest single bilateral mission. It was one of
the most elaborate American diplomatic communities that we ever had
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   How elaborate is clear in the area referred to in Bonn as Little
America _ the riverside community in the Plittersdorf district
where a victorious America began building houses for its diplomats
and spies in the 1950s because war-ravaged Germany had none to
provide.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American houses mushroomed, to more than 400.
Later, there was the U.S. post office, the American Embassy Club
with its nine tennis courts, its bowling alley and its vast indoor
swimming pool, the movie theater, the thrift store, the Bonn
Booster Club, the American School, the ball fields and even an
American gas station.
</P>
<P>
   A whole world, in fact, on a scale with the Cold War mission _
but conspicuously out of scale with the placid Rhineland town that
was chosen as Germany's postwar capital precisely because it was so
unthreatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even had our own heating plant,'' said Truman Brown, who
served in the U.S. Embassy in the late 1970s as an administrator.
``We were totally self-sufficient.'' He has now returned to Bonn as
the official charged with the mission of turning out the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Despondently, Brown led a visitor through the long, empty
embassy corridors of countless vacated offices where desks,
shelves, telephones, calculators and other bits and pieces await
disposal or transportation.
 &UR;  &LR; The ambassador, John Kornblum, always an enthusiast for Berlin,
was one of the first out. The commercial section moved the week
before last. A large printing plant used for embassy publications
was moved earlier. The Internal Revenue Service office will be one
of the last to go.
 &UR;  &LR;  In all, Brown said, about 140 truckloads will be needed to clear
cargo from a building that began life almost 50 years ago as the
U.S. High Commission, charged with winding down the allied military
occupation of Germany and creating in its place a solid alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was in the conference room just opposite the
ambassador's now-abandoned office that on May 5, 1955, the
agreement ending Germany's status as an occupied state was signed,
the country's sovereignty formally restored and Germany's entry
into NATO ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place was really the nerve center for Eastern Europe,''
said Brown, who expects to need about eight more months to complete
the last details of the move. ``It's unbelievable to see it like
this. I guess that without Mr. Gorbachev, we'd still be going
strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And Johnny Bevins would not be having such a strenuous time.
 &UR;  &LR; Bevins rides the trucks to Berlin to make sure nobody tampers with
America's secrets. He has already made the trip more than 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never leave the truck,'' he said.
 &UR;  &LR; The trip is long. By German law the drivers have to stop every two
hours for a short break, and every four hours for one hour. So a
trip that would take five or six hours of steady driving ends up
taking 10, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, Bevins will undertake a high-security mission
when the political section of the embassy, complete with its Cold
War secrets, moves to Berlin. ``It's a big move,'' he said.
``Everything very tightly controlled.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, some of the Americans in Bonn are staying behind.
Because the German Defense Ministry is not moving to Berlin _ the
symbolism of a Berlin-based German military is still too charged _
a few dozen U.S. military and other officials will remain in the
top floors of the embassy, forming a liaison office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, parts of the top four floors of the seven-story
building are to be kept by the State Department, at least for the
next several years. German Agricultural Ministry officials _ ``food
and beverage people,'' Brown said _ are moving into the rest of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   How long the United States will hold on to part of the embassy
depends to some extent on whether it is able to build one in
Berlin. A plan to begin construction next to the Brandenburg Gate
has been stalled by a drawn-out dispute with Berlin city
authorities over how large a buffer zone the building needs to be
secure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the more than 500 State Department employees who have
moved from Bonn will be scattered in several Berlin buildings,
principally the former U.S. Embassy to the now defunct East German
state. Several hundred other Bonn-based American diplomats have
moved to Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, the situation will clearly be far less cozy than in
the Little America that has been left behind and is now rapidly
being dismantled. America's few survivors in Bonn will no longer be
pampered.
</P>
<P>
   The movie theater will close at the end of this month, the
general store a month later. Already the seats at the movie theater
have been sold to the U.S. military in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The American Club, acquired by a German company, will close on
Oct. 31. The 400 American houses have all been sold or exchanged.
The American church has been given to the city of Bonn. Kornblum,
the ambassador, is expected to lower the flag at the embassy in
late September.
</P>
<P>
   The process will be dignified, unlike in Saigon, but a curtain
will be falling on a period of American history nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   On his card, Brown, the diplomat closing up shop, is identified
as ``coordinator of transitions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why `transitions' in the plural?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' he said. ``From Bonn to Berlin, from Bonn to Frankfurt,
from Cold War to post-Cold War, from one era to another. Plenty of
transitions. You name it.''

COURTS GROW MORE RECEPTIVE TO SUITS CHALLENGING QUALITY OF MANAGED
HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS list of states that have forced HMOs to defend themselves in
lawsuits in 14th graf.)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a string of rulings over the last 20 months,
judges across the country have begun allowing patients to sue
health maintenance organizations for medical malpractice, after
decades in which such claims were repeatedly rejected by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, federal and state judges often allowed HMOs and
other managed-care companies to avoid liability for their
decisions, saying patients had no right to sue for damages. But
rulings by judges in U.S. District Courts and appeals courts in
recent months show that they have become more receptive to lawsuits
attacking the quality of care provided by health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The suits have become common as patients chafe under the
cost-control restraints of managed care, now the dominant form of
health insurance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether patients should have the right to sue their health
insurance companies has been the most divisive issue before
Congress as the Senate and the House debate legislation known by
its backers as the patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently passed a bill that would expand protections
for a limited number of Americans in managed-care plans, after
rejecting Democratic efforts to guarantee the right to sue.
President Clinton said he would veto the measure because it offered
``toothless, half-hearted protections.'' A move is afoot in the
House to draft a version that would include new rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law that regulates employee benefits has long formed
a protective shield around HMOs. The law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, made it difficult for
consumers to win liability claims for the denial of benefits,
primarily because Congress wanted employers to establish health and
pension plans without being exposed to expensive litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and their lawyers have recently found ways to get
around a provision of the law that allows patients to recover only
the value of denied benefits, not punitive damages or compensation
for lost wages or pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a U.S. District Court in Urbana, Ill., ruled this
year that a woman could sue a health plan, Health Alliance-Midwest,
on the ground that its nurses failed to diagnose her husband's
cardiac distress over the telephone. A nurse told the 42-year-old
man, Gary L. Crum, that his chest pain was probably a result of
``excess stomach acids,'' the lawsuit said, but Crum died of a
heart attack a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kelly A. Crum, is challenging the ``quality of medical
care,'' not a denial of benefits, so she may press her claim under
Illinois' wrongful death statute, Judge Michael P. McCuskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995, the Supreme Court emphasized the broad reach of
ERISA, which pre-empts ``any and all state laws insofar as they may
now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.'' But since
1995, the court has emphasized its presumption that states may
exercise their ``historic police powers'' in ``fields of
traditional state regulation,'' including health care and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to hold health plans more accountable, state
insurance commissioners recommended this month that all states
establish appeal procedures for people who want to contest the
denial of care by health maintenance organizations. Model
legislation, issued by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, would allow consumers to appeal to an independent
panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that without a change in federal law, it is
difficult to sue an insurer for denying care to a patient under the
terms of an employee benefit plan. But plaintiffs are already using
novel arguments to win damages for inadequate quality of care _ in
short, for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when a patient sued for malpractice, the target was
usually a doctor. But Promutual Group, a malpractice insurer based
in Boston, says ``managed care organizations are being held liable
in more and more medical malpractice cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly D.E. Temchine, a Washington lawyer who represents managed
care organizations, said patients and their lawyers liked to name
HMOs as defendants because the health plans were seen as having
``deep pockets.'' In recent months, judges in 15 states have forced
HMOs to defend their actions in cases involving suicide, heart
attacks, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer and other illnesses.
Those states are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have said HMOs can be sued on a variety of legal
theories. Some courts have held HMOs legally responsible for the
negligence of their doctors, especially if the doctors act like
agents of the HMO. Other courts have allowed patients to sue HMOs
for ``breach of fiduciary duty,'' meaning their obligation to act
in the interest of participants and beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Judge Christopher F. Droney of U.S. District
Court ruled recently that one of the state's largest HMOs could be
sued for negligence by a man whose son had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Stewart R. Moscovitch, said the HMO had stopped
paying for psychiatric care at Danbury Hospital for his severely
depressed son, Nitai, and arranged for the youth to be transferred
to a drug treatment center, where he hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the lawsuit could go forward in state court
because it involved ``claims for medical negligence, not claims for
the improper denial of plan benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Moscovitch said: ``I felt that the
HMO in this case had to be held accountable. I do believe, and know
in my heart, that they killed my son by making a medical decision
for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice C. Ferreira, a spokeswoman for the HMO, Physicians Health
Services of Shelton, Conn., said, ``The tragic outcome of this case
saddens us all.'' But she added, ``Once all the facts are presented
in court, they will prove that PHS fulfilled its obligation'' to
the Moscovitch family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Democrats in Congress and some House Republicans say
the right to sue is an essential element of any managed-care
legislation, because health plans often decide what kind of care
patients receive. But Senate Republicans, HMOs, insurance companies
and employers adamantly oppose any new right to sue, saying it
would increase the cost of insurance and lead to an increase in the
number of Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ralph J. Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
addressed such concerns in a recent ruling. ``We acknowledge that
by allowing negligence claims, there will be a financial impact on
HMOs,'' he wrote. But, he insisted, ``patients enjoy the right to
be free from medical malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Trueman, a New York lawyer who has represented scores
of patients, said, ``The courts' willingness to protect the
consumer is consistent with changing public attitudes toward
managed care and the need to hold HMOs responsible for actions that
harm patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania this year allowed a lawsuit
against an HMO by a man who said he had become a permanent
quadriplegic because of a three-hour delay in his transfer to a
university hospital for treatment of an infection in his spinal
column.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan said the federal law on employee benefits barred
such claims, and to support its contention it cited several
decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court in the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the U.S.
Supreme Court ``noticeably changed tack'' in 1995. As a result, he
concluded, ``Congress did not intend to pre-empt state laws which
govern the provision of safe medical care,'' nor did it intend to
block lawsuits making negligence claims against an HMO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, a California jury returned the largest verdict to
date against an HMO: $120.5 million for a woman whose husband had
died of stomach cancer. The woman, Teresa Goodrich, was allowed to
sue because her husband, David, had been a county prosecutor, and
Erisa's limits on damages do not apply to health plans for
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rulings have pleased consumer advocates and caused
concern among managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans say the court decisions show there is no need for
changes in Erisa, because patients can vindicate their rights under
existing law.
</P>
<P>
   But patients' rights and judge's rulings are, at the moment,
somewhat unpredictable, and patients often must shuttle back and
forth between federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Trueman, the New York lawyer, said that despite recent court
victories for consumers, ``the law in this area is in flux, often
limited and at times confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Ohio State
University, said: ``It's still pretty clear that you cannot
directly sue a plan for denial of benefits, no matter how egregious
the denial is. That protects much of what health plans do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a consumer
group based in Santa Monica, Calif., said congressional action was
needed to clarify patients' rights.

KOSOVO NOTEBOOK: ALBANIANS RECLAIM PRISTINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-CLAMPDOWN) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At one end of one of Pristina's prime
shopping streets, known as Peyton Place, is a baby shop known as La
Poire. It was Serb-owned, and during the NATO war against
Yugoslavia, it was damaged by bomb blast, its windows shattered.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, during the war, its owners were replacing the
glass and preparing to reopen, an eerie sight then, because most of
the Albanian shops on the same street, at least those that had
survived the bombing, had been looted and burned by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Today La Poire is a charred ruin, looted and burned in turn by
Pristina's Albanians. In what is now an almost exclusively Albanian
town, the Albanians are busy putting their own shops in order.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, two young brothers, Berkan and Edroan Mumini,
18 and 15, worked with a neighbor, Rian Sherifi, also 15 and
wearing an earring, to rebuild the family grill restaurant,
Topkapi, which the Serbs had burned.
</P>
<P>
   Or tried to work. Actually, with the electricity off again, they
were sitting around drinking warm Coca-Cola canned in Macedonia,
about an hour away, across what remains a mostly unregulated
border. When the Cokes were done, they used the cans as ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was a gutted shell, but there are the beginnings
of a roof, and frames already installed for plate-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Mumini family remained in Pristina during the war, moving to
an aunt's apartment when Serbs took over their own, after doing
some looting. But they allowed his grandmother to remain, Berkan
said, and treated her decently. Still, it was too dangerous to keep
an eye on the restaurant, he said. ``We just stayed inside as much
as we could.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the restaurant burned on June 10, only two days before
NATO troops crossed into Kosovo, when the Serbs were withdrawing in
a last paroxysm of rage.
</P>
<P>
   What exercises Berkan now is the lack of any help to rebuild
Topkapi from the growing numbers of Westerners and aid workers who
fill the functioning restaurants of Peyton Place every night.
``Before we started the work, I took photos,'' Berkan said
hopefully. ``Will there be any kind of help at all?''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from friends, the family will spend about $6,000 to
put up a roof and put in kitchen equipment and tables.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people of the Mumini family will work in Topkapi, said
Berkan. ``Do you think they will help us if I send the photos to
the United Nations?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Peyton Place
</P>
<P>
   When asked how they feel now that the war is over, Albanians
speak in metaphors about breathing, about how they can breathe now,
or breathe more easily, or more freely.
</P>
<P>
   They walk more freely in Pristina, too, and speak more freely,
their Albanian unhindered by armed Serb police or army officers,
who had filled the streets during the war.
</P>
<P>
   At night, Peyton Place is packed with young Albanians, sitting
at tables sometimes in candlelight, when the electricity is gone,
nursing coffee or drinks.
</P>
<P>
   But for Mehmet Bashkim, a waiter at Bagram, a popular Albanian
restaurant that reopened in mid-June, the customers are doing more
sitting than spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here have a lot less money now, that's for sure,'' he
said. ``The only people that come here to eat dinner are the
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Cambodia or anywhere the outside world flocks to rebuild,
remake and reshape, foreigners are distorting the economy, creating
needs for services that will disappear when they do and absorbing
many of the young educated class as interpreters and ``fixers'' _
people who will serve as guides and arrange interviews for
journalists, but who might ordinarily work in local businesses,
universities or newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, too, the foreigners are overwhelming those services
that do exist. The mobile phone network in Pristina is now so
jammed that it is essentially unusable from about 8:30 in the
morning until nearly midnight. But part of the problem, too, are
the Albanians who lived and worked abroad, but who have now
returned, with their own cell phones.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politics of License Plates
</P>
<P>
   Pristina's roads now are packed with cars, but many of them have
German or Swiss license plates. Albanians returning from abroad
either own them or are trying to sell them, sometimes at such low
prices that NATO peacekeeping officials, with other problems to
attend to, assume that they have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   And many cars have no license plates at all, indicating that the
cars were either taken from others, including Serbs, or had plates
that would indicate Serb registration.
</P>
<P>
   The normal license plate, the Yugoslav one, has a small Serb
flag among the numbers, which replaced the old Communist red star.
Today people use white paint to cover the star or the flag, or try
to scratch off the color.
</P>
<P>
   But one clever entrepreneur has come up with a better solution:
a small decal of the Albanian flag, bright red with a double-headed
black eagle, that fits neatly over the hated Serb one.
</P>
<P>
   Cycle of Revenge
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the postwar cycle of revenge, fewer than 2,000 Serbs
remain in Pristina, according to the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees, from a prewar population estimated at 40,000. Between
20,000 and 25,000 live in all of Kosovo, down from the 180,000
estimated a year ago. Even those Serbs are being regularly harassed
and pressed to go, sometimes with fake eviction notices delivered
by Albanians with identification cards giving them spurious police
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Serbs found dead in the last three weeks,
peacekeeping officials say, have been executed, often forced to
kneel with their hands bound before being shot in the head. One
elderly Serb woman was drowned in a bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The refugee agency spokesman, Ron Redmond, said the situation
was worsening for those who remain. ``Old women are now being shot
through the doors of their apartments, including two women in their
70s,'' he said. ``It is highly unlikely that these people were
involved in the persecution of Albanians. But that doesn't seem to
matter to the thugs who are now terrorizing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping soldiers are now putting metal grilles over Serbs'
windows and doors to protect them, and sometimes even moving into
buildings where Serbs lived.
</P>
<P>
   In general, inevitably, Albanians here do not have much
sympathy, agreeing with a British newspaper headline: ``Serbs you
right.'' But U.N. officials find themselves forced at least to act
embarrassed, since they are committed to building a democratic,
multi-ethnic Kosovo with equal rights and security for all
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The former political representative of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, Adem Demaci, who spent more than 29 years in Yugoslav prisons
for his work for an independent Kosovo, described the departure of
his own Serb neighbors, an elderly couple.
</P>
<P>
   Some Albanians ordered them to go one night. ``I knew these
people were good, but how to prove it?'' Demaci said. He said that
peacekeeping soldiers stood guard until 10 p.m., but that in the
morning, he watched the couple go, probably to the Serb enclave
around the monastery of Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anger of the Albanians is so much _ it's too much,''
Demaci said. ``For our future this is very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As Demaci walked away toward home, a British soldier came up,
asking for someone who spoke English. He asked if anyone had heard
a brick go through the window of Serb house just a few minutes
before. No one had.

RENO PUTS A HUMAN FACE ON AN INHUMAN DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As an advocate for people with Parkinson's disease,
Joan Samuelson has pounded on many a Capitol Hill door trying to
increase funding for research into the incurable disorder. In
August 1996, she found herself with a rare opportunity to make her
pitch to a member of the Clinton Cabinet: Attorney General Janet
Reno, a fellow Parkinson's sufferer.
</P>
<P>
   But any illusion the advocate may have had about enlisting the
United States' highest law-enforcement officer in her cause was
quickly dispelled. ``She didn't feel she should make Parkinson's a
part of her public agenda,'' Ms. Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, three years later, Reno has little choice. The
characteristic tremors of her hands and arms have worsened in
recent months, making Parkinson's a part of her public persona, if
not her agenda.
</P>
<P>
   As if being caught in the crossfire between congressional
Republicans and a Democratic president were not stressful enough,
she must contend with questions about her health, and speculation
that she will resign before the end of President Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   She insists that she will not. Her neurologist, Dr. William
Weiner of the University of Miami, says her disease is still in the
early stages; both he and independent experts say there is no
reason at this point that Reno cannot work. ``There is nothing
about Parkinson's that precludes working,'' said Dr. Curtis Freed,
a well-known Parkinson's expert at the University of Colorado. ``It
is strictly between the person and their employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, the nation's first female attorney general, has held the
job longer than any of her predecessors in this century. With her
blunt words and image as a Washington outsider, she is a favorite
with voters beyond the Beltway, and she has long been admired by
female lawyers as a role model.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at age 61, the woman who is sworn to enforce the Americans
with Disabilities Act has herself become a symbol for the disabled,
particularly those with Parkinson's disease. The degenerative
neurological condition afflicts 1 million Americans, many of whom
remain ``in the closet,'' in Ms. Samuelson's words, because they
worry that they will lose their jobs, or that people will think
them incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Michael J. Fox kept his Parkinson's diagnosis a secret
for seven years before disclosing it last year. Doctors and
journalists suspected for months that Pope John Paul II had
Parkinson's, but Vatican officials did not confirm it until October
1996, partly because they feared that his ability to lead the Roman
Catholic Church would be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, by contrast, announced her illness on Nov. 16, 1995, at a
press briefing televised on C-Span, three weeks after she received
the diagnosis. At the time, the symptoms were confined to the left
side of her body; now both sides are involved. Yet as the disease
has progressed, the attorney general has adopted none of the usual
tricks _ clutching a pen, stuffing her hands in her pockets _ that
others may use to minimize its visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Janet handles this disease the way she handles everything
else: open, upfront, straightforward,'' said Donna Shalala, the
secretary of health and human services and one of Reno's closest
friends in the Clinton administration. ``She hides nothing.'' Other
patients and doctors say she is shattering myths, not by talking
about the disease _ she rarely does _ but simply by living with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of prejudice associated with
having a neurologic disease; people think if your hand shakes, you
can't think,'' said Weiner, who has treated the attorney general
for the past three years. ``She didn't volunteer for it, but she is
doing a service to the Parkinson's community to be out there
working, to be out in the open about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while speaking to the American Bar Association's
House of Delegates at the group's annual convention in Atlanta,
Reno's body gave her little relief. She spoke in the slow,
deliberate cadence that is her trademark. But her hands spoke at
their own pace. Her left arm bobbed up and down during the
20-minute address, while the fingers on her right hand fiddled with
the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is very brave,'' said Robert Witmer Jr., a lawyer
from Rochester, N.Y. ``I think it actually enhances the delivery of
her message to see someone who is coping with a physical disability
and not letting it deter her from her job.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of how Reno copes remain largely a private matter.
Although she permitted her doctor to be interviewed, she has
repeatedly declined to discuss her illness in detail, telling
reporters with questions to show up at her weekly briefing and ask
them. On June 18, one did. ``It doesn't bother me,'' she said then.
``And if you all will just get used to it, it won't bother you.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Weiner said that while Reno's tremors have indeed grown worse,
the more troubling symptom is one the public does not see, the
occasional stiffness she experiences while walking. Even so, the
doctor said, when he last examined the attorney general on July 19,
``she was doing well.'' He added: ``She was quite enthusiastic. She
had been mountain climbing in California and swimming in the ocean
here in Florida. She felt she had done well at that, and she was
quite proud of herself.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been Reno's image throughout her tenure in Washington:
the active, energetic nature lover, and friends and aides say she
seems determined not to let illness get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   She took her staff out kayaking on the Potomac a couple of weeks
ago, and she still sticks to what Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder described as a ``punishing'' schedule, making day trips to
cities like Chicago and Cleveland that begin at 5 o'clock in the
morning so she can return to work in Washington later the same
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's disease impairs its victims by killing the brain
cells that produce dopamine, a neurochemical that controls motor
function. The primary symptoms, at the outset, are stiffness and
tremors, but patients eventually lose all motor control.
</P>
<P>
   The disease progresses at different rates in different people,
and there is no way to predict how quickly Reno's condition will
deteriorate. About one-quarter to one-third of all patients have
cognitive impairment, but Weiner says there is no evidence of this
in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists assess Parkinson's patients according to five
stages. Reno is in the second stage, Weiner said, which means she
has stiffness and tremors on both sides of her body but is not yet
losing her balance or having trouble with other daily activities.
Last year, while attending a service at a Maryland church, Reno
fainted, but Weiner said the episode was unrelated to her disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of drugs for Parkinson's, but they treat
only the symptoms, and there is considerable debate among doctors
about how much medication patients should take, and what kind.
</P>
<P>
   Reno takes a relatively small amount: 2 milligrams per day of
pramipexole, a drug that mimics the action of dopamine in the
brain. It is not enough to control her symptoms completely, but
Weiner said complete control is not necessary, so long as the
patient is comfortable and can function.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are we treating?'' he asked. ``The patient, or the people
who have to look at the patient?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Parkinson's drugs stop working, which is one
reason advocates like Ms. Samuelson are so anxious for better
treatments, if not a cure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this year, Ms. Samuelson spoke
eloquently of her own frightening future: ``I have watched fellow
advocates and friends, people I loved, die the living death which
is end-stage Parkinson's, where you are a prisoner of your body,
unable to participate in the world, unable to move, unable to
speak, unable to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Reno say she has read about the disease and
understands the prognosis. But if she has any anxiety, or moments
of sadness or self-pity, they say, she does not reveal them. ``She
has just gone on,'' said her younger sister, Maggy Hurchalla. ``I
think the most striking thing she has done is not worry about
people worrying about her.''

PHONE FEE FOR SCHOOL INTERNET SERVICE TOO POPULAR TO OVERTURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Alaska, N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years ago, when the government imposed a new
fee on long-distance telephone companies to raise money for
Internet connections at schools and libraries, the reaction from
some quarters was ferocious.
</P>
<P>
   Republican politicians, assuming that people would be outraged
by the extra charges showing up on their phone bills, called it the
``Gore tax'' because Vice President Al Gore had championed the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative academics accused the Clinton administration of
distorting the marketplace, quietly expanding the federal role in
education and creating a new, expensive entitlement program.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance carriers were quick to put new line items on
phone bills identifying the extra charges they were passing along
to customers, and they screamed that costs would skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   But the program, officially called the e-rate, has proved to be
so popular that even the harshest critics now agree that further
complaints are futile.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that pork barrel trumped political,
ideological and commercial concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In the new school year, 80,000 schools and libraries across the
country will have new or improved high-speed Internet access
because of the program, and a total of more than 1 million
individual classrooms, in every state and presumably every
congressional district, will be wired.
</P>
<P>
   While a tight lid has been imposed on almost all other
government programs, spending for the e-rate, which appears nowhere
in the federal budget, has been increased by one-third to $2.25
billion in the coming school year. That makes it one of the federal
government's largest education programs _ significantly larger, for
example, than the $1.5 billion the government is allocating this
year to vocational and adult education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have large sums of money pouring into every school
district in the country, it's impossible to turn off the spigot,''
said a lobbyist who has worked against the program.
</P>
<P>
   Another opponent of the program, Adam Thierer, a communications
policy specialist at the Heritage Foundation, agreed there was no
turning back. ``Pork barrel has won out, no doubt about it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology has such appeal,'' Thierer added. ``If you're
against this, you're viewed as being against children. The
political dynamic at play here is very powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union Message in 1996, President Clinton set
the goal of connecting every classroom and library to the Internet
by the turn of the century. Now, because of the e-rate, it appears
as if that goal will essentially be met, and the president often
speaks of the success.
</P>
<P>
   At a political fund-raiser a week ago in Little Rock, Ark., with
Gore at his side, Clinton declared: ``Al Gore led the fight to make
sure that the federal government required all the schools in this
country to have affordable rates so that every classroom in the
poorest schools in America can be hooked up to the Internet. He did
that, and he deserves credit for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials seize every opportunity to point out
the local benefits. In a speech in Houston last month, William
Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission,
said, ``This week, we were able to send nearly $12 million to
schools and libraries right here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that schools and libraries should have access to
modern technology. Thierer, for example, said he would not want his
children to go to a school that was not connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been over whether the way to accomplish the
goal is through the back door. The Federal Communications
Commission, not Congress, decides how much money should be spent
under the e-rate program and who should receive it. And rather than
raise the money through general taxes, it all comes from the fee on
long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not doubt that there is a benefit to wiring our
classrooms and libraries today,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,
R-Texas. ``But to require captive consumers to pay the full cost
does not pass the fairness test.''
</P>
<P>
   From the administration's perspective, the problem is that the
Republican Congress would never have approved money directly for
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The e-rate program grew out of the sweeping 1996 legislation
that rewrote the nation's 62-year-old communications law. The
measure, a product of countless compromises and tradeoffs,
instituted a new era of competition in telephone and data services.
</P>
<P>
   One section of the legislation requires telephone companies (and
providers of cellular phone and pager services) to pay a fee to the
Federal Communications Commission so that all Americans can have
access to affordable telephone service and so that schools,
libraries and rural hospitals and clinics can receive discounts on
telephone service and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fee and the exact nature of the services it
would cover were left up to the commission to determine.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since telephones became a central part of American life
early in this century, some telephone users have subsidized others.
Businesses have subsidized residential users. Urban customers have
subsidized those in rural areas. The affluent have paid more so
that poor people could afford telephones.
</P>
<P>
   The theory has been that everyone benefits from universal access
to telephones, just as everyone benefits from a national highway
system and mail service that reaches everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hundt, who was Gore's prep-school classmate and the FCC
chairman from 1994 to 1997, saw the communications law as the path
toward the administration's goal of wiring classrooms and
libraries. Under the policy that he developed and that has been
followed by his successor, Kennard, long-distance companies pay a
fee of slightly less than 1 percent of their revenue into a
universal service fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the money raised by the fee is spent on telephone
service for rural communities and poor people. The other third,
$2.25 billion a year, is earmarked for the e-rate program. This
covers 20 percent to 90 percent of the cost of wiring and paying
the monthly bills from Internet service providers. The poorer the
schools' students or the libraries' neighborhood, the higher the
percentage of the cost that is covered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The companies pass along the cost of the fee to their customers.
AT&AMP;T, for instance, charges residential accounts 99 cents a month.
MCI Worldcom charges customers 7.2 percent of their long-distance
bill. Sprint charges 6.3 percent. One-third of this fee pays for
the e-rate.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the e-rate program to most consumers is 30 to 40
cents a month _ about the cost of a postage stamp, Kennard
frequently says.
</P>
<P>
   The program had a rocky start. Faced with criticism in Congress
and a report of poor management by government auditors, Kennard cut
back the financing last year to $1.7 billion from the original
$2.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But across the country, from the biggest cities to the most
remote communities, the response from schools and libraries has
been enthusiastic. Complaints from long-distance customers who are
footing the bill have dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Salvati, coordinator of the e-rate program for New York
City public schools, said seven to 12 classrooms in every school in
the city would be wired for high-speed Internet service when school
opens for the new year. The city received about $70 million for the
program through last June and expects another $70 million in the
new school year, Salvati said.
</P>
<P>
   Elva Scott, the volunteer librarian in Eagle, Alaska, an
isolated community with 500 residents near the border with the
Yukon Territory, said her library's grant allowed her to offer
residents 30 minutes of free time on the Internet every month and
more time at a charge of $3 for every 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this,'' Ms. Scott said, ``we were really out of the
loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents clearly misjudged the public's willingness
to pay a small amount of money to accomplish what is seen as an
important social goal. Encouraged by the political support and a
new management structure, Kennard returned in May to the $2.25
billion annual level.
</P>
<P>
   His position was bolstered last month when the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals rejected a challenge to the program on the ground
that the fee imposed by the FCC was an unconstitutional tax.
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, even the strongest supporters of universal
access to the Internet still worry about whether the communications
commission should be running a major education program rather than
Congress or the Department of Education or the education
authorities in the states and cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful program,'' said Patricia Aufderheide, a
professor of communications at American University here and the
author of a book on the 1996 telecommunications law. ``But it's
certainly making education policy in a backward way.''

FEARS RISE IN JAPAN OVER TEST OF NEW KOREAN MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By By CALVIN SIMS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ With no apparent diplomatic solution in sight and no
military ability to defend themselves, the Japanese are growing
increasingly jittery over North Korea's threat to test-fire a
long-range ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   In recent opinion polls and interviews, many Japanese have
expressed deep dismay over the planned missile launching, which
could occur despite strong efforts by Japan, the United States and
South Korea to dissuade Communist North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they have felt particularly vulnerable since August
1998, when North Korea launched a medium-range version of the
Taepodong missile that flew over the Japanese mainland and into the
Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence officials from Western and Asian countries said
their latest surveillance information showed that North Korea was
continuing preparations to launch the second missile, a
Taepodong-2, and that rocket fuel had been delivered to a launching
pad in North Hamkyong Province.
</P>
<P>
   Kanako Omotani, a 30-year-old office worker, who was passing
through Tokyo's busy Shinbashi train station, said she was worried
about the missile ``because we don't know where it's going to
drop,'' adding, ``We are not sure whether they are aiming at us or
not,.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Omotani's husband, Tomoji, 41, agreed. ``Even if they have
a target,'' he said, ``they will fail to hit it because their
technology is very bad, and the missile could fall on us. I'm very
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent opinion survey by Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest
daily newspaper, about 70 percent of 3,000 people questioned said
they feared that war in the region could jeopardize their country's
security. About 60 percent said they feared a direct attack on
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Akio Watanabe, a military expert at Aoyama Gakuin University,
says that perhaps more than any other country Japan feels
susceptible to North Korea's missiles because it has no means to
protect itself, and many Japanese have little faith that a system
proposed by the United States as a defense against missiles will
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason people are afraid is because the first
Taepodong missile flew over our heads,'' Watanabe said. ``Why
didn't North Korea point it in some other direction? Apparently
that was some message for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite Japan's history of pacifism since its
devastating defeat in World War II, many Japanese now believe that
their country should greatly expand its defenses against missile
attacks and invasions.
</P>
<P>
   Takeo Kawai, a 54-year-old executive, put it bluntly: ``If we
are attacked by them, then we should be prepared to counterattack.
It would be better to have a dialogue, but that's impossible with
North Korea.''
</P>
<P>
   Mie Sakamoto, 21, a college student, said, ``We should develop
our own military capacity, especially since the United States won't
do it for us. Japan is America's dog. We do anything they tell us,
but in the end, they won't take care of us.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Japanese Cabinet approved an agreement to conduct
research with the United States to develop a system to detect
incoming ballistic missiles and destroy them with intercepting
missiles or by other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Sadaaki Numata, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry,
acknowledged that there was ``a high degree of concern on the part
of the Japanese people,'' but he said the government was continuing
its diplomatic efforts with the United States and South Korea and
remained hopeful that a resolution could be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Some American and Japanese officials say a launching does not
appear imminent because it will take days if not weeks for North
Korea to outfit the missile for firing. But Japan's Defense Agency
is taking no chances of being caught off guard, as it was last year
when the first Taepodong was launched.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has stepped up its reconnaissance by deploying ships
and aircraft in the Sea of Japan, and it has promised to inform the
public immediately in the event of a launching.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, two U.S. Navy ships equipped with missile-tracking
radar systems left a naval base in southern Japan, causing
speculation that they were on their way to monitor a possible
launching.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Japanese were worried. Sou Uchida, 38, an office worker,
said, ``The fact that Japan considers this North Korean missile so
scary is very troubling because there are so many other important
things to be concerned about. Japanese people are overreacting.
Instead of worrying, we should help North Korea and make them rich
and happy.''

AS PROTESTANTS MARCH, POLICE AND CATHOLICS CLASH IN ULSTER
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Police officers of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary clashed Saturday in cities across Northern Ireland
with Roman Catholics protesting Protestant parades through Catholic
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were arrested and scores were injured, most
of them not seriously, as protesters confronted policemen who
carried heavy shields and truncheons, which they used to clear the
demonstrators away from the parades.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators shouted abuse at the Protestant marchers, who
were celebrating the 310th anniversary of the defeat of James II, a
Catholic, in Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations over the parades occurred in Belfast, Lurgan
and Londonderry. They came as the people of Omagh, in the center of
the predominantly Protestant British province, prepared to
commemorate the first anniversary of a bombing by a splinter group
of the Irish Republican Army that killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, supported the
demonstrations and accused the police of brutality, which the
police denied. In the past, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams has
acknowledged that Catholic protests over the Protestant parades are
a part of the republican strategy to advance Sinn Fein's position
in the northern peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have been stalled for more than a year in a
dispute over the disarmament of the IRA and over Cabinet posts for
Sinn Fein in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly was
created under the 1998 peace agreement with a view to giving the
province's minority Catholics more power.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials, including mainstream Catholic politicians, said
Sinn Fein was using the protests to satisfy hard-line members of
the IRA who are restless with Adams' policy of trying to negotiate
with the Protestant unionist majority without violence.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's demonstrations, the officials said, also had the
effect of counterbalancing the plan for a memorial service in Omagh
on Sunday for the victims of last year's bombing. The bomb was
planted by an IRA splinter group calling itself the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The main IRA has observed a cease-fire for two years but has
refused to disarm. A new session of the assembly will take up this
problem in Belfast next month.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast on Saturday morning, police said 19 officers and
several civilians were injured in clashes on the Lower Ormeau Road
as about 20 members of the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry
marched through the area. There were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Television on Saturday night showed policemen dragging sitting
protesters off the Lower Ormeau Road. They responded by kicking.
The police then clubbed the protesters' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rice, leader of the Catholic neighborhood group and a
former IRA prisoner in a British jail, said the police had been
``brutal, absolutely brutal,'' in clearing several hundred
protesters out of the way of the march.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers then boarded a bus for Londonderry, where the main
Apprentice Boys ceremonies were held in honor of the young
apprentices who in 1689 locked the gates of the city against James
II. James was eventually defeated by his Protestant son-in-law,
William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In Lurgan, 20 miles west of Belfast, police said that protesters
in a Catholic area threw gasoline bombs and rocks at police
officers and that several masked men attacked police lines with
cudgels. The police said they fired five plastic bullets and made
five arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Londonderry, in the west of the province, a Protestant parade
in the city center passed without significant violence at noontime
along the old wall of the city, near the Catholic Bogside area. In
the Catholic neighborhood of Creggan, two cars, apparently owned by
Protestants, were hijacked and burned.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 police officers were deployed in Londonderry,
which Catholics call Derry, after Assistant Chief Constable Alan
McQuillan said he expected ``extremist republicans'' to cause
``serious damage, to organize it, to orchestrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They will involve young people in it and have created petrol
bombs for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein scoffed at the statement, said the civil rights of
Catholics were being violated and praised the protesters. In the
past, when Sinn Fein wanted to defuse sectarian conflicts, Adams or
his top aide, Martin McGuinness, have issued calls for calm. There
were no such calls Saturday.

RWANDAN IN GENOCIDE CASE MAKES LAST PLEA TO STAY IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Rwandan under indictment for genocide by an international war
crimes tribunal in Africa made a final plea to the Supreme Court on
Friday to avoid deportation from the United States, American
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan is Elizaphan Ntakirutimana, a Seventh-day Adventist
pastor and a Hutu accused of inciting the massacre of hundreds of
frightened Tutsi hiding in his church compound in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only suspect sought by either the Rwanda or Balkan war
crimes tribunal who is in American custody.
</P>
<P>
   His deportation to the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda, which the State Department has fought for since 1996, would
be the first such action by the United States. Several African
nations have turned over suspects to the court, which is based in
Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsley Moghalu, a spokesman for the tribunal, which was set up
by the U.N. Security Council, says that all nations are required to
cooperate in making arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Legal hurdles raised over the last three years to prevent
Ntakirutimana's deportation have been an unexpected embarrassment
to the Clinton administration. The United States had been
instrumental in forming the tribunal in 1994, after hundreds of
thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in Rwanda
following the death in a plane crash of a Hutu president.
</P>
<P>
   The United States blocked Security Council efforts to intervene
while the genocidal campaign was in progress, a policy for which
President Clinton has since apologized to Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was living with a son, Eliel, an anesthesiologist
in Laredo, Texas, when he was arrested by federal marshals in 1996.
In Rwanda, he had been the chief pastor of a large church with an
affiliated hospital in Mugonero, in the western region of Kibuye.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the spring of 1994, the Rwanda tribunal prosecutors
charge, he first encouraged Tutsi families to seek shelter in his
church compound, then led a Hutu militia into the area to attack
them. Another son of Ntakirutimana is already in custody in Arusha
under indictment in the same attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Ntakirutimana case was taken up by Seventh-day Adventists in
Texas, where the pastor was portrayed as the innocent victim of
Tutsi revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Before the State Department could arrange the elder
Ntakirutimana's deportation, a Texas magistrate released him in
1997, calling the agreement under which he was to be turned over
``unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   The action sought by the State Department is not an extradition,
normally carried out under pacts between countries, but a unique
procedure that Congress authorized in a 1996 law intended to open
the way for American cooperation with the ad hoc tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana was rearrested last year and has been appealing
the case. He lost the appeal in a U.S. district court earlier this
month. That left him with only an appeal to the Supreme Court. As a
preliminary move, his lawyers asked the Supreme Court on Friday for
a stay of deportation while an appeal is considered.
</P>
<P>
   Ntakirutimana's defense has been led by a former U.S. attorney
general, Ramsey Clark, who served in the administration of
President Johnson. Clark has challenged the legality of the
tribunals and sees nothing in the U.N. charter that allowed for
them to be set up.

Barak is running Israel like a commando. He has pushed most of the
traditional doves from key roles in government and brought in
colleagues from his army days. They talk of their ``mission'' and
keep plans so hush-hush that even traditional allies are either
baffled or angered. He favors discipline over politics, even to a
nearly authoritarian degree. For example, when Cabinet ministers
engaged in the usual practice of leaking their proposals to the
press before cabinet meetings, Barak sent word that any proposals
leaked to the press would not be brought up in the meetings.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ The end of the world is near, warned
some superstitious Russians, who trusting in the country's mystical
folklore saw a bad omen in the final solar eclipse of this
millennium. Russia survived the cosmic phenomenon; it is coping,
too, with last week's Kremlin phenomenon. President Boris Yeltsin,
and his inner circle of political operatives and business tycoons
produced yet another shock by naming ex-spy Vladimir Putin as
Russia's fifth prime minister in the past 18 months. At work in
Russia isn't some strange alignment of the stars, but gritty,
down-to-earth politics that has slowed progress on key issues with
the United States _ namely arms control and reviving the Russian
economy. The campaign season has begun, with national parliamentary
elections scheduled for December and the vote for president to take
place next summer when Yeltsin's term ends. (Holmes, Cox News

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ How's this for spin? Russian officials
recently delivered the good news that the country's economy will
not expand this year. In a sign of the times, the government issued
the promising forecast that the economy would remain flat in 1999,
compared to earlier estimates that predicted the downward spiral
that commenced last summer would continue. One year into its
deepest economic crisis since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia's
outlook is assessed not so much by what's going right, as by the
horrible things that could have _ but haven't _ gone wrong. Even
last week's abrupt firing of the government by President Boris
Yeltsin barely made a ripple on the economy. (Holmes, Cox News

   MEXICO-MADRAZO _ MEXICO CITY _ Roberto Madrazo has a grin and a
gleam in the eye that reflect a politician who knows he's on top.
Madrazo wants to be the first man democratically elected on Nov. 7
as presidential nominee for Mexico's Revolutionary Institutional
Party. The PRI, which has provided Mexico with its presidents for
70 years, has never had a primary election until this year. And
Mexicans have never seen a bruising attack campaign -- via
television and campaign slogans - like the one Madrazo launched
this month against his closest rival, Francisco Labastida, who is
perceived as the PRI establishment's favorite. As Madrazo, who
recently resigned as governor of Tabasco state and is slightly
ahead or even with Labastida in polls, works his way through
barrios here, he cultivates a ``man of the people'' image, tapping
into deep anger over the economy and other problems. (Ferris, Cox

COMMENTARY: WILL YOU, WARREN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I can tell you in one word why Warren Beatty won't
run for president: lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The man is a master at putting himself in the most flattering
light, literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   He can instruct the technicians on the Larry King show about the
best way to light him. Once, while I was interviewing the star at
his candle-lit dinner table in Hollywood, he wanted to read me
something about Tennessee Williams. Instead of turning on a lamp,
he fetched a tiny flashlight. You've got to like a guy who cares
about chiaroscuro.
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old movie man is just as finicky about his image.
Other than ideologically, he is far from the rollicking, fearless,
reckless politician he created in ``Bulworth.'' Beatty is a
connoisseur of shadows. The elliptical is his element. He believes
in the power of the unseen.
</P>
<P>
   He kindles to the game of cat-and-mouse with reporters,
manipulating the way he is portrayed. He scrupulously weighs every
word for every possible effect. He dissects every question,
flashing an ankle only when the angle is propitious.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who enjoys control, anyone who can retreat behind his big
gate, would hate to be plunged into the uncontrollable insanity of
a campaign, trapped in a boring primary with bad production values,
pigs, bales of hay and reporters rooting around in your private
life.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's a nutty season, a time when Jesse
Ventura and nonpoliticians are cherished. The instant Beatty said
he might consider considering, he racked up 25 percent in an ABC
News poll on the Web, following Bill Bradley's 29 percent and Al
Gore's 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the actor has long been passionate about politics. Growing
up in a Washington suburb, he dreamed of becoming president. But he
was never that comfortable addressing the public. Campaigning for
McGovern in 1972, he confessed he sometimes felt ``silly'' and
``embarrassed'': ``I think the public is innately suspicious of the
self-forwarding, publicity-seeking, capricious artist who would
like to attach some mood of seriousness to his persona by
participating in public affairs.'' (Yup.)
</P>
<P>
   The Beatty boomlet seems a mere late-summer diversion for his
pal Pat Caddell, the apocalyptic prognosticator who has long been
disillusioned with the Democrats, and columnist Arianna Huffington.
</P>
<P>
   On MSNBC, Caddell, an adviser on such fiascoes as President
Carter's malaise speech and New Coke, was gassing up the Beatty
bandwagon: ``Is there a need? Is there a vacuum? ABSOLUTELY!''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point. In a world where Gary Bauer and Bob Smith think
they can be president, where W. is still learning his foreign hot
spots and Al is learning how to keep audiences awake, where Steve
Forbes can bankroll a vanity candidacy, why not Bulworth? In an
airless and funless and substanceless race, Beatty could inject
some useful mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Beatty to enter the race and draw all of this attention
would be the most emphatic statement about the hollowness of
politics now,'' says Ron Brownstein, the L.A. Times columnist who
wrote the book about the Hollywood-Washington nexus, ``The Power
and the Glitter.'' ``It would be a wonderful agitprop way of
showing how entertainment values are eating away at the political
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty is aiming more for idealism than cynicism. But Brownstein
was reminded of a story from his book: In a 1972 publicity stunt
for ``The Candidate,'' Robert Redford went on a mock whistle-stop
tour through Florida, attracting larger crowds than the
presidential candidates. He would go to the back of the train and
declare: ``I appreciate your coming out. I only ask you to think of
this, my friends: I have absolutely nothing to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty's brazen liberalism, reflected in the raps and rants of
``Bulworth,'' seems anachronistic. But he has a hankering to ignore
polls and make liberalism chic again, the way another actor
rekindled conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   He is most offended by what he sees as a movement toward ``a
plutocracy'' _ the corrosive influence of campaign money on
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's a peculiar message from a rich, pampered star. But in our
culture, politicians can be celebrities and celebrities can be
politicians. However provocative a Beatty campaign would be, even
he must worry that it would go straight to video.

COMMENTARY: AMERICA'S TWIN EVILS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buford O. Furrow Jr. is the symptom. We can deal with him. Lock
him up. Convict him. Kill him.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you deal with that sickness in the nation's soul that
will still be there even after a fiend like Buford Furrow is gone,
a sickness that is already spawning future Furrows?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's a sickness all right. There is something very wrong
when you have youngsters barely out of the toddler stage looking
warily over their shoulders as they head into day care. Two of the
children shot last Tuesday in Los Angeles were 6 years old, and the
other was 5.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-aged girl and a 68-year-old woman also were shot. Furrow,
who intended the wounds to be fatal, said he wanted to send a
``wake-up call to America'' to kill Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Even now we are not paying enough attention to this. A bullet in
a Jew is a bullet in every American. Violence and hate are the
perennial threats to America from within. If a grown man
deliberately shooting Jewish children is not enough to make us do
something real about these twin evils, I'm not sure what will.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years we have tended to throw up our hands and behave
as if we were helpless in the face of cauldrons of violence and
hate like Furrow. We distance ourselves. We ask questions. Was he a
loner? Was he crazy? Was he part of a conspiracy? Whatever. It's
the death penalty for him _ the electric chair, or the gas chamber,
or that marvelously lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   We express our horror and indignation and move on, carefully
avoiding that something in ourselves that nurtures the attitudes
that create the environment that produces the man with the gun.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago in Billings, Mont., someone threw part of a
cinder block through a window in which a menorah was displayed.
Glass from the shattered window landed on a child's bed. Jewish
families were thus faced with a dilemma _ give in to the haters and
hide a symbol of their religion or display it and risk becoming a
target.
</P>
<P>
   The response of thousands of non-Jewish families in Billings was
to express solidarity with their Jewish neighbors by putting paper
menorahs in the windows of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   It is the responsibility of all of us to rise up against
intolerance wherever it manifests itself. That might be in our own
homes, or somewhere in the neighborhood, or at school, or among the
politicians who seek our votes, or on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It takes courage. But when you do nothing you end up with
innocent kids trying to outrun the gunfire of a madman. You end up
with Joseph Ileto, a mailman, lying dead in the street because of
his Filipino heritage. You end up with the United States of
America, a great country, not being nearly as great as it could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have to really live tolerance, brotherhood and
caring in this country in a real way,'' said Morris Dees, legal
director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate
groups and monitors hate crimes in the U.S. ``But nobody really
thinks it's a major agenda issue. It's not as pressing as budget
matters, or some of these other problems, but it's an issue that
affects the very fabric of this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this most prosperous of times violence and hate are
changing the way we live. The lead paragraph in the tead story in
Friday's Times said:
</P>
<P>
   ``At rural schoolhouses and sprawling urban campuses across the
country, millions of students returning to class in the next few
weeks will encounter a steely array of new security measures. In
many schools, lockers are being removed, cameras are being
installed as hallway monitors, and students will have to swipe a
computerized ID card just to get in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, there is still resistance to comprehensive gun
control, which should be the easiest part of this whole thing. Just
get it done. Licensing and registration should be universally
required, with a photo ID and the gun owner's address on the
license. Purchases should be limited to one gun a month. Dealers
who violate the law or try to thwart the spirit of gun control
should be run out of business.
</P>
<P>
   We should not allow ourselves to be the hostages of violence and
hate. Tolerance is not so bad once you get used to it. And a
healthier society is a lot easier on the children.

<P>
   Lane Kirkland, who was president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995 _ an extremely troubled time for American workers _ and who
resigned after an unprecedented revolt of union presidents against
him, died Saturday morning at his home in Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as
president of the AFL-CIO and his longtime friend and mentor, led
the U.S. labor movement for nearly 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the
labor organization, the U.S. economy and the workplace experienced
drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership
shrank, and the importance of unions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The growing concern for labor's future in the United States, a
concern that contributed to Kirkland's downfall, contrasted with
its relatively powerful influence abroad, an influence that
Kirkland helped to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was an ardent anti-communist and proud of his
organization's efforts to help the Solidarity movement in bringing
democracy to Poland by any means it could. During the 1970s and
'80s he worked tirelessly to help Solidarity topple the communist
government, surreptitiously channeling organization money and fax
machines to the movement led by Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of solidarity owes a lot to Lane,'' said Henry
Kissinger, a close friend of Kirkland. ``He supported it with funds
and organizers, and he had a big effect on American
policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major criticism of the labor leaders who forced him from
office was that he lacked the same intense interest when it came to
energizing American workers and winning them over to trade
unionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has become more vigorous since Kirkland's
resignation, it remains unclear whether the U.S. labor movement can
ever rebound and recapture its former power. When Kirkland assumed
office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to
unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lane Kirkland _ everyone called him Lane _ was born on
March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers
Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson. A
great-great-grandfather, Thomas Jefferson Withers, signed the
Confederate declaration of secession, and Kirkland often referred
to the Civil War as the ``War of Northern Aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was raised in Newberry, S.C., where he attended public
schools, and where many of his classmates were sons and daughters
of mill workers. ``They'd leave school to work in the mills, and
conditions were rather bad,'' he once told The Washington Post.
``If they'd fire a guy, he'd lose his house; he'd lose everything.
There's no better way to get an education in becoming liberal than
to be exposed to those sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the United States entered World War II, Kirkland
unsuccessfully attempted to join the Canadian military. In 1940, he
became a cadet on the SS Liberator, a merchant marine ship.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
Upon graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American
ships transporting war materiel, sailing to South America, the
beachheads at Sicily and Anzio, and the Solomon Islands in the
Pacific. He always retained his membership in the Masters, Mates,
and Pilots Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kirkland entered the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University, graduating in 1948. He then worked as a
researcher with the American Federation of Labor, becoming a
specialist on pensions and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer, he was on loan in 1948 to the Democratic Party
to write speeches for Alben Barkley, President Harry Truman's
running mate. In 1952 and 1956 he wrote campaign speeches for Adlai
Stevenson, the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He always impressed Meany, who had become president of the AFL
in 1952 and who became president of the AFL-CIO in 1955 when the
labor federation merged with the Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Kirkland became director of research and education for
the International Union of Operating Engineers, but in 1960 he
returned to the AFL-CIO as Meany's executive assistant. He directed
the organization's daily operations and often represented it on
Capitol Hill and at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Always negotiating, he helped resolve jurisdictional disputes
among AFL-CIO unions _ then a major problem in labor _ and helped
to settle the mass-transit strike in New York City in 1966. He
pushed strongly for a fair-employment-practices provision in the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1969, Meany selected Kirkland to be secretary-treasurer,
the No. 2 position in the organization. His opposition to the
policies of the Nixon administration earned him a place on the
president's notorious ``enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland continued his intense interest in international
affairs, maintaining that they were too important to be left to ``a
tight incestuous breed of economists and diplomats.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and
was instrumental in the AFL-CIO's refusal to support Sen. George
McGovern as the Democratic candidate for president in 1972. In 1976
he was a founder of the Committee on the Present Danger, which
demanded larger military budgets to confront the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as Meany's health declined, Kirkland often ran the
labor organization. In September 1979, Meany, then 85, announced
his retirement, and in November Kirkland was named president even
though he remained a remote figure to many union members.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Kirkland set a tone for his
administration, making clear, in his tart manner, the importance
that he placed on getting nonaffiliated unions to join the AFL-CIO.
He said that ``all sinners belong in the church'' and unaffiliated
unions should renounce ``petty personal or pecuniary
considerations, or ancient and tedious grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   He regarded as his biggest achievement persuading the
autoworkers, the mine workers, the longshoremen and warehousemen,
and the teamsters to join or rejoin the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was proud of other changes under his leadership. He
placed the first woman on the labor organization's executive
council and increased the participation of blacks and Hispanics. He
agreed to establish an institute to train new organizers. He also
continued the AFL-CIO's vast foreign operations in Europe, Africa,
South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But huge problems emerged with his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was, as is said in the garment trades, an inside guy,
not an outside guy. He often seemed detached, sometimes arrogant,
incapable of banter or pleasantries. He was given to withering
ripostes, and seemed to detest the media, often refusing interviews
and requests to appear on television, even on Labor Day, saying he
found it demeaning. He said reporters should periodically be
condemned to their morgues to read their clippings, an exercise he
believed would show the shallowness and inaccuracy of much of
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Kirkland spent too much time on international
affairs and not enough time on domestic concerns and that he linked
American labor too frequently with conservative unions in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   They also maintained that in its foreign policy, Kirkland's
organization too often allied itself with American corporations. In
1993, when Congress debated a bill to ban permanent replacement
workers, Kirkland was in Europe. The AFL-CIO spent more money on
international affairs than on organizing, civil rights and workers'
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, fundamental change was occurring in the U.S.
economy. In the 1980s, one industrial plant after another closed,
and whole communities were in distress. The service economy, with
little union organization, expanded. Jobs were lost to new
processes and foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Strike after strike, including one by the air traffic
controllers in 1981, was unsuccessful, and labor suffered numerous
defeats in Congress, including its failure in 1993 to block passage
of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which unions opposed
because of concern over losing jobs in the United States. In 1994,
Republicans won control of the House and the Senate for the first
time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, organized labor failed to expand its
membership and Kirkland's critics in the union movement said he
lacked the vision to reverse the slide.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, in a remarkable event for labor unions, whose
culture stresses loyalty, discipline and the private settlement of
problems, an open revolt broke out. Not since John L. Lewis and
others left the AFL in 1935 to form what became the CIO had such a
raucous, public fight occurred in American unionism.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt was led by Gerald McEntee, president of the municipal
workers; John Sweeney, then president of service employees; Richard
Trumka, then president of the mine workers; and Ronald Carey, then
president of the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee doggedly followed Kirkland to speaking engagements,
engaging him in impromptu debates. Union leaders, acting
anonymously, condemned Kirkland in statements to reporters and he
was assailed at a February 1995 executive council meeting in Bal
Harbour, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney twice asked Kirkland to retire. He knew that President
Clinton had offered Kirkland the ambassadorship to Poland, and he
suggested that the union leader accept it and make way for new
leadership. But Kirkland, always a stubborn man, refused to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In June that year, with presidents of some 20 unions opposing
him, Kirkland said he would resign in August, becoming the only
president in the American Federation of Labor's then 109-year
history to be forced to step down. Thomas Donahue, the AFL-CIO's
secretary-treasurer, and Kirkland's choice to be his successor,
announced his candidacy for the presidency. But in October,
Sweeney, the leader of an opposition slate, defeated Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Kirkland was rarely in the pubic eye. He
never forgot or forgave Sweeney and the other insurrectionists,
saying that they engaged in ``mendacity and falsehood.'' He said
the labor movement had always had difficulties, given its many
enemies, but was built for ``heavy weather.'' And he took pride in
the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, believing
that he and the AFL-CIO had helped bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kirkland was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include Kirkland's wife, the former Irena Neumann, a
German concentration-camp survivor whom he married in 1973, and
five children from his first marriage, to Edith Draper Hollyday,
which ended in divorce in 1972. The children are Blair Hollyday,
Lucy Alexander, Louise Richardson, Edith Hollyday and Katharine
Hollyday, all of whom live in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by five grandchildren and two great
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland had broad interests that included gardening, gin rummy,
wine, jazz, modern art, archaeology and hieroglyphics. He was a
constant smoker, and his trademark, along with a sharp tongue, was
a long, yellowed holder with a burning cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of articles about him over 20 years, only one, in 1984
in The Washington Post, showed him at ease. He was portrayed in his
home, in Washington, playing ``Amazing Grace'' on his Marine Band
harmonica, in the manner of a sailor at sea, with his dachshund
Stanley howling in delighted accompaniment.

   LIMA, Peru _ As recently as one year ago, Peru and Ecuador were
preparing to go to war, something they have done with regularity
ever since the Peruvian Navy blockaded Ecuador's principal port in
1860.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that the squabbling neighbors are finally learning
to live together, Ecuador President Jamil Mahuad finished a
three-day visit through Peru on Friday, complete with banquets,
honorary university degrees and a triumphal tour through downtown
Lima arm in arm with President Alberto K. Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by a failing economy and increasing protests at home,
Mahuad came to Peru to consolidate the gains won last October when
the two countries signed a peace treaty brokered by the United
States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile to settle a longstanding border
dispute over a 50-mile swath of the Condor Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents were jeered at on Friday as they drove
through Iquitos, the political and economic center of the Peruvian
Amazon, by hundreds of protesters who say the treaty gives Ecuador
too many commercial rights in their region. But most analysts
called the visit a success that augurs well for future relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori and Mahuad dressed in matching red sport shirts and
donned Indian ceremonial headdresses to pose for photographers in a
dugout canoe on an Amazon River tributary. And they met with
residents of the jungle town of Sarameriza to announce the
construction of a port project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism searches for development,'' Fujimori said as Mahuad
smiled widely. Then Fujimori called for a show of hands of those
opposed to opening river commerce to Ecuadoreans. No one voted
against the Peruvian President, Fujimori noted, ``not even
Mahuad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a backhanded slap at political leaders of the area who
oppose the thaw with Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friend President Mahuad is Arab and I am half Japanese,''
Fujimori said, ``but we speak the same language.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Presidents announced a wide assortment of joint
projects, including the extension of national parks, forestry
projects and construction of river port installations, bridges,
roads, schools and medical clinics that will total up to $3 billion
over several years. They also signed a free-trade agreement that
will remove tariffs from 585 agricultural, consumer and industrial
goods.

<P>
   BILBAO, Spain _ Like the peace talks in Ireland that inspired
them, negotiations between the Spanish government and the guerrilla
movement that has been fighting for independence for the Basque
region have stalled but not stifled hopes for peace in a long and
bloody conflict.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 people have died at the guerrillas' hands in Spain
since 1968; the last victim was killed in a bombing on June 25,
1998. Three months later, the rebels proclaimed an ``indefinite''
cease-fire, one that both Spanish government officials and Basque
politicians in touch with the guerrillas say they expect will hold
despite the lack of momentum in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Violent guerrilla struggle is not what Bilbao wants to be known
for today. A million people a year come from all over the world
just to see Frank Gehry's stunning new Guggenheim Museum Bilbao,
bringing a new cachet of sophistication to a city built on a gritty
economy of heavy industry and shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The political wing of the guerrilla movement is also changing
its image, bringing in articulate young leaders like Esther Agirre
Ruiz, a 29-year-old lawyer, to explain itself to the world after 23
grizzled, veteran chiefs were thrown into prison two years ago.
They were accused of collaborating with the rebels by spreading
propaganda favorable to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, if it's possible in Ireland, why not in the Basque
country?'' Ms. Ruiz asked during an interview in the Bilbao
headquarters of her Herri Batasuna _ or Popular Unity _ party,
whose older leaders were recently freed by Spain's Constitutional
Court. ``As long as all the nationalist parties, trade unions and
other movements stay together, the cease-fire will be maintained,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ETA guerrillas, known by the initials of the Basque words
for Basque Homeland and Liberty, have never had the support of the
majority of the people here for the violent tactics they have used
in their drive for independence for the ``Basque Country.'' It is a
region of rugged green hills straddling the French and Spanish
border at the Atlantic end of the Pyrenees, where people speak a
language that may have originated in the Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly appalling assassination in July 1997 hardened
public opinion all over Spain against the guerrillas. They had
kidnapped and then killed a Basque town councilman, Miguel Angel
Blanco, after giving the authorities in Madrid 48 hours to transfer
jailed terrorists to prisons closer to their families, a demand
that Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's conservative government
refused to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Six million people took to the streets after the killing in
revulsion against the seemingly unending series of Basque bombings
and killings. Last September, after a long police crackdown, the
guerrillas changed their strategy, agreeing with moderate Basque
nationalist parties and labor unions to try to follow the Irish
model and begin a process of ``dialogue and negotiation'' instead
of violence, though still insisting on self-determination for the
2.6 million people who live in Spain's four historic Basque
provinces and 250,000 others in the French part of the Basque
country. Four days later, on Sept. 16, the guerrillas called the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Running in Basque regional elections last October under a new
name as the Euskal Herritarrok coalition, the Basque independence
movement won 18 percent of the vote, up from 12.5 percent two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ETA is looking for a way out after 40 years,'' said Xabier
Arzalluz, head of the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, which
governs in Spain's Basque region and, since last December, has been
doing so with the support of the movement that backs the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Arzalluz, himself often a harsh critic of the central government
in Madrid, said in an interview at his party's headquarters here,
``I think the ETA has decided to stop the armed fight, but that
doesn't mean it couldn't act again in situations it considers
provocations.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the guerrillas have moved closer to the moderate
nationalist movement or Arzalluz's nationalists have moved closer
to the guerrillas is a question politicians of other parties here
sometimes ask, but they also agree that the tide has turned against
violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every passing day makes it harder for the ETA to
return to violence,'' said Nicolas Redondo Terreros, leader of the
opposition Socialist Party in the Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo Ibanez-Martin, a member of Aznar's
Conservative Party and an official of Spain's Interior Ministry,
said of the guerrillas: ``They realized they were down a blind
alley. They were fighting a losing battle on the terrorist side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It paid off politically,'' Calvo-Sotelo conceded, with
nationalist gains in the regional elections last fall, followed by
Aznar's announcement in November that he had authorized his
government to talk with people close to the guerrillas to see how
sincere their pledge to forswear violence really was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go back to violence when you do well in political
terms,'' Calvo-Sotelo said, but he added that what the government
really wanted was ``not only a renunciation of violence, but a
condemnation of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Irish Republican Army, the Basque guerrillas did not
agree to disarm at the start of the peace process. And, as in
Ireland, agreeing to talks was easier than the talks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The first and so far only encounter took place over four hours
this past May _ in Switzerland, according to Arzalluz.
Calvo-Sotelo, whose immediate superior in the Interior Ministry,
Ricardo Marti Fluxa, was one of the participants, said he could not
talk about the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ETA sent out a one-page summary, in Basque, of the
questions that were discussed,'' Arzalluz said. ``ETA asked whether
the state would recognize the right of self-determination for the
Basques, and the government representative said, `We don't
represent the state, we represent the prime minister.' ETA also
asked if the government recognized the right, and they answered
that the government would never accept the excision of a part of
Spain or the right of the Basques alone to decide it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arzalluz said the government delegation was led by Javier
Zarzalejos, a top aide to Aznar, and also included the prime
minister's pollster, Pedro Arriola. One of the new, younger
guerrilla leaders, Mikel Albizu _ who uses ``Antza'' as his nom de
guerre and is the son of a founder of the movement _ spoke for
their side, said Arzalluz, with one of the veterans, a woman whose
name he said he could not remember, backing up her younger
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Arzalluz said a second round of talks was unlikely any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have not budged, after a year without any
killings, are the central government,'' he said. Supporters of the
guerrillas have also continued low-level street protests against
the government's refusal to bring some 400 prisoners closer to
where their families live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is European case law saying there is no such thing as a
right to serve time near home,'' said Calvo-Sotelo, the Interior
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
   But he and Ms. Ruiz agreed in separate interviews that they did
not expect much movement in the stalled negotiations until after
national elections that Aznar must call before his minority
government's term runs out next April.

 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For nigh on 20 years, Mary Daly, who is widely
considered the world's foremost radical feminist philosopher and
theologian, has barred men from her classroom at Boston College,
arguing that they marred the learning experience of women.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, too, the university objected to her separatism and
penalized her with reprimands and denial of promotion, but never
fired her. Nor could it change the strong mind of a woman who has
three doctorate degrees, has inspired reviewers of her seven books
to use words like ``genius,'' and so defies the powers that be _
including church and university powers _ that she even uses her own
lexicon, with words like phallocracy and academentia.
</P>
<P>
   And so the conflict went, flaring and dying down depending on
the year _ until now. In what some consider a telling sign, Daly
appears to be going down _ swinging, swinging all the way _ to
defeat, a forced retirement at age 70. At least, so it would seem,
judging by recent legal and administrative moves.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Boston College, a Jesuit-run Catholic university,
officially took Daly's office back from her, as sure a sign as any
of academic nonbeing. And though she called a press conference and
complained of a ``lockout'' (prompting university officials to
protest that they had not locked her out but were indeed
reassigning her office), it did not change the bureaucratic fact
that after decades, 467 Carney Hall was no longer hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic, isn't it?'' Daly said. ``A lockout. Think of
Virginia Woolf, `A Room of One's Own' _ that's what women have
always needed under patriarchy, and can't be creative without. They
took away my classroom, and my status to teach, and now they have
taken away my office, and all of it is giving the message that
Virginia Woolf and I are losing what I call `womenspace.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Boston College spokesman, Jack Dunn, said that Daly had made a
commitment to retire rather than admit male students _ though she
has since renounced that commitment _ and thus lost her tenured
post. The university plans to fight her in court for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel it's dangerous to condone intolerance,'' Dunn
said. ``You can't make an exception for discrimination or
intolerance. It's a slippery slope, it's dangerous ground, and we
refuse to do it. If this were a white professor saying, `I don't
want black students in my classroom,' obviously we'd take the same
position. The difference is, the world would have out-shouted us
first. This is a harder case, but it's the same issue. It's
fairness. It's accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominously for Daly, she lost the preliminary round in
her legal battle against Boston College. She sued the university in
May for breach of contract and violation of her tenure rights and
asked a judge to immediately order the university to reinstate her
in this fall's course catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Martha B. Sosman of Superior Court refused, saying
in part, ``There is no question that the school has adequate cause
to terminate Daly if, for some reason, her promise to resign turns
out to be unenforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added: ``A coeducational institution of higher
learning may insist that all courses be open to both male and
female students. A professor's defiance of that policy _ in this
case, a vehement and very public defiance _ would give the school
ample grounds for her termination.''
</P>
<P>
   That early ruling does not cow Daly's lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness.
She says the case, which is scheduled to go to trial next summer,
is on ``the cutting edge of Title IX,'' the 1972 law barring sexual
discrimination at schools that receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that says what she's been doing is per se
against the law,'' Ms. Van Ness said, ``and in fact, Title IX has
said that when you are making up for past discrimination and have a
pedagogical reason for what you're doing, it might be
permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ms. Van Ness said, Title IX is meant to combat
discrimination based on stereotypical views like ``women can't play
sports.'' Daly, she said, ``came to decide to teach the way she
teaches not based on stereotypes or intentional discrimination but
on her very, very real experience of what it meant for her students
for her to teach in a mixed class rather than separate classes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a women-only class, said Megan Niziol, a former student of
Daly's who graduated this year, ``being together creates an energy
that Professor Daly calls `gynergy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, when there are male students in a class,
that gets suffocated,'' Ms. Niziol said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Center for Individual Rights in
Washington, which has successfully challenged affirmative action
practices in several states recently, questioned the legal _ and
moral _ basis of women-only classes.
</P>
<P>
   The law permits single-sex institutions to teach single-sex
classes, said Terence J. Pell, senior counsel for the center. But
``what Title IX does not contemplate is a particular professor at a
coed institution simply refusing across the board to even consider
the possibility of men in her class.''
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for Daly's current problems came in the person of
Duane Naquin, a male student who was denied access last year to her
class in feminist ethics and complained to university officials and
to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Pell and Dunn questioned Daly's recent statements that she was
willing to teach men, but in separate classes. Dunn said that
according to the registrar's records, no male student had completed
one of Daly's classes since she began separate teaching in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston news media, recent editorial opinion has leaned
against Daly, and though she has been supported by some students
wearing ``Where's Mary Daly?'' pins, there has been nothing like
the ground swell of 1,500 students _ all men _ who rallied behind
her when she was first denied tenure in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   To Daly and her supporters, the powerful opposition looks like
part of a national backlash against both feminism and affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of all-women classes has been on the agenda for
20 years,'' said Letty Russell, a colleague of Daly's and professor
of theology at Yale Divinity School. ``So the fact they could bring
it up now and make an issue of it, I think, reflects change both in
the climate of the country and the approach to getting rid of
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who took on the male-dominated hierarchy of the Roman
Catholic Church in the 1960s and has not stopped her ideological
assaults on male power and her elevation of female virtues ever
since, looks unlikely to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Past conflicts with the university were ``not entirely painful,
because when I fought back, I always won,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time is the first time it appears they have won,'' she
said. ``But they haven't.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drier conditions will spread into the Northeast on Sunday as the
low-pressure system responsible for this weekend's precipitation
moves slowly off the Maine coast. Showers will occur during the
morning near the New England coast with drier air arriving in the
afternoon. Residual moisture in the lowest portions of the
atmosphere, however, will cause clouds to linger most of the day
from southeastern New York to eastern Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, spotty thunderstorms will douse the Southeast and
eastern Gulf of Mexico coasts as a southward-advancing cool front
lifts the very sultry air over the region. Intervals of clouds and
sun will rule the skies of Florida. Scattered thunderstorms will
occur, especially during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Morning clouds will yield to afternoon sun from the eastern
Great Lakes through the Appalachians. Meanwhile, sinking currents
associated with high pressure will promote clear skies from the
western Great Lakes to the middle Mississippi Valley. Farther
south, torrid conditions will continue over Texas as abundant
sunshine propels readings above 100 degrees in many places.
</P>
<P>
   A corridor of moist air circulating into the Southwest will
bring patchy clouds and scattered thundershowers to the southern
Rockies. Onshore breezes will promote mainly cloudy and cool
weather in western parts of Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   A potent jet stream disturbance will spark isolated strong
thunderstorms across eastern Montana today. Elsewhere, unusually
hot weather will spread into the western high Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: A Drop in the Bucket
</P>
<P>
   The weekend rain across the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States
has brought some relief to the current drought. Prior to the rain's
onset, statistics indicated that parts of the region required about
12 inches of rain to eliminate the current deficit. The several
inches that fell in some places helps. Not all rainfall, however,
is created equal. If a 2 inch rain occurs in a few hour period,
much of the rain drains into streams or municipal sewer systems and
is not absorbed into the ground. Farmers prefer rain to fall over a
longer duration, assuring more absorption into the soil.

SPY'S EX-WIFE IS SUING CUBA OVER HIS DECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ To Ana Margarita Martinez, an avowed anti-Communist
Cuban-American, the dashing young jet pilot seemed to have dropped
from heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Pablo Roque, a disenchanted officer in the Cuban air force,
escaped the Communist-controlled island by swimming to the U.S.
Navy base at Guantanamo Bay in February 1992. He denounced Cuban
President Fidel Castro and quickly became a vocal militant in the
Cuban exiles' pro-democracy movement in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He even flew planes for Brothers to the Rescue, a group of
Cuban-American pilots who cruised the Florida Straits searching for
refugees fleeing Cuba on rafts. He met Ms. Martinez his first year
in Miami, in church, and they fell in love. They were married in
1995, as he established himself as one of the city's more visible
anti-Communists. He wrote a book called ``The Deserter.''
</P>
<P>
   It was all a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Roque, in reality a spy for the Cuban government sent to
infiltrate exile groups like Brothers to the Rescue, vanished from
Miami on Feb. 23, 1996, and returned to Cuba, four years after his
swim to Guantanamo.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Cuban jets shot down two small planes flown by
Brothers to the Rescue, just outside Cuban air space in
international waters. Law-enforcement authorities in Miami and
Cuban exiles blamed Roque for the deaths of four fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban exiles who had trusted Roque felt violated.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Martinez, the betrayal was rape. She never would have
married him, never would have shared a bed with him, Ms. Martinez
said, if she had known the man she thought was an anti-Communist
was actually an agent of the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, saying that her consent to have sex with the man over the
11 months of their marriage was based on a lie, she is suing the
Cuban government for sexual battery _ rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used me,'' Ms. Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed earlier this month in Miami-Dade Circuit
Court, Ms. Martinez contended that Roque used her as part of his
cover, and that his decision to court and ultimately marry her was
done only to establish himself within the exile community.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the fifth victim of the downing'' of the two planes,
said Jose J. Basulta, president of Brothers to the Rescue. ``We
were all victimized but perhaps she was the person with whom there
was the most cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   When she filed the court papers, Ms. Martinez described the
lawsuit as her only way of fighting back. She has since had the
marriage annulled _ Roque, now in Havana, did not contest _ and has
not heard from him since he left the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in an appearance on Cuban television soon after
returning, Roque told an interviewer that the thing he missed most
about living in Miami was his sport utility vehicle, said lawyers
for Ms. Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   That man was not the one Ms. Martinez thought she had married.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very attentive,'' she said. ``He made me feel protected
and secure. He was the kind of man who went to work and came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted a family,'' she said, and helped her raise two
children from a previous marriage. Now she says it was just part of
his disguise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would not have given her consent, had she known'' who
Roque really was, said one of her lawyers, Scott W. Leeds of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her `husband,''' Leeds said, using the word derisively, ``was
a spy in the employment of the Cuban government. She was victimized
and was powerless to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Roque, who also served as a paid informer for the FBI and
supplied information about Brothers to the Rescue, has been named
in a federal indictment that accuses him and 13 others with spying
and trying to sabotage the efforts of Miami's Cuban exiles. He is
also charged with conspiracy to commit murder in connection with
the attack on the Brothers to the Rescue planes.
</P>
<P>
   One week before the two planes were shot down, two members of
the alleged spy ring were warned not to fly in any Brothers to the
Rescue planes near the island between Feb. 24 and Feb. 27,
according to the federal indictment. The warning apparently came
from an agent of the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Roque appeared on CNN from Havana. That was how
Ms. Martinez learned where her husband had gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just disappeared,'' said Ms. Martinez, an executive
secretary in Coral Gables, Fla. ``He told me he was going on a
business trip, and the next thing I knew he was in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez is hoping for a moral victory and any financial
reward is secondary, her lawyers said. Getting money from the Cuban
government has proved difficult in the past.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The families of the four fliers who were killed also sued the
Cuban government and were awarded almost $188 million by the
federal District Court in Miami, money they hoped to recoup from
frozen Cuban assets.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, denied the families access to what had seemed the most
likely source of damages, $6.2 million in payments from American
telephone companies to the Cuban telecommunications company,
Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That case, a complicated legal tangle, has been in the headlines
in Miami for years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martinez's case, at least on the surface, seems simpler.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, her lawyers point out that sex cannot be
consensual if it is derived by ``fraud and concealment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, Roque was under orders from Cuba's
ministry of the interior to become a member of the Cuban exile
community, and _ while leading ``a normal life'' _ to infiltrate
Cuban-American organizations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his cover, he was told to become active in church,
where he met Ms. Martinez. His marriage to her was part of his
directive, the complaint said. Meanwhile, he doubled as an informer
for the FBI, also part of his directive from Cuba, the complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the lawsuit does not contend that Roque was under orders
to marry Ms. Martinez ``specifically,'' he used her as part of his
disguise, said Leeds, the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans here either defend her lawsuit or shake their
heads at its seeming strangeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a legitimate way of defending herself,'' Basulta
said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have said the case will be difficult, since Cuban
officials are unlikely to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cuban exiles have one bit of satisfaction. Wherever
Roque is, knowing the economic straits and shortage of good
automobiles on the island, he is probably not driving a quality
vehicle.

AGAINST ALL ODDS, THE GARDEN IS STILL THE GARDEN, AT LEAST FOR
NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has taken us a quarter of a century, but sports
fans are finally adjusting to the reality that free-agent athletes
jump ship at whim.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too much to ask, however, that the names of our stadiums
and arenas stay constant from one season to the next?
</P>
<P>
   I am referring to several dozen sports dens losing local,
traditional names in favor of airlines or banks or, worse yet,
companies that give no clue as to their function. What is a
Qualcomm? What is a 3Com?
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Madison Square Garden has been owned by so many
faceless corporations that one little theater in the complex went
from being called the Felt Forum to the Paramount to the Theatre. I
believe it is currently named the Mosh Pit.
</P>
<P>
   Sports are reflecting the frivolous anarchy of financial
institutions blowing each other out of the water for the sport of
it.
</P>
<P>
   We can all agree that one of the most hideous moments in
contemporary life is discovering that our bank or mortgage company
or insurance company has been taken over by some new gang of
swashbucklers. The hostile captors promptly force us to fill out
new forms, which are then mangled by a clerk unfamiliar with a
computer or the English language itself.
</P>
<P>
   Now the temples of sport are being affected by the whims of
these corporate pirates. One city being menaced is Buffalo, where
the Sabres play hockey in an arena built ostensibly as the
Crossroads, which had a nice, energetic civic ring to it. But
before the arena opened in 1996, a bank with roots in upstate New
York paid $8.5 million to have the new joint called Marine Midland
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres fans were getting used to that name this spring when the
team reached the Stanley Cup finals. Now the company that swallowed
up Marine Midland last year, the HSBC Group out of London, wants to
put its rather uninteresting corporate initials on the arena. (For
the record, they stand for Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corporation.)
</P>
<P>
   Bless their hearts, the Sabres are not going for it. They've got
season tickets to sell, skyboxes to rent, schedules and brochures
about to be printed, all with Marine Midland Arena on them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, HSBC filed a breach-of-contract suit in state court,
claiming the company had automatically acquired the naming rights
by buying the arena. The Sabres say a name change is not in the
contract. All of this may be mere lawyerly jockeying to see who
pays for the changeover, but, as a traditionalist, I am rooting for
Marine Midland, extinct as a banking institution, to somehow
prevail as a hockey arena. Then again, I'm hoping Yankee Stadium
can outlast this grubby trend.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time a corporate name has changed faster
than coaches are fired. In Philadelphia in 1994, the new arena was
named after the Corestates Financial Corp., which had roots in the
region. One of the stipulations in the contract was that future
naming rights were included for the price of $40 million over 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As volatile as the banking industry has been, they said, `We
may acquire _ or we may be acquired,''' recalled Peter Luukko, the
president of Comcast-Spectacor Facilities, which runs the arena in
South Philly.
</P>
<P>
   The Corestates executives must have had a premonition. In 1998,
First Union of Charlotte, N.C., staged a $17 billion takeover,
gaining the naming rights for the Corestates Arena as well as the
Corestates Spectrum next door. First Union dutifully paid another
$2 million for the complete changeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how many things have the name on it _ stationery,
signage, brochures, garbage cans, uniforms,'' Luukko said. ``We had
two signs that said Corestates _ one facing Broad Street, one
facing I-95. The last thing I wanted was one saying Corestates and
one saying First Union. They got it all done in time for last
season, with green letters 10 feet high, saying First Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Luukko said there had been ``little antipathy'' to the change _
``but it's not something you're too excited about, either. You  &UR; are
 &LR; changing the name of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   That name could change again. As The New York Times has written,
``The towering First Union facade cloaks a failure to attain the
financial goals promised in its merger binge, mounting managerial
woes and low morale amid the layoff of thousands of workers _
layoffs deemed necessary for the bank to meet earnings goals
associated with acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong rumors that First Union itself could be
swallowed up by some other outfit on the make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if they were acquired by First Boston,'' joked Luukko,
a Boston native. ``Then they could name it the Boston Garden'' _ a
reference to the ancient den, now demolished in favor of the Fleet
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to the grim corporate touch. Fred Wilpon, the otherwise
sentimental co-owner of the Mets, has informed us that the
projected new ball park in Queens will neither be named for his
late father, Nathan Wilpon, who took him to many games in Ebbets
Field, nor for Jackie Robinson, who helped win six pennants in that
holy place.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wilpon warns us, the new stadium will be named for the
highest bidder. The naming rights will, of course, be written into
the contract _ pending the inevitable takeovers, buyouts, sales,
transfers, mergers, bankruptcies and all other forms of financial
instability that so define our age.

EPA WANTS WATER QUALITY AS NEW GAUGE FOR CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Environmental Protection Agency will propose
this week that states regulate water pollution by focusing on the
quality of bodies of water, instead of the levels of discharges
from individual plants.
</P>
<P>
   Once the state determined the extent to which pollution must be
reduced in a body of water, the polluters would receive a quota and
could then clean up their emissions or buy the right to discharge
into the water from someone else whose cleanup had exceeded a
quota.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which was announced Saturday morning by President
Clinton in his weekly radio address, is based on a mostly unused
provision of the 1972 Clean Water Act that requires pollution
regulators to assess water conditions and issue discharge
restrictions accordingly. Federal and state agencies have generally
enforced discharge limits on factories and municipal water
treatment plants without measuring the quality of the bodies of
water involved.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental regulators have sometimes set limits on pollution
by analyzing the body of water, mostly when forced to by lawsuits
brought by environmentalists; EPA officials said the new rule would
be the first that required the states to act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that under the new rule, states would have to
establish schedules for cleanup or the federal government would
step in and do it for them.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule, which will be open for public comment for 60
days, is available at http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/tmdl/index.html. The
agency is also publishing what it says is the first comprehensive
state-by-state listing of ``impaired'' bodies of water, which shows
the nature of each pollutant.
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Browner, the EPA administrator, said the new rule would
be ``the last chapter in how we get to fishable, swimmable
waters.'' Great progress has been made since Congress passed the
Clean Water Act in 1972, she said, but 5 million acres of lakes and
30,000 miles of rivers and shorelines are not fit for fishing or
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Developing the plans could cost the states $1 million to $2
million each, Ms. Browner said. She did not estimate the costs to
actually reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists hailed the rule but said the trick was not
only to assess the water, but to actually force a cleanup. One
problem is that much of the pollution comes from unregulated
parties, like small farms, as opposed to factories, power plants
and sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, Susan L.
Sylvester, the administrator for water division, said that under
existing regulations, ``we've done a lot'' with discharge pipes
from factories and sewage treatment plants. But she said many
bodies of water were still polluted by contamination from sources
like runoff from farms or parking lots, which are not regulated.
Farms are sources of pathogens from animal manure and insecticides
used on crops. Farms are also sources of nutrients, which can
promote algae and other plant growth in water that kill fish.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EPA proposal, Ms. Sylvester said, states could
encourage farmers to relocate manure piles or route storm water
around them, and take similar steps to cut runoff. States might
even use grant money to finance farm improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Or, she said, under a trading arrangement, a municipal sewage
plant emitting phosphorous, a nutrient, might pay a farm to reduce
its releases of phosphorous, at a lower cost per ton. A plant might
even pay a farmer to quit raising animals or quit farming, to the
economic advantage of each, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of environmental orders based on bodies of water
rather than discharges will depend on the willingness of regulators
to follow through, said Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer at the Natural
Resources Defense Council in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Izeman said that such rules had prevailed from 1948 until the
Clean Water Act was passed in 1972 but had not been enforced and
that even under the Clean Water Act, regulations had been issued in
1979, 1985 and 1992 to allow such enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules have resulted in beginnings of programs in some
states, including listing of impaired water bodies,'' Izeman said.
``But the program has largely not been implemented.''

 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ On the surface there is little different about
Miami Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson. The hair remains perfectly
layered, and nothing short of a hurricane can disturb it. The tan
is something out of Melrose Place. His attitude is still there as
well: Johnson thinks he is the baddest coach on the planet. And it
could indeed be argued that Johnson remains the best at what he
does.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there are the other usual suspects. Mike Shanahan has won
two consecutive Super Bowls, Dennis Green is one of the brightest
coaches in the game, and no one has to ask how smart Bill Parcells
is because he'll tell you himself. But when it comes to a coach who
can win _ a lot _ and do so with an attitude and no political
correctness, Johnson is the guy. There are probably five coaches
who could take the sorriest team in football and by pure force of
their will push that franchise into the post-season. Johnson is one
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes his Dolphins team is the most talented in the
American Football Conference East. He may be right. With more
weapons on offense than he has had since joining Miami for the 1996
season, Johnson is poised to advance deep into the playoffs. His
Dolphins have a swagger, like Johnson's old Dallas Cowboys teams
that won two Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Everything seems perfect. Quarterback Dan Marino is as excited
as he has been in five years, the defense is a top five unit, and
the team believes it is special.
</P>
<P>
   Yet something hovers over the franchise like the blistering
Florida sun. In his ninth year of coaching in the National Football
League, there are strong indications, some of which come from
Johnson himself, that this could be his final season.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 56, does not come right out and say what he is
thinking, but what he does not say is equally important. Johnson
refuses to say he will definitely be back after this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how long I'm going to coach,'' Johnson said after
a recent practice. ``I really don't think about it. I probably
think about it less now than in past years for the simple reason
that I'm going to coach my rear end off, go as hard as I can go,
and then after the year is over I'll pull back and say, `OK, do I
want to do this again?'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says he has the insight of all the positives and
negatives he has been through, has been financially secure for 15
years and knows where he is heading. ``In light of all of that,''
he said, ``you do take it one year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he could talk ``about how I'm going to coach until
I win another Super Bowl,'' but the truth is ``I don't know what
I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His thinking is a result of an episode after last season that
can only be called a football midlife crisis. Extremely emotional
over the death of his mother, the firing of a number of other head
coaches, including his good friend Dave Wannstedt by the Chicago
Bears, and a disappointing 10-6 season, Johnson quit the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is unaccustomed to not meeting expectations. In Dallas
he single-handedly built the Cowboys and then won consecutive Super
Bowls, becoming only the fourth head coach to do so. He also was
the first head coach to win a college national title (with the
Miami Hurricanes) and an NFL championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins' record improved in each of Johnson's seasons, from
8-8 in 1996 to 9-7 and then to 10-6 last year. But Johnson felt the
Dolphins had enough talent to win a Super Bowl, and part of the
reason Johnson hurriedly quit was that the Dolphins' progress was
slower than expected. It was only after a long night of
soul-searching and extensive talks with the team's owner, H. Wayne
Huizenga, whom Johnson likes, that he decided to return to
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches are somewhat emotional,'' Johnson said. ``We had just
come off an emotional season. My mother had just passed away, and
that was the first time in my life someone in my immediate family
had passed away. I had made plans to get married. It was a
turbulent time.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson did after his personal crisis was vow to change the
way he lived. He started spending less time around the office to
allow for a personal life.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted about a week. Johnson is too addicted to his work to
live a 9-to-5 life, so he is back to his old routine, staying up
late working on game plans and personnel moves. ``My wife said to
me, `You haven't changed, you still stay in the office until two in
the morning,''' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is more relaxed than perhaps ever before. He smiles and
jokes more. On the field, Johnson has allowed veteran players like
Marino to take an occasional training camp practice off, something
he had never done as coach of the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The kinder, gentler Johnson has surfaced because his good friend
and jogging buddy, Wannstedt, is around, just like the good old
days in Dallas when he was Johnson's defensive coordinator.
Wannstedt has a soothing effect on Johnson and is his sounding
board.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Johnson has a cache of talented backs, good
receivers and an improved offensive line. ``For whatever reason I
think I'm more relaxed,'' he said. ``I've always been optimistic,
but I think I'm even more optimistic this year for the simple
reason we've got a lot more talent. When you've got better players,
maybe that makes you happier. You tend not to smile as much when
you don't have good players.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson made it clear he came back to the Dolphins because he
owes a debt to Huizenga and his coaches, but his return was also
because of pride. After he does retire _ whenever that is _ he
plans to live in the Miami area. Johnson can already get a seat at
the best restaurants on a Friday night without calling ahead, but
imagine his popularity if he brought the city its first Super Bowl
championship since the 1972 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be able to walk around this city when I'm done
and stick out my chest and say we won it all,'' he said. ``Now, is
that going to happen? I don't know, but I'm going to make a run at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team Johnson sees as the biggest threat to his becoming the
king of Miami? The Jets. That's the team Johnson constantly thinks
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets are the team to beat,'' he said. ``We shouldn't be
the team to beat because we didn't win the division last year. We
may have the best team in the division, but the Jets hold the
title. They're the team to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is the man to watch because his team could very well get
to the Super Bowl. If that happens, look for him to definitely
retire. It would be a pivotal moment in football because the league
would lose one of its most talented and entertaining coaches ever.

LOS ANGELES: ``meager 3.7 percent.'' ``A lot of the late-summer films would have done better in May or
June,'' Bucksbaum said. ``The exhibitors, particularly those who
couldn't get `Star Wars,' were starving for product back then.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The second reason -- failing to find the audience -- is more
complicated, but it stems from the simple fact that very few
moviegoers wanted to see ``Iron Giant.'' Its weekend per-theater
average was only $2,631, an average of $145 or perhaps 30 tickets
per showing. That means theater owners will want to ditch ``Iron
Giant'' as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my household, I'm the only one who wants to see `Iron
Giant,' '' said Rick Manly, an Altadena resident and frequent
moviegoer. ``My 13-year-old son wants to see `Deep Blue Sea' again
and my 10-year-old daughter would love to go to `Runaway Bride.'
They have no interest in `Iron Giant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum believes Warner missed out by not targeting teen-agers
and adults. ``You can't target kids anymore with your marketing,
because they don't want to see it unless older kids think it's
cool,'' he said. ``Kids want to see adult films like `Runaway
Bride' and `The Haunting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Bucksbaum asserts, it was crucial for Warner to do
something other than using a traditional marketing campaign. ``With
the Disney brand so strong for animated movies, you really have to
do something different,'' he added. ``It's really tough unless
you've got computer-generated images. You talk to people in the
street about seeing this movie and it's just `No way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Internet movie guru Harry Knowles, operator of the
ain't-it-cool-news site, believes ``Iron Giant'' needed special
treatment. ``The problem with Warner's marketing of the film is it
treats the movie as though it was a Saturday morning TV cartoon,''
he wrote. ``They played the movie as being silly, as being a goofy
movie. And that was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, who contends ``Iron Giant'' deserves a Best Picture
Academy Award nomination, believes the studio should have submitted
``Iron Giant'' to the Cannes Film Festival and used the buzz from
the international press to generate interest.
</P>
<P>
   He said Warner Bros. also should have shown sneak previews
during the Fourth of July weekend with its ``Wild Wild West'' and
released the movie July 16 against ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which ended
up performing almost as poorly as ``Iron Giant.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's too late, unless there's a stunning shift at the
box office. ``Iron Giant'' will wind up grossing about $20 million
domestically and join that odd category of critical favorites that
never caught on with the public this year such as Disney's
``Rushmore,'' Paramount's ``Election'' and Sony's ``Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, it's all about concept, hype and buzz and getting
people into the theater,'' Bucksbaum said. ``It's what you do
before the opening weekend. They may have to go back to the days of
giving away free cups and dishes to get people to come.''

WARNER BROS. BLEW CHANCE TO MARKET FILM WHILE IRON WAS HOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- What in the world went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``Iron Giant'' is on its way to the scrap heap of Hollywood. It
will be the best movie your kid never sees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the most superlative reviews of any film this year, the
animated tale of a boy's friendship with a giant robot from outer
space opened with a massive thud last weekend. It ended Sunday with
$5.7 million in gross receipts and in ninth place -- one-fifth of
the business generated by ``Sixth Sense,'' the weekend's leader.
</P>
<P>
   That's a flat-out disaster for a project that cost Warner Bros.
an estimated $50 million to produce and an additional $30 million
for marketing. It's embarrassing for the studio because ``Iron
Giant'' opened not only with blue-chip critical support but also
with customers mobbing multiplexes, pushing overall summer grosses
up 20 percent over last year's record-setting pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a couple of things happened to `Iron Giant,' '' said
Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. ``First,
kids don't read reviews, and they were the target audience. Second,
it was very crowded over the weekend with six films doing over $10
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. for its part is hoping that word of mouth will kick
in. ``We were a little disappointed by the opening, with such great
reviews and exit polling,'' said distribution chief Dan Fellman.
``This is a terrific movie for parents who often say, There's
nothing to take the kids to.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, industry trackers are left wondering what
Warner Bros. -- already shaken to its foundations three weeks ago
with the surprise resignations of co-chairmen Bob Daly and Terry
Semel -- should have done differently.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there's not a market for animated films.
``Tarzan'' opened two months ago and is nearing the end of a run
that should go past $170 million domestically, making it the fifth
animated film in a year to top $100 million following ``Mulan,''
``A Bug's Life,'' ``Rugrats'' and ``Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if people don't agree with critics, who were
especially impressed by how the boy's life changes when a
metal-eating giant arrives in a small Maine town in 1957. ``The
exit polls show 96 and 97 percent of the people would recommend
`Iron Giant,' '' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service. ``If you can get a teen-ager to see it,
they're going to love it, but you're going to have to drag them
in.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if Warner Bros. didn't try to sell the movie,
even going so far as to schedule sneak previews on the Sunday
before it opened. But analysts say ``Iron Giant'' was doomed by two
factors -- bad timing and a severe miscalculation of how to attract
an audience.
</P>
<P>
   The timing goes back to ``Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom
Menace.'' When 20th Century Fox decided to stake out the May 19
opening, rival studios except for Universal cleared out of the way.
Universal executives figured there would be a strong market for
other movies and were proved correct with ``The Mummy'' and
``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else tried to cram summer-type movies into July and
August, including ``The Blair Witch Project'' from little-known
Artisan Entertainment. ``Blair Witch'' generated not only
sensational grosses when it opened in mid-July; it also attracted
virtually all of the media attention in the days and weeks before
``Iron Giant'' opened Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Warner picking a worse time to open the
film. Not only was it facing four other new movies (``Sixth
Sense,'' ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' ``Mystery Men'' and
``Dick''); it also was going up against the second weekends of
``Runaway Bride'' and ``Deep Blue Sea'' and the expanded run of
``Blair Witch.'' Box office for the weekend was the second-highest
ever at $153.5 million; ``Iron Giant'' captured a meager 3.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUES ON NEW TAKE.)

STRAW POLL NO-SHOW WITH A PLAN  
 CONTRARIAN OREGON  
 OLYMPIAN TAX RATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.H., S.C., Calif., Texas, Utah)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., was the only one of the 10 Republican
presidential hopefuls to pass on Iowa's straw poll this weekend. So
what's his game?
</P>
<P>
   For the last month or so, while the other candidates scoured
every corner of Iowa in search of poll participants, McCain, who
called the poll a ``sham,'' focused his campaign on New Hampshire,
South Carolina and California. Those states, he says, offer him the
best opportunity to break to the front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The way he figures it, whatever national polls show and whatever
the statistical outcome of Saturday's straw poll in Ames, he is the
genuine No. 2 in the Republican contest, the candidate the party
will turn to should the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   And, he says, he has a plan to hasten the collapse of the Texan:
Close in on the governor in New Hampshire's first-in-the nation
primary next year (tentatively set for Feb. 8), overtake him a
couple of weeks later in South Carolina and home-state Arizona,
then put him away in the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries, when the
biggest prize of all will be California.
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order. Very possibly too tall. But while the
campaign spotlight has been on Iowa, the senator has been doing his
own scouring.
</P>
<P>
   He has made more trips to New Hampshire in the last few months
than any other candidate _ 14 in all this year _ and in recent
polls there has climbed to second place, his stated short-term
goal. Bush leads by a solid, perhaps insurmountable 30 points, 40
percent to 10 percent, but that said, McCain is the only candidate
besides Bush to achieve a double-digit standing.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McCain begins a two-week sweep through California,
with the focus on veterans at many stops. As a survivor of North
Vietnamese prisoner of war camps, he is relying heavily on fellow
veterans to help promote his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   After California, he heads for New Hampshire and a five-day bus
tour that he hopes will mirror the success of the tour he made
earlier this month of South Carolina. When that trip was over _ it
was his 10th visit to that state _ one of South Carolina's most
seasoned political writers, Lee Bandy of The State in Columbia,
wrote that McCain had been enthusiastically received and was
``rapidly emerging here as a solid alternative'' to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of fund raising. And again McCain has
been hard at work, raising more money, $6.1 million, than any
Republican candidate except Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Steve Forbes, the publisher, has much more than $6.1
million for his campaign. But it has mostly come out of his own
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine by McCain, for the moment. He figures Forbes will
use it to hammer down Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing fine,'' McCain said a few days ago. ``The money is
coming in OK. The support is there. I'm enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Advances by Retreating
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years and more ago, when most states relied on caucuses
to help choose presidential nominees, Oregon was one of those
relative rarities that held a primary. The voting usually took
place on the third Tuesday in May and the results were considered
more clear-cut and indicative than the outcome of caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon, though no megastate when it came to population, took on
an outsized role in the nominating process, and the state's voters
grew accustomed to being wooed up close by the likes of Thomas
Dewey, Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   No more.
</P>
<P>
   Today, dozens of states hold primaries. And many of those
states, particularly many that are larger than Oregon, schedule
their votes in March, or even sooner, in an effort to gain early
clout in the primary process.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of eating their political dust, Oregon joined the
``front-loading'' rush in 1996 and moved its primary date to the
second Tuesday in March, just a bit behind New Hampshire's opening
primary. But to little avail _ only Bob Dole, the eventual
Republican nominee, dropped by to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson in that, Jim Edmunson, the Oregon Democratic
chairman, later observed, is that ``if a state can't be first, it
better be big.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, for Election 2000, the Oregon Legislature has moved the
state's primary back to its original date, the third Tuesday in May
_ a step so contrarian, as primary scheduling currently goes, that
Oregon surely qualifies once again as a political rarity.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials say, however, that it was not difficult to
sell the Legislature on the need for the reversion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, they note, only the date of the presidential primary
was moved up, not the date for state and local primaries. When the
second round of voting took place in May, the officials say, the
turnout was unusually low, in good part because the draw of the
presidential primary was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the officials say, it was too costly to run two separate
rounds of primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Oregon's shift back to the May date for the Election
2000 presidential primary removed a possibility that the state, if
it stuck with the March date, might run afoul of a special
Democratic National Committee rule. That rule authorizes New
Hampshire not only to hold the first primary, always, but also to
hold it at least a week before the next state votes, including
states, like Oregon, that allow advance voting by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Mayoral Candidate Would Tax, Tax, Tax
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of contrarian politics, how about a candidate whose
main pitch is a call to raise taxes, and raise them ``shamelessly
high?''
</P>
<P>
   Read Jim Bradley's lips.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is one of 13 people running for mayor of Salt Lake City.
And like the other candidates, he is spending a lot of time talking
about the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, which will be held in Salt
Lake City, and which the city bid for so heavily that it was
accused of trying to ``buy'' the event.
</P>
<P>
   Having won the bidding, many city officials and residents are
now worried that if the games are not a success, Salt Lake might be
stuck with any bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, a former county commissioner and unsuccessful
Democratic candidate for governor in 1996, says he has a plan:
Raise extra income by increasing taxes on rooms, rental cars, food
and everything else needed by the thousands of visitors who will
come to the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel transient room tax has to be jacked up as high as we
can possibly do it,'' Bradley argued in a recent candidates debate.
``We have to raise the car rental tax as high as we can possibly do
it _ even shamelessly high _ to generate revenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Jones, another mayoral contender, called Bradley
``insensitive'' and argued that Salt Lake City ``isn't a place to
come and get fleeced.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, considered one of the front-runners in the race,
countered that however high Salt Lake City taxes and prices were
raised, the city would still seem a bargain to most visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mean-spirited idea,'' he said. ``All I'm looking
for are ways that the city's not left holding the bag.''

ULSTER TOWN TORM BY BOMB CARRIES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ For seven years in the 1970s, Michael
Gallagher, a Catholic, and Stanley McCombe, a Protestant, lived
next door to each other, friendly but not really friends.
</P>
<P>
   They occupied a familiar patch in Northern Ireland where most
Catholics and Protestants are civil to one another but are still
distant, separated by national identity and segregated by school
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drifted apart,'' Gallagher recalled, ``but tragedy reunited
us.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago &UR;  &LR; Sunday at 3:10 p.m., a car bomb planted by Irish
republicans opposed to the peace process exploded in the center of
this County Tyrone town as it was crammed with back-to-school
shoppers. The bomb killed 29 people and injured 382.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were Gallagher's 21-year-old son, Adrian, who had
gone into town to buy a pair of jeans, and McCombe's 49-year-old
wife, Ann, who worked in a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michael Gallagher and Stanley McCombe are close friends,
relying on each other to get through ``the bad days,'' when
memories and the sense of loss overwhelm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had that much in common,'' McCombe said. ``We've
become very good friends. We feed off each other, for strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship, and their vocal advocacy for those killed and
injured by the bomb, captures both the vulnerability of people here
and their determination to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Their mutual dependency is also something of a metaphor. The
first anniversary of the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland
coincides with a stagnant peace process, increasing violence on the
fringes, and a creeping sense that the progress of the last few
years is threatened by inertia, intransigence, and extremists who,
like those who planted the bomb here, are determined to exploit the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   As Gallagher put it, ``We have to stand together, or we'll all
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of the bombers' goals was to drive a wedge through Omagh,
where about 65 percent of the 25,000 residents are Catholic and 35
percent Protestant, it hasn't worked. A study carried out by David
Clarke, a professor at the University of Oxford, found people felt
closer as a town since the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   David Bolton, the director of social work at The Bridge Center,
a counseling unit set up after the bombing, said his counselors
have found similar signs of solidarity and an absence of blaming
the Catholic community for the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was potentially divisive because militant republicans did
it. But people are holding together,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   While most atrocities in Northern Ireland have tended to
victimize one side or the other _ Protestant unionists who want to
remain British citizens or Catholic nationalists who aspire to
unity with the Irish Republic _ the Omagh bomb was remarkably
indiscriminate. Its victims included those from both religions, of
all shades of political opinion, some who were apolitical, and two
visitors from Spain, the only tourists ever killed here in the
Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were six children age 12 or younger, six
teenagers, and two unborn twins of Avril Monaghan, who was killed
alongside her 1-year-old daughter, Maura, and her mother, Mary
Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   The forlorn figure of Michael Monaghan is a reminder of the
devastation wreaked on so many families, none more than his.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife gone, Monaghan is raising his three surviving
children alone. ``Avril has three,'' he told a friend recently,
``and I have three.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of heroic stories here. Michelle Mimnagh, a
teenager who lost her right leg in the explosion, learned how to
ski over the winter and walks the town with a newly fitted
artificial limb.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the outward displays of strength, this is a
wounded place. Like the mist that often shrouds Omagh on winter
mornings, sadness hangs over the town.
</P>
<P>
   So does frustration. Aside from the arrest of an allegedly
peripheral player, the biggest cross-border manhunt ever in Ireland
has failed to result in charges against the bombers even though
many people seem to believe they know who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Locals bitterly resent that the bombers have been able to recast
the town's identity for the outside world _ that Omagh is now known
as the place where the worst atrocity in 30 years of the Troubles
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want to move on, but there are others who are
still hurting,'' said Bolton, who believes more people than the 470
his team has counseled need help.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Byrne, who was elected to represent Omagh in the Northern
Ireland Assembly, said the town ``is still subdued.'' Many people
were dreading Sunday's memorial service, fearful of the memories
that will be dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go into town, do their business, and get out,'' he
said. ``There's less conversation on the street. A lot of people
have this sense of unease.''
</P>
<P>
   The unease is exacerbated by the political stalemate that led to
the assembly's suspension last month. Gallagher said many of those
whose loved ones were killed took some consolation from the fact
that the bomb seemed to make more people more determined to see the
peace process succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is stalled because unionists refuse to form a
power-sharing government with nationalists until the Irish
Republican Army begins disarming. Many here believe the IRA missed
a golden opportunity to make a token gesture just after the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the time to do it, and we would be well beyond this
impasse,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said the political stalemate is feeding anxiety, and that
a collapse of the cease-fires by the main paramilitary groups would
cause a relapse for many here who have been treated for stress and
depression. He said there has been an increase in suicides in the
area, but it was too early to determine whether that trend is
because of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As he drew hard on one of the cigarettes that have become his
constant companions, 51-year-old Stanley McCombe said he often
finds it hard to not be consumed by his grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's over,'' he said, sitting in the small office where
he and Gallagher run the Omagh Support and Self-Help Group. Before
the bombing, ``I took early retirement, for a better future with
Ann. Now there's no future. There's only tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries for his sons, Clive, 23, and Colin, 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive is very unsettled. He's taken three different jobs this
year. Colin's gone back to work, but there are days when he can't
be bothered,'' he said. ``The boys don't say an awful lot. When
Colin talks about it, he gets angry.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombe said he constantly battles his emotions. One day, while
driving, he saw Francis Mackey, leader of the political wing of the
group that carried out the bombing. He said he had to resist an
urge to run Mackey down.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher seems less susceptible to fits of anger, but says it
is a conscious effort not to give in to darker impulses. He and his
son ran a garage together. But he quit that to devote his time to
representing the interests of the families who were bereaved. All
but a few of the families have come together, determined that they
will control the memory of their loved ones. Those who chose not to
get involved are too hurt to emerge from their seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was important to come together,'' Gallagher said.
``The people who planted the bomb did so cynically, to destroy the
peace process and split the town. We won't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the families have been buoyed by the support they have
received from people in Ireland, Britain, and abroad. But he says
Omagh residents are upset by the inability of the police to arrest
the perpetrators and by the compensation process that forces them
to argue for the monetary worth of their loved ones' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a degrading process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watterson's clothing store in the town center used to be a
bubbly place, in large part due to the presence of salesladies like
Ann McCombe and Geraldine Breslin. They chatted up customers and
traded jokes.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb threat was phoned into police, most of the two
dozen employees at Watterson's were evacuated to the rear of the
store. But McCombe and Breslin stayed behind to help a woman with a
baby carriage down some stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers at the front of the store shepherded the women,
and two other employees returning from lunch, Veda Short and Doreen
Preston, down the street. Because of inaccurate information called
in by the bombers, the police unwittingly brought them and dozens
of others to stand next to the car that held the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   McCombe, Breslin, and Short were killed. Preston lost a leg and
part of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the bomb, Watterson couldn't imagine
reopening the shop his father founded in 1938 and that he has run
for 35 years. But customers insisted he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never be the same,'' Watterson said. ``But we've
surprised ourselves. We've struggled through and keep going. Like
the town itself.''

SPORTS COLUMN: QUESTIONING EVERYTHING FOR THE RECORD AND BEYOND
</HEADLINE>
   (ko) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think I may be suffering from record fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   A diagnostician from the Elias Sports Bureau would probably find
the first symptoms deep in my childhood, while I was trying to
flawlessly field a pink rubber ball 100 times as it bounced off a
brick wall. Even when I succeeded, I felt a certain emptiness, an
``Is this all there is?'' I wondered if I would feel relief at 200,
euphoria at 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   I felt the recurrence of that childhood pathology 10 days ago
when Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run. I might also have been a
little surprised. Only 500? Will I feel better when he hits his
800th? His 1,000th?
</P>
<P>
   Then nine days ago Tony Gwynn got his 3,000th hit. By the time
Wade Boggs reached 3,000 a day later, my lack of caring was
disturbing. I knew how meaningful this was to Boggs, how he had
once kept batting charts so detailed that they included not only
the types of pitches he faced but also what he was eating that day
and whom he was sleeping with. The consummate pro deserved to
celebrate his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Is it mean-spirited of me not to share this excitement, I
wondered? Or is it record fatigue, one form of the many low-level
contemporary diseases caused by the information overload? Instead
of treating it as a swarm of locusts to be sprayed away, we welcome
the relentless assault as a kind of mental lottery. We consume all
the bits, sure that one of them will contain the germ of wisdom.
And what could be a better bet than that bit of information called
a record, all-star information with a pedigree, with a history,
with a ranking?
</P>
<P>
   Millennial sum-ups, catch-ups and best lists are part of the
problem; this is a way of putting the century to bed. Also, we seem
to have reached a critical mass of numbers along with the computers
to sort them quickly. This at a time when a highly competitive
sports media is scrambling to concoct news events out of scheduled
entertainments, to give some human meaning to otherwise meaningless
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   My record fatigue, indolent since childhood, flared when Cal
Ripken Jr. approached Lou Gehrig's record of consecutive games. So?
A player stays healthy, competent and on one team long enough to
surpass a player who contracted a fatal disease. Ripken's record
was given weight by right-wing conspirators who wanted to embarrass
workers who took Mondays off, left early on Fridays and used their
sick days.
</P>
<P>
   When I publicly suggested that Ripken take a day off, the only
national commentator who understood I might be joking was Rush
Limbaugh. This turned me rightward; I gave away my Tommy, Willie
and Angela Davis T-shirts. But I also felt isolated in my rare
condition. Just when I was fatigued, most other people couldn't get
enough records. And soon we'll have Ripken again with his 3,000 _
if he can get healthy enough to get back in the lineup long enough.
</P>
<P>
   Record fatigue makes you question everything. McGwire, Gwynn and
Boggs stacked up their statistics with noncontending teams; does
that mean they don't have to face top pitchers? Five grand slams in
five games last Monday, the first time in history that so many were
hit in one day; a return to the rabbit ball?
</P>
<P>
   I should be happy that records are back. In the 1980s,
golf-style rankings in which athletes were listed, like day traders
and orthopedic surgeons, by their incomes, replaced batting
averages, yards gained and points per game as measures of man. By
the '90s, however, with more multimillionaires than All-Stars on
every roster, money rankings made no sense. Salary records were
routinely broken every season, and resentment grew among fans and
sportswriters. Back to hard figures that could gauge achievement.
Let's make sports pure and simple again.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. Pete Rose got 4,256 hits and he's not good enough for
the Hall of Fame. Lawrence Taylor, who left a statistically
verifiable trail of blood and tears through the National Football
League, almost didn't make his Hall because of conduct unbefitting
a man who knocks other men down for a living.
</P>
<P>
   And the significance of records keeps changing. When Roger
Maris, who was not Mickey Mantle, hit 61 home runs in one season,
we were told that Babe Ruth's really important record was his
lifetime tally. Then Hank Aaron, who was not white, hit 715 and we
were told that Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak was the one
true record. Maybe if we ever learn to embrace McGwire, we can go
back to the single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   But just what does a record mean?
</P>
<P>
   A certain selfish drive, to be sure. Unless it's a record for
assists (but then you just might be someone's co-dependent or were
afraid to shoot), we can figure you were thinking about your
scoreboard numbers a lot. Hitting records often depend on who is
batting around you in the order. Touchdowns thrown or caught are a
two-man operation. Track and field records have lost a certain
precision unless they are accompanied by the types and amounts of
chemical helpers.
</P>
<P>
   Is this just me? Too many records in a record-breaking span of
time? Or are we counting the wrong numbers? Maybe Wilt Chamberlain
was right; foul shots sunk are not as human a statistic as women
slept with (20,000). Now that's worthy of record fatigue. &QL;

 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For nigh on 20 years, Mary Daly, who is widely
considered the world's foremost radical feminist philosopher and
theologian, has barred men from her classroom at Boston College,
arguing that they marred the learning experience of women.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, too, the university objected to her separatism and
penalized her with reprimands and denial of promotion, but never
fired her. Nor could it change the strong mind of a woman who has
three doctorate degrees, has inspired reviewers of her seven books
to use words like ``genius,'' and so defies the powers that be _
including church and university powers _ that she even uses her own
lexicon, with words like phallocracy and academentia.
</P>
<P>
   And so the conflict went, flaring and dying down depending on
the year _ until now. In what some consider a telling sign, Daly
appears to be going down _ swinging, swinging all the way _ to
defeat, a forced retirement at age 70. At least, so it would seem,
judging by recent legal and administrative moves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Boston College, a Jesuit-run Catholic university,
officially took Daly's office back from her, as sure a sign as any
of academic nonbeing. And though she called a press conference and
complained of a ``lockout'' (prompting university officials to
protest that they had not locked her out but were indeed
reassigning her office), it did not change the bureaucratic fact
that after decades, 467 Carney Hall was no longer hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's symbolic, isn't it?'' Daly said. ``A lockout. Think of
Virginia Woolf, `A Room of One's Own' _ that's what women have
always needed under patriarchy, and can't be creative without. They
took away my classroom, and my status to teach, and now they have
taken away my office, and all of it is giving the message that
Virginia Woolf and I are losing what I call `womenspace.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Boston College spokesman, Jack Dunn, said that Daly had made a
commitment to retire rather than admit male students _ though she
has since renounced that commitment _ and thus lost her tenured
post. The university plans to fight her in court for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel it's dangerous to condone intolerance,'' Dunn
said. ``You can't make an exception for discrimination or
intolerance. It's a slippery slope, it's dangerous ground, and we
refuse to do it. If this were a white professor saying, `I don't
want black students in my classroom,' obviously we'd take the same
position. The difference is, the world would have out-shouted us
first. This is a harder case, but it's the same issue. It's
fairness. It's accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominously for Daly, she lost the preliminary round in
her legal battle against Boston College. She sued the university in
May for breach of contract and violation of her tenure rights and
asked a judge to immediately order the university to reinstate her
in this fall's course catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Martha B. Sosman of Superior Court refused, saying
in part, ``There is no question that the school has adequate cause
to terminate Daly if, for some reason, her promise to resign turns
out to be unenforceable.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge added: ``A coeducational institution of higher
learning may insist that all courses be open to both male and
female students. A professor's defiance of that policy _ in this
case, a vehement and very public defiance _ would give the school
ample grounds for her termination.''
</P>
<P>
   That early ruling does not cow Daly's lawyer, Gretchen Van Ness.
She says the case, which is scheduled to go to trial next summer,
is on ``the cutting edge of Title IX,'' the 1972 law barring sexual
discrimination at schools that receive federal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing that says what she's been doing is per se
against the law,'' Ms. Van Ness said, ``and in fact, Title IX has
said that when you are making up for past discrimination and have a
pedagogical reason for what you're doing, it might be
permissible.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Ms. Van Ness said, Title IX is meant to combat
discrimination based on stereotypical views like ``women can't play
sports.'' Daly, she said, ``came to decide to teach the way she
teaches not based on stereotypes or intentional discrimination but
on her very, very real experience of what it meant for her students
for her to teach in a mixed class rather than separate classes.''
</P>
<P>
   In a women-only class, said Megan Niziol, a former student of
Daly's who graduated this year, ``being together creates an energy
that Professor Daly calls `gynergy.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, when there are male students in a class,
that gets suffocated,'' Ms. Niziol said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Center for Individual Rights in
Washington, which has successfully challenged affirmative action
practices in several states recently, questioned the legal _ and
moral _ basis of women-only classes.
</P>
<P>
   The law permits single-sex institutions to teach single-sex
classes, said Terence J. Pell, senior counsel for the center. But
``what Title IX does not contemplate is a particular professor at a
coed institution simply refusing across the board to even consider
the possibility of men in her class.''
</P>
<P>
   The trigger for Daly's current problems came in the person of
Duane Naquin, a male student who was denied access last year to her
class in feminist ethics and complained to university officials and
to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Pell and Dunn questioned Daly's recent statements that she was
willing to teach men, but in separate classes. Dunn said that
according to the registrar's records, no male student had completed
one of Daly's classes since she began separate teaching in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston news media, recent editorial opinion has leaned
against Daly, and though she has been supported by some students
wearing ``Where's Mary Daly?'' pins, there has been nothing like
the ground swell of 1,500 students _ all men _ who rallied behind
her when she was first denied tenure in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   To Daly and her supporters, the powerful opposition looks like
part of a national backlash against both feminism and affirmative
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of all-women classes has been on the agenda for
20 years,'' said Letty Russell, a colleague of Daly's and professor
of theology at Yale Divinity School. ``So the fact they could bring
it up now and make an issue of it, I think, reflects change both in
the climate of the country and the approach to getting rid of
affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly, who took on the male-dominated hierarchy of the Roman
Catholic Church in the 1960s and has not stopped her ideological
assaults on male power and her elevation of female virtues ever
since, looks unlikely to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Past conflicts with the university were ``not entirely painful,
because when I fought back, I always won,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time is the first time it appears they have won,'' she
said. ``But they haven't.''

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, STEP RIGHT UP AND PICK A PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Politics can be a circus, and there was no better
example of that than here Saturday, where Republican presidential
candidates competed not over tax or education policy but who could
erect the biggest tent, serve the tastiest barbecue and provide the
best country-and-western music.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people swarmed to the campus of Iowa State
University in this central Iowa town to participate in a straw poll
devised as a money-making operation by the state's Republican
Party. In a practice that critics say is meaningless because it
verges on outright vote-buying, the campaigns bused Iowans here,
fed them, entertained them and then paid their $25 entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   The hope was that, in return, the sated participants would cast
a vote for the candidate who treated them the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the way to pick a president?'' asked former Rep. Bill
Zeliff of New Hampshire, as he stood amid a huge, state-of-the-art
playground erected by Steve Forbes' campaign. ``If it is, we're in
bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Zeliff's candidate took part; Zeliff is national
chairman for former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander. Alexander's
enticement for voters: singer Crystal Gayle.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that in the 2000 campaign, this, indeed, may be a
way to pick a candidate. Because the campaign has started so soon,
with many states moving up the dates of their primaries, the straw
poll here could have the effect of winnowing the field. Because
Texas Gov. George W. Bush has so dominated the polls and amassed so
much cash, some campaigns said that Ames might be the site of their
last stand.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the revelry on this bright and festive Saturday
afternoon, the campaigns were partaking in high-stakes politics.
Aides to the campaigns scurried about with walkie-talkies and cell
phones, doing all they could to insure that their candidates would
grab the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   The event was an organizational test to see which campaigns
could convince the most people to travel far and wide to this event
_ and then take the next step to support their candidate. Any Iowa
resident of voting age could participate, a change in the rules
that gave this event more credibility than it had four years ago.
Then, candidates turned this grass-roots exercise into the campaign
equivalent of the Berlin airlift, flying in supporters from around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's spectacle was by far the most extravagant ever.
Republicans sometimes call themselves the party of the Big Tent
and, certainly, the event was a sea of big and small tents.
</P>
<P>
   If sheer resources were any guide to who would triumph, Forbes
would win hands down. No one here could stop talking about a
mammoth, air-conditioned tent (with French doors) erected by the
campaign of Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher who is dipping
into his fortune to finance his White House quest.
</P>
<P>
   Marveling, perhaps, at the competition, Benjamin Ginsberg, the
Bush campaign's legal counsel, called it ``Chateaux Malcolm,'' a
reference to Forbes' father.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people coming here to get cooled off,'' Greg
Muller, a spokesman for Forbes, said approvingly as people swarmed
into the tent. ``In the Bush tent they come off a little stodgy.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the pivotal Iowa caucuses nearly six months from
now, when people will actually vote in a binding contest, Muller
said, `'This is all a down payment for a cold night in February.''
</P>
<P>
   One Forbes supporter who was cooling off was Joanne Pohlman, 62,
a retired schoolteacher from Webster City who clutched a Forbes
gift bag. ``It's like a carnival,'' she said. ``But it's fun. Great
fun. Great sport. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Max Eckstein, 22, a college student from Boone, Iowa, who was
surveying the band in one of the Bush tents, said the governor and
other candidates ``must be kicking themselves'' for not
air-conditioning their tents. But, he said, that would not in
itself sway him to back Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do food and entertainment make a difference?'' Eckstein asked.
``Maybe for the common person.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the partygoers, while not shy about eating the food
and accepting the free rides on hot air balloons, denounced the
extravagance, saying the campaigns should spend their millions on
more than just staging a big party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is trying to appeal to the side of us that says, `OK,
we can play, so he must be good,''' said Tanya Bignell, a data
entry worker from Bettendorf who is backing Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. ``I don't think so,'' Ms. Bignell said in Hatch's
sweltering tent, picking over a modest spread of chicken and baked
beans.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns who forked out the most cash were a bit worried
that some people they transported here would use their ticket to
vote for another candidate. So before anyone could extract their
ticket from the Forbes organization, they had to sign a pledge
saying, ``I, the undersigned, pledge to support Steve Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Jim Moore and Greta Moore, farmers from Thornburg, Iowa,
peered into the Hatch tent but said they were backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as entertainment goes, ``Forbes is probably the
best,'' Moore, who is 69, said. ``He had Debby Boone in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Boone, who is 68, interjected, ``It was packed, I'll tell
you.'' She said she was not put off by the hefty spending, saying,
``That's their business. You spend your money where you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Endicott, 34, an English teacher who lives near here,
said he is a Democrat but voted for Elizabeth Dole in the hope that
she will take votes from Bush _ and make him seem less intimidating
to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get her more points against Bush to keep her in the
race,'' he said. Endicott said he was ``turned off'' by some of the
tents, even by the low budget operation of former Vice President
Dan Quayle. ``Quayle's corn cobs and hay stacks, it's just too
hick,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, others agreed. While the Forbes and Bush tents were
packing in hundreds and hundreds, the Quayle tent was fairly empty
before lunch. A band played to only a handful of people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the advance scout for the Anaheim Angels
was in Philadelphia when Curt Schilling was trying to add to his
streak of complete games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going for his fifth or sixth complete game in a row,''
the scout, Matt Keough, related. ``Everybody was going crazy. Not
to take anything from Mr. Schilling; he's a dynamic pitcher. But I
had to laugh because that would have been a customary month for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Keough was a member of the Oakland Athletics' starting rotation
in 1980 when he and his fellow starters pitched the astounding
total of 94 complete games, including 20 by Keough, 24 by Mike
Norris and 28 by Rick Langford. By that season, complete games were
already in decline elsewhere in the major leagues, but the complete
game had not yet become an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   It is that today. Just check the Mets' total of complete games.
Through 117 games, through Friday, that total was zero, as in 0, as
in none. No team has ever gone through a season without a complete
game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Colorado Rockies, notorious for their inept
pitching staffs, had one complete game. Bryan Rekar pitched it in
his second major league start, beating Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far I don't think it has hurt us in any way,'' Steve
Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said of the team's absence of
complete games. ``It doesn't bother me that we haven't and whether
we get one or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips suggested that Schilling might have some questions
about his eight complete games. If he hadn't thrown all of the
innings needed to finish those games, Phillips said, ``he might be
healthy now'' instead of being on the disabled list with a sore
shoulder. ``Is that a bigger factor than complete games,'' the
Mets' executive asked, ``that mentality of throwing pitches when
you're tired?''
</P>
<P>
   The number of complete games has been in decline since the late
1970s. For six successive seasons and seven of eight in the '70s,
major league pitchers finished what they started from 1,009 times
to 1,089. But the total fell steadily for the most part, reaching a
low of 266 in 1997 before rising to 302 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The National League reached its all-time low in 1996 with 127,
and the American League followed the next season with its all-time
low of 123. Both leagues are now headed for totals even lower than
those.
</P>
<P>
   The NL had 86 complete games before Saturday, at a rate that
would produce 121 for the season. The AL had 72, which would
translate to a total of 101, less than two handfuls more than the
1980 Athletics had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tendency is going to be toward fewer complete
games,'' Tony La Russa, the St. Louis Cardinals' manager, said.
``You have younger starters, and they're not prepared to get deep
in the game. You also have just about everybody trying to build a
bullpen. They put as much interest in building a bullpen as the
starting rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing La Russa's first point, about young pitchers, Omar
Minaya, the Mets' senior assistant general manager, said: ``The
industry as a whole is a little bit conservative with young arms
and goes by pitch counts. That creates a psychology where when the
pitcher gets into the fifth and sixth inning, he starts thinking
he's tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing player development people want to do, Minaya
added, is overuse a pitcher. ``You cherish arms when you have
them,'' he said. ``You don't want to burn them out.''
</P>
<P>
   On La Russa's second point, building bullpens, just about
everyone interviewed on the subject said teams these days put their
best arms in their bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Concurring that the best pitching prospects are turned into
closers, Larry Dierker, the Houston Astros' manager and a former
major league starter, said, ``It used to be all the best pitchers
were groomed to be starters and the older guys who couldn't go nine
anymore were put in the bullpen and the best were made the
closers.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips readily acknowledged that he deliberately set out to
build a strong relief corps for this season, then bolstered it with
recent trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew last winter we couldn't make trades or sign free
agents to build our starting rotation to be better or equal to the
Braves' rotation,'' Phillips said, ``so we thought we'd focus on
having a competent starting rotation with a very deep and strong
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Economics also enters into the equation. ``If you're going to
put together a strong rotation or a strong bullpen, it's more cost
effective to do the bullpen,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 the Minnesota Twins won the World Series with a pitching
staff that during the season produced 16 complete games, fewest in
the AL. This season the Twins have seven complete games, two more
than the Yankees' strong starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't want to go on the field,'' Tom Kelly, the
Twins' manager then and now, said, meaning he would be happy never
to have to remove his starter. ``I think most managers would like
to see the complete games. Then again, the general manager and the
owner are paying some people out there to get some people out. So
if you have the opportunity, why not use him? I'm not saying use
him just for the sake of using him. But there's no reason to let a
guy just sit out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker has gained a reputation for encouraging his starters to
pitch nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them to finish if they want to, and I want them to want
to,'' the Astros' manager said. ``If I can tell there's any
hesitation and he's looking down there at Billy Wagner in the
bullpen, I'm not going to try to teach them lessons in
complete-game pitching at the expense of losing games.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the existence of the sophisticated and carefully
constructed bullpens, which La Russa had much to do with inspiring
when he managed Oakland in the late '80s and early '90s, managers
have practical considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several factors,'' La Russa said. ``A lot of
pitchers take the decision away from you because they're throwing
so many pitches. Leaving them in in the eighth or ninth, you're
risking that the fatigue will cause them to make a mistake and cost
you the game. Or they'll reach back for something more and get
hurt.'' The second factor, he said, is that ``the fresh specialist
generally gives you a better chance than a tiring starter.'' And
three, ``If you have a horse, you want him firing late in the
season when everything is more important. You can burn out your
starter by pushing him throughout the season. You look to save him
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Melvin of Texas added another factor: agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recently had an agent call me and tell me he didn't want one
of our pitchers to go to winter ball because he'd have too many
innings,'' Melvin related. ``He's going to have about 160. The
agent thought pitching another 50 innings would be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who said he probably would never have wanted to be a
closer, nevertheless thinks the existence of the closer has
improved the game. But, he added, ``You can fall into the trap of
using the guy all the time.'' He cited the Astros' experience last
week in Atlanta, where John Rocker, the Braves' closer, pitched the
ninth inning of each game of the three-game series, preserving a
victory each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day he threw 96, then 93 the second day, then 90,''
Dierker said, referring to the velocity of Rocker's fastball. ``I
felt sorry for him. He was happy. He threw a lot of breaking balls
and he won. But if I had been Bobby Cox, I wouldn't have used him
the third day. I thought they were abusing him, bringing him in
that third day.''

<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Inside Columbine High School, where two
teen-agers shot and killed a dozen other students and a teacher
last April 20, the library, where much of the mayhem occurred, has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Once pockmarked by bullets and splattered with blood, it now
remains hidden behind a wall of blue-painted lockers as part of
efforts by local officials to remove evidence and memories of one
of the deadliest school shootings in American history.
</P>
<P>
   When students return to classes on Monday for a new school year,
not quite four months after the chaos ended with the young gunmen
turning their weapons on themselves, Columbine faces the rather
daunting challenge of seeking normalcy in a place that could never
be the same after what happened there.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are experiencing a range of emotions, the most
universal of them, anxiousness,'' said Krista R. Flannigan, a
victim counselor from Idaho Springs, Colo., who worked with many
families of Columbine students over the summer. ``Some students are
really looking forward to going back. Others are afraid. Some think
something could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students, like Kasey Ruegsegger, a junior last year who was
shot in the shoulder as she hid behind a desk in the library, grew
so uncomfortable with the prospect of returning that they have
transferred to other schools or turned to home-schooling. Ms.
Ruegsegger said she planned to attend a small private school for
``a fresh start,'' adding, ``But I'm happy for the ones going back
to Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   The shootings traumatized a town and stunned a nation that is
fast growing accustomed to episodes of savagery in which the
victims are young and only loosely connected, if at all, to their
attackers. At Columbine, the teen-agers who armed themselves with
four weapons and a cache of bombs, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan
Klebold, 17, members of the so-called trench coat mafia, were known
to many other students as relatively unremarkable, which made their
final exploits that much more chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to say that their crimes changed much in the nation would be
an exaggeration. While Congress raised the specter of Columbine and
other school shootings in the long debates on tougher gun-control
measures, the last session ended with no new legislation. Nor have
sociologists, psychologists and other experts agreed on the reasons
that teen-agers from apparently stable, financially secure families
would act out aggressions against peers in such a violent manner.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Columbine, school officials have invited parents,
teachers and other residents of Littleton to form a ``human chain''
outside the school early Monday morning to project a sense of
support and safety for the 1,900 new and returning students who are
expected. A 45-minute rally in the student parking lot has been
scheduled to follow, with Columbine's principal, Frank DeAngelis,
planning to urge the students to ``take back our school.''
</P>
<P>
   A flag that has stood at half-staff since the shootings will be
raised; a ribbon wrapped around the school will be cut.
</P>
<P>
   But even with changes intended to make Columbine safer than ever
_ a $1 million investment by the Jefferson County school district
that includes a new surveillance system, student identification
badges and additional mental-health workers _ anxieties persist
among many Columbine parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting feelings within the Wilson family are typical.
Stuart, a 10th grader who is trying out for the football team as a
defensive end, said he and many of his friends were eager to
reconvene as a group, forget what happened last April and ``be back
like normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   But his mother, Annie, a native of South Africa who brought her
family to Littleton six years ago ``to be safe,'' described herself
as ``extremely anxious'' about sending Stuart and her two other
children back to Jefferson County schools this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are fine, but I'm neurotic about this,'' she said,
standing outside Columbine one day last week with Stuart, 14, and
his siblings, Cameron, 13, and Holly, 8, after Stuart registered
for the new school year. ``I admire the kids' courage, coming back,
but for me, it's been really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to psychological scars, the shootings left a wide
path of destruction well beyond bullet holes in walls and library
books stained with blood.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the 15 who died, nearly two dozen students were wounded
by gunshots, three of whom remain paralyzed below the waist and
face the almost certain prospect of life in a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Anne Marie Hochhalter, 17, who was shot in the
back, left the hospital only last week to join her family living in
temporary quarters until they move soon into a house that is
wheelchair accessible. A spokesman for Craig Hospital in Denver,
where the most seriously injured people were treated, said Ms.
Hochhalter was planning to return to Columbine for her senior year,
although not right away.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth student, Patrick Ireland, 17, who escaped from the
library by climbing out a window after he was shot in the head,
still has a bullet lodged in the back of his brain. Ireland, who is
expected to return to classes on Monday, has partial paralysis on
his right side and problems speaking.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Many of the families of injured students were caught with
insufficient medical coverage and are struggling to pay bills.
Churches and other local community groups have helped raise money
to defray the costs, and a ``healing fund'' was created to
distribute the $3.8 million that was collected for families of
people who were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   But in a few cases, support arose from unlikely sources. Rashad
Williams, a 15-year-old student in San Francisco who had previously
never met Lance Kirklin, 16, raised $40,000 in pledges to help him
by running in the Bay to Breakers race across the city. Lance was
shot five times at close range, causing major damage to the left
side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ruegsegger suffered a less serious injury. As the shootings
continued, she said, she drew herself under a desk and pulled a
chair in front of her. ``I heard a lot of it,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't let myself watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she was shot in the right side of her body, and this
summer, therapy is helping her regain full motion of her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings also led to a swirl of activity by law-enforcement
agencies investigating how the killers got their guns. The
authorities decided not to prosecute Robyn Anderson, a Columbine
student who bought a shotgun _ legally, they determined _ used in
the shootings. Ms. Anderson went to the prom with Klebold three
days before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But two others involved with getting weapons for the gunmen,
Mark Manes and Philip Duran, who were not students at Columbine,
face gun charges and have arraignments scheduled this month.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   For all the measures undertaken to heal the mental and physical
wounds of the Columbine community, Dr. Donald Bechtold, a child
psychologist at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said
it was unlikely anyone affected by the shootings would soon forget
them.
</P>
<P>
   He said some students would prove ``remarkably resilient'' but
that others would continue to be haunted by the tragedy, emotions
triggered by a sight, a sound or even a smell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to expect them to resolve their feelings 3
1/2 months after the fact,'' Bechtold said. ``I don't think any of
them have completed the recovery process.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility has left teachers and administrators expecting
a wide range of emotions when the rally ends on Monday and students
re-enter the building as a group for the first time since the
shootings. Students finished out the spring semester at nearby
Chatfield High School.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Johnson, a psychology teacher who taught both of the gunmen
and was a close friend of the teacher who was killed, Dave Sanders,
said he was looking forward to returning when classes resume. But
he conceded that he did not know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there will be some tears for friends and the
memories of what happened,'' he said. ``But I also think that kids
are geared up to do what they need to do to have a real school
again.''

   CHIBA, Japan _ What Miho Kakuno hated worse than the beatings
was the bathtub treatment. It took place once or twice a week, even
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Miho says that she and her younger brother were placed in the
tub, while their stepfather filled it with cold water and covered
them with a wooden top, leaving only a couple of inches of air for
them to breathe. They could never push off the cover, she said,
because there was something heavy on top.
</P>
<P>
   Now, several years later, Miho, 12, is one of the lucky ones.
Her grandmother eventually won custody of her, and she is living
quietly trying to recover her equilibrium. Her brother, Hiroki, now
10, eventually ran away and, like his sister, lives in a location
that is being hidden from their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Miho and Hiroki's story of abuse is just one of many that have
come to light as Japan begins to confront a problem many Japanese
did not believe existed. Japan's unusually strong families are
being strained, aggravated by the long recession and record
unemployment, which have undermined stability in the home. In
addition to economic pressures, divorce rates and remarriages are
rising, which experts say has led to abusive behavior by some
stepparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``In pediatric circles we thought there wasn't much child abuse
and that we were different from the United States because our
culture was different,'' said Dr. Seiji Sakai, a child psychiatrist
and director at the Center for Child Abuse Prevention. ``The single
biggest problem was society realizing that there is child abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   But efforts by doctors, lawyers and welfare workers, as well as
a recent campaign by the Mainichi Shimbun, a national newspaper,
have begun to raise awareness. For the first time, the Parliament
focused recently on the increase in child abuse cases by
questioning bureaucrats and ministers. Lawmakers now are
considering relaxing rigid laws that give considerable power and
autonomy to families and parents.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics suggest a rise in child abuse, although experts are
uncertain whether it is actually increasing or whether more are
instances now being reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Child abuse is on the rise in Japan,'' said Machiko Ayukyo, a
lawyer who handles child abuse cases and is a director of the
Center for Child Abuse Prevention. ``Superficially, it seems the
trend is rising,'' she said, because more is coming to light. ``I
feel that this has been happening for a very long time and it is
finally just coming to the surface,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare commissioned its
first child abuse survey. It also plans to start specialized
training for social workers in child abuse, to provide increase
psychological support for abused children and to distribute a video
to publicize the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are also increasing their coverage of individual
cases like the one where a couple left their 5-month-old infant in
a coin locker one night last May, and then went to eat at a nearby
noodle shop. A passer-by heard the infant's cries and summoned
police.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, police rarely investigated accusations of child
abuse or wife beating, believing these were issues best left to the
head of the household _ meaning the father or grandfather.
Authorities are now struggling to figure out when and how to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics show that in 1997, there were 5,352
reported cases of child abuse, a 30 percent rise from the previous
year. But statistics may not present a full picture because the
government has not traditionally kept track of cases and few are
reported to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These figures are just the tip of the iceberg,'' said Satoru
Saito, director of the Institute of Family Functioning in Tokyo,
who said that changes in the family are leading to more child
abuse. ``The family's relationship with relatives and the community
is not so close anymore. Parents rarely seek support outside and
they tend to be isolated from society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakai, the psychiatrist, says that doctors often see injured
children but do not investigate enough. A couple once brought in a
5-month-old baby who died from a cerebral hemorrhage _ but even
after an autopsy, the death was not attributed to child abuse but
rather to sudden infant death syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   He also cannot forget the case of a young girl, now 7, whose
parents he described as ``highly educated'' and ``well-to-do.''
They brought her to the hospital with a bone fracture when she was
6 months old. Then a year later, they brought her in with a
cerebral hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a child would have died from the injury, but this girl
lived. Now, protected in a special school for the handicapped, she
is paralyzed and mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked that the second time, when the child had a
hemorrhage, the doctor didn't report it as child abuse,'' Sakai
said. ``We have tried to ask about what happened and why, but the
problem is that the mother doesn't speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miho and Hiroki, the two children held down in the bathtub,
the problems began when their father died and the mother, Mieko,
quickly moved to the distant city of Nagano from Osaka to live with
Kiichiro Kakuno, a small-time shop owner who was tall, handsome and
charming.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko's mother, Misako Ishibashi, objected to the relationship,
partly because Kakuno was married. But Mieko persisted and
eventually married Kakuno, and Mrs. Ishibashi gradually began to
wonder what was happening to her grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Mieko sometimes visited with her children, and Hiroki once came
with a big bruise on his head and what looked like a small burn on
his back. Mieko said that Hiroki had stumbled on the street, but
when it was time to climb into the car to return to Nagano, he
wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day in 1992, Mrs. Ishibashi received a call from Miho's
nursery school teacher. Could she please come to Nagano to see what
was happening?
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, she was shown two large volumes of photographs
that the teachers had taken of her grandchildren, both with
bandages, bruises and cuts all over their bodies. In one picture,
Hiroki's face was so black and blue that it was swollen like the
moon, Mrs. Ishibashi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overwhelmed,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They waited until Mieko came to pick up Miho and took her to a
nearby restaurant to ask her about the children. Mieko dodged their
questions, repeatedly changed topics and then left.
</P>
<P>
   The Kakunos have no lawyer and no listed phone number in the
Tokyo area, and could not be reached for comment. They have refused
to accept court documents and have not appeared in court. Two years
ago, Kakuno denied all accusations of child abuse in questioning by
a lawyer. Asked about the bathtub treatments, he told the lawyer
that he was teaching his stepdaughter Miho how to swim and never
tortured her, court documents say.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The children's grandparents went to the local police, who told
them that unless they could prove how the injuries were inflicted,
the police could do nothing. Moreover, if Mrs. Ishibashi were to
take the children away, she would be arrested for kidnapping. When
she called the local child consultation center, which has the power
to shelter an abused child, she was told that even suing in the
courts would be very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has tried to keep its family structure relatively intact
with laws that give enormous authority to the family. The tradeoff
has been that abused children are sometimes stuck with abusive
parents because authorities do not want to interfere.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Japanese believed that children were like
possessions and that parental authority was virtually supreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, the right of the family head was very strong,'' said
Toru Arichi, a professor of family law at Kyushu University. Until
the 1860s, he said, ``When a father unintentionally killed a child,
by being too strict or too violent, he was not questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, authorities do not know how to handle mistreatment by
parents. On May 15, a 23-month-old girl was brought unconscious to
a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. She was only 11 pounds,
less than half the average weight of a typical 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who was 18, was arrested after admitting that she
had not fed her baby much that month and had given her nothing
during the previous few days. The mother had separated from her
husband after giving birth, and had a nighttime job, but simply had
lost interest in caring for the child.
</P>
<P>
   After deliberating a court sent the mother to a juvenile home
for a few weeks of evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Even when authorities are aware of mistreatment, it often takes
years before the children can be rescued because of rigid laws that
protect the right of parents. In the case of Miho and Hiroki, it
took about nine years before their grandmother won custody of both
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Rigid laws coupled with a cultural deference to the parents
helped prolong the agony for Miho and Hiroki, even though neighbors
repeatedly reported sightings of abuse to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated everything,'' said Miho, who seems shy and hesitant
throughout a long interview.
</P>
<P>
   The first time she ran away, with the help of a teacher, school
director and a police official, she was kept for a few days at the
local child consultation center. But then she was returned home
when her mother and stepfather demanded her back.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the family moved to Tokyo, and after Miho began playing
with a friend downstairs she ran away to her friend's family, who
reported the problem to the local authorities. But she went back
home soon after because the authorities declined to help her. When
she tried to escape again, the child center recommended that she
not be returned home but since it had no legal authority to keep
her, Kakuno was able to collect the child.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after months of silence, a neighbor reported to a child
center that Hiroki had been found one morning wandering near a
large train station in muddy pajamas. Miho secretly had helped her
brother escape.
</P>
<P>
   The child consultation center ultimately protected Hiroki and
called a lawyer who helped Mrs. Ishibashi sue her daughter for
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Miho spent many hours plotting her own escape a year after
Hiroki left. She had been to school, where she told her teachers
about her plan, and then she went to a friend's house. She prepared
clothes and a small bag and left it with them.
</P>
<P>
   She had once tried to escape from the front door, but had been
caught. So this time, she tried the window from her third-floor
room. She piled up furniture in front of the window to climb out,
taking her in-line skates so that she could make a swift getaway
over the hills. She climbed sideways on the veranda to get to a
hallway window, which she entered to go down the stairs.
</P>
<P>
   As she recalls the whole period of mistreatment, Miho gets a
faraway look in her eyes, and it is clear that it still haunts her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got here, I was a little worried,'' she said. ``I
worried about whether I can belong here, about whether I can
survive here, and about what I should do if Dad or Mom and those
kinds of people come here to get me.''

COURTS GROW MORE RECEPTIVE TO SUITS CHALLENGING QUALITY OF MANAGED
HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CHANGES Massachusetts to Maryland in 14th graf)  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a string of rulings over the last 20 months,
judges across the country have begun allowing patients to sue
health maintenance organizations for medical malpractice, after
decades in which such claims were repeatedly rejected by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, federal and state judges often allowed HMOs and
other managed-care companies to avoid liability for their
decisions, saying patients had no right to sue for damages. But
rulings by judges in U.S. District Courts and appeals courts in
recent months show that they have become more receptive to lawsuits
attacking the quality of care provided by health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The suits have become common as patients chafe under the
cost-control restraints of managed care, now the dominant form of
health insurance in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether patients should have the right to sue their health
insurance companies has been the most divisive issue before
Congress as the Senate and the House debate legislation known by
its backers as the patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate recently passed a bill that would expand protections
for a limited number of Americans in managed-care plans, after
rejecting Democratic efforts to guarantee the right to sue.
President Clinton said he would veto the measure because it offered
``toothless, half-hearted protections.'' A move is afoot in the
House to draft a version that would include new rights to sue.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law that regulates employee benefits has long formed
a protective shield around HMOs. The law, the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, known as ERISA, made it difficult for
consumers to win liability claims for the denial of benefits,
primarily because Congress wanted employers to establish health and
pension plans without being exposed to expensive litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and their lawyers have recently found ways to get
around a provision of the law that allows patients to recover only
the value of denied benefits, not punitive damages or compensation
for lost wages or pain and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a U.S. District Court in Urbana, Ill., ruled this
year that a woman could sue a health plan, Health Alliance-Midwest,
on the ground that its nurses failed to diagnose her husband's
cardiac distress over the telephone. A nurse told the 42-year-old
man, Gary L. Crum, that his chest pain was probably a result of
``excess stomach acids,'' the lawsuit said, but Crum died of a
heart attack a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Kelly A. Crum, is challenging the ``quality of medical
care,'' not a denial of benefits, so she may press her claim under
Illinois' wrongful death statute, Judge Michael P. McCuskey said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995, the Supreme Court emphasized the broad reach of
ERISA, which pre-empts ``any and all state laws insofar as they may
now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.'' But since
1995, the court has emphasized its presumption that states may
exercise their ``historic police powers'' in ``fields of
traditional state regulation,'' including health care and
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to hold health plans more accountable, state
insurance commissioners recommended this month that all states
establish appeal procedures for people who want to contest the
denial of care by health maintenance organizations. Model
legislation, issued by the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, would allow consumers to appeal to an independent
panel of medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say that without a change in federal law, it is
difficult to sue an insurer for denying care to a patient under the
terms of an employee benefit plan. But plaintiffs are already using
novel arguments to win damages for inadequate quality of care _ in
short, for malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when a patient sued for malpractice, the target was
usually a doctor. But Promutual Group, a malpractice insurer based
in Boston, says ``managed care organizations are being held liable
in more and more medical malpractice cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly D.E. Temchine, a Washington lawyer who represents managed
care organizations, said patients and their lawyers liked to name
HMOs as defendants because the health plans were seen as having
``deep pockets.'' In recent months, judges in 15 states have forced
HMOs to defend their actions in cases involving suicide, heart
attacks, sudden infant death syndrome, cancer and other illnesses.
Those states are Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida,
Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have said HMOs can be sued on a variety of legal
theories. Some courts have held HMOs legally responsible for the
negligence of their doctors, especially if the doctors act like
agents of the HMO. Other courts have allowed patients to sue HMOs
for ``breach of fiduciary duty,'' meaning their obligation to act
in the interest of participants and beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, Judge Christopher F. Droney of U.S. District
Court ruled recently that one of the state's largest HMOs could be
sued for negligence by a man whose son had committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Stewart R. Moscovitch, said the HMO had stopped
paying for psychiatric care at Danbury Hospital for his severely
depressed son, Nitai, and arranged for the youth to be transferred
to a drug treatment center, where he hanged himself.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the lawsuit could go forward in state court
because it involved ``claims for medical negligence, not claims for
the improper denial of plan benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Moscovitch said: ``I felt that the
HMO in this case had to be held accountable. I do believe, and know
in my heart, that they killed my son by making a medical decision
for profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Alice C. Ferreira, a spokeswoman for the HMO, Physicians Health
Services of Shelton, Conn., said, ``The tragic outcome of this case
saddens us all.'' But she added, ``Once all the facts are presented
in court, they will prove that PHS fulfilled its obligation'' to
the Moscovitch family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Democrats in Congress and some House Republicans say
the right to sue is an essential element of any managed-care
legislation, because health plans often decide what kind of care
patients receive. But Senate Republicans, HMOs, insurance companies
and employers adamantly oppose any new right to sue, saying it
would increase the cost of insurance and lead to an increase in the
number of Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ralph J. Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
addressed such concerns in a recent ruling. ``We acknowledge that
by allowing negligence claims, there will be a financial impact on
HMOs,'' he wrote. But, he insisted, ``patients enjoy the right to
be free from medical malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   David L. Trueman, a New York lawyer who has represented scores
of patients, said, ``The courts' willingness to protect the
consumer is consistent with changing public attitudes toward
managed care and the need to hold HMOs responsible for actions that
harm patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania this year allowed a lawsuit
against an HMO by a man who said he had become a permanent
quadriplegic because of a three-hour delay in his transfer to a
university hospital for treatment of an infection in his spinal
column.
</P>
<P>
   The health plan said the federal law on employee benefits barred
such claims, and to support its contention it cited several
decisions of the U. S. Supreme Court in the 1980s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But Cappy of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the U.S.
Supreme Court ``noticeably changed tack'' in 1995. As a result, he
concluded, ``Congress did not intend to pre-empt state laws which
govern the provision of safe medical care,'' nor did it intend to
block lawsuits making negligence claims against an HMO.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In January, a California jury returned the largest verdict to
date against an HMO: $120.5 million for a woman whose husband had
died of stomach cancer. The woman, Teresa Goodrich, was allowed to
sue because her husband, David, had been a county prosecutor, and
Erisa's limits on damages do not apply to health plans for
government employees.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rulings have pleased consumer advocates and caused
concern among managed care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Health plans say the court decisions show there is no need for
changes in Erisa, because patients can vindicate their rights under
existing law.
</P>
<P>
   But patients' rights and judge's rulings are, at the moment,
somewhat unpredictable, and patients often must shuttle back and
forth between federal and state courts.
</P>
<P>
   Trueman, the New York lawyer, said that despite recent court
victories for consumers, ``the law in this area is in flux, often
limited and at times confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Ohio State
University, said: ``It's still pretty clear that you cannot
directly sue a plan for denial of benefits, no matter how egregious
the denial is. That protects much of what health plans do.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Court, director of Consumers for Quality Care, a consumer
group based in Santa Monica, Calif., said congressional action was
needed to clarify patients' rights.

DECIDING ON THE MANAGER, AND MAKING IT WORK
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Always candid and first class, Phil Garner said the Milwaukee
Brewers were justified in firing him as their manager last week.
The same cannot be said for all decisions to fire managers or
general managers, or to retain them. This season offers various
evidence of that reality.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A: Fourteen months ago the Fox regime fired Fred Claire
as general manager and Bill Russell as manager of the Los Angeles
Dodgers. Certainly a new owner has the right to bring in new people
to replace those who ran the operation for the previous owner. But
what a disaster Fox has produced.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with the major leagues' second most expensive payroll,
the Dodgers have raised the bar for the measurement of
underachievement. Fox gave Kevin Brown the most lucrative contract
in baseball history, instantly affecting the entire industry, and
thought that clinched their trip to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the capable hand of Davey Johnson has been able to
avert the disaster the Dodgers have become. Barring a late surge,
they will spoil Johnson's record of never having finished below
second place in the 10 complete seasons he has managed.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit B: After six seasons, the Colorado Rockies decided that
Don Baylor was no longer good enough to manage their team. They
fired him and lured Jim Leyland to the Rocky Mountains with a $2
million-a-year contract. To their naive surprise, they have
discovered that their team is no better than it was under Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies entered Saturday's game in last place with a 49-67
record. At the corresponding stage last season they were in fourth
place with a 52-64 record. Leyland obviously can't do any more than
Baylor did without a decent pitching staff. The pitching staff, in
fact, is headed for a league-worst earned run average for the sixth
time in the team's seven-year existence, and with its highest ERA
ever, perhaps over 6 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit C: After Johnson led the Baltimore Orioles to two
postseason appearances in two seasons as their manager, they
accepted his resignation, which he tendered before he could be
fired. The Orioles have been a $150 million (two-year payroll)
wasteland since.
</P>
<P>
   With Ray Miller as the manager, handpicked by the owner, Peter
Angelos, the Orioles have compiled a 130-147 record this season and
last and have staggered an insurmountable distance from the
Yankees, an aggregate of 55{ games before Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Angelos has resisted firing Miller during the season, but now
that Garner is available, Angelos may pursue him and make the
change if and when he catches him.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit D: The Detroit Tigers fired the popular Buddy Bell as
manager last Sept. 1 and replaced him with Larry Parrish. But as
disappointing as they were last year under Bell, the Tigers are
more disappointing under Parrish this season.
</P>
<P>
   At this point last season the Tigers had a 46-69 record and were
in last place, 18{ games from first. They reached Saturday with a
46-69 record, in last place and 24{ games from first. This is not
how the Tigers planned to march into their new park next season.
</P>
<P>
   This season has not gone the way the Anaheim Angels planned,
either. After a flap over some players' view toward the manager,
Terry Collins, the Angels made a Disney-like move, showing the
players who was in charge by giving Collins a contract extension.
Now, after plunging 13 games in the standings in a recent 18-game
stretch and losing 23 of their last 27 games, the Angels staggered
into Saturday's game 21 games behind the first-place Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels players feel Collins is too frantic, makes changes
too hastily and does not let them do their jobs. Collins
encountered similar problems in Houston, and the Astros fired him
at the end of the 1997 season. They hired Larry Dierker, a
broadcaster of all things, to replace Collins, and they are in
position to win their third consecutive division championship under
Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Blue Jays fired their manager, Tim Johnson, during
spring training, an unusual time for such a move. But they were
concerned about the continued fallout from his fanciful tales about
service in Vietnam. Some people in baseball feel the Blue Jays
treated Johnson badly, especially after they had insisted he
apologize for his behavior, but the Blue Jays are pleased with the
results. Under Jim Fregosi, they are contending for the wild-card
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Athletics are contending for that spot, too, and
they are doing it under Art Howe, whom they considered firing but
did not. There's a saying in baseball that some of the best moves
are the ones you don't make. In this instance, the Athletics are 10
games better than they were last year, 62-53 compared with 52-63.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Reds made a similarly wise decision in retaining
Jack McKeon as their manager, despite the feeling in at least one
quarter that he was too old. Joe Morgan, player turned author,
wrote in a recently published book that ``at 69 his time has
passed,'' and that McKeon would not be able to relate to the Reds'
young players.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds' players, young and old, love McKeon, and the front
office loves where he has the team, in first place when play began
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Season Blues
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Valentine is trying to be No. 1, but for now he'll have to
settle for being No. 3, though on a different list. With the Mets'
game in San Francisco on Saturday, Valentine will have managed more
games in the major leagues without finishing first than all but two
managers: Paul Richards (1,837) and Jimmy Dykes (2,962).
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Banks knows what that's all about. He played in 2,528
games, more than any other player, without ever playing in a
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' Banks said when told about Valentine. ``I know how
that feels. I know how he feels. My heart goes out with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Banks remembered _ how could he forget? _ that it was
the Mets who deprived him of his best chance of playing in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets were the team that kept me from getting there with my
last chance,'' he said, alluding to the Chicago Cubs' collapse in
1969. ``Those were rugged times for all of us. Sometimes you can
feel you have something in the bag and the bag breaks. It was my
last chance. I was 40. The Mets were so good. They just overtook
us. That was it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks, who played for 19 years, was reminded of the void in his
career last month when he was in Boston for the All-Star Game and
the announcement of the plans for voting for the MasterCard MLB
All-Century Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was talking,'' Banks related, ``and we were enjoying
each other. I looked around and said gosh, I'm the only one here
who didn't play in the playoffs or the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   That scene reminded him, too, of other times, other gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elston Howard and I talked about it a lot,'' Banks said.
``He'd be in the World Series all the time. I said, `Elston, my
main mission in life is to get to you guys in October.' He would
laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the old-timers games. ``I'd ask the guys what
it's like to play in the World Series. Willie'' _ Mays, of course _
``started laughing. They had fun with me. I became the focal point
of the games.''
</P>
<P>
   And Hall of Fame induction weekends. ``Those guys used to tell
me that those games are totally different than any games. I think,
what would I have been like playing in those games, when the
pressure's on, when you're representing your city? You really miss
that opportunity, that feeling. You don't know how good you could
have performed under those conditions, to be in a World Series.
It's very special. I missed that. I miss that a lot. There is
nothing to take the place of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting Stirred Up to Start
</P>
<P>
   After Esteban Loaiza served as a starting pitcher in his first
four seasons in the major leagues, the Texas Rangers made him a
reliever this season. He didn't like the role, however, and four
weeks ago he pointedly asked why Ryan Glenn, a rookie, and not he
should be starting against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Loaiza, a 27-year-old Mexican, pitched in the
game, 42/3 innings to Glynn's 41/3, and was the winning pitcher.
When that slot in the rotation came up five days later, it was
Loaiza who had it. He has now started four games, winning three and
compiling a 3.04 ERA. The Rangers won his fourth start in extra
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it put a little fire under him,'' General Manager Doug
Melvin said, referring to the game Loaiza didn't start. ``That's
one thing he has lacked. We've tried to challenge him. I challenged
him earlier this year. I said, `People don't understand why you're
not doing as well as Jose Lima; you have as good an arm.' Sometimes
the light has to click on.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza, Melvin said, responded by acknowledging that he needed
to be more focused in games. ``He loses his concentration at
times,'' Melvin said. ``He has to take it a little more seriously.
He's shown some signs of doing that. He's got a durable arm. He
could be a good long guy for us, but he pitched well and deserved a
shot in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have one of the best relief corps in the
majors, need a solid starter and will give Loaiza all the starts he
wants as long as he continues to pitch effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The Myth of Letdowns
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of free agency, owners and general managers
have grumbled that players with multiyear contracts don't play as
well as they do under one-year contracts. They feel players let
down in the first years of their long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   So consider some of these recent performances in the first year
or years of multiyear contracts:
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, first year, 70 home runs. Sammy Sosa, first year,
66 home runs. Ken Griffey Jr., first two years, 56 home runs each
season. Roger Clemens, first two years, two Cy Young awards.
</P>
<P>
   And how about this season with Bernie Williams in the first year
of a seven-year contract, Robin Ventura in the first of five and
Roberto Alomar in the first of four? These are not exceptions, just
examples.

<P>
   Some are millionaires, all are living a boyhood dream of playing
professional football, but during four weeks every July or August
they are summer campers with all the ordinary problems of dormitory
life _ snoring roommates, clashes over bathroom etiquette,
arguments over who gets to watch what on television.
</P>
<P>
   Take Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn and quarterback Kerry
Collins, two of the team's most prominent players and the Felix
Unger and Oscar Madison combination of this year's Giants training
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn received an advance scouting report on Collins. ``I told
him I was a borderline slob,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn went to the Giants' camp at SUNY-Albany prepared. ``I
brought about five extra sponges for cleaning up after him,'' said
Sehorn, who is always meticulously groomed and orderly.
</P>
<P>
   But life in their portion of the Freedom Hall dorm has been
without incident. Sehorn, in fact, has not used any of his extra
sponges.
</P>
<P>
   Players have their own bedrooms, but share a living room area
and a bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought maybe I was making him nervous when some of my stuff
was starting to pile up near his stuff,'' Collins said. ``So I
grabbed it and hid it in my closet. Everything's been fine since
then.''
</P>
<P>
   That they are rooming together at all is a bit odd because
Collins replaced quarterback Danny Kanell, who was Sehorn's best
friend on the team. But Sehorn welcomed Collins from the start. And
when coach Jim Fassel was going over room assignments, he thought
it natural that Collins take Kanell's place in every way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spends most of his time on his laptop and I spend mine on
the telephone,'' said Collins, who makes nightly hours-long calls
to his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised they've gotten along,'' Fassel said. ``They
are teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Strahan and Cedric Jones are teammates, too, and the
Giants' starting defensive ends. That does not mean they get along
on everything as roommates. The heart of their quarrel is
television programming choices, and it can be best described in
initials: PBS versus WWF.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to watch educational programs or maybe a sitcom,''
Strahan said. ``He wants to watch pro wrestling or Jerry
Springer.''
</P>
<P>
   They have roomed together before, and Strahan and Jones knew
enough to bring two televisions this summer, one for each bedroom.
But this arrangement has brought about only a certain measure of
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to take a nap and Cedric is yelling to me,
`Michael, turn on Channel 33, they're throwing chairs on Jerry
Springer!''' Strahan said at camp last week. ``I said, `Cedric,
excuse me, I'm trying to sleep in here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jones, ``Well, I didn't know he was asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has complaints of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``His phone is ringing all day and night,'' he said of Strahan,
who recently concluded negotiations for a $32 million contract
extension. ``And he's not just watching educational programs, he's
watching those music videos all the time. He does tell me my TV is
too loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan called that an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too loud? I can hear it coming down the hall,'' Strahan said.
``And one night I had to get up at 3 a.m. and go turn off his TV
because he forgot to set the sleep timer.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two are good friends. They travel in Strahan's car back
and forth to practice, and to lunch and dinner daily. ``Oh yeah, I
love him,'' Strahan said. ``Cedric is easy to get along with.''
</P>
<P>
   In the suite where safeties Sam Garnes and Percy Ellsworth and
wide receiver Ike Hilliard live, boisterous rancor is the attitude
that keeps them happily together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loud place,'' Garnes said. ``A lot of trash talking.
You've got to have a thick skin to be in our league. We say, `Don't
come in there if you can't take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garnes is not talking about their existence together as much as
the three or more video basketball games they play each day. They
plan to play an entire National Basketball Association season.
Garnes was the doormat of the video league last season, so this
off-season he went into a heavy training regimen to improve his
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on my game every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's winning big.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam is hot right now,'' Hilliard acknowledged glumly.
</P>
<P>
   It's something Garnes reminds his roommates about constantly.
``I'm gloating. They don't even want to talk to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing they don't do is talk football.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, the point is to take your mind off football for a while,''
Ellsworth said. ``We get enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The players' schedule is hardly carefree. There is no time for
sailing on the Hudson River or getaways to nearby Saratoga Race
Course. There is a two-hour practice around 9 a.m., followed by
lunch. Most players take a nap before the 3 p.m. practice. After
dinner, the players are in meetings until almost 10 o'clock nearly
every night. Most are asleep by 11:30 p.m. or midnight.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to linebackers Pete Monty and Scott Galyon, bedtime is
when their problems with Derek Engler, a center, begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He snores,'' Monty said of Engler. The two are teammates and
friends from their days playing at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Galyon: ``I can hear him through his door and my door. He's
got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Engler dismissed the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we're in our separate rooms,'' he said. ``The problem
is those two nuts jumping up and down and yelling while they play
that James Bond videogame. It's a circus. I'm the one not getting
any peace and quiet. Pete is screaming much louder than he does on
the football field.''
</P>
<P>
   And from one floor below, where backup quarterback Mike Cherry
occupies the room beneath Monty, Galyon and Engler, came another
party to the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can hear somebody snoring up there,'' Cherry said. ``Then
again, that whole room is pretty loud with guys jumping on my
ceiling. They must be having fun up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, what else is summer camp for?

 NUDISTS GATHER TO SHED CARES, PRETENSES, EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MORAVIA, N.Y. _ At Empire Haven Nudist Park, visitors leave
their pretenses at the door, along with their clothes. Especially
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, hundreds of people began filtering into the private
park for this year's Northeast Naturist Festival, billed as the
largest gathering of nudists in New York state and the
second-largest in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of folks think that you have to be beautiful to run
around naked, but if you walk around here for a while, you'll see
almost the opposite is true,'' said Nancy Casey, a child counselor
from Rochester who strolled about the park with her husband,
Darrell, both wearing nothing but sandals.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the 300 or so nudists gathered here this weekend
seem not to be slaves to Stairmasters. Mostly in their 40s and 50s,
they are forklift operators, police officers, accountants,
ministers, teachers and grandparents. They have come from as far
away as Illinois, Florida and parts of Canada to be naked with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Though Empire Haven, the first and oldest nudist park in the
state, has been open for 40 years, recreational nudism is not quite
a mainstream movement. Wary of being labeled perverts or sex
maniacs, nudists (many now prefer to be called naturists) felt
compelled to keep their hobby a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Such fears are rapidly melting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much more acceptance in society,'' said Morley
Schloss, 57, a retired Rochester school administrator who helped
organize this weekend's festival. ``People tried it and found out
they didn't lose their jobs.'' As nude guests sat down to a dinner
of steamed vegetables with roast beef or whitefish, Schloss
strolled about nude, save for three strings of colored beads around
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Through the park's expanses of grass and trees, cherubic young
children held hands and cavorted in the buff under their parents'
watchful gaze. Such is life at the 97-acre park, located in the
Finger Lakes region of western New York: relaxed, unhurried and,
for the most part, naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way to de-stress myself,'' said
Steve P., who would not give his last name but said he was an
ex-Marine who works as an accountant for a Big Five firm in lower
Manhattan. Friday afternoon, he sat naked in the clubhouse, typing
an electronic spreadsheet on a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come here to shed my worries, shed my clothes, shed
everything,'' he said. ``It's a form of honesty. You see me
standing there nude, you don't know if I'm a plumber, a truck
driver or a Wall Street financial guy. There's nothing to hide
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many people come here unaware of what they are getting into.
The nearest paved road is miles away, the entrance is gated and a
wall of pine, oak and maple trees is so thick that many folks in
downtown Moravia, four miles away, don't know the nudist park
exists.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with Al and Marlene Robinson, Empire Haven's
friendly husband-and-wife owners. Robinson's father bought the
land, which used to be a mix of cow pastures, apple orchards and
strawberry fields, and opened the park in 1959. Robinson pretty
much grew up a nudist, and raised his children the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for my kids, because they grew up knowing that no
one is different from anyone else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The park is open from May through October. Visitors and the
handful of trailer home owners who live here over the summer have
the clubhouse, a pool, a volleyball court, a private pond and acres
of meadow at their disposal. Nudity is optional everywhere except
in the pool area, sauna and hot tub.
</P>
<P>
   Photography is not permitted without permission, and no one is
allowed to drive in unchecked. Under a white tent near the entrance
gate on Friday, Mrs. Robinson, topless, registered guests and
collected camping fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't really know what a nudist park is until you get
here,'' said Al Robinson, 60, clad in shorts and a T-shirt. Before
driving off to buy 50 pounds of potatoes for that night's dinner,
he added, ``It's a way of life, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Empire Haven guests are members of the Naturist Society,
the sponsor of this weekend's festival and one of two factions of
American nudism that have emerged over the years. The Naturist
Society _ or TNS, as it is known here _ is more political, and its
members are known to take an activist approach to challenging the
clothing requirements at public beaches. The American Association
for Nude Recreation, on the other hand, tends to be less
confrontational about nudity, preferring to gather in private.
</P>
<P>
   Both organizations have prospered in the last 10 years, as
nudism's negative stereotype fades.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say there are not plenty of misconceptions about
nudity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general perception in the public that if you're
nude, you've got to be having sex,'' said Mrs. Casey, stepping,
nude, inside her trailer home with her husband, who was also nude.
``Nudity and sexuality are not connected in this park.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in ways the park embodies family wholesomeness, with
children playing tag, couples dancing to music and Mrs. Casey
leading a ``hug workshop'' for 25 naked older people seated in lawn
chairs. Inhibitions don't seem to exist around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised how many people secretly enjoy being
nude,'' said Jack Will, a retired Rochester police officer,
lounging naked next to the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quite a few of my friends on the force that go
nude,'' he said. ``It's like a fraternity,'' he said, gesturing to
other nude sunbathers. ``Everybody's equal when you don't have your
clothes on.''

DOUGLAS BAZATA, 88, DARING WAR HERO AND ARTIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Del., France, Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas DeWitt Bazata, who served with the U.S. Office of
Strategic Services behind enemy lines in France in World War II and
later became an artist, died on July 14 in his home in Chevy Chase,
Md. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Bazata was reported to The New York Times on Aug.
6.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as ``a red-haired soldier of fortune who called
all colonels `Sugar''' in a 1978 book, ``Honorable Men,'' by
William Colby, a former director of central intelligence, and Peter
Forbath.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata, a Pennsylvanian who had already served in the Marines
and who was a skilled boxer and marksman, became an Army officer in
1942 and also joined the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be one of a daring group of about 50 American
parachute officers who volunteered for what Colby described as ``a
highly hazardous mission'' in Nazi-occupied France, Belgium and the
Netherlands. Other members of the group included Stewart Alsop,
later a noted journalist, and Colby.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the American group received training for operations
as commandos and behind-the-lines guerrillas in what was called the
OSS' Operation Jedburgh. It is said to have received that name from
a place in Scotland where ``Jedburgh justice'' for sheep rustlers
was said to mean, ``Hang them first and question them afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   In three-man international teams, more than 250 American and
other Allied ``Jeds'' were dropped by parachute across France,
Belgium and the Netherlands to aid in leading the resistance in
those countries against the German occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Capt. Bazata, as he then was, managed to parachute into
the Haute-Saone department in eastern France without being captured
by the Germans. He was the leader of a three-man Jedburgh team.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the ground, Bazata got in touch with a British secret
agent whose code name was Emile. Emile had arrived in Haute-Saone
earlier, also by parachute, with the mission of assisting the
area's Maquis, as the French anti-Nazi guerrillas were known.
</P>
<P>
   The Maquis, along with Bazata and Emile, harried the German
troops and, it is said, drew attention away from a sector of
France's strategically important Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata, a major by the time he left the Army in 1947, was
recalled admiringly by Emile in a volume of memoirs, ``Maquis,''
which came out in 1947. Emile, whose real name was George Millar,
wrote that ``walking with the tempestuous Bazata toward the German
lines was like riding a horse with a mouth of iron.'' Once Emile
and Bazata escaped the attention of nearby Germans by pretending to
be innocent Frenchmen gathering mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   His mettle was tested particularly during operations against the
Germans in August and September 1944, when he earned the Purple
Heart four times as well as the Distinguished Service Cross and
France's Croix de Guerre with two palms.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata's postwar life was mercifully peaceful, and diverse. He
studied wine making in Paris and worked in the wine industry in
Europe for some years. A decade after the war's end, he plunged
into painting, in the Abstract Expressionist vein, and had one-man
shows in France, England and Germany as well as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow painter Salvador Dali executed a canvas called
``Homage to Bazata'' in which Bazata was done up as Don Quixote. An
admiring British art critic, Michael Webber, remarked in 1969, in
the British journal Arts Review, that by then Bazata had lived ``a
life eventful enough for a dozen novels.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s Bazata, having given up both the wine
industry and the painting world, began operating a pheasant
preserve and hunting club in Maryland. In later years he held a
post in the Veterans Administration and went on to serve for a
time, in the Reagan administration, as special assistant to
secretary of the Navy John Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata was born in Wrightsville, Pa., the son of a Presbyterian
minister. He studied at Syracuse University and served in the
Marines from 1933 to 1937.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage in 1943 to Diana Chirieleison ended in divorce, as
did his marriage in 1948 to Penelope Grant.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 29 years, Marie Pierre Bazata, survives him, as does
a son, Nicholas, of the county of Northumberland, England, and a
brother, Charles, of Wilmington, Del.

SPORTS COLUMN: CAPTAIN CRENSHAW'S TWO FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GLF-PGA, GLF-PGA-NOTEBOOK) 
(mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Now for another Ryder Cup controversy: Ben
Crenshaw's two captain's choices to fill out the 12-man U.S. team
that will try to recapture the trophy from the European pros Sept.
24-26 at The Country Club outside Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Ten automatic members, led by David Duval and Tiger Woods, will
be determined by the final point standing after Sunday's conclusion
of the Professional Golfers' Association Championship. Duval,
Woods, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III and Mark O'Meara have clinched
berths. Hal Sutton, Justin Leonard and Jim Furyk are virtually sure
of confirming their reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after that,'' Crenshaw said before the PGA started, ``I'll
be looking at the others, starting with Phil Mickelson.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson was ninth in the standing, followed by Jeff Maggert in
the 10th and last automatic spot, then Tom Lehman, Steve Stricker,
John Huston, Chris Perry, Bob Estes, Steve Pate and Fred Couples.
But the outcome of the PGA will likely change that order.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker and Huston wrecked their chances by missing the 36-hole
cut while Perry, Estes, Pate and Couples could move up.
</P>
<P>
   If Jay Haas, Stewart Cink, Skip Kendall or Estes emerges as the
PGA champion, Crenshaw will be almost obligated to choose him. But
if there is no shuffle in the standing, Lehman and Couples will
appear to be the captain's likely choices, if only for their
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking,'' Crenshaw said, ``for that player that has that
solid game and can hit sound shots and can play that golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples won seven matches, lost nine and halved four with the
last five Ryder Cup teams; Lehman was 3-2-2 with the last two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who stopped at The Country Club recently for a practice
round, endeared himself to Crenshaw, a Ryder Cup traditionalist, by
saying some pros ``should be ashamed of'' themselves for stirring a
controversy over their request for payments by the PGA of America
that would be donated to charity.
</P>
<P>
   The European team standing, led by Colin Montgomerie, Lee
Westwood, Darren Clarke and Paul Lawrie, won't be finalized until
after next weekend's BMW International Open in Munich, Germany.
Mark James, the European captain, is expected to choose Jesper
Parnevik of Sweden and Sergio Garcia, if the 19-year-old Spanish
prodigy whose 66 led the PGA's first round stays outside the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw will gather most of the American team at The Country
Club on Aug. 30 for what he described as a ``reconnaissance
rehearsal'' on a course that the pros haven't played since the 1988
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know that golf course,'' the captain said. ``It's
rustic. It's natural. It has every conceivable shot. I think it's
going to be a classic match-play course. But knowledge is going to
be a factor. It's very much up and down with New England terrain,
rocky outcroppings. It's a wonderful approach-shot course. You must
have the right club in your hand. And the greens are wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw has fond memories of the greens. Growing up in Austin,
Texas, he had always putted on Bermuda-grass greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to the 1968 U.S. Junior Amateur at The Country
Club,'' he said, ``I was putting on bent-grass greens for the first
time. I thought: `This is easy. All you have to do is get the ball
on line.'''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him as one of the best putters in golf history, but not
necessarily easy for mere mortals, even a Ryder Cup mortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are beautifully shaped with some puzzling rolls in
them,'' Crenshaw said. ``They're sufficiently undulating. You've
got to know where not to put the ball. But they're beautiful
greens, a good test of putting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Ryder Cup's match-play format, the holes will be decided
on and around what are relatively small greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want our players to really work hard on their short games
because that's how you win holes, and when you do, you also
confidently go on to the next hole,'' Crenshaw said. ``It seems
like in the last few meetings the Europeans have done a beautiful
job of getting that ball up and down in tough situations. In order
for us to do well, we'll have to be sharper in the short game.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods won't be there on Aug. 30 because of a prior commitment,
but he plans to stop there sometime before the team officially
arrives in Boston for that week's practice rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who have not been there have a lot to learn,''
Crenshaw said. ``It's not a course you can grasp in a few days. I
want them to understand where they're going to compete. It's a very
special place that means a lot to the history of the game. I want
them to experience that and learn the course as best they can. It's
anything but a straightforward American-type course.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the money dispute still simmering, this will be
anything but a straightforward Ryder Cup match.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: SAN FRANCISCO'S MEMORABLE NEWSPAPER WARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after a premature obituary of The San Francisco Examiner
several years ago, the paper's executive editor, Phil Bronstein,
issued staff T-shirts emblazoned with the boast ``We're Still
Here.'' Fairly soon now, by the sound of it, the T-shirts will be
stuffed into packing boxes along with old press passes and expiring
antacid tablets. San Francisco is beginning to look like another
one-newspaper town.
</P>
<P>
   Closing a daily newspaper in this country is no longer news, of
course. What makes the San Francisco story worth registering is the
flamboyant rivalry between The Examiner and The San Francisco
Chronicle, a news duel that lasted more than a century. The
competition produced some of the more colorful chapters in American
journalism and helped define the character of one of the country's
most distinctive cities.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst's raucous news empire began when he took
over The Examiner in 1887 and proved that nothing is really new in
the news trade, even today's ``infotainment.'' The paper was a
graduation present from his father, a kind of rich kid's business
toy. Fresh from Harvard, the youth vowed to be ``alarmingly
enterprising'' and ``startlingly original.'' On these promises, at
the very least, Hearst delivered.
</P>
<P>
   When the city could not rescue five fishermen marooned on a rock
outside the entrance to San Francisco Bay in 1890, Hearst and
several staff members borrowed a tug, braved the storm, saved the
men and brayed at the competition, which still had the fivesome
languishing at sea.
</P>
<P>
   When the actress Sarah Bernhardt came to town, Hearst reporters
quickly ``escorted'' her away from members of the competing press.
Even then, The Examiner's report of her tour of an opium den in
Chinatown seemed to suffer from a faint whiff of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   The McGinty ``orphans,'' fabricated one slow news day by The
Examiner's staff, brought tears to the eyes of many readers,
including Hearst's own mother. She donated a sporting $100, a good
percentage of which ended up at the local pub where editors met to
discuss their predicament. They finally bathed a few young
volunteers and renamed them McGinty for the occasion. When the
competition found out, Hearst's newspaper, once again, made news.
</P>
<P>
   If it was not great journalism, this loose, jingoistic, carnival
of a newspaper was lucrative, at least for a while. After more
difficult times, The Examiner and The Chronicle entered a joint
operating agreement in 1965, generally a sort of two-headed cash
cow that allows struggling newspapers to share profits and business
expenses while keeping their editorial departments separate.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner also became an afternoon paper, a news form that
became endangered in this country at about the same time television
invented the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner steadily lost circulation even as Hearst's
grandson, William R. Hearst III, took over in the 1980s and tried
to reconstitute some of the old flair. Young Hearst hired his own
eccentrics, including Hunter Thompson, whose missives were
sometimes so mysterious that editors once suspected that his hands
had accidentally shifted a few keys on the keyboard. Thompson, for
his part, says it was ``a little bit like working in a paper on the
moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank McCulloch, a respected editor lured out of retirement to
help run the paper, recalls publishing a few important stories,
but, as he says now, ``I would have hated to run the Examiner when
I was still serious about journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   With The Examiner at 114,000 readers and The Chronicle at about
475,000, San Franciscans have made their choice. What adds to the
Hearst family drama, however, is Hearst Corp.'s decision to buy The
Chronicle and sell Hearst's flagship paper. As a business move,
this may be sound, but for newspaper buffs, it feels like Pillsbury
putting a fork in its own doughboy.
</P>
<P>
   While some readers suspected that The Chronicle would close shop
after the columnist Herb Caen died in 1997, San Franciscans have
remained fairly loyal to a paper that has specialized in provincial
news since it appeared in the city's boomtown saloons over 130
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, its fare feels easy and light, much like the city it
serves. As Martin Nolan, a Boston Globe columnist living in San
Francisco, explains, ``The late-breaking recipe takes precedence
over the Ways and Means Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's future flavor is a mystery, except that readers
probably cannot expect an ``alarmingly original'' paper like the
first one created by Citizen Hearst.

EDITORIAL: BREAKING THE IRAQ DEADLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   When Richard Holbrooke takes over as America's representative to
the United Nations, one of the most important issues he will face
is the stalemate over Iraq. The Security Council has been in
disarray on Iraq, and Saddam Hussein has been taking advantage.
With no international arms inspectors present, he has been free to
rebuild his purchasing networks and resume production of toxic and
nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, American and British jets have launched more
than 1,000 missile strikes answering challenges to enforcement of
Iraq's two no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   But these attacks are no substitute for on-site arms inspection.
When the Security Council resumes discussions on Iraq next month,
Holbrooke must apply his talents to uniting its members around a
new plan for sending inspectors back with full authority to carry
out the requirements imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf
war.
</P>
<P>
   Recent accounts by Richard Butler, the former chief weapons
inspector, Scott Ritter, who led inspection teams inside Iraq, and
Tim Trevan, a former inspection commission spokesman, offer sharply
competing interpretations of how inspections broke down in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But one theme common to all three accounts is Iraq's successful
campaign to manipulate divisions on the Security Council. Those
divisions ultimately thwarted efforts to hold Iraq to its
disarmament obligations.
</P>
<P>
   The council lineup pits France, Russia and China against the
United States, Britain and a large majority of other members. All
agree that resuming inspections is necessary and all are willing to
offer Baghdad the suspension of some U.N. sanctions if it provides
substantial cooperation. But the three main holdouts would concede
too much financial relief in exchange for too little cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The majority position is reflected in a British draft, which
Washington provisionally supports. It would create a new inspection
commission that would hand Baghdad a list of the most important
remaining disarmament requirements.
</P>
<P>
   If Iraq readmitted inspectors and complied with these
requirements, export sanctions would be suspended for four months,
with the revenues going into an internationally supervised account.
If Iraq kept cooperating, the suspensions would continue. If it
cheated, sanctions would be reimposed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington would prefer that no sanctions relief be granted
until Iraq had met all of its obligations in full and Saddam
Hussein was out of power. But the White House has rightly been
willing to compromise to rebuild international unity. France is
demanding a less onerous list of initial disarmament tasks, wider
sanctions relief and looser controls over Iraqi revenues.
Washington must insist on a strict task list and financial
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Passing a new U.N. resolution will not guarantee that Iraq will
readmit inspectors or provide consistent cooperation. Saddam
Hussein has a long record of defiance. But even he has generally
shied away from confronting a united Security Council.

EDITORIAL: THE HATEFUL AGENDA OF IGNORANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Aug. 15:
</P>
<P>
   Buford Furrow Jr., the man who attacked a Jewish community
center in Los Angeles last Tuesday, is something of a throwback,
even among white supremacists. The trajectory of his simple,
malevolent faith is expressed in two photographs, one taken of him
wearing an Aryan Nations uniform in northern Idaho, the other of
him wearing police handcuffs in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that Furrow would have prospered as a campus
recruiter for Aryan Nations. It is also unlikely that he could have
done much to further the supremacist movement's growing presence on
the Internet, except, of course, as hero and, if convicted and
sentenced to death for the murder of Joseph Ileto, as martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow embodies the attributes, amounting nearly to stereotype,
that have made it all too tempting to regard white supremacy as a
fading, peripheral irruption within normal society.
</P>
<P>
   But not Benjamin Smith. He killed himself after wounding several
people and murdering two in a series of racially motivated attacks
in Illinois and Indiana in early July. He was 21 and from a
prosperous family, but he was also a frenetic college recruiter for
the white supremacist World Church of the Creator.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the kind of young man who tried to twist his message
to conform to _ or lie concealed within _ the canons of ordinary
society. He never lived in a supremacist enclave or wore an Aryan
Nations uniform. Furrow, an unpersuasive figure, was dangerous to
himself and his immediate victims. Smith was dangerous in a far
more insidious way.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has sampled the hate sites on the Web cannot help but
notice a striking thing. The more extreme the doctrine, the firmer
its reliance on what passes for logic and historical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It is as though, recognizing the absurdity of their racist and
inherently violent conclusions, men like Smith insist upon the
logical, evidentiary steps by which they arrive at them. The utmost
that white supremacists achieve in argument is the appearance of
plausibility, and this is achieved only on the premise of the
reader's ignorance. In their literature, false notions of evolution
coexist with false ideas of revelation. Invented histories support
insupportable conceptions of culture.
</P>
<P>
   But for too many people, now as always, and especially for the
young, plausibility is often more compelling than fact, the
explanatory power of a sinister theory more satisfying than the
circumstances of living in a complex, rapidly shifting world.
</P>
<P>
   The only real argument the white supremacists make is at the
point of a gun. Speech, of their kind, is scarcely separable from
violence, which leaves us with the conundrum of distinguishing what
the American Civil Liberties Union calls ``abstract beliefs'' and
their legitimate expression, which deserve protection, from the
actual crimes they sometimes generate.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the ideas behind these shootings sound hateful to any
reasonable person. But it is more dangerous to shut them out _ to
ignore them, pretend they do not exist, or prosecute the holding or
articulation of such beliefs. Hateful as it is, the sound of such
ideas in the air is the mark of this democracy's vigilance and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   There will always be racists and supremacists of one kind or
another among us. They are the legacy of a violent history from
which we have only recently, in this century, begun to think of
absolving ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their methods and tools will change, as will the circumstances
that motivate them, but their arguments will always be the same. It
does not take logicians or historians or anthropologists to confute
them. One only needs to know that any argument, any solicitation,
that ends in division, exclusion and hatred is by its nature evil.

COMMENTARY: A JOURNEY TO AN ISLAND THAT FEELS FAR AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FISHERS ISLAND, N.Y. _ Residents of this tiny squiggle of land
three miles off the Connecticut coast could not feel more
disconnected from their local government. Then again, isolation is
what brought them here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The government is the town of Southold, way down on the North
Fork of Long Island. It's a 12-mile trip by water. But to get back
and forth, you have to ride two ferries, stopping in New London,
Conn., to change boats. The trip takes about four hours each way.
Few people ever bother.
</P>
<P>
   One day every August, though _ out of guilt or curiosity or
boredom, or simply because someone started doing it decades ago and
no one has ever stopped _ politicians and bureaucrats and a handful
of other dignitaries from Southold, Suffolk County and New York
state pile into a chartered ferry and cruise over here for a peek,
to take care of a little business and, most thoughtful of all, to
give island gadflies and busybodies who've been saving up a year's
worth of gripes a chance to vent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to touch the people,'' said Alice Hussie, a
councilwoman making the trip the other day for the eighth time.
</P>
<P>
   Just before noon, about 100 name-tagged officials in Bermuda
shorts and windbreakers stepped off the ferry. A dozen residents
were waiting to whisk the visiting horde off for a spin around the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Hunt, president of the island's civic association, drove
off with the town engineer, eager to point out roads that needed
reflectors, trees that needed trimming and streets that could use
no-parking signs.
</P>
<P>
   Any tour leads from the old fort on the west end, where the
year-rounders live and work, to the eastern end of the island, a
moneyed paradise of mansions invisible even from the private road
and country clubs that are accepting no new members.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the two ends of the island get along quite well _ a
good thing, since they depend on each other so heavily. The 275
year-rounders _ lobstermen, telephone workers, caretakers and
schoolteachers _ do all the work, volunteering in the fire
department and taking turns on the Sea Stretcher, which roars over
to the hospital in New London in 17 minutes flat.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 or 4,000 summer people _ folks with nicknames like
Twig and Bobsie, last names like DuPont and Luce _ hold
fund-raisers, sit on boards and write checks. In the late 1980s,
when the year-round population was dropping like a yacht anchor,
threatening the labor pool that keeps the golf greens mowed and the
ferries running, they underwrote the construction of affordable
housing for 12 year-round families.
</P>
<P>
   Lately they've been paying for a campaign to protect the
depleted lobster stocks around Fishers Island from big fishing
outfits based in Montauk and Connecticut. The eight lobstermen left
here say they are being squeezed out of the business, and most are
thinking about moving away. But with their families and employees,
they account for a tenth of the island's year-rounders and about a
fourth of the fire department.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut and New York fought over Fishers Island for 200
years before a committee representing both states awarded it to New
York in 1879. But now neither state seems to show much interest.
``Last year the town board did a resolution to do everything they
can to help us,'' said Chris Edwards, a lobsterman, summer-home
caretaker, firefighter and school-board member. ``They haven't done
anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   On this year's Town Fathers Day, as Fishrs Islanders call the
yearly rite, the Southold council had some serious business to
attend to: interviewing constables. The part-time job pays around
$12,000 and involves little more than responding to false burglar
alarms. Two state troopers posted on the island during the summer
take care of real crime, like speeding.
</P>
<P>
   After a lunch of white-bread sandwiches in the gym of the
island's K-12 school, where the graduating class this year was
three students, everyone settled in for the meeting. As usual, the
visitors outnumbered the islanders by more than three to one. The
visitors introduced themselves, as did the island residents. The
Southold town supervisor, Jean Cochran, announced that she planned
to include a third constable in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was nearly 3 p.m. _ time to catch the ferry home.

DUCKS WILL DARKEN THE SKY THIS FALL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A record number of ducks will be flying south this fall,
according to Ducks Unlimited and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The service began surveying breeding duck populations in North
America in 1955. This year, the service estimates that there were
43.8 million ducks in the survey area. That was the highest count
since the survey's start _ 12 percent more than last year, and 34
percent higher than average.
</P>
<P>
   These annual surveys, which take place in May, have
traditionally covered the north-central United States, from,
roughly, the Dakotas and Montana up through Canada's prairie
provinces, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba, an area in which
most North American ducks breed. Since 1995, the survey has also
included eastern Canada and portions of the northeastern United
States. Ducks Unlimited, a private, nonprofit waterfowl
conservation organization founded in 1937, says that hunters,
wildlife watchers and conservationists in North America ``should
expect a spectacular fall flight,'' perhaps the largest in more
than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this happy prospect is that much wetland and pothole
breeding habitat in this country and Canada was in good or
excellent shape this spring and early summer when the birds were
nesting. Steve Adair, Ducks Unlimited's manager of habitat
development, notes that the Wildlife Service also counts the number
of ponds _ many of which dry up during drought _ in the survey
area; the count this year was 6.7 million. Last year it was 4.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mallards, by far the continent's most common duck, increased 15
percent since the 1998 survey, to more than 11 million birds.
Green-winged teal were up 35 percent, to 2.8 million, and
blue-winged teal went to 7.2 million from 6.4 million. Both species
of these little, fast-flying birds are at record highs. Even scaup
and pintails, species that have been in trouble the past decade,
showed increases of 27 and 21 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Gadwalls and redheads were exceptions to this success story,
down 14 and 3 percent, respectively, and another species, the black
duck, continued its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Held in high esteem by New England gunners for its sagacity and
its edibility, the black duck remains in trouble, its populations
down 28 percent from 1998. Waterfowl biologists speculate that the
reason is that the mallards are outcompeting the black ducks for
habitat and also hybridizing with them. On the Eastern seaboard,
where black ducks seem to be holding their own, New Brunswick is
the species' prime breeding area. It is estimated that the breeding
populations of all ducks that visit the northeastern United States
are up by 5 percent, Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   Adair also noted that Atlantic populations of migratory Canada
geese have rebounded this year, up 84 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ducks Unlimited's executive vice president, Matt Connolly, who
is retiring this summer, is leaving in a blaze of glory. In its
fiscal year 1999, which ended last February, the organization
raised over $118 million, more than any other year in its history,
and its membership increased 30,000 to more than 700,000.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest and most influential wetlands and waterfowl
conservation organization, Ducks Unlimited protected and restored
more than 300,000 acres of wildlife habitat in the United States
alone during fiscal year 1999. Adding land conserved by its sister
organizations in Canada and Mexico, the total area conserved during
that period was nearly 500,000 acres. Since Ducks Unlimited's
inception, it has raised more than $1.2 billion to conserve some
8.8 million acres in North America.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, most of the organization's members are duck
hunters. It is with both ducks and hunters in mind that the group
sponsored three retriever training clinics in New England this
summer. One remains: Aug. 28-29 at the Nod Brook Wildlife
Management Area in Simsbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The clinics include a Saturday training procedure seminar ($60)
and a hands-on Sunday session ($125) open to owners of retrievers
six months or more old. Only 12 dogs will be allowed to attend. For
reservations, call Craig Ferris at (203) 426-2466.
</P>
<P>
   A good dog can make the difference between success and failure
when waterfowling, finding downed birds in thick cover or
retrieving those that fall far out on lake or bay when the wind is
offshore. Even with a well-trained retriever, a hunter will not
recover all the birds he shoots, but a dog sharply reduces such
losses.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a bonus for the waterfowler who uses a dog: the
presence of a companion always eager to shiver beside you in a
wind-ripped blind.

BETWEEN DRAFT AND CAMP, A ROOKIE HAS A CHANGE OF HEART
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strange story of defensive lineman Dimitrius Underwood took
an odd turn after he signed his five-year, $5.3 million contract
with the Minnesota Vikings on Aug. 1. At that time, Underwood was a
smiling, proud man who showed no indication that he was having
second thoughts about playing professional football.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't said exactly what happened, but something changed in
the mind of the former Michigan State star that would soon result
in a nearly two-week drama.
</P>
<P>
   The day after he signed his contract Underwood went to his first
Vikings practice. He was out of shape and was manhandled in his
first encounter with the team's outstanding offensive line. The
next day he left camp, and the Vikings did not hear from him for
almost a week.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation among National Football League executives is
that Underwood felt he was too physically overmatched to play in
the pros. But Underwood later explained his absence by saying he
was having a crisis of conscience and was uncertain if he could
balance football with his religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood was the 29th pick in the April 16 draft. While it is
now in vogue to say that the Vikings should have drafted a
different player, six teams contacted last week said they had
Underwood rated approximately where the Vikings selected him.
</P>
<P>
   Although Underwood's decision to leave camp took the team by
surprise, he had not had a smooth transition into professional
football. Between the draft and the start of Vikings camp on Aug.
2, Underwood fired two agents, told the Vikings he needed to miss a
minicamp because of school obligations, which they said turned out
not to be true, missed a flight to his introductory news conference
and then missed three days of another minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Vikings decided they had had enough. Underwood has
agreed to return his $543,562 signing bonus, and once he does the
Vikings will officially release him.
</P>
<P>
   As Minnesota Coach Dennis Green said, Underwood is not the first
player to walk out of camp and he won't be the last. Several years
ago an Oakland Raiders rookie, on his first day of camp, got into a
fight with another player and then left the team. Since 1994, the
Jets have watched a handful of veteran players quit during training
camp, including tight end Johnny Mitchell and offensive lineman
Erik Norgard this month.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies, naturally, have the most difficult time adjusting to
the rigors of the NFL, on and off the field. Ricky Williams, the
New Orleans Saints rookie running back, recently expressed dismay
at how some players are in professional football only for the money
and how rude some fans are when asking for autographs. Such
revelations threw Williams into a funk last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just throw stuff in your face and give you a pen
and don't say `please' and `thank you,''' Williams said. ``It makes
you feel that you are not a person, you're just something to sign
an autograph. That's kind of tough to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Capers Changes Defense
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive off-season pickup for the Jacksonville
Jaguars wasn't a player, it was defensive coordinator Dom Capers,
who has changed the makeup of the team's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Jaguars have one of the most explosive offenses in the
league, and if they can improve a defense that ranked 25th in the
league last season they will be one of the top teams in the
American Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Capers, the former head coach of the Carolina Panthers, is
trying to upgrade the defense by installing a more aggressive
zone-blitz attack along the lines of the one he directed so
successfully with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the early 1990s. The
players are so impressed with Capers that they look at him as a
sort of co-head coach. He runs the defense and head coach Tom
Coughlin runs the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The secondary centers around the newly acquired safety Carnell
Lake, who left the Steelers for a four-year, $18 million contract
with the Jaguars. Lake, who starred under Capers and his
predecessors in Pittsburgh, is one of the best blitzers in the
league and should continue to do well with the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Problems Down Under
</P>
<P>
   While the Denver Broncos and the San Diego Chargers were putting
on a solid performance in the American Bowl in Australia last week,
league officials were busy putting out several small fires behind
the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   First, the league does not allow its teams to put gambling
advertisements in stadiums. But the NFL does not control stadiums
in Australia and there was a gambling ad inside the stadium before
the Broncos-Chargers game. The NFL was able to intervene and remove
the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was another dispute between the NFL and Experimental
and Applied Sciences, the Colorado firm that makes nutritional
supplements. Last year the league's drug adviser on steroids, Dr.
John Lombardo, warned each team about the use of Andro-6, an EAS
product that is said to boost testosterone levels and increase
strength and muscle mass. Use of the product put players at risk
for failing drug tests, Lombardo wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Broncos players use EAS products and endorse the
company. When EAS attempted to get both their personnel and
promotional products into the Denver locker room in Australia, the
NFL kept both out.
</P>
<P>
   There are sure to be other disagreements. EAS considers the
Broncos some of their most valuable clients, while the NFL does not
like the company or its products.
</P>
<P>
   Caution on Sanders
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders could return from his toe surgery in
two weeks. The team will approach his situation cautiously and
probably not play Sanders until the last preseason game on Sept. 2
against Jacksonville. ... Quarterback Akili Smith and the
Cincinnati Bengals remain miles apart in their contract
negotiations. Smith could miss at least another week and probably
longer.

SENTENCE IN ISRAEL SPY CASE IS TOO LONG, GIULIANI SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Touching on cases of sedition and espionage that
could be of concern to Puerto Rican and Jewish voters in next
year's race for the U.S. Senate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said
Saturday that he did not have enough information to form an opinion
on President Clinton's decision to commute the sentences of 16
members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group that carried out
bombings in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani said that the life sentence now being served by
Jonathan J. Pollard, the American who was arrested in 1985 for
spying for Israel, is too long compared with sentences in similar
cases. The mayor's remarks seemed to suggest that he believes that
Pollard ought to be granted clemency, a view shared by Israelis and
many Jewish groups but one that has been adamantly opposed by top
American military and security officials.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, Giuliani seems to get more questions at
his daily news conferences about the actions of the Clinton
administration and whether he believes they are in any way related
to Hillary Rodham Clinton's all-but-declared candidacy as a
Democrat for Senate in New York. Giuliani, a Republican, is also
considering a run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall on Saturday, the mayor was asked about Clinton's
decision on Wednesday to commute the sentences of 16 members of the
Armed Forces of National Liberation, or FALN, a group that was
dedicated to the independence of Puerto Rico and carried out at
least 130 bombings of political and military targets in the United
States between 1974 and 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The question focused on whether the Clinton's clemency offer
might boost his wife's standing among the large number of Puerto
Rican voters in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president had long been under pressure from minority
politicians and human rights activists to free the FALN members,
and the White House said the commutations had been in the works
long before Mrs. Clinton expressed interest in running for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who was the third-ranking official in the Justice
Department under President Ronald Reagan, said that in that post he
had handled thousands of pardon requests and that he would want to
read an internal Justice Department report about the individual
convicts and about the sentences in similar cases before he could
offer an opinion about whether the president's action was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 FALN members being offered clemency, in exchange
for declarations renouncing violence, were convicted of federal
crimes of seditious conspiracy, possession of an unregistered gun
or interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle. Some were
sentenced to more than 50 years in jail, and most have already
served more than 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to see is the pardon attorney's report,''
Giuliani said. ``This is an area that I have a great deal of
knowledge of because this is what I used to do in the Justice
Department. The pardon attorney prepares reports that try to look
at factors like remorse, rehabilitation and also comparative
sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought Mrs. Clinton's candidacy might have
been a factor, the mayor said: ``Looking at the pardon attorney's
report would tell you something like that. I mean it would give you
a sense of is this usual. Does it fit within the way in which
presidents have routinely exercised the pardon power or is it
somewhat unusual? I am acutely aware of the fact that presidents
pardon a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Pollard's case, Giuliani said he knew the facts
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that given comparative sentences, his sentence _ this
I happen to know because I have seen the documents _ his sentence
is way beyond the sentence served by other people that have been
convicted of the same offense,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and numerous Jewish-American groups have pressed for the
release of Pollard, who had been a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst
and pleaded guilty to spying for Israel. Clinton twice denied
Pollard clemency but agreed to reconsider the case after it became
an issue at the Middle East peace talks last year. The new Israeli
prime minister, Ehud Barak, has also said he would like to see
Pollard released.

KEOUGH RECALLS HOW MARTIN DEPENDED ON THE A'S STARTERS  
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Also see BBO-COMPLETE-GAMES) (ko) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Martin had one simple instruction for his starting
pitchers when he managed the Oakland Athletics in the first three
seasons of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to tell us don't even look at the bullpen; there won't
be anyone down there,'' Matt Keough said, recalling those years
with some fondness. ``Billy's whole philosophy was, why should I
bring in someone from the bullpen, lefty or righty, when they're
not as good as the guys I have on the mound now?''
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland starters, young and full of pride, Keough said,
pitched 94 complete games in 1980 and 60 in the strike-interrupted
1981 season. Just about every member of Martin's starting rotation
wound up injured, and he was widely blamed for overusing the
pitchers. But Keough offered a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks at it as negative,'' he said of the multitude
of complete games, ``but Billy didn't get us hurt. I don't think
the complete games caused the injuries, the way we were used.''
</P>
<P>
   But _ and there was a big but _ Keough added: ``After we got
hurt, Billy convinced us to keep pitching. Our egos bought into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And on second thought, he said, it was possible that Rick
Langford, who led the team with 28 complete games in 1980 and 18 in
'81, suffered his elbow problem because of all of the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick was a sliderball pitcher,'' Keough said. ``I'm sure the
wear and tear of throwing a lot of sliders and sinkers would have
been difficult for him. He pitched a lot toward the end of that
season to try to win 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Langford won 19 games in 1980 and then faded, making it through
the next two seasons before injury sent him into a career-ending
spiral. Mike Norris, who Keough said had shoulder and elbow
problems that preceded Martin, pitched two more seasons after he
worked through 36 completes games in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   ``People make a lot out of all the complete games, but we kept
our pitch count low,'' said Keough, who tore the labrum in his
right shoulder when he slipped on a muddy mound in Baltimore in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a lot of off days because we had a lot of
doubleheaders on Sunday. Billy never skipped the fifth starter, so
it would be common for us to pitch on four days' rest and sometimes
five and even six.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keough also recalled that the starters pitched four complete
14-inning games in 1980 and were used in other ways, too, relief
appearances and assorted extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched a 14-inning complete game in Toronto,'' Keough said,
``and two days later Billy wanted to know if I could pitch to a
group of right-handers instead of throwing on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 14-inning game, he also recalled: ``Billy never asked me
after the 11th how I was. He knew that after 11 I wasn't going to
give it up. I was going to win or lose. I won.''

NOT THE HAMPTONS, AND THAT'S THE POINT: YUPPIES DISCOVER THE JERSEY
SHORE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOVELADIES, N.J. _ When Carrie and David Harmon went out to the
Hamptons in their pre-parenthood years, David packed a blue blazer,
khakis and a pair of bucks, and the couple, both lawyers, typically
ate at expensive places like the Palm restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   When they made the switch to the Jersey Shore three years ago,
he left the blazer at home but brought the khakis and bucks. This
summer, for their two-week vacation in this Long Beach Island
community, where soaring contemporary homes rise from the dunes,
his wardrobe consisted of shorts and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's dressed up if the shirt doesn't have a hole in it,''
said Mrs. Harmon, as the foamy surf washed over her calves. ``I
don't put on makeup, and my hair's in a ponytail. It's so much more
relaxed. We're not checking ourselves in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey Shore, long thought of as the uncool cousin of the
Hamptons and Fire Island, is undergoing something of a renaissance.
More and more, it is attracting refugees from the traffic and
trendiness of the Hamptons, people who want a reasonably priced
rental and a long white beach.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that the Hamptons have scared some souls away.
The Jersey Shore itself has changed, particularly in places like
Long Beach Island and the genteel towns of Sea Girt and Spring Lake
farther north.
</P>
<P>
   The ocean and beaches are cleaner than they have been in years.
And a few sleek restaurants that would look right at home in SoHo
have opened, offering an alternative to fried seafood platters and
lobster-trap decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny way to gauge things, but years ago the
automobiles were sort of Chevrolets and Buicks, but now it's BMW's
and Mercedeses,'' said Arthur C. Bennett, who, with his wife, Kay
Brover, just bought a house at the peaceful northern end of Long
Beach Island in the town of Barnegat Light. ``You also see a lot
more New York license plates.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who live on Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side
of Manhattan, could certainly afford to be in the Hamptons. He is
the chief human resources officer at the Dime Savings Bank; she is
a director of sales at the high-end real estate agency Douglas
Elliman. But they both like the break that Long Beach Island
provides from their weeknight regimen of cultural outings and
social events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I don't like the Hamptons,'' Bennett said. ``I
work in midtown, and there's no restaurant I haven't been to. You
take that whole scene and stick it 120 miles east, and forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brover said: ``We wanted a respite from that. We love the
fact that we don't know anybody here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are still towns that scream ``Jersey Shore,'' plenty
of them: where boardwalks bustle with tattooed bodies and blaring
radios, where amusement rides whir, where video arcades and bingo
halls beckon and shops like Ooh La-La, at the southern end of Long
Beach Island, sell glow-in-the-dark paper towel holders shaped like
fish _ with big lips and sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   And some vacationers say they favor the Jersey Shore over other
beach resorts precisely because of what they affectionately called
the ``schlock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jersey Shore has the tacky stores and the hoagie shops,
and I love that,'' said Kathy Schiffer, 50, a divorced mother of
two now renting a house for five weeks in Loveladies, Long Beach
Island's wealthiest community.
</P>
<P>
   But the professionals choosing the Jersey Shore over the east
end of Long Island gingerly sidestep those locales for the northern
half of Long Beach Island, as well as places like Spring Lake. Long
Beach Island is especially popular among young parents who
appreciate the relatively easy commute, the miniature golf courses
and the multitude of ice cream parlors.
</P>
<P>
   For Harmon, who loved the summers he spent in Westhampton as a
boy and later as a young man, the Jersey Shore started to look more
attractive when he had two boys and moved from Manhattan to Short
Hills, N.J., a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hamptons are a happening place for single people,'' said
Harmon, a partner in a New York law firm. ``They are magnificent,
and there's a lot more glamour there. But I'm 40 years old, have
two kids and live in New Jersey, and this makes a lot more sense
for me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring Lake, on the other hand, is emerging as a stylish place
for Wall Street singles.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no place reflects the changing sensibility of the Jersey
Shore as much as the Warren Hotel, a 19th-century Tudor-style
establishment in Spring Lake that has become the place for singles
to drink strawberry daiquiris and be seen in the setting sun. On
Saturday and Sunday afternoons, the hotel's outdoor pool bar draws
as many as 500 tanned young people on the grassy lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the same bar attracted maybe 10 or 20 hotel
guests and older patrons, and one bartender was sufficient. Today,
there are 10 bartenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it happened but they started coming here, and
now they come by the droves,'' said Mary Russell, the hotel's
owner. ``It's a very yuppie scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin O'Neill, 34, a lawyer who lives in the Park Slope section
of Brooklyn, was down visiting his girlfriend, Claudia Greco, a
30-year-old lawyer who lives in Tudor City in Manhattan. She rents
a cottage in Spring Lake with two friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think of the Jersey Shore as Bruce Springsteen, big
hair and tank tops, but this area isn't like that,'' O'Neill said
as he sipped his beer.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few years, renters have noticed changes, and
some worry that the excesses of the Hamptons may be drifting their
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still women who wear shorts at night, but now you
also see them in their downtown dresses and heels,'' said Marty
Moore, an advertising saleswoman who lives on the Upper West Side
and who has rented a house with friends for six years in Sea Girt.
``There are also major lines to get in places.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they may be reasonable by Hamptons standards, rents are
pushing upward, too. Real estate agents in Spring Lake say rents on
houses near the ocean have jumped 30 percent in two years. On Long
Beach Island, weekly rents range from $750 to $10,000. ``We have
houses in Loveladies that rent for $25,000 a week,'' said Jo Ann Lo
Duca, an agent with HCH Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   Some longtime renters, especially and paradoxically the ones
with money, seem to regret signs of encroaching wealth and status.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harmon's mother, Bernice Fein, who rented a six-bedroom
house overlooking the ocean in Loveladies for her children and
grandchildren, smarted when she spotted the first Hummer on the
island, the tank of a car popular among the super-rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bringing conspicuous consumption to a place that really
focuses on ice cream cones at night,'' she said.

AMERICA'S CUP TEAM APPEARS TO BE OVERCOMING SLOW START 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ It was all-white polo shirts and preppy faces
here Friday when the Young America team announced its official
challenge team for the 1999-2000 America's Cup trials. The
gathering on the rolling lawn of the New York Yacht Club annex
looked more like a crisp advertisement for Helly Hansen, the team's
apparel sponsor, than a sweaty gathering of sports jocks. But make
no mistake, America's Cup crews have their combative side, too.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ed Baird, skipper for the New York Yacht Club's entry,
Young America. ``We've started calling him Ward Cleaver, after the
'50 TV dad,'' Jerry Kirby, the bowman on Young America, said.
``Ed's the nicest guy on the planet. He's truly a super-dad with
his little kids, and he really cares about what the old lady on the
street thinks. But once you take the dock lines off, Ward Cleaver
disappears, and Ed becomes the Terminator.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem like a harsh description of a balding, 41-year-old
yacht racer with a quiet voice and ready smile. But the competitive
niche in his personality makes him unexpectedly aggressive on the
race course.
</P>
<P>
   He was not able to find much time last year to compete on the
world match-racing circuit. But it did not seem to matter. Baird
came up with an impressive second-place finish last month at the
Swedish Cup match-race series in Marstrand, Sweden, with several
members of the Young America team, including the highly competent
Kirby, on board the 37-foot sloop with him. Finishing first was
Peter Gilmour of Australia, the No. 1-ranked match racer in the
world and skipper of Japan's America's Cup challenge entry. But the
New York Yacht Club team's real coup in Sweden was beating Russell
Coutts, the New Zealand sailor whose team beat Dennis Conner, 5-1,
in the 1995 America's Cup match off San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very happy position right now,'' Baird said last
week. ``We have two new boats that are ready to hatch, and it's
very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it seemed that New York was not moving forward at
all. A money crunch last winter forced Young America officials to
decide in favor of technology over manpower. It had lost out on a
$2.5-million sponsorship deal with the Fox Sports Network that took
a sizable chunk out of the team's proposed $40-million budget. To
make it worse, other corporate donations seemed slow to surface.
</P>
<P>
   Laying off much of its crew for the spring and summer, the
yachting syndicate focused its limited resources on technology. It
appears now that the early disjointed effort may be coming
together. More than 40 scale-model sailboats _ each one-third of an
actual 75-foot cup yacht's actual size _ have been built for
testing. And one of the top naval architecture firms in the
business, Farr Yacht Design Ltd. of Annapolis, Md., is eager to
prove that its boat can win the America's Cup as it has almost
every grand prix event in international racing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, a three-time cup veteran, decided on the Young America
team after being wooed by other United States syndicates. But when
he decided on New York, he decided big: he came along with four
other seasoned America's Cup sailors, all of whom were on Bill
Koch's America3 team when it successfully defended the cup off San
Diego in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York made a really good decision because the most
important dollars you spend are in design,'' the 43-year-old Kirby
said. ``We would have been burning really important dollars if we
had spent it to keep on crew this last year. Money for rigs, boat
appendages and sails far outweigh any practice time this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even New York's adversaries are noticing. ``They have the
ingredients to be dominant,'' Ken Read, the helmsman for Conner's
one-boat America's Cup program, said. ``There's no doubt about
that. You'd be naive to say that Young America doesn't have the
upper hand right out of the box. But can they put all of the
ingredients in the right order?''
</P>
<P>
   Read says the answers ought to be readily apparent in the
beginning of the Louis Vuitton Cup, the four-month challengers'
trial series that begins Oct. 18 in Auckland, New Zealand. ``It
will be apparent come the first beat of the first race,'' Read
said. ``I think a lot is told in a short time. Boat speed rules.''

ROBERT JONES, 89, INNOVATOR IN JET-WING DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Miss., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert T. Jones, an innovator in aircraft design at NASA who
played an important role in developing the high-speed swept wing,
died on Wednesday at his home in Los Altos Hills, Calif. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, as the designers of combat aircraft sought
ever-greater speeds, German manufacturers such as the Messerschmitt
and Junkers companies developed and built the first jet fighters
and bombers with swept wings. The swept-wing Me 262 was the first
jet fighter to fly in combat.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, the
predecessor of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
later said the design agency had failed to develop jet engines or
swept wings at a time when Germany was the clear leader in
high-speed aircraft design.
</P>
<P>
   After the war the United States rushed to catch up, and Jones
played a crucial role.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Thursday, William Berry, deputy director of
NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., described
Jones as ``one of the world's most highly acclaimed aeronautical
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides developing swept wings to reduce the drag imposed on
aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound, Jones' innovations
included a wing designed for oblique flight, with one side swept
forward and the other backward. It was believed that a supersonic
transport plane based on the peculiar-looking design would be
particularly efficient, and a large model was successfully tested
five years ago, but so far the design has not caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Jones never obtained a bachelor's degree, but his college
training at Catholic University in Washington included a course by
Max Munk, a prominent German aerodynamicist.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jones retired from NASA in 1981 he had acquired a
host of awards and honors, including an honorary doctorate from the
University of Colorado. In 1973 he was elected to the National
Academy of Engineering, and in 1981 he was elected to the National
Academy of Sciences. In the same year he was presented with the
President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. He
also received the Smithsonian Institution's Langley Award, which is
bestowed only on leading aeronautical pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is survived by his wife, Megan More of Los Altos Hills;
two daughters, Harriet Jones of Berkeley, Calif., and Patricia
Jones of San Diego; and four sons, David of Corinth, Miss., Edward
of Murfreesboro, Tenn., and Gregory and John, both of Los Altos.

FRANK KLEILER, 85, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Mass. Wis.)  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Kleiler, a retired deputy assistant secretary of labor and
a former executive secretary of the National Labor Relations Board,
died on Aug. 8 at a nursing home in Silver Spring, Md., where he
lived. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In the Johnson and Nixon administrations, Kleiler served as
chairman of a task force within the Department of Labor that
drafted proposed legislation resulting in the Employment Retirement
Income Security Act. He also administered major portions of the
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act and the Welfare and
Pension Plans Disclosure Act.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Kleiler played a small role in President
Truman's unsuccessful effort, during a labor dispute in the early
1950s, to nationalize the steel industry, as well as in federal
efforts to block Major League Baseball players from unionizing in
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Kleiler was born April 17, 1914, in Green Bay, Wis., and grew up
in Shorewood, a suburb of Milwaukee. He graduated from Antioch
College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Moving to Washington after
college, he was a reporter for The Evening Star. A year later, he
moved to Boston to work for The Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Washington in 1937, working for the National
Mediation Board, and, in 1939, he was transferred to the National
Labor Relations Board. Over the years, he worked in several cities
for the board.
</P>
<P>
   During the Korean War, he worked for the Wage Stabilization
Board, but he returned to the Labor Department in 1953. He became a
deputy assistant secretary in 1969, and stayed in that post until
1973, receiving the department's distinguished career service
award.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, he worked with a Chicago publisher on employment
benefits plans. In 1974 and 1975, he led a team from the Federal
Mediation and Conciliation Service to supervise tribal elections on
the Ogalalla Sioux Indian Reservation at Pine Ridge, S.D. He also
wrote a book, ``Can We Afford Early Retirement?'' (Johns Hopkins
University Press, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Frances, died in 1982. He is survived by two sons,
David of Brookline, Mass., and James of Kensington, Md., and two
grandchildren.

HARLEM RALLY PLANNED, DESPITE LAST YEAR'S MELEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The organizers of last year's Million Youth March,
which ended in a violent confrontation with the police, are
planning a similar event next month and are again encountering
resistance from city officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Police Department's legal affairs office are
negotiating with organizers on the location, security and
logistical details for the event, which the organizers want to hold
on Sept. 4 on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   However, the chief organizer, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, warned:
``We will march with or without a permit, and black youth will come
from throughout the country. And if they thought it was a volatile
situation with a permit, it would be much more dangerous without
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's event was a rally rather than a march, and was held
along six blocks of Malcolm X Boulevard. It drew about 6,000
participants, according to police estimates. For this year's event,
Muhammad is seeking march and rally permits, and has announced
plans to march down Malcolm X Boulevard to a rallying area at 125th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the police shut down the No. 2 subway line and had
more than 1,600 officers in attendance and another 1,600 in
reserve, including dozens on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   As police officers in riot helmets began to inch toward the
stage near the rally's scheduled 4 p.m. conclusion, Muhammad told
participants that they should use force to defend themselves from
any police attack. At 4:05 p.m., as Muhammad asked participants to
go home peacefully and uttered the last words of his speech, metal
folding chairs were hurled at officers.
</P>
<P>
   A melee followed in which at least 30 people were injured,
including 16 police officers. Six people were charged with
attempted assault and reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   Given what happened last year, civic leaders from Community
Board No. 10 in Harlem have refused to support Muhammad's
applications for permits.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Gleaton, the board's president, said on Friday that last
year's event ``really left a bad taste in our mouths.'' He added:
``There is a general consensus that an event like this would be
best held in a better spot. It is not about whether we agree with
their views, but we just felt it should not take place in the
middle of Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad, a former senior official in the Nation of Islam, said
he hoped an agreement could be worked out with city officials. But
if it cannot, he said, his first step would be to file suit in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Police Commissioner Howard Safir said, ``We will work
with the organizers and we will hold them to any permit
requirements and city ordinances.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after the city administration refused to grant a
permit for the rally in Harlem, organizers obtained a U.S. District
Court order forcing the city to let them hold the event.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Friday from St. Louis, where he was
looking for participants, Muhammad said he planned to give a speech
at the rally attacking city officials, the Police Department, Jews
and many of the city's black civic and political leaders. He also
said he planned to call on black city residents to take up arms and
form militias to protect themselves from the police.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad was dismissed as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam in
1994 after a speech in which he referred to Jews as
`'bloodsuckers'' and made other inflammatory remarks against Roman
Catholics, whites and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   He later founded the New Black Muslim Movement and the New Black
Panther Party, both based in New York. It is unclear how large
Muhammad's following is and whether he can deliver the 50,000
participants he has promised.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad is billing this year's event as a show of strength and
unity among black teen-agers from across the country, patterned on
the 1995 Million Man March on Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, said on Friday
of plans for the event: ``Instead of speaking about hate, we as a
city should be speaking about healing and working together. Instead
of speaking about taking up arms, we should focus on getting as
many guns as possible off the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Foxman, the national president of the Anti-Defamation
League, said on Friday that he supported Muhammad's right to march,
but that he hoped Muhammad would find little public support. ``This
time, the leadership has said no, the community has said no, and if
nobody goes, it is nothing, except a bigot standing alone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood leaders also expressed concern about police
tactics, fearing that the event could again shut down Harlem,
hurting commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Eric Adams, the president of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement
Who Care, a group that was critical of the police tactics in last
year's rally, said on Friday that he hoped the city would learn
from its mistakes. He said the police response was too large and
aggressive, adding that he believed, from talking to senior police
commanders, that it was motivated more by politics than safety
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the tendency of reshooting ourselves in the foot, as
if losing a toe the first time was not enough,'' Adams added. ``I
am hoping that better minds will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said on Friday it was unlikely that opposition
would prevent the event from being held. ``The fact that people
fear the protesters' rhetoric or potential misconduct of the Police
Department does not warrant the suspension of the First
Amendment,'' he added.

FOR RUTGERS, A QUARTERBACK WHO WANTS TO LIVE IT UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Mike McMahon tells you that he does not want
to be a vocal leader, that he just wants to have fun. Looking at
how casually he works his way through the waves of cameras and
reporters, you believe him.
</P>
<P>
   But the way McMahon pictures himself is not the same way the
Rutgers Scarlet Knights see him. They are counting on the
quarterback to emerge this season as one of the leaders who will
carry Rutgers to an elusive bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his leadership, the junior recounted a story about
gathering teammates for a trip to the beach, which fits with the
shell necklaces he wears over his jersey. And he maintained that
fun should be an objective for Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is a game,'' McMahon said as the Knights went through
an interview session before beginning their first official practice
of the season. ``If you aren't having fun, why are you playing it?
I want to go out there, improve a little bit more and bring home
the bowl championship this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are goals that would fit in for the Scarlet Knights. After
being pushed into the lineup midway through his freshman year, an
0-11 season, McMahon guided Rutgers to a 5-6 record last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't believe in us still,'' McMahon said.
``They said that our schedule was easy last year. Compared to this
year, it was a lot easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a crossroads. We showed people. We went 5-6
last year and they say we're a program just ready to turn the
corner. Well, if we don't turn that corner, we're back to where the
0-11 team was. So I think, definitely, this is a big year for us.
We have to make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon is a big part of that. He is ranked the eighth-best
underclass quarterback in the nation by one magazine and named an
honorable mention all-American by another.
</P>
<P>
   When told about the accolades, McMahon shrugged and searched for
a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, all-American; you sure about that?'' he said.
``Whatever. I'd rather get the bowl championship. That would mean
so much more to the university. That's what I came in here to do,
to turn this program around.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance may have played a part in Rutgers' recruiting,
too, with the school getting an oral commitment from the first
quarterback they offered a scholarship to, Chris Dapolito, a highly
rated quarterback from Matawan (N.J.) High School.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon spent extra time in the film room this spring and
summer, time that he hopes will pay even more dividends this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had a strong arm,'' said Walter King, a junior wide
receiver who sat out last season with a back injury. ``He had that
big-play capability. But now he has it all put together. Now he
knows the plays; now he knows the receivers to go to. I think most
of all his confidence level is up. That's the main thing. I think
the way he carries himself, you can just tell.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon has already carved a niche in the Rutgers record book,
ranking in the top 10 in school history in yardage, touchdowns and
completions. But Rutgers needs not only numbers, but also someone
to help lift it through a harsh schedule, which begins at
California on Sept. 4.
</P>
<P>
   What he went through as a freshman is in the past now, but not
forgotten. McMahon will be throwing to an inexperienced receiving
corp that may include a pair of freshmen, Antoine Lovelace and
Aaron Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard to come in as a freshman,'' McMahon said. ``I
had a tough time. I remember one night crying to go home. No matter
how many all-star games you play in, people say freshmen come in
cocky, but you feel intimidated. With the receivers coming in, I
really wanted to welcome them in, get them used to everything, and
let them know that people are here for them.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Irving Kleinerman, a pathologist and lung specialist who
helped develop national health standards for the workplace, died in
an automobile accident on Aug. 6 in Arcadia, Fla. A former resident
of Shaker Heights, Ohio, he was 75 and had retired to Palm Beach
Garden, Fla., four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinerman did extensive research on the effects of tobacco
smoke on lungs and contributed to the diagnosis of lung diseases
and other occupational hazards for coal miners. His work helped
call attention to the need for health safeguards in coal and
asbestos mines and in other industrial settings.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on advisory committees for the National Institutes of
Health, the Interior Department, the Bureau of Mines and other
public agencies concerned with occupational health. He also headed
the executive committee of the American Registry of Pathology of
the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinerman was long associated with Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland, where he started as a researcher in
pathology at the Medical School in 1951. He retired in 1995 as
professor emeritus of pathology and environmental health sciences
and chairman of the pathology department at the affiliated Metro
Health Medical Center. He was head of the Division of Pathology
Research and Clinical Pathology at St. Luke's Hospital in Cleveland
from 1964 to 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He was chairman of the pathology department at Mount Sinai
School of Medicine in New York from 1978 to 1986. He also was
director of pathology at Mount Sinai Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pittsburgh, he graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh in 1943 and received his medical degree there in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Kleinerman's wife, Seretta Miller Kleinerman, died in 1995 after
50 years of marriage. He is survived by three daughters, Dr.
Eugenie Sue Kleinerman of Houston, Ellen Jan Kleinerman of Warren,
Ohio, and Kay Elise Kleinerman of San Mateo, Calif., and four
grandchildren.

 &HT;    Two schools, rocked by shootings, share similarities as new
academic year starts
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'll have to look long and hard to find any evidence
of the shootings almost four months ago at Heritage High School in
Rockdale County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The holes left by bullets fired from the .22-caliber rifle
accused gunman Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon used to shoot six of his
classmates May 20 are no longer visible in the pillars in the
school's commons area, as students discovered when they returned to
school last Wednesday. They have been filled.
</P>
<P>
   The metal frame near the door of the school's south entrance
also has been repaired. It was struck by a bullet police said
Solomon fired from a .357 magnum at fellow student Brandon
Mitchell, who pursued him after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Half a continent away at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., the scene of the nation's deadliest school shooting can't be
viewed at all. At the request of the families of the 13 people
killed by Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the
library at the school has been sealed off and will not be available
for use when students return to school Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how long we will keep it that way,'' said
Marilyn Saltzman, manager of community services for the Jefferson
County, Colo., school district. Saltzman said the library will be
relocated to two doublewide trailers. ``That is something we are
still trying to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The measures are part of the recovery of the two schools, thrust
into the national spotlight last spring when disturbed students
opened fire on their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Though Columbine's tragedy was far larger in scope than Heritage
High's, the schools and school systems share many similiarities as
they begin the 1999-2000 school year. Both will:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Require students to carry photo identification cards.
Jefferson County has introduced the photo IDs in response to the
shooting at Columbine. Rockdale County Schools had instituted the
photo ID requirement prior to the Columbine shooting, though at the
time their main purpose was for use in checking out library books
and purchasing school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Have psychologists in the schools to counsel students.
Columbine had six following last year's shootings, while Heritage
will have its first this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Place resource officers in their middle schools. In the past,
the law enforcement officers have only been assigned to the high
schools. The change is a direct result of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Restrict visitor access to one door. This is new for Jefferson
County schools, but Rockdale schools have had such a policy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   How residents in the two communities responded to the shootings
was dictated by the magnitude of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Jefferson County, residents created new programs aimed at
youth, while numerous churches reached out to those needing
spiritual guidance. Students and adults lobbied for stricter gun
controls. In Rockdale, the only visible outreach was through a
handful of churches.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage Principal Lowell Biddy said the reason is simple:
Police in Rockdale were able to wrap up their investigation quickly
and arrest Solomon; and Heritage was the site of summer school, so
it has been continuously in use by students since the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students have already been in it after the shooting,'' Biddy
said. ``It has not caused a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbine students attended classes at a neighboring high
school, where they ended their school year.

<P>
   Despite the differences, students from both schools have one
thing in common: They did not want to give up on their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine student Rusty McPhail, 16, spent his summer at the
Ascot Center, a youth hangout created in answer to the shootings.
He said going back to Columbine is important because if he turns
his back on the school, the shooters _ Harris and Klebold _ win.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lynch, who is a junior at Heritage this year, said the
response to the shootings there actually bought her friends closer
together. They looked forward to going back to school and think
that it will be safer than ever, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while she admitted that the shooting has made her feel more
vulnerable, she said she refuses to be a hostage to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A day does not pass that I don't think someone is waiting
behind a corner to jump out at me, holding a gun,'' she said. ``But
I must not let that run my life, and I refuse to let him (Solomon)
run my life!''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, she would like to reach out to Solomon, who a
Rockdale juvenile court judge ruled last Wednesday should be tried
as an adult. She said she wants to understand him better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not hold a grudge against him, and I would like to talk
to him, actually,'' she said. ``I would like to see how he is
doing.''

 &HT;    The Atlanta-China connection:
 &HT;    Weapons dealer used Southern city
 &HT;    as ``beachhead'' to spread influence
 &HT;    WITH SIDEBAR
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The exploits of shadowy Chinese arms dealer Wang Jun
have captured national headlines and the attention of federal
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But one aspect of this intriguing story has been largely
overlooked in the recent scrutiny _ Wang Jun's Atlanta connection.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's Atlanta operations were, in his own words, his
``beachhead'' in America.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say Wang, son of a former Chinese vice
president, formed at least a half-dozen companies in the Atlanta
area with just 20 employees. Still, investigators say some of these
companies bought, sold and in at least one case smuggled
sophisticated weapons, funneled money to suspicious offshore bank
accounts, and bought up land across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to making money, playing golf and reveling in
the Atlanta lifestyle on his visits to Georgia, Wang came to
America, investigators suspect, to bring home U.S. technology and
military secrets to his employers _ the Chinese armed services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt that Wang Jun was in this country to
acquire sensitive technology,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox
(R-Calif.), who headed a Congressional investigation into Chinese
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear what role Wang's Atlanta companies played in
that mission, federal investigators have unearthed evidence of
questionable business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Wang's operations in Atlanta, which began in the
spring of 1987 and continued for nine years, has been pieced
together from court and land records, financial documents from
Wang's companies obtained by The Atlanta-Journal Constitution, and
interviews with top law enforcement officials and others familiar
with Wang's operations.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story with many improbable twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   Thorny legal problems generated by Wang's Atlanta activities,
for example, involved two of the city's most prestigious law firms
in escapades that one lawyer compared to a John Grisham novel.
</P>
<P>
   In another plot line, a former Chinese naval intelligence
officer who ran Wang's Atlanta operations was indicted in 1996 for
his alleged role in smuggling 2,000 AK-47s into this country. The
guns, netted in a sting by federal agents posing as Florida
mobsters, were the single largest cache of automatic weapons ever
seized by U.S. authorities. The Wang associate, Robert Ma, remains
a fugitive and is believed to be in China. Federal investigators
suspect he had been tipped off that the indictments were coming.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the treasure chest of arms sale profits stemming
from Wang's Atlanta operations that mysteriously ended up in the
Cayman Islands, Bermuda and the British West Indies, according to
internal company records, court documents and interviews with
former employees.
</P>
<P>
   But most unsettling for federal investigators are signs that
Wang may have been involved in espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is the chairman of the Poly Group, a Beijing-based arms
trading company which is part of the People's Liberation Army. The
army makes money by selling weapons _ from assault rifles to
ballistic missiles _ around the world. Poly occupies a glittering
two-tower high-rise on almost a full block near Beijing's Forbidden
City. It's board members include the sons and daughters of
prominent Communist Party members. As the head of Poly, Wang
reports directly to the so-called Staff Department of PLA, which
oversees China's military intelligence. Wang also runs China
International Trust &AMP; Investment Corp., a powerful company with
interests in industry, finance and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators believe that both companies took part in a
plan to station workers at companies throughout the United States
to gather sensitive information that would be helpful to the
military. Cox and other federal investigators estimate there are as
many as 3,000 such ``front'' companies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report states that some of the companies are set up to
acquire sensitive technology under the guise of a subsidiary of a
Chinese company; others are set up to provide cover to government
agents who enter the United States to gather technology and
military data; still other companies are set up to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   F. Michael Maloof, chief of technology security operations at
the Defense Department's U.S. Threat Reduction Agency, has been
investigating Wang's activities for more than 18 months. He has no
doubt about what Wang has been up to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wang Jun's operations are part of an overall Chinese system
that is integrated to target and acquire militarily critical
technologies,'' Maloof said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloof said the technology China has acquired has made it
possible to modernize its navy, improve its fleet of long-range
cruise missiles and build better long-range fighters and bomber
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But the full impact of Chinese technology and military
acquisitions won't be felt until more advanced weapons are
designed, Maloof said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have basically auctioned off the security of our
children,'' said Maloof. ``We won't realize for the next ten years
the full impact of these technology acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Wang in China were unsuccessful. Congressional
committees have requested his appearance to answer campaign
fundraising and espionage charges for the last two years. They have
little hope he will appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is bad news,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), who sits
on the House panel investigating campaign fund-raising misdeeds.
``The fact that he has been able to operate with impunity is very
disturbing. This fellow has ties that go directly to the Communist
Party in Beijing. He is right there, smack in the middle of the
campaign finance scandal and (involved with) U.S. corporations that
are in the middle of the spy scandal. Apparently this comes as a
surprise to our law enforcement officials and that's a problem.
It's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Connection
</P>
<P>
   Wang's enterprises eventually stretched across the United
States, but they began in Atlanta in 1987 as PTK International
Inc., a joint venture with a suburban Atlanta company, Keng
Firearms Specialty Inc. Two other companies controlled completely
by Wang _ Dynasty Holding Co. and Poly USA, Inc. _ soon followed.
Four additional companies were incorporated in Atlanta, but never
conducted any kind of business. Most of the companies listed the
same officers and the same address.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's companies in Atlanta devoted themselves mostly to
importing guns from China and reselling them to dozens of American
distributors. But Dynasty bought a lot of commercial property
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Claude Collins, an Atlanta businessman who was the chief
financial officer at Dynasty and active in several of the
companies, says Wang began to cut back on his Atlanta operations
after President Clinton's 1994 ban on importingassault guns and
ammunition from China. All of the companies were dissolved by the
summer of 1996 soon after Ma's gun smuggling indictment, according
to Collins, who remains on good terms with his former Chinese
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was involved from the beginning with Wang's enterprises
in Atlanta, helping set up the joint venture between Wang and the
Keng family.
</P>
<P>
   David Keng and his family immigrated to the Atlanta area from
Taiwan in 1973. They initially settled in Riverdale, just south of
Hartsfield International Airport. Keng, his wife and two sons
worked at a Chinese restaurant and jewelry import business that he
shared with his brother, always struggling to make ends meet. But
David Keng always kept looking for a way to merge his love for gun
collecting with business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he got the chance: He would sell Chinese guns to
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   After several years of discussions, Poly and Keng signed an
agreement in Beijing in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Poly would export AK-47 assault rifles and SKS semi-automatic
rifles from China to Keng Firearms, which would sell the guns to
PTK, the joint venture between Wang's Poly and Keng in Atlanta. PTK
then would sell to American distributors.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement was legal until the 1994 ban on importing of
assault weapons (Ma's indictment on smuggling charges came two
years later).
</P>
<P>
   Poly's agreement with Keng was marked by a celebration at an
exclusive Japanese restaurant in Beijing. Some sons and daughters
of the so-called Taizi _ the hardline Communist revolutionaries
_were there, including the daughter of the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping. These children of Chinese leaders _ often called
``princelings'' _ are now in positions of power themselves, and are
using it to make capitalistic fortunes. As they dined and
celebrated their good fortune, Wang stood and raised his glass,
allowing a wide smile to cross his face. His new Atlanta venture
would be the company's ``beachhead'' in America, he told the
gathered guests. It would be just the beginning of a vast fortune
for them all to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyers threatened in Beijing
</P>
<P>
   The first years of business brought great rewards for both Wang
and the Keng family. By 1992, five years after its incorporation,
Poly had sold a total of $200 million worth of assault rifles to
various U.S. wholesalers and distributors. Company records show
that U.S. dealers paid PTK $18.4 million for guns in 1989. PTK
reported profits of $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the bloody Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 and the
resulting U.S. crackdown on trade with China, the relationship
between Poly and the Keng family soured and a legal battle ensued
over money.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta federal court, the Kengs and Poly tangled over
shipments and legal issues over theirpartnership. The court fight
soon turned nasty, involving two of the city's biggest law firms _
Long, Aldridge &AMP; Norman representing Poly and Alston &AMP; Bird
representing the Keng family. Court records show a flurry of
unusual legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I practice law until I am 80 years old, I will never have a
case like this again,'' attorney Johnny Stephenson of Alston &AMP; Bird
said in an interview from his office overlooking Piedmont Park at
One Atlantic Center. ``If someone had told me this was the truth, I
wouldn't believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   After much haggling, Stephenson and his partner, Peter Bassett,
went to Beijing in the spring of 1991 to depose Ma and a handful of
others. On the third day of their visit, the lawyers said they were
accosted by three men at the top of the escalator at the China
World Hotel. They warned: ``We know who you are, where you are and
what you are doing. Watch your step. Beijing is a small place.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson and Bassett were so rattled that they immediately
returned to their hotel room and called the U.S. embassy. No
answer.
</P>
<P>
   So, they left and walked over to the lounge of the Shangri-La
Hotel, where they sat in a stunned daze for hours, thinking about
what to do next. The men who had accosted them knew too much _
their names and businesses _ to be mere street thugs. Was their
hotel room bugged by the government? Should they try to leave on
the next flight? What would happen if they got thrown in jail in
China?
</P>
<P>
   As they listened to a Filipino singer belt out American folk
songs, the attorneys said they sunk deeper into their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like Alice going down the hole, it was so surreal,''
Stephenson said. ``There we were in Beijing, worried about our
lives, out of touch with the American embassy, listening to a woman
who couldn't speak English sing like Judy Collins.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson and Bassett say their suspicions about the incident
were only heightened a year later when he learned from the American
Embassy in Beijing that a high-ranking Chinese official had _ the
day before their arrival in China _ sent a letter to the embassy,
objecting to their taking depositions of potential witnesses. The
Chinese official noted that it was in violation of their tourist
visas, which the Atlanta lawyers saw both as a warning and a way to
pave the way for their possible arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Bassett said. They felt cornered by Wang and
his friends because they were traveling on a visa that Poly had
strongly suggested they use, rather than a business visa that would
give them permission to do legal work in China.
</P>
<P>
   When Stephenson and Bassett returned to the United States they
decided they had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Stephenson told Atlanta federal Judge Charles
Moye in court documents that ``individuals have been threatened
with punishment in the event (Poly) learns of their involvement.''
He said it would be impossible to call future witnesses, some of
them employees of Wang, because he feared that the Chinese
government might ``subject individuals in China to the danger of
retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Poly attorneys responded by alleging that the Keng family had
threatened to kill Ma.
</P>
<P>
   Collins still wonders how a basic civil dispute spun so far out
of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a simple collection suit,'' said Collins, defending
Poly. ``We wanted what was owed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This case was no more a 'simple collection suit' than the
bombing of Pearl Harbor was a little diplomatic misunderstanding,''
Stephenson retorted. J. Allen Maines, the former Long &AMP; Aldridge
attorney representing Poly, declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson said Poly abruptly dropped its suit after he started
tracing millions of dollars of Dynasty's money to a ``mail drop''
in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that money, Stephenson alleged, accumulated in off-shore
accounts through an illegal ``dual billing'' practice to hide gun
sale profits from China's Ministery of Foreign Trade and Economic
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were shipping money from Dynasty to an insurance company
in the Cayman Islands, ostensibly for insurance premiums,''
Stephenson said. ``We are talking about a mail slot in a bank. ...
They were expensing these premiums for tax purposes, so they didn't
show their full income on their business activities here.''
</P>
<P>
   This practice made it possible, the suit alleges, for Ma and his
comrades to live ``extravagant'' lifestyles in America and to
invest in other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson compared his investigation of those off-shore
accounts to a John Grisham thriller. ``I'm reading 'The Firm,'
thinking, `That's nothing; come be me for six months.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean this guy (in the book) isn't being threatened by a
Communist country. He's down in the Cayman Islands on some little
tax scam. I'm down there tracing money from the Chinese government
and having my life threatened. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, too, found the Cayman Islands operation suspicious.
``That was as flaky as a homemade biscuit,'' he said. ``We were
paying a million-dollar premium for a million-dollar policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, chief financial officer of Dynasty, said he was left in
the dark about the insurance deal. It was only after it was
operating that he began to ask questions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Poly lawsuit was abruptly dropped, the Keng family
stayed in the import business. They now sell accessories and parts
for rifles and pistols from China. They also import small arms and
ammunition from France and Austria. But times are tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much smaller operation now,'' said Da Keng, the eldest
son. ``We've had to fight to stay in business, to be smarter. Ten
years ago it was very easy money. Now it's a real dog fight.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, another Chinese government-run firm, China North
Industries Shenzhen Corp. is suing Keng for a breach of contract,
charging that the Kengs owe the company $723,000 _ a charge that
the Kengs adamantly deny.
</P>
<P>
   White House connections
</P>
<P>
   Wang first caught the eye of congressional investigators when he
visited the White House on Feb. 6, 1996, with Charlie Trie, a
former restaurateur and friend of the Clintons from Arkansas. Trie
figured prominently in the 1997 campaign fund-raising
investigation, having raised $640,000 in disputed donations for a
special fund started to help the president with his spiraling legal
expenses. Those funds were returned amid controversy over whether
they originated from foreign or otherwise improper sources. Trie
later pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   When news of Wang's trip to the White House first surfaced,
President Clinton went out of his way to say that it was ``clearly
inappropriate'' for a Chinese arms dealer to appear at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Clinton aides said they had no prior knowledge of
Wang's gun dealing background, nor did they know of his close ties
to the Chinese army.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins said he gave top White House aides detailed
information about Wang at a private White House luncheon in early
May 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was asked to speak to a small gathering of business
leaders at the White House luncheon after escorting Deng Xiaoping's
son, Deng Zhifang, to some of America's premier corporate centers.
</P>
<P>
   At the gathering, Collins said, were former White House Counsel
Thomas ``Mack'' McLarty and former senior aide Mark Middleton, who
later became a target of the campaign fund-raising probe.
</P>
<P>
   McLarty did not return phone calls about the lunch. Robert
Luskin, an attorney representing Middleton, said his client had
``absolutely no recollection of the lunch,'' adding that that is
not unusual given the hundreds of people that Middleton met with in
his White House post.
</P>
<P>
   After the lunch, Collins said, Middleton called for more details
about Wang. Collins said he told Middleton that Wang is the son of
former Chinese Vice President Wang Zhen and that his companies were
connected with the Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grilled me and grilled me ... It's hard to believe that
they didn't know who he was,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   If White House aides didn't know then who Wang was, they soon
would learn.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's visit drew sharp criticism from lawmakers, including some
Democrats, who said it was an example of the lengths the White
House would go to raise a campaign dollar.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House had simply reviewed Poly's annual report, it
would have found that Poly's annual report lists its defense system
sales.
</P>
<P>
   The English version of a recent Poly annual report notes that
the company is in the business of ``import and export of defence
equipment in the areas of aviation, transportation and
communication of civilian products.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reports that Wang was involved in arms dealing and
espionage, Collins sighed deeply and said, the only thing he found
suspicious in his seven years working for Wang was the off-shore
bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything (Wang's companies) did was legal, right down to the
bone,'' Collins said. ``We all knew what was fish and what was
fowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Espionage and arms dealing?
</P>
<P>
   However, Wang used Poly to arm Third World countries and funnel
American military technology back to China, internal company
records and interviews show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wang's Poly Group is Communist China's worst worldwide
proliferator of deadly weapons, having brokered the sale of cruise
missiles to Iran and nuclear weapons to Pakistan,'' Cox explained.
Congressional investigators believe that Poly also sold M-9
nuclear-capable missile technology to Syria and arms to both sides
of the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s. Burma was another customer.
</P>
<P>
   And evidence of espionage continues to grow. In a recently
unclassified document, Maloof, the Defense Department official
investigating Wang, wrote, ``cumulative exports of selected
sophisticated U.S. technology to China ... has provided the Chinese
military with a nationwide integrated command, control,
communications, computers and intelligence encrypted network that
will serve it well into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say it is not clear whether Wang's Atlanta-based
companies were involved in espionage, but there were several
disturbing incidents in which equipment that could have had a
military purpose was secretly sent back to China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Poly asked PTK officials to place a shipment of
high-tech computer equipment in brown paper and ship it in unmarked
wooden crates back to China. Company documents indicate that
company officials were asked to draft documents that would conceal
the equipment, making it appear that it was actually radio
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Memos turned over to federal investigators show that Poly
officials in Beijing wrote memos to Poly employees in Atlanta
instructing them in Chinese to ship $19 million worth of militarily
sensitive high tech radar equipment through a state-owned shipping
line.
</P>
<P>
   It's over
</P>
<P>
   After the lawsuits were dropped and things settled down in
Atlanta, Stephenson went to the Atlanta offices of Wang's
operations in 1994 on behalf of the Kengs to review documents
pertaining to a federal tax issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ma and Collins were on hand to supervise Stephenson as he went
through the documents. After several hours, Ma asked Stephenson,
``The lawsuits are all over, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Stephenson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I have a gift for you,'' said Ma, leaving the room.
</P>
<P>
   Ma returned with a red leather-bound book with its title in gold
embossed lettering: ``What You Should Know About the American Legal
System.''
</P>
<P>
   The author? Ma Bao Ping _ Robert Ma's Chinese name.
</P>
<P>
   When Stephenson opened the book he found 300 blank pages and
Ma's autograph _ a sarcastic dig at the U.S. legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson still keeps the book on his shelf at Alston &AMP; Bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another bizarre episode in this fantastical tale,'' he said.

 &HT;    Black farmers doubt USDA probe to end aid bias
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal authorities are investigating whether black
farmers in two Georgia counties were denied disaster reliefbecause
of their race.
</P>
<P>
   But black farmers who recently settled a $2 billion
discrimination suit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture
contend the investigation is too narrowly focused and should be
broadened to examine whether the withholding of disaster aid is a
prevalent problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is typical of the USDA,'' said J.L. Chestnut, a civil
rights lawyer in Selma, Ala., who represented the farmers in the
discrimination case. ``They're looking in selected counties when
the problem is universal. I doubt they can find a county where
blacks live and there is not discrimination in the awarding of
disaster aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture officials declined to identify the counties where
their investigation is focused. Laura Trivers, a USDA spokeswoman,
would say only that the department's civil rights office and
inspector general are examining allegations about disaster relief
practices in two Farm Service Agency county offices in Georgia and
three in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take such complaints very seriously, and we will
investigate them thoroughly,'' Trivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the agency's state office in Athens did not
respond to requests for an interview. The state Agriculture
Department said it has no role in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers say the problem lies in the USDA system for
distributing aid. In each county, an advisory committee of farmers
_ typically wealthy and white, black farmers claim _ decides how to
disburse a lump sum of money allocated to its county.
</P>
<P>
   After weather-related disasters such as droughts or floods, the
committees typically settle claims by white farmers first, said
Melvin Bishop, president of the Georgia chapter of the Black
Farmers and Agriculturalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to black farmers, they aren't contacted until
the money has already run out,'' said Bishop, who raises beef
cattle in Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Adams, a beef and poultry farmer in Greene County, said
black farmers suffer from a cycle of racism. The USDA committees
justify giving less disaster relief to black farmers because they
generally have smaller farms, Adams said. But that's the case, he
said, only because black farmers often have trouble getting loans
to expand. Then when disasters hit, he said, they don't get enough
aid to resume their previous level of farming, which causes them to
qualify for even less assistance the next time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only get the crumbs,'' Adams said. ``We don't get the
benefits we're due.''
</P>
<P>
   The USDA admitted to discrimination in disaster relief when it
settled the black farmers' class-action lawsuit last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Under that settlement, the department will pay as much as $2
billion to about 20,000 black farmers, each of whom will receive
$50,000, plus $12,500 to pay taxes. In addition, their debts to the
USDA will be written off.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement doesn't prevent the USDA from continuing
discriminatory practices, said Gary Grant, national president of
the North Carolina-based black famers association.

   ``One of the biggest complaints we have is no one has been
terminated for the actions they've taken,'' Grant said. ``So why
should the folk be changing now? ... The department has admitted
it's guilty, but has not done one thing to rectify it.

   ``What have we got here?'' he said. ``A bittersweet victory that
yields nothing.''

 &HT;    SIDEBAR TO ATLANTA-CHINA CONECTION
 &HT;    In Atlanta, Collins was `go-to' man for Wang
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Claude Collins sinks into a plush chair at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in downtown Atlanta, the light reflects off of
his solid gold wristwatch with Chairman Mao etched on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``A gift from my Chinese friends,'' Collins says with a touch of
pride. ``There are only 1,000 like this in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   When Collins visits Beijing, his tall frame and flowing gray
hair are so well known that he's greeted like a dignitary in the
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins' friends in Beijing extend far beyond grocery
shoppers. They go straight to the top of the Chinese Communist
Party's ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   When the son of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping wanted a
tour of America's premiere financial houses, it was Claude Calvin
Collins of Atlanta who escorted him.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, 61, once a workaday computer consultant, says he ended
up becoming one of the Chinese government's ``go-to'' people in
America through Wang Jun, a well-connected member of the sons and
daughters of Communist revolutionaries who now run the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, the son of former hardline Vice PresidWT Wang Zhen, is a
power in China, running both the country's largest investment
conglomerate and the largest weapons trading company owned by the
Chinese military.
</P>
<P>
   Even Collins found the experience a bit heady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times in China, I'd find myself in high-level meetings
pinching myself, saying: 'How did I get here? Why isn't George
Shultz or Alexander Haig here? Why me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Collins had lived in Atlanta since 1969, when a credit card
processing company he started in Texas was acquired by National
Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Collins went off on his own, working for Mid-Atlantic
Fuel, a coal brokerage company based in South Carolina. After that,
he got a taste for international work as the U.S. representative
for Eckman Co. in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Collins started doing business with Wang through the owners of
Keng Speciality Firearms Inc., an Atlanta gun trading company that
asked Collins to help set up a joint enterprise with Wang. That
introduction made it possible for Collins, who never graduated from
college, to enter the high-stakes world of international trade.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he started to learn about China after meeting Wang
and his associates: ``Up until that point, I had not been that
interested. But I realized that this would permit me to see what
was going on in China economically from a box seat.''
</P>
<P>
   When Wang decided to open other companies in Atlanta, Collins
helped set up and run them. When other Chinese entrepreneurs wanted
to do business in America, they called Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Collins was doing everything from driving Wang and
his Atlanta-based Beijing employees around to helping them buy a
three-story stucco town house in Buckhead to setting up their
computer system at their swank East Paces Ferry Road offices. As
they trusted Collins more, he was given the responsibility of
overseeing export licenses and trade of high-tech avionics
equipment to Wang's companies in China.
</P>
<P>
   And winning their trust was not easy. Robert Ma, who ran most of
Wang's operations in Atlanta, was said by American colleagues to
have such a distrustful nature that he would keep a hair in his
diary to monitor whether anyone was reading it behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first came over, they couldn't find the barber
shop,'' Collins said. ``It was an incredible experience to have
gotten to know them and their customs. We are so ignorant in
America about the way they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Atlanta businesses are long shuttered, Collins
still carries a Samsonite travel briefcase with a sticker from the
Beijing Hilton Hotel emblazoned across the front. ``My home away
from home,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Collins estimates that he has taken 20 trips to China over the
last decade. The connections have paid off. After Wang closed his
companies, Collins says he received a lucrative contract to install
e-mail in the People's Hall in Beijing, among other contracts.

 &HT;    Dead in the road
 &HT;    North Carolina leads South
 &HT;    in lying-in-the-road fatalities
 &HT;    WITH ILLUSTRATION
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Roughly once a month in North Carolina,
usually after a night of drinking, somebody lies down in the road
and is run over and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Mention the obscure statistic, and people often laugh. But it's
an alarming problem in North Carolina _ the only Southern state
aside from South Carolina to track it _ because highway safety
officials aren't sure how to prevent these deaths.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easily solved by traditional precautions, such as
lowering the speed limit or installing a traffic signal at a
congested crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot put up a sign saying, `Do not lie in the road,'
because you do not know where people are going to lie down in the
road,'' said Eric Rodgman, senior database analyst for the UNC
Highway Safety Research Center, part of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. ``People driving at night do not expect to
find people lying there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's lying-in-the-road death toll in North Carolina
reached 21, the highest tally since 40 killed in 1972, according to
the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. That accounted for
slightly more than one in 10 of the state's 199 pedestrian
fatalities in 1998. Another 16 were injured.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, such deaths in North Carolina have averaged 13
a year, a steady number representing a problem that officials blame
partly on alcoholism among the poor, homeless and mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The victims are typically men who are intoxicated. Most often,
they die in the hours just before or after midnight. Most of the
accidents occur during the summer months, often on rural roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lying-in-the-road scenario almost invariably involves
people who are passed out or asleep,'' said Lawrence Harris, a
retired North Carolina medical examiner and a pathology professor
at East Carolina State University in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he co-wrote ``While Lying in the Road _ The Prone
Pedestrian,'' a report that documented 136 such North Carolina
fatalities over five years. Since few other states keep separate
statistics on the phenomenon, North Carolina was saddled with the
reputation of leading the nation in the category.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1986 editorial titled ``Liquored Up, Smashed Flat,'' the
Star-News in Wilmington concluded that it is ``true and painfully
obvious that not all of the South will rise again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, it's grown more difficult to determine how
widespread the problem is in the South. Police crash reports in
Georgia and Tennessee, for instance, no longer single out
lying-in-the-road deaths as a separate category of pedestrian
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, agencies that monitor traffic fatalities, such as
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National
Highway Safety Administration, do not keep separate statistics on
lying-in-the-road deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question has always been how many of these are suicides?''
said Bill Shanks, statistician for the Alabama Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   While the Alabama agency doesn't officially track such deaths,
Shanks scans the police crash reports noting whether officers
describe fatalities as lying in the road. He found three such cases
last year among the state's 79 pedestrian fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, the Department of Motor Vehicles tracks accidents
involving people ``standing or lying in the road.'' That number
totaled 156 in 1997, the latest figures. But the agency does not
separate fatalities from injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in South Carolina, one person died lying in the road,
while six died sitting in the road. Those deaths accounted for 6.3
percent of the state's 111 pedestrian fatalitites.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the victims die after staggering drunk into the road.
Last August, a 24-year-old Charlotte man who was intoxicated fell
from the back of a pickup truck. Another vehicle struck and killed
him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the parents of an 18-year-old Pennsylvanian said he
died while imitating a scene from the movie ``The Program.'' It
showed several drunken college football players lying in a road to
prove their toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing that comes back to us,'' said Sgt. Jeff
Winstead of the North Carolina Highway Patrol. ``These are people,
not numbers.''

 &HT;    Family cites racism in death of schoolteacher, boyfriend

<P>
   SEAGROVE, N.C. _ Up ahead on the dark highway, the
tractor-trailer swerved sharply. Its taillights flashed red, and
Richard Clark slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling home from a vacation in Myrtle Beach, S.C., the
44-year-old Pennsylvania businessman figured the 18-wheeler had hit
a deer darting across the road. The last thing Clark wanted to do
was spatter his 1997 Holiday Rambler motor home with road kill.
</P>
<P>
   Then, out of his left window, he glimpsed a tennis shoe on the
pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Clark turned on his CB radio, as passing vehicles rumbled over
the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Truck driver Levy Giles shouted, ``I hit something,'' and began
pulling over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it a deer?'' Clark asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I believe it was a person.''
</P>
<P>
   An unresolved tragedy
</P>
<P>
   Two people died on the pavement of U.S. 220 that night, Sept.
18, 1998. North Carolina's Department of Motor Vehicles classified
them as ``killed while lying in the roadway,'' a peculiar but
surprisingly common fatality on North Carolina's highways.
</P>
<P>
   The statistic bolsters unflattering stereotypes that linger from
the South's legacy of rural poverty. Generally speaking, somebody
gets drunk late at night, stretches out on the warm blacktop, and
gets run over.
</P>
<P>
   But the deaths of longtime sweethearts Tina Armstrong and Deon
Ledbetter defy such circumstances. The mystery of how they wound up
on the four-lane highway that slices across piedmont North
Carolina's hardscrabble peach belt has sparked a controversy
involving allegations of drug abuse, brutality and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year later, the accident illustrates how haunting _ and
divisive _ an unresolved tragedy can be.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran police are still baffled. The highway offered them no
clues _ no skid marks, no broken glass. Today a roadside bouquet of
purple and yellow plastic flowers, left by Ledbetter's sister,
Portia, marks the spot where the rain washed away the stains.
</P>
<P>
   Torn by grief, the victims' families are desperate for details.
The lack of answers has made the survivors impatient and suspicious
that somebody is hiding information about the accident. Armstrong's
family, in particular, has criticized the North Carolina State
Highway Patrol's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   When she closes her eyes, 73-year-old Evelyn Armstrong can see
her daughter. But she can't imagine why she was down in the road
with her fiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midnight hour, I wake up and say, `Tina, where are you?
What happened to you?''' said Armstrong, who learned of her
daughter's death from a knock at the back door. ``I still have so
many unanswered questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The family says it believes racism tainted the inquiry. North
Carolina's Highway Patrol, already under legislative scrutiny for
allegedly targeting black motorists in traffic stops, denied the
charge of racism in investigating the deaths of Armstrong and
Ledbetter, who were black.
</P>
<P>
   The mysterious circumstances have led to speculation in this
rural county where the couple, both 29, had dated since their
teens. They were headed to Greensboro to see a movie and to visit
Ledbetter's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was a popular fourth-grade teacher at Candor
Elementary School. The petite woman with shoulder-length brown hair
lived with her parents. Her soft-spoken mother still called h(er
``Baby'' because she was the youngest of her six children.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's smiling school portraits are scattered throughout
her family's modest brick house in the Dry Creek community, outside
Candor.
</P>
<P>
   Ledbetter seemed headed down a different road. A part-time
construction worker, he was well known to local police. Between
1989 and two months before his death, he faced more than 60 charges
in Montgomery County, including assaulting police officers and
resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's relatives said Ledbetter was well behaved around
them. The last time Evelyn Armstrong saw him at her home, just
hours before he died, Ledbetter asked for a piece of chicken on the
way out the door. They hugged before he left.
</P>
<P>
   But Ledbetter also used cocaine shortly before he died. A state
medical examiner's report disclosed ``potentially lethal'' levels
of the drug in his body. Testing found no evidence of drugs in
Armstrong's body.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous theories _ a domestic fight, revenge by drug dealers, a
police setup _ have surfaced. None has been proved.
</P>
<P>
   Under the influence of cocaine, Ledbetter could have suffered a
``psychotic episode,'' which could have made him act irrationally
and disregard his own safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just a theory,'' said state toxicologist Ruth
Winecker, who echoes the most common question: ``What in the world
were they doing there?''
</P>
<P>
   Witness told of fight
</P>
<P>
   It seems nobody saw Armstrong and Ledbetter get out of her
pearl-white 1992 Lexus sedan on U.S. 220, a heavily traveled
summertime route to the Carolina beaches. That September night,
traffic was relatively light.
</P>
<P>
   First Sgt. J.R. Williams, a 25-year patrol veteran who
supervised the investigation, said investigators talked to a woman
who said she was driving behind Armstrong's car when it pulled on
to the right-hand shoulder. The woman then went on to an exit ramp
to stop at Hardee's. In the five minutes it took her to get back on
the highway, the accident had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, a truck driver talking on the CB radio said
he had seen a couple chasing a dog across the grassy highway
median.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Asheboro, a grocery store clerk told an off-duty
highway patrol officer she overheard a man saying he had seen two
people fighting in the highway. Investigators told the clerk to
keep an eye out for the tipster, but that lead never panned out.
</P>
<P>
   Public speculation by state troopers that Armstrong and
Ledbetter might have been fighting has enraged Armstrong's family.
They accuse investigators of seizing upon Ledbetter's criminal
record prematurely as a reason to suspect he was fighting with
Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think people know they are practicing racism,'' said
51-year-old Gloria Lewis, Armstrong's sister. ``It is just a way of
doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis discounted one theory that Armstrong stopped her car
because she wanted to get away from Ledbetter. Perhaps angry that
she was trying to break up with him, Ledbetter might have chased
her into the highway and knocked her down.
</P>
<P>
   Had the couple been about to end their relationship, said Lewis,
``I do not think Tina would have been gracious enough to drive him
to Greensboro.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, investigators found a pair of earrings _ one on the
driver's side floorboard and the other on the seat _ in the car,
which Armstrong kept meticulously clean. Police suggested the
earrings as possible evidence that Ledbetter had hit Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and other family members said she may have simply taken
them off. Over the next few days, Lewis said investigators provided
her family with conflicting information, such as whether the truck
driven by Levy Giles was the first to hit the couple. She also
complained that the state patrol has refused to return her sister's
clothing. The patrol said the garments are evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that could possibly be done in this investigation
was done,'' said Williams. ``Race was not a factor. I can only
guess that they are having trouble bringing closure to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two black troopers, he noted, were among the first to arrive on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who heads the county's council on aging, complained in a
letter to North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley about ``a
possible coverup of facts by investigating officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley's office referred the complaint to the state Highway
Patrol. The agency's now-retired commander, E.W. Horton, replied
last December that supervisors investigated Lewis' complaints, but
that state law prohibited the agency from divulging whether it took
any ``personnel actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the patrol's Asheboro office, Williams said troopers
invested more time in this case than usual because of the elusive
details. Three officers took the unusual step of traveling to
Chapel Hill seeking details from the medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking information to prove that the wreck wasn't accidental,
Armstrong's family listed the incident on a Web page for unsolved
crimes _ www.unsolvedcrimes.com.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis believes that the massive head injuries that Ledbetter
suffered in the accident could have masked blows from a beating.
The autopsy stated that his right thumbnail had been torn off,
suggesting to Lewis he could have been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are hit by an 18-wheeler, it could do a lot of
things,'' said Sharon Fuqua, a supervisor in the state Office of
the Chief Medical Examiner. ``Neither of them had any kind of
gunshot wounds or knife wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office concluded that both victims
probably died from ``multiple injuries'' after being struck by
numerous vehicles. Fingerprinting of Armstrong's car disclosed no
evidence of foul play, said Williams, the state patrol supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could give the family an answer, tell them what
happened,'' he said. ``The only people who know why they were out
there was them and the good Lord above.''
</P>
<P>
   The car was still running
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's family has cobbled together details leading up to
the accident. Armstrong left home, driving past Candor's peach and
apple orchards and tumble-down fruit stands. She picked up
Ledbetter in nearby Biscoe, and they turned north on U.S. 220 for
the nearly 60-mile drive to Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   After the couple went to a movie, Armstrong planned to drop off
Ledbetter at his sister's home in Greensboro. The next morning, he
was to take a bus to Pittsburgh. That night, Armstrong planned to
return home.
</P>
<P>
   The couple never made it to Greensboro. Twenty-six miles from
Armstrong's house, her car pulled off the highway, parking on the
right-hand shoulder just past the exit ramp to Seagrove.
Investigators believe Armstrong was driving.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow _ and that is a big part of the mystery _ they wound up
outside the car about 20 feet away, down in the left-hand passing
lane.
</P>
<P>
   The car's engine was still running, and the lights were on.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising along at the posted speed of 65 mph, trucker Giles was
climbing a steady hill when he spotted the Lexus pulled on to the
shoulder. He eased into the left-hand passing lane to distance his
truck from the parked car.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Giles saw something down in the road, in the same lane
in which he was driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was right on top of it, it looked like I saw the face
of a person,'' said the longtime driver for Pillowtex, a textile
maker based in Eden, N.C. He now believes that was Ledbetter. ``I
can't say I hit a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Police did not charge Giles in the accident. He said he is not
convinced that he was the first to hit the couple, despite
investigators' conclusion that he was. ``I just prayed to the Lord
that I did not take anybody's life,'' Giles said recently. ``If I
did, I did everything to avoid it. It was an accident.'' A neighbor
of Armstrong's, 21-year-old Damon Green, drove through shortly
after Armstrong and Ledbetter apparently were first hit. He heard a
thump and thought he had hit a dog. Later, he said, ``I think it
was Tina.''
</P>
<P>
   The week afterward, he washed his Chevy Cavalier three times a
day to get rid of the smell of flesh singed by the heat of
tires.``He don't sleep,'' said Green's mother, Edith. ``He don't
stay still.''
</P>
<P>
   `God wanted it like that'
</P>
<P>
   After learning of Armstrong's death after midnight, her
relatives drove to the hospital in Asheboro. They crossed the
northbound lanes of U.S. 220 where the couple had died. Sand spread
by emergency workers hissed against the bottom of their car. At the
hospital, an attendant urged the family not to view Armstrong's
broken body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to find somebody who had seen my baby,'' her
mother said. ``Was she standing up, or was she lying down?''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people attended Armstrong's funeral last
September at the local high school. The casket was closed. She was
buried on the rocky hillside of First Congregational United Church
of Christ, her family's longtime church near her home.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, on a Sunday morning in April, Armstrong's
mother wept for the first time. She took her seat in the choir, as
usual. This morning, she heard preacher Johnny Jones humming
through the closed door of his study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will understand it better by and by/By and by when the
morning comes/When the saints of God are gathered home/we'll tell
the story of how we've overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the small congregation cried along with Evelyn
Armstrong, reassured that someday she'll know what happened. She
also found comfort in an arrangement of white silk roses. Somebody
left them in her carport after her daughter's funeral. They now sit
on the kitchen table. A ribbon on the vase reads, ``God wanted it
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the roses were so beautiful,'' she said. ``I'd like
to know who sent them. There was no message, no name, no card.

   ISRAEL-BARAKSTYLE _ JERUSALEM _ He spent most of his career as a
soldier in secret elite units. Now Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is running Israel like a commando. He has pushed most of the
traditional doves from key roles in government and brought in
colleagues from his army days. They talk of their ``mission'' and
keep plans so hush-hush that even traditional allies are either
baffled or angered. He favors discipline over politics, even to a
nearly authoritarian degree. For example, when Cabinet ministers
engaged in the usual practice of leaking their proposals to the
press before cabinet meetings, Barak sent word that any proposals
leaked to the press would not be brought up in the meetings.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ The end of the world is near, warned
some superstitious Russians, who trusting in the country's mystical
folklore saw a bad omen in the final solar eclipse of this
millennium. Russia survived the cosmic phenomenon; it is coping,
too, with last week's Kremlin phenomenon. President Boris Yeltsin,
and his inner circle of political operatives and business tycoons
produced yet another shock by naming ex-spy Vladimir Putin as
Russia's fifth prime minister in the past 18 months. At work in
Russia isn't some strange alignment of the stars, but gritty,
down-to-earth politics that has slowed progress on key issues with
the United States _ namely arms control and reviving the Russian
economy. The campaign season has begun, with national parliamentary
elections scheduled for December and the vote for president to take
place next summer when Yeltsin's term ends. (Holmes, Cox News

   RUSSIA-CRISIS _ MOSCOW _ How's this for spin? Russian officials
recently delivered the good news that the country's economy will
not expand this year. In a sign of the times, the government issued
the promising forecast that the economy would remain flat in 1999,
compared to earlier estimates that predicted the downward spiral
that commenced last summer would continue. One year into its
deepest economic crisis since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia's
outlook is assessed not so much by what's going right, as by the
horrible things that could have _ but haven't _ gone wrong. Even
last week's abrupt firing of the government by President Boris
Yeltsin barely made a ripple on the economy. (Holmes, Cox News

   MEXICO-MADRAZO _ MEXICO CITY _ Roberto Madrazo has a grin and a
gleam in the eye that reflect a politician who knows he's on top.
Madrazo wants to be the first man democratically elected on Nov. 7
as presidential nominee for Mexico's Revolutionary Institutional
Party. The PRI, which has provided Mexico with its presidents for
70 years, has never had a primary election until this year. And
Mexicans have never seen a bruising attack campaign -- via
television and campaign slogans - like the one Madrazo launched
this month against his closest rival, Francisco Labastida, who is
perceived as the PRI establishment's favorite. As Madrazo, who
recently resigned as governor of Tabasco state and is slightly
ahead or even with Labastida in polls, works his way through
barrios here, he cultivates a ``man of the people'' image, tapping
into deep anger over the economy and other problems. (Ferris, Cox

of federal investigators. But one aspect of this intriguing story
has been largely overlooked in the recent scrutiny _ Wang Jun's
Atlanta connection. Wang's Atlanta operations were, in his own
words, his ``beachhead'' in America. Federal investigators say
Wang, son of a former Chinese vice president, formed at least a
half-dozen companies in the Atlanta area with just 20 employees.
Still, investigators say some of these companies bought, sold and
in at least one case smuggled sophisticated weapons, funneled money
to suspicious offshore bank accounts, and bought up land across the

 &HT;    Children urged to take frequent water breaks
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ To any sports coaches and band directors who
don't believe in frequent water breaks during summer practices, a
health expert has a few words of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' says Dr. Norman Schneiderman of Miami
Valley Hospital. The words ``insane'' and ``dangerous'' came up
during the discussion, too.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids whose activities require outdoor practices this month
are in good health, but Schneiderman says healthy people get
dehydrated, too. ``We do sometimes see these healthy people just
drop, and it can be a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   People who exercise outside in oppressive heat should be
drinking liquids to replace their body fluids ``every 15 to 20
minutes,'' he says. Not only are they sweating away those fluids,
but they also lose fluid every time they exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``So these people need to be constantly drinking, drinking,
drinking,'' he says. ``And the point is, it's hard to practice when
you're doing that. So you probably shouldn't have practice. You
probably should make that practice in the early morning or night.''
</P>
<P>
   It was hot enough during last month's heat wave at 6:30 a.m.,
when Schneiderman went jogging. ``But 3 o'clock in the afternoon?
When it's that hot? That's insane. It's dangerous. You've got to
use some common sense.''

CZECH RUNNER, RECORD INTACT, BACK AS A COACH  
(KO)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANITA VERSCHOTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASLAV, Czech Republic _ In the summer of 1983, in the span of
20 days, Jarmila Kratochvilova of Czechoslovakia lowered the world
record in the 800 meters and the 400 meters and won two gold medals
and one silver at the first world track and field championships in
Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Her extraordinary performances, however, were shrouded in
controversy. Was she really that good, some critics wondered, or
were her amazing times _ 1 minute 53.28 seconds in the 800 and
47.99 in the 400 _ achieved with the help of drugs?
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps the unkindest question of all, was she really a
woman?
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova, then 32, was heavily muscular, with a stocky
frame and a preference for wearing drab warm-up suits. She never
flunked a gender test or a drug test in an era when there was no
out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova was aware of the innuendos swirling around her
then, yet today she prefers to remember those days as the happiest
in her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought that I would like to look like other women,
with more in front and a better-looking backside,'' the 48-year-old
Kratochvilova said recently. ``I have an athletic body. I was not
hurt when I heard those remarks. My body has been good to me; it
has kept me healthy. As for drugs, I never took any. Never.''
</P>
<P>
   She returns to the world championships Aug. 20-29 in Seville,
Spain, this time as a coach of two women on the Czech team. Anyone
who has not seen Kratochvilova in recent years may be startled by
another transformation: gone are about 18 pounds of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   She is now slender, with her hair fashionably cut and her face
tanned and finely chiseled. Her blue eyes light up when she laughs,
a welcome shift from the shy, often surly ``state professional''
who seldom felt comfortable in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   She earned only 8,000 crowns ($235) for an 800-meter mark that
is the oldest surviving among major events in the sport, for men or
women. No woman has run faster than 1:54.44 in 10 years, and no one
has broken 1:55 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an athlete, I never made $15,000 in my life,''
Kratochvilova said in an interview in this medieval town 50 miles
east of Prague, where she commutes eight miles four times a day
from her home village of Golcuv Jenikov for coaching sessions.
``When I hear today that some runners get $15,000 for a 1:58, I
prefer to keep my mouth shut. That's not sports anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova said today's runners spend too much time traveling
the world for several meets a week and too little time on
preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation ran in two big championships per year; the rest
of the time it was all concentrated work,'' she said. ``I would not
have minded to get some money for all the work I did.''
</P>
<P>
   And work she did. Her coach, Miroslav Kvac, said Kratochvilova's
success was the result of intense workouts, not drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Although other Soviet-bloc athletes, most notably in East
Germany, were subjected to sophisticated state-supported sports
programs that included the use of anabolic steroids and other drugs
during training, Kvac said, ``there were never any drugs involved''
in Kratochvilova's regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just supplements such as vitamins, amino acids, protein,''
said the 67-year-old Kvac, who still coaches at the Caslav
Athletics Club.
</P>
<P>
   Initially a sprinter, Kratochvilova went unnoticed until Kvac
shifted her to longer distances. But at 5 feet 7 inches and 152
pounds, she was at first handicapped in the 400 and 800 by her
weight and short body. So Kvac decided to turn her weight into
power, working with hundreds of pounds of weights at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Kvac put her on a program that included take-off jumping and
uphill sprints. She ran 200-meter sprints 20 times, and on a
steeper hill, 60-meter sprints 12 to 16 times. Kratochvilova, who
won a silver medal in the 400 at the 1980 Olympics, still remembers
the punishing 300-meter interval drills _ 20 of them _ at a
47-second pace, which she executed with only a two-minute rest
between each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you cannot imagine what it means to run 300 meters 20
times,'' she said. ``You should try it. Every day of my training
was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladislav Krnac, a Slovak journalist, who followed
Kratochvilova's career, said recently, ``She was willing to torture
herself.'' He added: ``There are very few of those around. She
didn't need orders. She knew, `If I suffer, I can get good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   American athletes and fans seldom saw Kratochvilova compete. In
January 1984, she made the first of four appearances in the United
States, competing in the Sunkist indoor meet at Los Angeles.
American coaches and officials were stunned at her muscularity, and
one prominent chiropractor, Dr. Leroy Perry, said at the time, ``I
think there is something chemically different about her
physiological makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet-led boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics cost
Kratochvilova an almost certain gold medal in the 800. An Achilles'
tendon injury put her out of competition a year later, and she
resumed training for the 1987 world championships in Rome, but
finished fifth in 1:57.71.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova now lives with her parents in a spacious two-story
house that was built six years ago. The parents occupy the lower
floor while she has the second floor to herself. Most of her
trophies are on display in her large living room.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began coaching, she has been paid a salary as a high
school physical education teacher, although she coaches mainly
graduates. She also gives clinics in Prague and Bratislava,
Slovakia. Her group is sponsored by Adidas and some local
industries.
</P>
<P>
   At the world championships, Kratochvilova's star pupil, Ludmila
Formanova will be one of the medal favorites in the 800. At the
world indoor championships last March, the 25-year-old Formanova
outran Maria Mutola en route to a winning time of 1:56.90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there wouldn't be any good results without hard work,''
Formanova said after a recent workout. ``But Jarmila introduced me
to it gradually. There are days when I don't feel like training,
but she teaches me not to give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Hana Benesova, a sprinter, is the other athlete Kratochvilova
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Does Formanova believe she can run a time under 1:54?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, never,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kratochvilova smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't think you could run 1:56 either,'' she said.

 By WILLIAM SERRIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lane Kirkland, who was president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995 _ an extremely troubled time for American workers _ and who
resigned after an unprecedented revolt of union presidents against
him, died Saturday morning at his home in Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as
president of the AFL-CIO and his longtime friend and mentor, led
the U.S. labor movement for nearly 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the
labor organization, the U.S. economy and the workplace experienced
drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership
shrank, and the importance of unions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The growing concern for labor's future in the United States, a
concern that contributed to Kirkland's downfall, contrasted with
its relatively powerful influence abroad, an influence that
Kirkland helped to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was an ardent anti-communist and proud of his
organization's efforts to help the Solidarity movement in bringing
democracy to Poland by any means it could. During the 1970s and
'80s he worked tirelessly to help Solidarity topple the communist
government, surreptitiously channeling organization money and fax
machines to the movement led by Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of solidarity owes a lot to Lane,'' said Henry
Kissinger, a close friend of Kirkland. ``He supported it with funds
and organizers, and he had a big effect on American
policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major criticism of the labor leaders who forced him from
office was that he lacked the same intense interest when it came to
energizing American workers and winning them over to trade
unionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has become more vigorous since Kirkland's
resignation, it remains unclear whether the U.S. labor movement can
ever rebound and recapture its former power. When Kirkland assumed
office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to
unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lane Kirkland _ everyone called him Lane _ was born on
March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers
Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson. A
great-great-grandfather, Thomas Jefferson Withers, signed the
Confederate declaration of secession, and Kirkland often referred
to the Civil War as the ``War of Northern Aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was raised in Newberry, S.C., where he attended public
schools, and where many of his classmates were sons and daughters
of mill workers. ``They'd leave school to work in the mills, and
conditions were rather bad,'' he once told The Washington Post.
``If they'd fire a guy, he'd lose his house; he'd lose everything.
There's no better way to get an education in becoming liberal than
to be exposed to those sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the United States entered World War II, Kirkland
unsuccessfully attempted to join the Canadian military. In 1940, he
became a cadet on the SS Liberator, a merchant marine ship.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
Upon graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American
ships transporting war materiel, sailing to South America, the
beachheads at Sicily and Anzio, and the Solomon Islands in the
Pacific. He always retained his membership in the Masters, Mates,
and Pilots Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kirkland entered the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University, graduating in 1948. He then worked as a
researcher with the American Federation of Labor, becoming a
specialist on pensions and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer, he was on loan in 1948 to the Democratic Party
to write speeches for Alben Barkley, President Harry Truman's
running mate. In 1952 and 1956 he wrote campaign speeches for Adlai
Stevenson, the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He always impressed Meany, who had become president of the AFL
in 1952 and who became president of the AFL-CIO in 1955 when the
labor federation merged with the Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Kirkland became director of research and education for
the International Union of Operating Engineers, but in 1960 he
returned to the AFL-CIO as Meany's executive assistant. He directed
the organization's daily operations and often represented it on
Capitol Hill and at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Always negotiating, he helped resolve jurisdictional disputes
among AFL-CIO unions _ then a major problem in labor _ and helped
to settle the mass-transit strike in New York City in 1966. He
pushed strongly for a fair-employment-practices provision in the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1969, Meany selected Kirkland to be secretary-treasurer,
the No. 2 position in the organization. His opposition to the
policies of the Nixon administration earned him a place on the
president's notorious ``enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland continued his intense interest in international
affairs, maintaining that they were too important to be left to ``a
tight incestuous breed of economists and diplomats.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and
was instrumental in the AFL-CIO's refusal to support Sen. George
McGovern as the Democratic candidate for president in 1972. In 1976
he was a founder of the Committee on the Present Danger, which
demanded larger military budgets to confront the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as Meany's health declined, Kirkland often ran the
labor organization. In September 1979, Meany, then 85, announced
his retirement, and in November Kirkland was named president even
though he remained a remote figure to many union members.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Kirkland set a tone for his
administration, making clear, in his tart manner, the importance
that he placed on getting nonaffiliated unions to join the AFL-CIO.
He said that ``all sinners belong in the church'' and unaffiliated
unions should renounce ``petty personal or pecuniary
considerations, or ancient and tedious grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   He regarded as his biggest achievement persuading the
autoworkers, the mine workers, the longshoremen and warehousemen,
and the teamsters to join or rejoin the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was proud of other changes under his leadership. He
placed the first woman on the labor organization's executive
council and increased the participation of blacks and Hispanics. He
agreed to establish an institute to train new organizers. He also
continued the AFL-CIO's vast foreign operations in Europe, Africa,
South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But huge problems emerged with his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was, as is said in the garment trades, an inside guy,
not an outside guy. He often seemed detached, sometimes arrogant,
incapable of banter or pleasantries. He was given to withering
ripostes, and seemed to detest the media, often refusing interviews
and requests to appear on television, even on Labor Day, saying he
found it demeaning. He said reporters should periodically be
condemned to their morgues to read their clippings, an exercise he
believed would show the shallowness and inaccuracy of much of
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Kirkland spent too much time on international
affairs and not enough time on domestic concerns and that he linked
American labor too frequently with conservative unions in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   They also maintained that in its foreign policy, Kirkland's
organization too often allied itself with American corporations. In
1993, when Congress debated a bill to ban permanent replacement
workers, Kirkland was in Europe. The AFL-CIO spent more money on
international affairs than on organizing, civil rights and workers'
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, fundamental change was occurring in the U.S.
economy. In the 1980s, one industrial plant after another closed,
and whole communities were in distress. The service economy, with
little union organization, expanded. Jobs were lost to new
processes and foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Strike after strike, including one by the air traffic
controllers in 1981, was unsuccessful, and labor suffered numerous
defeats in Congress, including its failure in 1993 to block passage
of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which unions opposed
because of concern over losing jobs in the United States. In 1994,
Republicans won control of the House and the Senate for the first
time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, organized labor failed to expand its
membership and Kirkland's critics in the union movement said he
lacked the vision to reverse the slide.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, in a remarkable event for labor unions, whose
culture stresses loyalty, discipline and the private settlement of
problems, an open revolt broke out. Not since John L. Lewis and
others left the AFL in 1935 to form what became the CIO had such a
raucous, public fight occurred in American unionism.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt was led by Gerald McEntee, president of the municipal
workers; John Sweeney, then president of service employees; Richard
Trumka, then president of the mine workers; and Ronald Carey, then
president of the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee doggedly followed Kirkland to speaking engagements,
engaging him in impromptu debates. Union leaders, acting
anonymously, condemned Kirkland in statements to reporters and he
was assailed at a February 1995 executive council meeting in Bal
Harbour, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney twice asked Kirkland to retire. He knew that President
Clinton had offered Kirkland the ambassadorship to Poland, and he
suggested that the union leader accept it and make way for new
leadership. But Kirkland, always a stubborn man, refused to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In June that year, with presidents of some 20 unions opposing
him, Kirkland said he would resign in August, becoming the only
president in the American Federation of Labor's then 109-year
history to be forced to step down. Thomas Donahue, the AFL-CIO's
secretary-treasurer, and Kirkland's choice to be his successor,
announced his candidacy for the presidency. But in October,
Sweeney, the leader of an opposition slate, defeated Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Kirkland was rarely in the pubic eye. He
never forgot or forgave Sweeney and the other insurrectionists,
saying that they engaged in ``mendacity and falsehood.'' He said
the labor movement had always had difficulties, given its many
enemies, but was built for ``heavy weather.'' And he took pride in
the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, believing
that he and the AFL-CIO had helped bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kirkland was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include Kirkland's wife, the former Irena Neumann, a
German concentration-camp survivor whom he married in 1973, and
five children from his first marriage, to Edith Draper Hollyday,
which ended in divorce in 1972. The children are Blair Hollyday,
Lucy Alexander, Louise Richardson, Edith Hollyday and Katharine
Hollyday, all of whom live in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by five grandchildren and two great
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland had broad interests that included gardening, gin rummy,
wine, jazz, modern art, archaeology and hieroglyphics. He was a
constant smoker, and his trademark, along with a sharp tongue, was
a long, yellowed holder with a burning cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of articles about him over 20 years, only one, in 1984
in The Washington Post, showed him at ease. He was portrayed in his
home, in Washington, playing ``Amazing Grace'' on his Marine Band
harmonica, in the manner of a sailor at sea, with his dachshund
Stanley howling in delighted accompaniment.

RUSSIA WARNS MUSLIM STATES ON DAGESTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Saying it had proof of Islamic financial support to
separatist rebels in Russia's strife-torn Caucasus, Russia issued a
blunt warning Saturday to Muslim states: Hands off Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   But as the fighting widens along Russia's volatile southern rim,
analysts said the focus on foreign scapegoats overlooks Moscow's
broader problem: It has neglected the vast extremes of the world's
largest nation, and Dagestan's uprising may just reflect the
tensions that could tear Russia apart, bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that highlights Moscow's concern over the armed
uprising in its strategically important Caucasus region, Russia's
acting foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, lashed out at unspecified
foreign backers of the militants who have occupied parts of
Dagestan and declared the area an independent Muslin state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that any form of support for the terrorists'
actions will be viewed as rude interference in the internal affairs
of the Russian Federation, with all the logical consequences,''
Ivanov wrote in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, major Western nations and several Muslim states. Ivanov
urged Islamic countries to condemn those who are ``trying to use
Islam to camouflage open banditism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Moscow had hard evidence that the rebels were
receiving aid from abroad, although he offered none of it.
Speculation has been rife that foreign backers were behind the
rebels ever since up to 2,000 well-armed militants crossed into
Dagestan from neighboring Chechnya on Aug. 7. The Russian media has
reported, without substantiation, that reputed Saudi terrorist
Osama bin Laden has spent $25 million training and equipping the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The reports overshadow experts' warnings that Moscow caused its
own problems in the Caucasus by neglecting to solve the volatile
regions' complex ethnic, social and economic problems until it was
too late. They say the federal government is too weak, too poor,
and too distracted with its own internal battles to spend the time
and effort need to in restive regions like Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a foreign problem, this is all a result of the
extreme weakness of the state in Russia,'' said Nikolai Petrov,
political analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center think tank.
``Dagestan is the weakest link, and it has specfic problems _ but
that doesn't take away from the fact that this problem is a result
of a problem that affects the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrov said it was characteristic that as heavy fighting broke
out between federal troops and the rebels last Monday, Moscow was
absorbed with a new political crisis caused when Yeltsin abruptly
toppled his fourth government in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, politicians have begun to sound the alarm. The
apperance of Muslim separatists on its own territory is a nightmare
scenario in a Russia that views radical Islamic expansion as its
main regional security threat.
</P>
<P>
   An uprising in the country's most restive region throws a wrench
in Russia's geopolitical dreams of controlling Caspian oil riches
through pipelines that run through Dagestan and thus maintaining
influence over its former Soviet neighbors in Central Asia and the
Transcaucasus. Oil analyst Euan Craik said Russia ``risks
completely being sidelined'' as oil companies turn to alternatives
to the Dagestan route.
</P>
<P>
   And after Moscow failed in a bloody 1994-1996 campaign to put
down a separatist rebellion in next-door Chechnya, many in Russia
believe the losing control any more territory could shatter the
fragile federal system upon which this vast, nuclear-armed country
is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakup of Russia is knocking at the door,'' remarked
Yegor Stroyev, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament,
the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   The house's members, made up of leaders of Russia's 89
constituent regions and republics, have been calling for tough
action from the Kremlin to halt the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has obliged, launching heavy air and artillery
strikes against the insurgents that military officials say have
begun to take their toll. Interior Minstry spokesman Yevgeny
Ryabtsev said in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital, that the
militants were beginning to show signs of ``panic'' after
sustaining the loss of over 200 men in fighting. But he added that
four Russian paratroopers had been killed and another 13 wounded in
the course of a seven-hour battle on Dagestan's rugged, mountainous
border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who have their own Internet site and supply daily
footage of their operations in Dagestan to Russian television
companies, say Russia has lost dozens of men while only five rebels
have died. On Saturday, the rebels' Web site said their Islamic
council, or Shura, had decided to open a criminal investigation
against acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and other senior
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal commanders say they will be able to drive the rebels
from Dagestan within two weeks. But they say the conflict is been
complicated by the help they say the separatists are getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are dealing with is a massive invasion by bandit
formations,'' Lieutenant General Igor Zubov of Russia's Interior
Minister said last week. ``They have been nourished with the help
of money received from abroad. The sums are roughly known to us _
millions of dollars have been invested in this operation. All the
participants have already received their renumeration. There is a
big number of mercenaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian media have repeated the allegations that the rebels'
Chechen commanders, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, have received
foreign financing for the operation in Dagestan. Respected
newspaper Kommersant Daily reported last week that individual
fighters receive $100 per day and $300 if they are wounded, huge
sums in the impoverished mountain villages of Dagestan and
Chechnya, where unemployment is over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is the spark inflaming this fight, critics say.
Alexander Iskandaryan, director of the Institute of Caucasus
Studies, said Russia may be able to fight off Basayev and Khattab,
but a successful police and military action against the rebels will
not end the malaise that fuels radical Islamic movements in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many young people with no land, no jobs, no
prospects and little education,'' Iskandaryan says. ``People in
South America in such conditions turn to Marxism. People in the
Caucasus turn to radical Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Chechen-led rebels arrived in Dagestan, a
radical Muslim sect known as the Wahhabis had taken control of
entire regions, establishing Muslim Sharia rule and refusing to
obey Russian laws.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab and Baseyev will go away, but the people in these
villages will still be there, ``and central authority will become
weaker and weaker,'' Iskandaryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He says the solution would be for the federal government to help
fund jobs and education, and to support mainstream Islamic groups.
But he acknowledges that the state has no money for such projects.
And he added it was hard to imagine Russia's Orthodox Christian
majority supporting the idea of spending state funds building
Islamic schools.
</P>
<P>
   For many Russians, the Caucasus are a foreign, frightening
place. Opinion polls routinely show that most Russian distrust
their countrymen from the Caucasus. And few Russians can tell the
difference between Chechens and and any of the 40 ethnic groups
that make up Dagestan's population. This was the point the Moscow
newspaper Vremya MN made when it printed a photograph of a bunch of
tough looking, heavily armed men in combat fatigues and dark
glasses. ``These are not Islamic militants,'' read the caption.
``They are Dagestani police.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people from the Caucasus have trouble travelling to
Russia to find work, according to Fiona Hill, director of Harvard
University's Strengthening Democratic Institutions project. They
are often the victims of racist police and residence requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Chechnya. Fighting there ended in 1996, but
Chechnya remains isolated, blockade and unreconstructed _ and
therefore a lawless place where armed gangs hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestanis do not want this, and many did not welcome the
militants' invasion. Mukhu Aliyev, speaker of Dagestan's National
Assembly, said Thursday that anti-Chechen sentiment is far stronger
than anti-Russian moods among the region's two million mainly
Muslim residents.
</P>
<P>
   That could all change if Russia's military starts killing
civilians and destroying towns and villages, the way it did in
Chechnya in 1995 and 1996, where 80,000 people died. So far,
Moscow's forces have avoided that.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia may have already committed a deadly mistake by
sanctioning the arming of Dagestan militias that have volunteered
to help federal troops fight off the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Such handouts of weapons could ignite a larger conflict among
Dagestan's ethnic groups spreading to neighboring regions along
Russia's border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an open road to civil war,'' Major General Nikolai
Bezborodov, a member of the Russian parliament's defense committee,
told The Moscow Times last week. ``It will simply turn the whole
area into a battlefield.''

<P>
   Lane Kirkland, who was president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995 and who resigned after an unprecedented revolt of union
presidents against him, died Saturday morning at his home in
Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as
president of the AFL-CIO and his longtime friend and mentor, led
the U.S. labor movement for nearly 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the
labor organization, the U.S. economy and the workplace experienced
drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership
shrank, and the importance of unions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was an ardent anti-communist and was proud of his
organization's efforts to help the Solidarity movement in bringing
democracy to Poland. But a major criticism of the labor leaders who
forced him from office was that he lacked the same intense interest
when it came to energizing American workers and winning them over
to trade unionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has become more vigorous since Kirkland's
resignation, it remains unclear whether the U.S. labor movement can
ever rebound and recapture its former power. When Kirkland assumed
office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to
unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lane Kirkland _ everyone called him Lane _ was born on
March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers
Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Upon
graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American ships
transporting war materiel. He always retained his membership in the

LATEST CONSTRUCTION BOTTLENECK: SHORTAGE OF SKILLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mass., La., Ill., Conn.)  (mk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Carroll is among the most wanted men in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A lean, red-haired electrician at a building project on 42nd
Street, Carroll and thousands of skilled construction workers like
him are suddenly in short supply as the real estate boom finally
ends what many in the industry describe as a brutal seven-year
depression.
</P>
<P>
   There are no unemployed workers at Carroll's union, the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3, where a
short time ago many electricians were out of work for six months
out of the year. Many are now working what they call ``six 10s,''
or six days a week for 10 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are no men on the bench,'' Carroll said.
``Everybody's at full employment. You can more or less pick your
job. I worked just about every day in July. I've been working for
11 years and I've never been able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything seems to be on a fast track as contractors advertise
for workers and scour the union halls for journeymen. There may be
fewer skyscrapers under construction today than a decade ago, but
there are many residential and commercial buildings being built, as
well as billions of dollars in public works and lots of
rehabilitation work.
</P>
<P>
   These projects range from an $87 million face lift for the
Hilton Hotel on the Avenue of the Americas in midtown to the $237
million renovation of the 1.5 million-square-foot office building
at 2 Broadway in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   And contractors want the work done now, especially in Times
Square, where everything from a new 50-story hotel at Broadway and
47th Street to the World Wrestling Federation's theme restaurant at
43rd Street is rushing to open by year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical contractors estimate that there is an immediate need
for 1,000 to 2,500 electricians in New York today, and that does
not take into account projects starting in the coming year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage is most keenly felt among electricians, but
builders say it is also hard to find enough tin knockers and
sheet-metal workers, who install duct work and put together heating
and air-conditioning systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing serious shortages,'' said Ray McGuire, general
counsel for the Contractors Association of Greater New York, a
trade association. ``There's a shortage of elevator construction
mechanics, steamfitters, sheet-metal workers and electricians. In
the short term, the industry is dealing with it by working a lot of
overtime. But that is not a long-term solution, because we see, if
anything, increased construction activity in the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not help that the situation is no better elsewhere in
the United States. John Kirberg, president of Kirberg Roofing in
St. Louis, cannot find enough experienced roofers to expand his
family business. Some builders are offering bounties for operating
engineers in Boston and electricians in New Orleans, Chicago and
Fairfield, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Construction companies in New York are luring badly needed
project managers and superintendents from rivals with $20,000
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors say the shortage of electricians, who make $34 an
hour, became acute in May and June. ``There is such a strong market
that many employers are really stretching to get the number of
skilled craftsman they need,'' Coletti said. ``The unions are, if
not at 100 percent employment, as close as they've ever been in 20
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for labor has been exacerbated by changes in the
construction industry as well. The corporations and retailers
building new homes now demand accelerated schedules. They want a
job that used to take 20 weeks done in 10 or 12 weeks. New
buildings, as well as renovation projects, also require more
electrical work than a decade ago, with computer cables, fiber
optic lines and redundant power systems.
</P>
<P>
   That means more workers and lots of overtime, which pleases many
workers anxious to pay off mortgages and debts accumulated during
the lean years. But it is also wearing.
</P>
<P>
   At a hotel project in Times Square, Ed Garvey, a veteran
electrician, has been working six eight-hour days a week and
expects his workweek to grow to 60 hours in the final push to open
before New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of 30 guys working for 6 months, they now load up with
100 guys for 2 months,'' Garvey said. ``It's chaos. Chaos means
cash, but it also leads to accidents. They're looking to push the
jobs a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   To combat the shortage and expand the union share of the labor
market, Local 3 and the sheet-metal workers' union have organized
nonunion contractors, while the Mason Tenders union has recruited
immigrant workers. The steamfitters have doubled the size of their
apprenticeship programs, but that is a long-term investment because
it takes three to five years to attain journeyman status.
</P>
<P>
   Local 3 has taken in unemployed electricians from Long Island as
well as 300 temporary college helpers, but it has been reluctant to
open up to travelers, electricians with union cards from
out-of-town locals. But the local may soon have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've requested that the unions bring in travelers, or
out-of-towners, to make up the shortfall,'' said Ken Colao, chief
executive of York Hunter, a construction management company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, builders have had to make do. Milo Riverso, president
of the School Construction Authority, said that sheet metal
delivered to some job sites lies unused for days because there are
not enough skilled workers to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Some contractors have turned down jobs. Only two of eight
electrical contractors responded to requests for bids from one
hotel developer, according to Raymond Quartararo, president of
Quartararo &AMP; Associates, a construction manager on the Ernst &AMP;
Young building and a project at 770 Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cettina, first vice president at Tishman Construction, said
his company had resorted to dividing the electrical contract for
its projects among several subcontractors rather than relying on a
single company.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get into a situation where you have a ton of
overtime at the end of a job,'' he said. ``It wears people out and
you don't have the ability to bring in a fresh crew. They don't
exist.''

REAL ESTATE: A RIVER WALK'S PIECEMEAL BIRTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS HEVESI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The concept is grand: preserve a ribbon of land by the water's
edge, 30 feet wide and 18 miles long, to bind and adorn the
imposing package of developments now rising above the old mud flats
and desolate rail yards of New Jersey's Hudson River shore,
creating for strollers and bikers an unimpeded path from Bayonne to
the George Washington Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hudson River Walkway, dependent on a state requirement
that the developer of each new office tower, condominium complex
and rental building by the river build and maintain his particular
link to the whole, remains a tattered necklace of short strands and
detached pearls.
</P>
<P>
   And with home builders challenging the state requirement in
federal court, the public walkway through their private property
has become a source of contention over the issues of eminent
domain, illegal ``takings'' and _ harking as far back as ancient
Roman law _ the people's right to get to the water.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the complications, said Robert Janiszewski, the
Hudson County executive, is that the walkway is like the proverbial
camel, ``a horse designed by a committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the challenge,'' Janiszewski said, noting that there
are nine towns along the walkway route: ``Multiple jurisdictions,
each with its own planning board; dozens of property owners,
different designs, nonexistent designs; some sites occupied by
governmental agencies, abandoned sites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing in common is the width,'' he said. ``Some
developers with deeper pockets create lovely paths, others, an
asphalt path; others, a dirt path, and some communities are walled
off. So it's incoherent for someone who would want to explore the
walkway from end to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrice Vare, an artist's representative who recently moved from
New York City to the River Club, a rental complex in Edgewater,
N.J., sees past the incoherence. With her dog, Bimini, by her side
on the walkway one recent weekday, Ms. Vare said, ``Isn't it a
great idea to be able to go from here all the way to Hoboken by
bike, walking?''
</P>
<P>
   It is that issue of access that concerns many residents of the
towns along the river: the ability to meander by the water, to
fish, to sit on a bench and do nothing slowly. And with buildings
on the rise, to still see the spikes and spires of the New York
skyline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are residential developments that have fenced the ends
of their property from the walkway,'' said Doug Harmon, president
of the Friends of the Weehawken Waterfront. ``There's limited
perpendicular access, meaning the staff at the gatehouse doesn't
permit you through unless you are the guest of a resident. And
because some of these developments are linked arm in arm, there's
almost no parking for waterfront walkway users.''
</P>
<P>
   A different set of access issues troubles the builders: concerns
about vandalism, and the safety of residents whose homes abut the
walkway, their windows and patios a few feet above the path.
</P>
<P>
   And there is that constitutional question _ already argued and
awaiting a decision in U.S. District Court in Trenton _ contesting
whether government can force developers to build and maintain,
permanently, at their own expense, a public amenity on their own
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This public walkway requirement is an unconstitutional taking
under the Fifth Amendment, which says that property can't be taken
without the payment of just compensation,'' said Duane Desiderio,
litigation counsel for the National Association of Home Builders,
which joined the New Jersey Builders Association in filing the
federal suit. ``The bottom line is that under any argument that has
been asserted, it violates the Constitution to allow people
willy-nilly access to private land.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ann Alexander of the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic
contends that the shoreline belongs to the people, ``and no one can
take away from the builders what they don't own.'' The Rutgers law
clinic is one of seven conservation groups that have voluntarily
joined the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection as
defendants in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The friction of public-private proximity was clear one recent
sultry Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On a paved-over pier that is part of the walkway, fledgling
roller skaters strode and stumbled; a fisherman dropped his line
and waited.
</P>
<P>
   On the adjacent lot, behind a fence, a backhoe stood still, its
bucket dug into a hillock for a long weekend in mid-bite. And the
gantry of a construction crane, tilted toward the top-floor girders
of a building on the rise, also awaited the start of another work
week.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north on River Road _ the sometimes narrow route that
winds below the cliffs of the Palisades parallel to the walkway _
there were other indications of things to come. A billboard read:
``Half Moon Harbour, 176 Luxury Apartments, Coming Soon. Phase
One.'' In West New York, N.J., a bouquet of balloons bobbed atop a
``Now Leasing'' sign at the Landings, a 276-unit development.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, in Edgewater, Dr. Mark Wardlow, 32, a
radiologist, stood on the patio of his two-bedroom duplex at
Mariner's Cove, overlooking the walkway. ``Only once,'' he said
when asked whether having the public so close was troubling.
``There was a bunch of kids, 14-, 15-year-olds, throwing debris in
the water. I pay too much money for people to come in here and
throw beer cans.''
</P>
<P>
   Wardlow has lived in Mariner's Cove, where apartments rent for
$2,200 to $3,000 a month, for a year and a half. ``I was told it
would be gated,'' he said, and it is _ but only at the entrance on
River Road, not along the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a lot of trespassing, I wouldn't be thrilled,''
Wardlow said. ``When the place is done and there are benches, there
might be trouble. Yes, I would have a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Stamm, past president of the New Jersey chapter of the
Hudson River Fishermen's Association, has a problem with the way
some communities bar the public from the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Stamm likes to reel them in at the waterfront. ``Have you ever
had a 20-pounder pull on your line?'' he said. ``It's thrilling.
You catch them, take a photograph and watch them swim out of your
hands. Just don't eat them.'' Last month, Stamm went to Roc
Harbour, a condominium development by the water in North Bergen.
``They wouldn't let us onto the pathway,'' he said. ``And the
pathway that they built had a chain-link fence with a padlock.''
</P>
<P>
   The contradictions were clear at Jacob's Ferry, a community of
183 town houses in West New York, where one banner advertises the
walkway and another promises ``Private Gates.''

</P>
<P>
   There has long been a tendency toward privacy along the
riverfront.
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1800s and through the first half of this
century, a maze of train tracks, bridges fashioned from boulders
and tunnels through the cliffs transformed the land along the river
into the mainland terminus for four of the nation's major rail
lines. And much of the property was fenced off from the public.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, however, the rail freight business had been
decimated by containerization, making it possible to move shipbound
cargo directly onto trucks. And so, after two decades of tortuous
bankruptcy proceedings, the rail yards and their environs became
public property _ a swath of weeded-over tracks, lonely freight
cars, rotting piers and stilled factories.
</P>
<P>
   The walkway was first conceived in the 1960s by the Regional
Planning Association to bring the public to the river. But it was
not until 1980 that Gov. Brendan Byrne formed a Waterfront Advisory
Commission, now called the Hudson River Waterfront Conservancy, a
nonprofit government advisory and advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a consultant hired by the New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection offered a preliminary plan for the
walkway. By then, developers were brimming with interest in the
waterfront and Byrne's successor, Gov. Tom Kean, proposed that each
municipality along the river be given control over its own section
_ the only stipulation being construction of the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1988 that the Department of Environmental Protection
formalized the concept by adopting the Coastal Zone Management
Rules, which defined the role of developers in building the
walkway.
</P>
<P>
   It is those rules that are now being contested in the courts.
Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive of the New Jersey Builders
Association, believes his members have a right to be compensated
for the public use of their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in recent
years,'' O'Keefe said, ``that have refined the takings clause of
the Fifth Amendment,'' which, in essence, says that government
cannot take private property without compensating the owner.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, a 1994 Supreme Court decision in the case of
Dolan vs. City of Tigard, Ore., has ``better defined'' the legal
tests determining when compensation is due, O'Keefe said. ``And
among those tests,'' he said, ``are requirements that the permit
program, such as the walkway, make individualized determinations
and impose the regulatory burden on the owners in proportion to the
impact their property is having on the publicly regulated
resource.''
</P>
<P>
   As a condition for its approval of a proposed development, the
Department of Environmental Protection requires a property owner to
grant a permanent easement for the walkway, and agree to maintain
the path to the department's standards in perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations do not make individualized determinations,
O'Keefe said, ``nor is the imposition that they make on a property
owner proportional to the impact of the development.'' The
department, he said, ``is less concerned with completing the
walkway than with extorting selected private parties to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Alexander of the Rutgers law clinic contends, however, that
the developers do not own the waterfront. ``And the reason they
don't have the right to exclude the public,'' she said, ``is
something called the Public Trust Doctrine'' _ a legal principle
dating back through common law to a codification of ancient Roman
statutes called the Justinian Institutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can exclusively own the seashore or the waterfront;
people are allowed to use the seashore for traditional purposes
such as fishing and navigation,'' Ms. Alexander said. ``And in
modern times, that's been interpreted by courts, including the New
Jersey Supreme Court, to also give the public a right to
recreational use, such as swimming and beach strolling.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court also recognized the Public Trust Doctrine
in an 1892 case, Illinois Central Railroad Co. vs. State of
Illinois, Ms. Alexander said, ``when it not only held that the
public had the rights to the waterfront but that the government
didn't have the power to give those rights away.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers have already benefited from concessions in the
state regulations, Ms. Alexander argued. ``Usually when you develop
the waterfront, the regulations say you can't develop at all within
100 feet of the shore, unless your use is water-dependent, like a
dock or a marina,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the walkway, in order to encourage development in that
formerly industrial area, the developers were allowed to construct
to within 30 feet of the water's edge. But in exchange for the
concession, the regulations required that they build the walkway to
make sure that the public can access the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of a decision in favor of his members,
O'Keefe of the builders' association said, would be a redrafting of
the state regulations to meet the standards of Dolan vs. Tigard,
``that the responsibilities of each builder be determined
individually and proportionally.'' Such a ruling would only affect
future development, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelle Marean, president of the Hudson River Waterfront
Conservancy, said: ``The conservancy believes that if the builders
prevail, it will effectively stop all future development of the
walkway. It would weaken the regulations significantly, because
then what standards will be used for determining walkway
requirements?''
</P>
<P>
   A decision in favor of the owners ``would also allow all current
walkway portions to be closed to the public,'' Ms. Marean
contended, ``because the other owners will seek equal relief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are speaking a good game,'' she said, ``but the bottom
line is that they don't want to build any walkway and they
absolutely don't want the public to have access to it.'' Arguments
in the builders' suit ended in June, and a decision by Judge
Garrett Brown Jr. of U.S. District Court is awaited.

 UNDATED: is awaited.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal court case is not the only legal skirmish on the
issue. On July 9, ruling in an action brought by Shelter Bay, a
279-apartment condominium in Edgewater, the Appellate Division of
New Jersey Superior Court affirmed an environmental department
order that fences blocking access to that community's stretch of
the pathway come down.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Benjamin Goldman, an author of books on
development and the environment, stood beside the padlocked,
barbed-wire-topped fence that blocks the walkway at Shelter Bay's
southern edge. Yanking on the padlock, Goldman, a recent resident
of Weehawken, five miles to the south, said, ``This is what we want
to avoid in our town.''
</P>
<P>
   Weehawken, he said, ``is just about the last stretch of
undeveloped land along the river _ 1.5 miles of blank slate.'' Two
developments with 1,643 units in six- to eight-story buildings
along with 40 town houses have been proposed for construction on
the Weehawken waterfront, right up to the walkway.
</P>
<P>
   The key, Goldman said, is to separate the public space from the
private space by building a road between any new development and a
waterfront park. ``An example of it done right is Riverside Park in
Manhattan,'' he said, ``and the only other place along the Jersey
side of the Hudson where this has been done is Hoboken _ the
waterfront park and walkway there.''
</P>
<P>
   Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive, has a grander plan,
one he believes would bring peace to the public-private fight while
finally threading all the gems on the waterfront necklace.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the towns along the river to enter into an
inter-local government agreement, permitting the county to oversee
construction of the entire walkway _ a project that Janiszewski
guesses would cost about $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In return,'' he said, ``the municipalities get input into a
common design, and a walkway in their lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, all the property owners would have to sign
easement agreements with the county. ``Developers get an asset,''
Janiszewski said. ``It's easier to market the property with the
walkway present. And instead of a cash outlay at the beginning of
their project, the walkway would be constructed by Hudson County as
a public entity with access to tax-exempt bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   The county could also apply for state and federal grants,
including money from New Jersey's Open Space Trust Fund, ``which
could, in turn, write down the estimated cost, probably by $20
million to $40 million,'' Janiszewski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will describe the walkway as a linear park,'' he said,
``and whatever the gap between grant dollars and the bottom line
cost will be made up by the developers. That is their incentive for
the easement agreement; they still own the land at the end of the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   One last piece of the puzzle. ``My proposal would be,''
Janiszewski said, ``that the walkway be given over to a
conservancy, some nonprofit entity responsible for maintaining the
walkway.'' Revenues generated along the walkway _ from refreshment
kiosks, for example _ ``would go to the conservancy, and the
difference in maintenance costs vs. revenues received would be
rolled into developers' costs,'' the county executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a swing chair in her zig of the zigzag building line
of attached town houses at Jacob's Ferry _ an architectural device
developers employ to maximize the number of views of the waterfront
_ Alexandra Kehayas said she favored public access. But she did
have some concerns, she said, ``that once the walkway is all
connected there may be through traffic on bikes, Rollerblades,
while children are playing in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Many an evening, Ms. Kehayas, a nutritionist, and her husband,
Peter, chief operating engineer for an insurance company, ``sit on
the deck, read the paper and relax after work.''
</P>
<P>
   From there they can gaze at New York and the night-lit glitter
of the city's silhouette. ``I'm so lucky that I can see this,'' she
said. ``It's a beautiful skyline; it should be shared by all.''

DEZIDER GRUNBERGER, 77, CANCER RESEARCHER AND COLUMBIA PROFESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dezider Grunberger, a cancer researcher and professor emeritus
of biochemistry, molecular biophysics and public health at the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, died on
Aug. 7 at a nursing home in Cresskill, N.J. He was 77 and lived in
Teaneck, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Grunberger's investigations focused on chemical
carcinogens and the mechanism by which they cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He studied the correlation between the structure of DNA as
modified by carcinogens and types of mutations induced in multicell
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   He helped develop antitumor drugs based on propolis, also known
as bee glue, a brownish, waxy substance collected by bees from the
buds of certain trees and used to caulk beehives. Propolis has long
served as a folk remedy for various ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Grunberger helped to explain the active elements in propolis. He
also shed new light on unusual DNA bases and atypical conformations
of DNA itself.
</P>
<P>
   Dezider ``Dijon'' Grunberger was born in the ancient town of
Kosice, then part of Czechoslovakia and now part of eastern
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a master's degree in inorganic chemistry at the
University of Prague in 1950 and a Ph.D. (1956) and D.Sc. (1968) in
biochemistry at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in Prague,
where he later became the founding director of the academy's
radioisotope laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, he made his first trip to the United States, to work
for the National Institutes of Health for a year, and began his
long association with Columbia's Comprehensive Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   He settled in this country in 1968 and rose through the academic
ranks to become a professor of biochemistry and biophysics and
deputy director of the cancer research center.
</P>
<P>
   Grunberger is survived by his wife of 50 years, Marta Herman
Grunberger; two sons, Dr. George Grunberger of Grosse Pointe,
Mich., and Dr. Ivan Grunberger of Cresskill; a sister, Edith Taus
of Munich; and five grandchildren. &QL;

REAL ESTATE: CAVALRY POST NEAR CHICAGO DONS CIVVIES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, Ill. _ As a child growing up in this North Shore
suburb outside Chicago, Richard Stein used to sneak up to the
perimeter of the Fort Sheridan Army base on the north end of town,
press his face into the fence and wonder what went on inside the
military property. Now he knows.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, 60, is one of three developers helping to revive the
shuttered military base by turning Fort Sheridan into a residential
community along Lake Michigan. When completed, the Town of Fort
Sheridan, as the base will be called, will have 551 residences,
including new and renovated single-family homes, town houses and
apartments. More than half of the units are being created inside
the one-time cavalry base's century-old structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a singular opportunity for a developer to create a
new community on the lakefront,'' said Stein, senior managing
director of Mesirow Stein Real Estate Inc., a division of the
Chicago-based Mesirow Financial. Stein bought an ammunition storage
bunker last year and converted it into a 6,500-square-foot,
three-bedroom residence that he now calls home.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 220 units in the $220-million development have been
built and sold. Bruce Abrams, president of the LR Development
Co &UR; . &LR; , another of Fort Sheridan's developers, says that the
developers are using $25 million of their own money and traditional
construction loans from banks to finance the rest of the project,
which should be completed within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Built at the end of the 19th century, Fort Sheridan was
decommissioned and closed in 1993, leaving behind the only
undeveloped large parcel of land on Chicago's affluent North Shore.
Because the 240-acre base has national historic landmark status,
the developers were faced with integrating 94 protected structures
into the development, including officers' quarters, cavalry stables
and barracks.
</P>
<P>
   The base received landmark status in part because many of its
buildings represented the first work of the Chicago architectural
firm of Holabird &AMP; Roche, among the originators of the Chicago
School of Architecture. The firm's other buildings include the
Palmer House Hotel in Chicago and the Chicago Hilton and Towers.
</P>
<P>
   Ossian Simonds, an influential turn-of-the-century Chicago land
planner, worked with the architects to incorporate elements of
Prairie theory _ using native plants and trees in a cultured
landscape _ in the overall design of the base, said David Hoffman,
chairman of the Red Seal Development Corp &UR; . &LR; , a principal in the
development team.
</P>
<P>
   As originally designed, Fort Sheridan was a series of rank- and
function-based neighborhoods centered around a parade ground.
Residential structures bordered the parade ground, with the
stables, ammunition storage bunkers, warehouses and other support
buildings hidden behind the soldiers' barracks on the south end of
the fort.
</P>
<P>
   As the mission of the Army base changed over time from a cavalry
base to a temporary hospital to an administrative center, so did
the historic structures. Most were reconfigured internally for
nonresidential uses. New buildings were also built, with little
thought given to the fort's design or the preservation of its
history, said Howard Decker of DLK Architecture in Chicago, the
project's historian and master architect.
</P>
<P>
   When the developers acquired the property, their first priority
was to restore a sense of history lost over the years. They used
the original neighborhood designs and land planning as guideposts
in creating different types of housing. The five neighborhoods will
have common building materials and colors _ with a total of $6
million in landscaping _ based on the writings of Simonds, the land
planner. The design includes a restored ravine, a bird rookery and
indigenous plants and flowers. The parade ground will be
incorporated into a new golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones.
</P>
<P>
   To further restore the fort's historic character, the developers
narrowed the roads to the width they were when horses were the only
mode of transportation on the base. Street lighting and signage are
similar to the types used when the base was first built.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Sheridan's most exclusive neighborhood, as both an Army
base and as a new residential community, sits on a wooded bluff
overlooking Lake Michigan to the east of the parade grounds. There
a visitor will find the 28 original married officers' quarters, set
on three cul-de-sacs.
</P>
<P>
   Red Seal Homes, a developer of upscale housing on the North
Shore, is building 22 estate homes on new cul-de-sacs on lake-view
property surrounding the mansions. The homes, with 3,000 to 5,000
square feet, will range from $815,000 to more than $1 million. Six
have been sold, with construction to begin in the fall, Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman also found a strong market for the historic officers'
mansions. All of them were sold in ``as is'' condition for $300,000
to $1 million. The Romanesque Revival-style houses ranged from
3,600 to 8,000 square feet and are distinguishable only by the
number of windows on the third floor: One window signified a
lieutenant's home; two windows a captain's.
</P>
<P>
   Because the mansions required significant rehabilitation, many
of the homes have been sold to other developers who are renovating
them on a speculative basis, says Neil Fortunato, president of
Fortunato Builders in Chicago, who recently moved into a
3,600-square-foot lieutenant's mansion that he renovated for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunato, whose father was once stationed at the base, bought
his home for $370,000 and invested $300,000 more in the renovation.
``The fort is a spectacular property,'' Fortunato said. ``It is
right off the lake. You can hear the waves. It is an amazing
setting.''
</P>
<P>
   From his living-room window, Fortunato can see the fort's
barracks and kitchen buildings, which are being transformed into
loft apartments. When completed, the lofts will range from 1,296 to
2,753 square feet, with prices beginning at $260,000. Many of the
apartments have lofted second floors and exposed brick walls and
wooden trusses.
</P>
<P>
   Marci Morrison and her husband, Greg, bought a
2,500-square-foot, three-bedroom home in the Ravinia neighborhood
of the fort after looking for houses in the surrounding suburbs.
They had found nothing comparable to the development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fell in love with it as soon as we saw the area,'' Ms.
Morrison said. `` Plus, we are in the middle of history.''

REAL ESTATE: TAX LIENS CAN ENRICH INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., N.Y.)  (lb) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has seriously contemplated making money in real
estate has probably encountered the arcane but potentially
profitable practice of investing in tax liens at public sales _ the
legal process through which municipalities obtain payment of
delinquent property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate experts say it is possible to make a secure
investment with a high rate of return in property-tax liens, even
for unsophisticated investors. And savvier, more careful and more
knowledgeable investors can even obtain title to real estate for a
small fraction of its market value by buying property at a tax
foreclosure sale, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax liens can be a great investment,'' said Saul Simon, a
certified financial planner for Allmerica Investments in Edison,
N.J., ``as long as you know what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that investors must normally seek out these sales
independently. Tax lien investments are generally not marketed like
securities by brokerage houses. The investors must be aware that
states have different procedures for handling properties on which
the owner has failed to pay property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, for example, municipalities are allowed to
``sell'' their tax liens _ or their right to foreclose on a
property when the owner has failed to pay taxes _ at public
auction. Simon said he has realized a 16 percent rate of return on
tax-lien certificates he has bought in these sales.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a municipal tax lien certificate?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a memorialization of a town's lien for unpaid taxes on a
property,'' said Hugh McGuire, a Jersey City, N.J., real estate
lawyer. When a property owner in New Jersey fails to pay local
property taxes, he said, the municipality acquires an automatic
lien against the property. That lien gives the municipality the
right to force the sale of the property to raise the money
necessary to pay the overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, however, instead of foreclosing, most municipalities
take advantage of a provision in state law that allows the tax
collector to sell the municipality's lien in exchange for the
payment of overdue taxes, McGuire said. To make it worthwhile for
investors to buy those liens, the law also allows the buyer to
collect interest on the amount he paid when he redeems the lien.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said that the interest rate that applies to a particular
lien is determined at the time the lien is sold by the
municipality. The maximum interest rate permitted by New Jersey law
_ and the rate offered at the time of sale _ is 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, when a tax collector holds a tax lien sale,
investors will ``bid'' for liens on particular properties, McGuire
said. Since the municipality is interested in obtaining payment of
all of the unpaid taxes, however, all bidders must bid the entire
amount of unpaid taxes. The successful bidder is the one who is
willing to accept the lowest interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, if only one bidder is present, he will obtain
the highest interest rate permitted by state law _ 18 percent. If a
rival bidder is present, however, he may ``bid down'' to 17
percent, meaning that he is willing to pay the overdue taxes in
exchange for a 17 percent rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people purchase tax lien certificates with the hope that
at some point in time, someone will come forward'' and reimburse
the investor for his outlay, paying any interest charges that have
accrued, McGuire said. That is what happens in most cases, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the original owner tries to sell the property,
the buyer will require that all back taxes and tax liens _ as well
as interest due any lienholders _ be paid in full. And when it
appears that the lien might not be satisfied, either because the
owner cannot be located or cannot or will not sell the property,
the law gives the lienholder the right to foreclose after holding
the lien for at least two years, McGuire explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your ultimate intention is to foreclose,'' McGuire said,
``it is usually wise to continue paying taxes for the two-year
period to prevent someone else from picking up a subsequent year's
lien.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, he said, it makes sense for investors to pay
taxes that accrue during the waiting period because when they
redeem a lien, they are allowed to collect interest on any
additional taxes paid at the same rate established at the tax sale.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Connecticut, similar procedures are used, but in New York
state, the procedures for handling tax-delinquent property depend
upon where it is located.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Davis, a New York City real estate lawyer, said the city
sells tax liens similar to the liens sold in New Jersey. However,
he said, in recent years the city has adopted procedures for the
sale of such liens that have resulted in the liens being sold ``in
bulk'' to large institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of the state, Davis said, individuals can invest
in tax-delinquent properties, but the procedure is somewhat riskier
than the city's.
</P>
<P>
   Outside New York City, a county tax collector is allowed to hold
a tax sale for any property that has accrued three years' back
taxes, Davis said. Before holding such a sale the tax collector
must notify the property owner of the time and date of the sale and
the amount of taxes that are due.
</P>
<P>
   If the taxes have not been paid by the date of the sale, the tax
collector has the right to sell the property to the highest bidder.
But buying property from a tax collector is not the same as buying
it from the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you get from the county is what is known as a quitclaim
deed,'' Davis said. Such a deed transfers to the successful bidder
all of the county's rights to the property.
</P>
<P>
   And while the county's tax lien takes precedence over all other
liens except federal claims, a quitclaim deed from the county tax
collector may not always be the safest investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the county didn't provide proper notice of the tax sale,
the sale could be subject to challenge,'' Davis said. For example,
he said, if the county notifies the property owner at the address
on the deed, but the property owner had properly notified the
county of a change of address, the sale could be defective.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Davis said, properties sold at tax sale can be
occupied by tenants, squatters or even the property owner himself _
a complication that could require lengthy legal proceedings to
rectify.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Davis said, investors considering purchasing New
York state property at a tax sale should inspect it before the
sale. It is also wise to conduct a title search to determine the
chain of title and to find out whether the person the tax collector
has identified as the owner is the current owner of record, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something you would want to just jump into,'' said
Davis, who has bought about 120 acres of upstate property at tax
sales. ``The risks can be significant. But that's not to say you
can't get lucky.''

THE NEW YORKER JOINS GLOSSY NEIGHBORS IN NEW TIMES SQUARE TOWER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Friday at noon, the phones at the offices of The
New Yorker rang for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., Certified Moving vans arrived at 20 West 43rd Street,
and movers began loading several hundred boxes of books, galleys,
correspondence, manuscripts, rejection notices, artwork and memos
from some of the country's most august writers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the magazine will reopen in new quarters on Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the magazine will share office space with
any other publication, let alone its fat, glossy compatriots at
Conde Nast, titles like Vogue and Allure that tend to evoke J.
Peterman more than S.J. Perelman.
</P>
<P>
   The move, and all that it seemed to symbolize, caused at least a
minor flash of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not talk about it,'' said one editor. Pausing for
several seconds between words, in mock horror, he added: ``I ... am
... in ... complete ... denial.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Conde Nast bought The New Yorker in 1984, S.I.
Newhouse Jr., the chairman of the company, has allowed the magazine
to remain on its own turf: first, in the magazine's famously grubby
offices at 25 West 43rd Street, and since 1991, in a more polished
environment _ slightly more corporate but still redolent with
writerly gentility _ across the street at No. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the magazine that has published the socially significant
writing of E.B. White, Dorothy Parker, James Baldwin, J.D. Salinger
and scores of other famous authors will inhabit the gleaming
citadel of Conde Nast, a chrome-and-glass lipstick tube of an
office building.
</P>
<P>
   The prized possessions left early: the plaster walls bearing
sketches by James Thurber, now encased in Plexiglas, were moved
last Monday and remain under the watchful eyes of security guards
at their new home on the 21st floor of 4 Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The staff members were both nostalgic and nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Garrison, an editor who has worked at both the 25 West
43rd Street and 20 West 43rd Street offices, was packing her
belongings early Thursday morning. Even though her new office is
appreciably smaller than the one she was vacating (complete with
panoramic views of the New York Public Library and the lush
greenery of Bryant Park), Ms. Garrison nevertheless planned to take
along her Correction Selectric III typewriter circa 1975, a box of
Case Duplicating Supply Inc. carbon paper and a stack of pink
routing slips, items of arcana that date back to the days when
William Shawn was editor.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrison also planned to bring along ``the shrink couch'' _
so named ``because sometimes you'd come in here and find distraught
writers curled up on it in the morning,'' she said _ but wondered
aloud whether it would be allowed into the sleek new headquarters
unless it was stylishly slipcovered beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were traumatized about moving here,'' she said, placing
heavy emphasis on the word ``here'' and gesturing to the
soon-to-be-vacant hallways. ``But at least this was a similar
prewar building, with rambling offices, and felt like a dusty
English department.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garrison looked westward and uttered something that sounded
an awful lot like, ``I guess now we'll be corporatized.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, David Remnick, the editor of The New
Yorker, made a short speech to the magazine's staff in the
16th-floor reception area. Some people drank champagne, and some
drank Corona beer, but all heard Remnick's message loud and clear:
The New Yorker is not about brick and glass. It's about the spirit
of the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but feel a pang in your heart whenever you move
from a place that's been home, but bricks and mortar are not the
soul of The New Yorker,'' Remnick said in an interview. ``The soul
is its writers and artists and everyone who contributes to it. Our
readers will see that the soul of The New Yorker will flourish,
too, on Times Square.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult, however, to flourish without bookshelves. When
Remnick and The New Yorker's deputy editor, Pamela Maffei McCarthy,
inspected the standardized new space, they discovered a serious
lack of bookshelves, and had to request that architects design and
build four times as many bookshelves for their offices. There are
also fewer offices for writers, so staff writers like John McPhee
and Kurt Andersen gave up their spaces and said they would write
from home.
</P>
<P>
   And the writers, for the first time, will inhabit the same floor
as The New Yorker's business staff, which one editor said made him
feel ``a little queasy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The New Yorker staff has other practical issues to worry about.
Since the other Conde Nast magazines have moved in, their staff
members have complained heartily about problems as various as the
standardized file cabinets in every office, which are built for
European-size file folders, and the lack of restaurants that will
construct and deliver custom-made, dressing-free salads.
</P>
<P>
   But there seemed to be some higher power at work in the offices
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, a color-Xeroxed photograph of Harold Ross, The
New Yorker's first editor, was Scotch-taped to the door frame of
Ms. McCarthy's office. When Ross died in 1951, rumors abounded that
The New Yorker would die with him, so the sudden unexplained
appearance of his ghostly portrait _ like an urbane, literary
Shroud of Turin _ seemed portentous.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy said she had no idea how it got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared there during the night,'' she said Friday, as she
placed one of the final phone calls before her phone was
disconnected at noon. ``I think it is someone's idea of a quiet
homage to Harold Ross. And you know what? I'm going to leave it up
there. It will be the only thing left of me and my time here when I
walk out the door.''

CARL TOMS, THEATRICAL DESIGNER, IS DEAD AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Toms, a set and costume designer for the theater, opera,
ballet and film, died on Aug. 4 at his home in Hertfordshire,
England. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was emphysema, The Guardian reported.
</P>
<P>
   Toms trained at the Mansfield College of Art in Mansfield,
Nottingham, and in London at the Royal College of Art and the
influential Old Vic Theater School. He apprenticed at the English
Stage Company, moving on in 1952 to work as an assistant to Oliver
Messel for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Messel's designs, known for their delicate opulence and
romanticism, were a far cry from the kind of grittily naturalistic
productions for which the English Stage Company became known. Toms
absorbed it all. Throughout his 40-year career, he was admired not
so much for a distinctive style as for a range of styles, always
rooted in practicality, that included the exotic and the
naturalistic, the chichi and the coolly stylized.
</P>
<P>
   He was also admired for the thoroughness of his conceptions,
particularly for theater and opera. In a review in The New York
Times of a Young Vic production of Terence Rattigan's ``French
Without Tears'' in 1974 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Clive
Barnes wrote: ``As ever the company had original and beautiful
settings by Carl Toms, the resident designer. There are few British
stage designers who can compare with the new young Americans _ but
Toms is his own kind of miracle worker. He designs a play from the
word up; the playwright's style seems to be his guideline.''
</P>
<P>
   Toms worked with Messel on productions at Covent Garden and
Glyndebourne and in the London commercial theater and assisted him
on the designs for the American musical ``House of Flowers'' in
1954.
</P>
<P>
   Toms was first known for his work in opera, beginning with a
Glyndebourne production of the Wolf-Ferrari opera ``Susanna's
Secret'' in 1958. His first theater commission after he left Messel
in 1958 was Girardoux's ``Apollo of Bellac'' at the Royal Court,
followed by several West End theater productions and an assignment
to decorate the royal box for a celebration at Covent Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Toms worked with the major English nonprofit companies,
including the Old Vic, the National Theater, the Royal Shakespeare
Company, the Chichester Festival and the English Stage Company. His
designs for the National Theater included productions of ``Love's
Labour's Lost,'' Marlowe's ``Edward II,'' Sir John Vanbrugh's
``Provoked Wife,'' Neil Simon's ``Brighton Beach Memoirs'' and
Brian Friel's adaptation of Turgenev's ``Fathers and Sons.''
</P>
<P>
   He designed many Noel Coward revivals. He worked frequently with
Tom Stoppard, on his adaptations at the National and on productions
in London and New York of plays including ``Travesties,'' ``Night
and Day,'' ``The Real Thing,'' ``Jumpers'' and ``Hapgood.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notable assignments included Robert Bolt's ``Vivat! Vivat
Regina!,'' Coward's ``Look After Lulu'' and the Chichester Festival
production of John Osborne's ``Patriot for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Toms designed the Royal Shakespeare Company's
production of the George S. Kaufman-Moss Hart comedy ``The Man Who
Came to Dinner'' and Ben Travers' ``Thark.'' Toms began to work in
New York theater in 1970 and won a Tony Award and Drama Desk Award
in 1974 for his designs for the musical ``Sherlock Holmes.''
</P>
<P>
   His opera work included designs for the Welsh National Opera,
the Royal Opera and the English National Opera and, in the United
States, for the Chicago, New York City, San Diego and San Francisco
Operas and the Metropolitan Opera. These included productions of
Bellini's ``I Puritani'' and ``Norma,'' Wagner's ``Meistersinger,''
Britten's ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ``Peter Grimes,''
Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' and Rossini's ``Barber of
Seville'' and ``Cenerentola.'' His dance designs included
productions of ``Swan Lake'' for the Royal Ballet and the London
Festival Ballet and George Balanchine's ``Ballet Imperial'' for the
Royal. He was also active at the Vienna Burgtheater, the Vienna
National Theater and the Vienna State Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Toms worked on nine films, including the 1966 ``One Million
Years B.C.,'' for which he had to create a prehistoric bikini made
of a few strategically placed animal skins for Raquel Welch. His
latest assignments included the English productions of two Edward
Albee plays, ``Three Tall Women'' in 1994 and ``A Delicate
Balance'' in 1997 and Peter Hall's production of Oscar Wilde's
``Ideal Husband'' in 1996 in London.
</P>
<P>
   Toms received the Order of the British Empire in 1969 after
serving as the design consultant to the investiture of the Prince
of Wales at Caernarvon. He redecorated theaters in the West End and
the Theater Royal in Windsor. He was known for his restoration of
the Theater Royal in Bath in 1982. He also decorated restaurants,
hotels and houses and designed exhibitions, theater programs and
cards. &QL;

FORMER TEAMMATES RECALL AILING HUNTER'S CLASS AND QUIET INFLUENCE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They talked the most about the teammate who wasn't
there. Not Joe DiMaggio, who before he died in March had become a
fixture at the Yankees' old-timers' days. Not Thurman Munson, whose
death 20 years ago in a plane crash deprived them of part of the
heart of their team. No, the teammate they talked about was Jim
(Catfish) Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being at Yankee Stadium on Saturday swapping old war
stories about the Yankee teams of the '70s, Hunter was lying in a
North Carolina hospital, his body not only deteriorating from Lou
Gehrig's disease but his brain also suffering from the bruise he
incurred when he fell down concrete steps at his home in Hertford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the subject of a lot of conversation at dinner last
night,'' Rich (Goose) Gossage said. ``Everybody was very concerned
about him. To see what he's going through now is a killer. It
brings tears to your eyes. No one should have to go through that.''
</P>
<P>
   But no tears were shed in the Yankees' clubhouse before the
old-timers ceremonies. Hunter's former teammates talked glowingly
and lovingly of him and wished he could have been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't mean the same,'' Ron Guidry said of
Old-Timers' Day without Hunter. ``I enjoy coming here, but when you
think of him, it doesn't mean as much as it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry and Gossage, two of many ``old-timers'' from the World
Series championship teams of the '70s, both spoke of what Hunter
meant to them as pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a better class guy that you ever saw pitch, I
haven't seen him yet,'' Guidry said. ``He was probably the
consummate class guy. I used to kind of emulate him. I watched that
man pitch for years. When I watched him walk in that door, I didn't
know if the game was over, if he was winning, 1-0, if he was
losing, 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd watch him walk over there, take his glove, lay it down,
sit down, undress. I never saw him come in here firing, cussing,
screaming and hollering. It was a lesson learned. It's not your
fault if you give up runs or you lose the game. He didn't feel he
had to take it out on anything if it didn't work out. It's just
that it didn't work out today. I learned a lot just watching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage learned from Hunter even before they became teammates
with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him with the Oakland A's,'' the former relief
pitcher said. ``For a young pitcher like myself, watching him go
about his business, that's how I learned to play the game, from
guys like him. When Catfish was on the mound, we were there to
watch, take notice and learn something. The way he conducted
himself on the mound was the way he represented himself off the
field, too. And he never wanted the light; just let me do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry especially recalled how Hunter did his job when he came
back from an arm ailment for the latter part of the 1978 season.
That was the season in which Guidry established himself as the best
pitcher in the American League, winning 25 games and losing a mere
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as good as my year was,'' the Louisiana left-hander said,
``I still say it wasn't because of me; it was because of him that
we won. He came back when we had nobody. Who would we have had
pitch in his place if he wasn't here to win the games that he won?
The only game he lost after he came back was the last day. If we
had lost one game in there, we would never have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry said he and Hunter were more than teammates. They were
good friends, much of the relationship stemming from their love of
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pick up a shotgun to go hunting, I automatically think
about Jimmy,'' Guidry said. ``I wonder what he's doing today. I
wonder if he's hunting this morning. I wonder if he's thinking
about me hunting. That's a good thing to think about early in the
morning. It would bring some good thoughts into my head.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teammate, Hunter was noted for more than his pitching. He
was considered the best at needling other players. He saved his
best arrows for Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best at getting on people,'' said Mickey Rivers,
who was pretty good himself, especially with Reggie Jackson as his
target. ``When he started on Lou, we just took it from there. He
knew exactly how to hit the nail.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage fondly recalled the verbal scraps between Hunter and
Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Lou used to go at it on the bus rides and the plane,''
Gossage said. ``They'd go back and forth. Cat was all over Lou. Lou
would always do this'' _ run his hand through the hair on the back
of his head _ ``and smell his fingers. Cat would be all over him.
He'd say, `Lou, what's that smell like, man?'''
</P>
<P>
   His former teammates would welcome the opportunity to hear
Hunter's North Carolina voice needle anybody just one more time.

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ As recently as one year ago, Peru and Ecuador were
preparing to go to war, something they have done with regularity
ever since the Peruvian Navy blockaded Ecuador's principal port in
1860.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that the squabbling neighbors are finally learning
to live together, Ecuador President Jamil Mahuad finished a
three-day visit through Peru on Friday _ complete with banquets,
honorary university degrees, tropical river fishing and a triumphal
tour through downtown Lima arm in arm with President Alberto K.
Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by a failing economy and increasing protests at home,
Mahuad came to Peru to consolidate the gains won in October when
the two countries signed a peace treaty brokered by the United
States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile to settle a longstanding border
dispute over a 50-mile swath of the Condor Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents were jeered at on Friday as they drove
through Iquitos in the Peruvian Amazon by hundreds of protesters
who say the treaty gives Ecuador too many commercial rights in
their region. But most experts called the visit a success that
augurs well for future relations.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori and Mahuad dressed in matching red sport shirts and
donned Indian headdresses to pose for photographers in a dugout
canoe on an Amazon tributary. And they met with residents of the
jungle town of Sarameriza to announce the construction of a port
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patriotism searches for development,'' Fujimori said as Mahuad
smiled widely. Then Fujimori called for a show of hands of those
opposed to opening river commerce to Ecuadoreans. No one voted
against the Peruvian President, Fujimori noted, ``not even
Mahuad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a backhanded slap at political leaders of the area who
oppose the thaw with Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our friend President Mahuad is Arab and I am half Japanese,''
Fujimori said, ``but we speak the same language.''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents announced an assortment of joint projects,
including the extension of parks, construction of river port
installations, bridges, roads, schools and clinics that will total
up to $3 billion over several years. They also signed a free-trade
agreement that will remove tariffs from 585 agricultural, consumer
and industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
   The October treaty sets a permanent border along the Cordillera
del Condor mountain range, as Peru always demanded. Ecuador gained
access to a piece of territory on the Peruvian side to commemorate
its war dead at a memorial site in Tiwinza, as well as navigation
and trade rights in the Peruvian river ports of Sarameriza and
Pijuayal.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the two countries went to war _ in 1995 _ 100
people were killed in four weeks of conflict. The fighting led to
an expensive arms buildup in both Peru and Ecuador. Experts say
peace will allow them to reduce the size of their militaries, which
will help their economies and strengthen civilian rule.

AS PROTESTANTS MARCH, POLICE AND CATHOLICS CLASH IN ULSTER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS last 2 grafs to UPDATE with Sinn Fein belatedly calling for
calm.)  (ko) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Officers of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary clashed Saturday in cities across Northern Ireland
with Roman Catholics protesting Protestant parades through their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people were arrested and scores were injured, most
of them not seriously, as protesters confronted policemen seeking
to clear them from the parades.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators shouted abuse at the marchers, who were
celebrating the 310th anniversary of the defeat of James II, a
Catholic, in Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations over the parades, which many Catholics find
insulting, occurred in Belfast, Lurgan and Londonderry. They came
as the people of Omagh, in the center of the predominantly
Protestant British province, prepared to commemorate the first
anniversary of a bombing by a splinter group of the Irish
Republican Army that killed 29 people.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, accused the police of
brutality, which the police denied. In the past, Sinn Fein
president Gerry Adams has acknowledged that Catholic protests over
the Protestant parades are a part of the republican strategy to
advance Sinn Fein's position in the northern peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have been stalled for more than a year in a
dispute over the disarmament of the IRA and over Cabinet posts for
Sinn Fein in the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Assembly was
created under the 1998 peace agreement to give the province's
minority Catholics more power.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials, including mainstream Catholic politicians, said
Sinn Fein was using the protests to satisfy hardline members of the
IRA who are restless with Adams' policy of trying to negotiate with
the Protestant unionist majority.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's demonstrations, the officials said, also had the
effect of counterbalancing the plan for a memorial service in Omagh
on Sunday for the victims of last year's bombing by the splinter
group, which called itself the Real IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The main IRA has observed a cease-fire for two years but has
refused to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast on Saturday morning, police said 19 officers and
several civilians were injured in clashes on the Lower Ormeau Road
as about 20 members of the Protestant Apprentice Boys of Derry
marched through the area. There were no arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Television on Saturday night showed policemen dragging sitting
protesters off the Lower Ormeau Road. They responded by kicking.
The police then clubbed the protesters' legs.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Rice, leader of the Catholic neighborhood group and a
former IRA prisoner in a British jail, said the police had been
``brutal, absolutely brutal,'' in clearing several hundred
protesters out of the way of the march.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers then boarded a bus for Londonderry, for ceremonies
honoring the young apprentices who in 1689 locked the gates of the
city against James II. James was eventually defeated by his
Protestant son-in-law, William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In Lurgan, 20 miles west of Belfast, police said that protesters
in a Catholic area threw gasoline bombs and rocks at police
officers and that several masked men attacked police lines with
cudgels. The police said they fired five plastic bullets and made
five arrests.
</P>
<P>
   In Londonderry, in the west of the province, a Protestant parade
in the city center passed without significant violence at noontime
along the old wall of the city, near the Catholic Bogside area. In
the Catholic neighborhood of Creggan, two cars, apparently owned by
Protestants, were hijacked and burned.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 police officers were deployed in Londonderry,
which Catholics call Derry, after Assistant Chief Constable Alan
McQuillan said he expected ``extremist republicans'' to cause
``serious damage, to organize it, to orchestrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, when Sinn Fein wanted to defuse sectarian
conflicts, Adams or his top aide, Martin McGuinness, have issued
calls for calm.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, after the Protestant parades and
ceremonies had ended, the violence had subsided and the protesters
had begun to disperse, McGuinness said Catholics should be ``calm
and dignified.''

RUSSIA WARNS MUSLIM STATES ON DAGESTAN 
</HEADLINE>
 LEDE WRITE THROUGH  
( Eds: Corrects Muslin to Muslim   in 3rd graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Saying it had proof of Islamic financial support to
separatist rebels in Russia's strife-torn Caucasus, Russia issued a
blunt warning Saturday to Muslim states: Hands off Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   But as the fighting widens along Russia's volatile southern rim,
analysts said the focus on foreign scapegoats overlooks Moscow's
broader problem: It has neglected the vast extremes of the world's
largest nation, and Dagestan's uprising may just reflect the
tensions that could tear Russia apart, bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that highlights Moscow's concern over the armed
uprising in its strategically important Caucasus region, Russia's
acting foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, lashed out at unspecified
foreign backers of the militants who have occupied parts of
Dagestan and declared the area an independent Muslim state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that any form of support for the terrorists'
actions will be viewed as rude interference in the internal affairs
of the Russian Federation, with all the logical consequences,''
Ivanov wrote in a letter addressed to the UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, major Western nations and several Muslim states. Ivanov
urged Islamic countries to condemn those who are ``trying to use
Islam to camouflage open banditism.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said Moscow had hard evidence that the rebels were
receiving aid from abroad, although he offered none of it.
Speculation has been rife that foreign backers were behind the
rebels ever since up to 2,000 well-armed militants crossed into
Dagestan from neighboring Chechnya on Aug. 7. The Russian media has
reported, without substantiation, that reputed Saudi terrorist
Osama bin Laden has spent $25 million training and equipping the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The reports overshadow experts' warnings that Moscow caused its
own problems in the Caucasus by neglecting to solve the volatile
regions' complex ethnic, social and economic problems until it was
too late. They say the federal government is too weak, too poor,
and too distracted with its own internal battles to spend the time
and effort need to in restive regions like Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a foreign problem, this is all a result of the
extreme weakness of the state in Russia,'' said Nikolai Petrov,
political analyst at the Moscow Carnegie Center think tank.
``Dagestan is the weakest link, and it has specfic problems _ but
that doesn't take away from the fact that this problem is a result
of a problem that affects the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrov said it was characteristic that as heavy fighting broke
out between federal troops and the rebels last Monday, Moscow was
absorbed with a new political crisis caused when Yeltsin abruptly
toppled his fourth government in 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, politicians have begun to sound the alarm. The
apperance of Muslim separatists on its own territory is a nightmare
scenario in a Russia that views radical Islamic expansion as its
main regional security threat.
</P>
<P>
   An uprising in the country's most restive region throws a wrench
in Russia's geopolitical dreams of controlling Caspian oil riches
through pipelines that run through Dagestan and thus maintaining
influence over its former Soviet neighbors in Central Asia and the
Transcaucasus. Oil analyst Euan Craik said Russia ``risks
completely being sidelined'' as oil companies turn to alternatives
to the Dagestan route.
</P>
<P>
   And after Moscow failed in a bloody 1994-1996 campaign to put
down a separatist rebellion in next-door Chechnya, many in Russia
believe the losing control any more territory could shatter the
fragile federal system upon which this vast, nuclear-armed country
is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``The breakup of Russia is knocking at the door,'' remarked
Yegor Stroyev, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament,
the Federation Council.
</P>
<P>
   The house's members, made up of leaders of Russia's 89
constituent regions and republics, have been calling for tough
action from the Kremlin to halt the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has obliged, launching heavy air and artillery
strikes against the insurgents that military officials say have
begun to take their toll. Interior Minstry spokesman Yevgeny
Ryabtsev said in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital, that the
militants were beginning to show signs of ``panic'' after
sustaining the loss of over 200 men in fighting. But he added that
four Russian paratroopers had been killed and another 13 wounded in
the course of a seven-hour battle on Dagestan's rugged, mountainous
border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who have their own Internet site and supply daily
footage of their operations in Dagestan to Russian television
companies, say Russia has lost dozens of men while only five rebels
have died. On Saturday, the rebels' Web site said their Islamic
council, or Shura, had decided to open a criminal investigation
against acting Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and other senior
Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Federal commanders say they will be able to drive the rebels
from Dagestan within two weeks. But they say the conflict is been
complicated by the help they say the separatists are getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are dealing with is a massive invasion by bandit
formations,'' Lieutenant General Igor Zubov of Russia's Interior
Minister said last week. ``They have been nourished with the help
of money received from abroad. The sums are roughly known to us _
millions of dollars have been invested in this operation. All the
participants have already received their renumeration. There is a
big number of mercenaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian media have repeated the allegations that the rebels'
Chechen commanders, Shamil Basayev and Khattab, have received
foreign financing for the operation in Dagestan. Respected
newspaper Kommersant Daily reported last week that individual
fighters receive $100 per day and $300 if they are wounded, huge
sums in the impoverished mountain villages of Dagestan and
Chechnya, where unemployment is over 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is the spark inflaming this fight, critics say.
Alexander Iskandaryan, director of the Institute of Caucasus
Studies, said Russia may be able to fight off Basayev and Khattab,
but a successful police and military action against the rebels will
not end the malaise that fuels radical Islamic movements in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many young people with no land, no jobs, no
prospects and little education,'' Iskandaryan says. ``People in
South America in such conditions turn to Marxism. People in the
Caucasus turn to radical Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Chechen-led rebels arrived in Dagestan, a
radical Muslim sect known as the Wahhabis had taken control of
entire regions, establishing Muslim Sharia rule and refusing to
obey Russian laws.
</P>
<P>
   Khattab and Baseyev will go away, but the people in these
villages will still be there, ``and central authority will become
weaker and weaker,'' Iskandaryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He says the solution would be for the federal government to help
fund jobs and education, and to support mainstream Islamic groups.
But he acknowledges that the state has no money for such projects.
And he added it was hard to imagine Russia's Orthodox Christian
majority supporting the idea of spending state funds building
Islamic schools.
</P>
<P>
   For many Russians, the Caucasus are a foreign, frightening
place. Opinion polls routinely show that most Russian distrust
their countrymen from the Caucasus. And few Russians can tell the
difference between Chechens and and any of the 40 ethnic groups
that make up Dagestan's population. This was the point the Moscow
newspaper Vremya MN made when it printed a photograph of a bunch of
tough looking, heavily armed men in combat fatigues and dark
glasses. ``These are not Islamic militants,'' read the caption.
``They are Dagestani police.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people from the Caucasus have trouble travelling to
Russia to find work, according to Fiona Hill, director of Harvard
University's Strengthening Democratic Institutions project. They
are often the victims of racist police and residence requirements.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Chechnya. Fighting there ended in 1996, but
Chechnya remains isolated, blockade and unreconstructed _ and
therefore a lawless place where armed gangs hold sway.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestanis do not want this, and many did not welcome the
militants' invasion. Mukhu Aliyev, speaker of Dagestan's National
Assembly, said Thursday that anti-Chechen sentiment is far stronger
than anti-Russian moods among the region's two million mainly
Muslim residents.
</P>
<P>
   That could all change if Russia's military starts killing
civilians and destroying towns and villages, the way it did in
Chechnya in 1995 and 1996, where 80,000 people died. So far,
Moscow's forces have avoided that.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia may have already committed a deadly mistake by
sanctioning the arming of Dagestan militias that have volunteered
to help federal troops fight off the intruders.
</P>
<P>
   Such handouts of weapons could ignite a larger conflict among
Dagestan's ethnic groups spreading to neighboring regions along
Russia's border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an open road to civil war,'' Major General Nikolai
Bezborodov, a member of the Russian parliament's defense committee,
told The Moscow Times last week. ``It will simply turn the whole
area into a battlefield.''

COLOMBIANS SHED TEARS FOR A CLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIRK SEMPLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA _ In a country where conflict characterizes daily life,
Colombians of all classes and occupations came together Saturday to
pay final respects to a beloved humorist who was assassinated
Friday on his way to work.
</P>
<P>
   Social and political satirist Jaime Garzon, who also worked as
an intermediary between the government and leftist rebels, was
slain during increasing violence between the government, rebels,
and right-wing paramilitary forces.
</P>
<P>
   In an event that had many of the trappings of a state funeral,
tens of thousands thronged Bogota's main square, many of whom had
passed by Garzon's coffin in the colonnaded entranceway of the
Capitol. The crowd demonstrated against the civil strife that has
claimed 35,000 people in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   So many people showed up under overcast skies that officials at
the main cathedral moved his Mass outside, before the body was
taken for burial Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying awoke a people numbed to the killings and
kidnappings of a nation at war. ``They Killed The Laugh, What
Next?'' read Saturday's headline in El Tiempo newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``This killing is horrible because we can't understand who did
it,'' said Mariana Shuk, an artist who stood on the Plaza de
Bolivar during the brief Mass. ``Before, there were the good guys
and the bad guys. But with all the forces at work now _ the army,
the paramilitary, the guerrillas _ we don't know where it came
from.''
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, 38, was one of the few Colombians who managed to bridge
all sectors of this stratified society. He was friends with the
president, yet played comic characters such as a shoeshine man and
a doorman. He impersonated and lampooned the nation's famous yet
was not too cynical to help with a nascent peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   No one was spared his acerbic wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made fun of everybody,'' Shuk said. ``This guy was a friend
of everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd of 60,000 or so carried small white flags that
said ``No More'' _ a reference to the civil war, in which the US
military has played a role working with the Colombian military.
Washington's main concern in the war is
</P>
<P>
   the rebels' protection of cultivators, producers, and US-bound
smugglers of cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Many Colombians already despair of a peaceful end to the
violence, a goal of President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard the news'' of Garzon's killing, said magazine
editor Ana Maria Londono, ``I thought, `Where is this country
going?' I don't want to have children here!''
</P>
<P>
   A cabbie who gave his name as Jorge said Garzon's death
reinforced another lesson about life in Bogota. ``Here you can't
speak about anyone because they'll kill you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon was shot by two gunmen on a motorcycle Friday morning as
he was driving to the Radionet station in downtown Bogota, where he
hosted a popular morning program, police said. Police have
impounded nearly 1,000 motorcycles in the investigation and are not
ruling out any suspects in the slaying, which several politicians
have attributed to the right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shrines took form at several locations in the capital.
Throughout Friday and Saturday, mourners placed flowers, written
eulogies, candles, and religious images in front of the comedian's
apartment, at his favorite restaurant, and near the scene of the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night, listeners from around the country and the
world called Radionet to offer their condolences and remembrances.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thousands who waited in a two-hour line to pass by
Garzon's coffin was Senen Fernandez, 33, who said the comic helped
make a depressing nation tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had it up to here,'' he said. ``I'm a chef, but I'm
working these days as a messenger. I've been thinking about moving
to France.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a common impulse these days in Colombia. The US Embassy
in Bogota has seen a doubling in requests for visitors' visas as a
growing number of Colombians try to flee with plans to remain
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's event, Cesar Osma, a 33-year-old performance clown
by trade, compared the public outpouring to the uproar that
followed the murders of other populist Colombian heros, including
presidential candidates Luis Carlos Galan in 1989 and former
guerrilla Carlos Pizarro in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kill those who fight for the poor,'' he muttered.

KOSOVO PEACEKEEPING FORCE GETS TOUGH WITH KLA

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ The NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo
is clamping down hard on the Kosovo Liberation Army, seizing arms
caches almost daily and confiscating documents and even cash in
what some officials say is a determined effort to dismantle the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and U.N. officials maintain that the tougher action is
routine, and part of an agreement signed almost seven weeks ago
that aimed to disarm the rebels within three months.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, though, the peacekeeping force here has given the
guerrillas a fairly wide berth. With the recent crackdown, the
force is demonstrating that the peacekeepers will no longer
tolerate violations of the agreement and that they expect the
rebels to turn over their weapons and come to heel behind NATO and
U.N. authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The action has also underscored differences over the future role
of the guerrillas and made clear that the peacekeepers have had to
resort to more forceful measures to get the rebels to live up to an
accord signed after high-level American officials intervened in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Kosovar army and the provisional government of
Hashim Thaci, who is the political leader of the movement, are
growing increasingly unhappy as many of their aspirations are
brushed aside. Those include forming a kind of national guard and
being incorporated within any police force for Kosovo, as well as
gaining social respect that they feel they have earned.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas' leadership says that it will continue to
cooperate with the NATO-led peacekeeping force and the U.N. mission
here, but warns that it may not be able to control disconsolate
members of its rank and file, something of increasing concern to
NATO commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The next six weeks will be a crucial test for cooperation
between the peacekeepers and the guerrillas. If things go wrong,
the peacekeepers may find themselves with an insurgent army turning
against them, some foreign military observers here warn.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems could become bigger, more serious,'' said
Bajram Kosumi, leader of the Parliamentary Party and minister of
information in the provisional government. ``Then we would have
wide-scale chaos. I cannot even imagine what it would be like.''
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers insist that they are merely acting according to
the agreement signed by their commander, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson,
in June. At that time, the chief of staff of the KLA, Gen. Agim
Ceku, agreed that the rebels would hand in all heavy weapons, and
30 percent of their small arms by July 21.
</P>
<P>
   But the guerrilla army apparently failed to hand over the bulk
of its weapons. Jackson gave them two extra days to do so, still
without satisfaction. He has now begun conducting tough
search-and-seizure operations across the province to force the
rebels to comply.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day last week, the peacekeepers seized weapons in
four or five different locations. On Thursday, they confiscated
antitank grenade launchers, assault rifles, grenades, mines and
mortar rounds in several premises and intercepted a truck carrying
several rifles and ammunition into Kosovo from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping troops also arrested Rexhep Selimi, the minister of
public order in the provisional government, and seized money,
weapons and ministry identification cards at his home last week.
Selimi was forced to issue a statement a day later acknowledging
the peacekeepers' and the United Nations' authority and admitting
that his ministry's identification cards were inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   While the peacekeeping force clearly established its authority,
the incident was perceived as a humiliation for Selimi and may bode
ill for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping force has been acting energetically to curb the
general criminal activity in Kosovo and is quick to point out that
many of the arms seized do not necessarily belong to the Kosovo
Liberation Army or Serb paramilitaries, which were originally
perceived as the two main parties to be disarmed, but to criminal
gangs or rogue elements that do not want to demobilize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now more and more there is some kind of evidence to suggest
there is a third actor,'' said a peacekeeping spokesman, Maj.
Roland Lavoie. ``The amount of money and material confiscated
suggests a more criminal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet whoever the criminals are, it is the guerrilla movement that
is taking the heat for the perceived noncompliance with NATO
demands. Peacekeeping soldiers on the ground appear to have little
sympathy for the guerrilla fighters. The atrocities committed by
the Serb forces are no longer foremost in their minds. What
preoccupies them now is the intimidation and revenge killings
committed daily by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are a soldier on the ground there is a natural
evolution to find an opponent,'' a British military observer
explained, working with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. ``The soldiers are coming up against
nastiness and see the Albanians as the bad ones.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is not lost on the guerrilla force and its
sympathizers. ``They are treating our war heroes like dogs,'' said
Kosumi, who never joined the KLA but sought its protection in the
mountains during the war.
</P>
<P>
   He said that it is as if the U.N. mission in Kosovo, known as
UNMIK, and NATO ``want to allow the image of the KLA to be
ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are in a dilemma,'' he said. ``Should we allow our
image to be ruined or should we say to UNMIK to stop? Should we
take action?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He argues that NATO and the U.N. authorities are becoming
dismissive of the guerrilla movement, which he said is wrong and
dangerous. Officials in the two organizations are attempting to
bypass the two most controversial paragraphs in the disarmament
accord, which agree to give consideration to former guerrillas who
want to take part in the police force and form their own national
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Those paragraphs were agreed to by James Rubin, assistant to
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, to help clinch the
demilitarization agreement with Thaci, the KLA leader, in June. Yet
many in the United Nations and at NATO do not agree with those
paragraphs and have no intention of letting them be realized,
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have considered it and they are not going to do it,''
said a Western diplomat in Pristina of the U.N. and NATO
authorities. The guerrillas ``are not being encouraged to think it
is going to happen,'' the diplomat continued.
</P>
<P>
   The provisional government knows it is being brushed off every
time it tries to talk about the national guard, and is not happy,
Kosumi said, not least because many of the rank and file are
expecting some sort of future employment.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign observer responsible for liaison with the KLA over
the last nine months warns that leaving the former guerrillas out
in the cold would invite trouble.
</P>
<P>
   He said any attempt to round them up by force would be like
``herding cats.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to hold them by the hand and walk them into civilian
life,'' he said.

 &HT;    Detained Chinese staying mum
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Investigators Saturday questioned some of the 132
Chinese men and boys found on a ship in Savannah last week in what
authorities said was the most sophisticated immigrant smuggling
operation in recent Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Agents plan more interviews today and Monday with the illegal
immigrants, who are being held in detention facilities in Fulton
and DeKalb counties in suburban Atlanta. Investigators hope to
decide within the next few days whether to file criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service said the
interviews so far have yielded no answers to key questions: Where
were the Chinese going? Was an employer waiting for them?
</P>
<P>
   INS District Director Thomas Fischer said the agents collected
names, dates of birth and other information from the men. The
agency flew Chinese-speaking agents to Atlanta from New York to
help, but Fischer said it was slow going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically the Asians have been very secretive,'' he said.
``They tend not to be as verbose as some other nationalities
regarding their family and anyone who assisted them.''
</P>
<P>
   INS agents found the 132 men and boys Thursday in a secret
compartment on the Prince Nicolas, a ship registered in Cyprus.
Fischer said the ship had sailed from China around the southern tip
of Africa and docked in Stockholm, Sweden, and Copenhagen, Denmark,
before crossing the Atlantic for Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   He said a ship's officer stayed in Stockholm and told Swedish
authorities about the hidden Chinese. The message was relayed to
the U.S. State Department and an INS office in Rome before the
telephone rang in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. James Hanzalik of the U.S. Coast Guard, which searched
the ship unsuccessfully before the INS became involved, said crew
members ``were pretty evasive'' when questioned. He said the
illegal immigrants were ``pretty frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said he thinks some crew members _ 26 Chinese, a
Lithuanian and a Filipino _ helped smuggle the Chinese. He said
smuggling ships often have an ``enforcer'' aboard to keep
passengers in line.
</P>
<P>
   The INS said Chinese usually pay $30,000 to $50,000 for a trip
to the United States, often living in squalid conditions on voyages
that can take weeks. Organized crime groups in China have been
linked to immigrant smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people weren't just traveling solo,'' Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the INS plans to keep the passengers and crew in custody
until it deports them. Officials will consider any requests for
political asylum, but an INS spokesman said the agency typically
considers Chinese who are being smuggled into this country as
``economic migrants'' ineligible for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at least five lawyers have volunteered to help the
Chinese navigate the legal maze.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Marshall, a retired lawyer who volunteers at an immigration
clinic sponsored by Catholic Social Services in Atlanta, said he
plans to work with some of the 51 boys ages 14-17 who were among
the detainees on the Prince Nicolas. He said he would explain
immigration law, appear in immigration court on their behalf and
answer their questions about the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also has helped some Chinese youngsters detained
after authorities busted a smuggling ring near Guam recently. He
said those teenagers have been in custody in Georgia for at least
four months. Based on their experience, he said, the 132 Chinese
found in Savannah probably will be in custody for several months
until an immigration judge decides their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can take a long time. The INS is just so swamped with all
kinds of work,'' Marshall said. ``This is a very lengthy process.

IOWA GOP GETS IT SAY   IN STRAW POLL 
</HEADLINE>
  ( Eds: will update later with results)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ There were bikers for George W. Bush and bicyclists
for Lamar Alexander. There were church groups for Gary Bauer and
farmers for former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   And there were so many people wearing orange shirts for Steve
Forbes that a campaign supporter suggested they resembled a giant
pack of Reese's Pieces.
</P>
<P>
   This was the quadrennial Iowa Republican straw poll, which
attracted so many voters, candidates and media that it was poised
to live up to the hype _ bigger, louder, and more outrageous than
any before it. Republicans came from across Iowa, using every bus
in the state and many from beyond the borders, to vote for their
favorite candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates gathered on stage Saturday evening to deliver
their speeches inside the Iowa State University basketball arena,
the crowd of more than 15,000 packed inside Hilton Coliseum roared
when the announcer said: ``On this stage is the next president of
the United States!''
</P>
<P>
   Although the contest is nonbinding, the event seemed destined to
have a significant impact on the race, which until now has been
dominated by the story of front-runner Bush. Forbes aides, watching
a long line of supporters seep into the Bush compound, were looking
for the kind of vote that could recast the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message to the lobbyists and politicians is very clear,''
Forbes, who is self-financing most of his campaign, told a cheering
crowd inside his white, air-conditioned tent. ``Their days are
numbered!''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty or so yards away, Bush, fresh from a morning of fishing at
a nearby park, beamed before a large outdoor crowd feasting of
campaign-supplied barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush aides clearly were nervous about the overflow from the
neighboring Forbes site, especially because Bush has repeatedly
raised expectations by saying that he would place a strong first in
the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle launched some of the most direct shots at Bush,
castigating the son of the man who was his running mate in 1988 and
1992. ``The Washington establishment wants to tell you who to vote
for,'' Quayle said. ``They say that issues don't matter. Let's send
them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers appeared overwhelmed by the turnout, which seemed
larger than the 15,000 expected.
</P>
<P>
   Bus after bus wound through the maze of campaign tents, dropping
off new batches of voters. Dozens of people wore the red shirts of
the Alexander campaign. Over there were a sea of yellow shirts, a
sign of support for Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The process turned chaotic Saturday, as thousands of people
could barely move along the concourse where party aides took
ballots and stamped the hands of voters with indelible ink in an
effort to prevent the sort of double-voting that has occurred in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush paid $43,000 for his tent site just outside the
Hilton Coliseum, it was Forbes who put on the most elaborate show.
In addition to the air-conditioned tent, the Forbes campaign looked
after children in a giant ``moon bounce'' machine and erected a
climbing wall.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a former Reagan domestic adviser and head of the
conservative Family Research Council, drew a large following from
church groups, many of which bused in supporters. The Bauer
campaign featured a religious brand of rock, with lyrics such as
``We need to get back to the basics of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, trying to make up for his late
start, brought along Karl Malone, the superstar of the NBA's Utah
Jazz, as well as singer Vic Damone. Quayle, Alexander and Patrick
Buchanan _ all familiar names in Iowa _ were hoping for a big
turnout. Otherwise, their campaigns might in trouble, especially
with fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Radio host Alan Keyes, whose antiabortion views drew sizable
support in the 1995 straw poll, drew strong applause for his attack
on President Clinton.

POLICE ASSOCIATION SPONSORS DEBATE ON RACIAL PROFILING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ When police officials from around the country gathered
here Saturday for a debate on racial profiling, many were surprised
to hear that one side of the issue would be argued by someone with
a white separatist background.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker, Jared Taylor, said at the annual meeting of the
National Association of Police Organizations that law-enforcement
officers were justified in using racial profiling during traffic
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, president of a research organization in Virginia and a
white separatist, said federal statistics showed that a higher
percentage of blacks commit violent crime than whites, and that
officers would be ignoring common sense if they did not take that
into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   That view and Taylor's background were assailed by his debate
opponent, John Crew, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties
Union in San Francisco, who also chided the group for inviting
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can throw away proper cause,'' Crew said of stops,
``then I'm wasting my time here.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling, or the targeting of suspects by race or ethnic
background, has become a highly charged issue in the last few
years, after a rising number of complaints that black motorists
were being pulled over by the police in disproportionate numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., introduced a bill last year that
would have required the police to record the race and ethnicity of
drivers stopped. The bill died.
</P>
<P>
   But after New Jersey Gov. Christie Whitman conceded in April
that some state troopers singled out drivers who were black or
Hispanic for traffic stops and were three times more likely to
search them than white drivers, Conyers reintroduced his bill.
</P>
<P>
   In June, President Clinton ordered federal law enforcement
agencies to compile data on the race and ethnicity of people they
question, search or arrest to determine if certain minorities were
being singled out.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Police Organizations, a nonprofit
group that represents 4,000 law-enforcement unions and
associations, argues that Clinton's directive and Conyers' bill
duplicate federal laws and that the vast majority of officers use
probable cause as the basis for stopping motorists. But the group
offered Taylor and Crew a platform to debate racial profiling as a
component of traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   Crew told the audience that Taylor's approval of racial
profiling was influenced by his long-held white separatist beliefs.
Crew read the audience several excepts of Taylor's writings from
the Web site of the organization he heads, the New Century
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said on the Web site, in part, that whites face ``the
prospect of oblivion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To celebrate diversity, as we are so often urged to do, is
nothing more than to celebrate our own dwindling numbers and
influence,'' he wrote. ``It is utterly unnatural and will,
ultimately, destroy us.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he did not recall writing those exact words, but
added, ``I agree with the sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   He also confirmed that he is a board member of the Council of
Conservative Citizens, a group that includes white supremacists and
received widespread publicity last winter when Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi addressed it.
</P>
<P>
   Crew began his remarks by calling Taylor ``an avowed white
separatist,'' and he chided his hosts by saying, ``inviting an
avowed white separatist here only adds fuel to the fire'' of the
national debate on the targeting of minority motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Robert T. Scully, executive director of the National Association
of Police Organizations, said he was unaware of Taylor's background
when he invited him to debate Crew. Scully said he invited Taylor
to attend after seeing him discuss his views on profiling on
C-Span.
</P>
<P>
   Scully also said the police organization did not subscribe to
Taylor's views.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, did many of those who listened to the debate,
which lasted about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him very offensive,'' said Paul Stewart of the Detroit
Police Officers Association, who is black. ``He was condoning
profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete O'Leary, president of the Suffolk County Detectives
Association on Long Island, a white officer, said: ``His statements
were very inflammatory. They stereotype police officers as racists.
When he was talking, I turned to a colleague of mine and asked him,
`Where's this guy from, the white Aryan Nations?'''

HONOR GLIDE WINS SARATOGA'S SWORD DANCER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ This is what they mean about favorites
and champions walking the gangplank at Saratoga. The 3-5 favorite
to win the $400,000 Sword Dancer Invitational and continue on to
become the country's champion grass horse was Yagli, owned by Allen
Paulson, trained by Bill Mott and ridden by Jerry Bailey, the
people who brought Cigar to his glory.
</P>
<P>
   But it rained heavily Saturday after weeks of drought, the turf
course turned soft, the pace was tantalizingly slow and Yagli
finished seventh and last. In the confusion, the 6-1 shot Honor
Glide won the race by 3\ lengths over Val's Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Yagli had won three straight Grade I stakes this year, and only
two weeks ago won the United Nations Handicap at Monmouth Park. But
Honor Glide, a 5-year-old bay owned by Robert Schaedle and the
Bonnie Heath Farm, had raced only twice this year, both times at
Belmont Park, finishing second in an allowance race in June and
winning the Bowling Green in July.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be thriving under his new trainer, Christophe
Clement, though, and his new jockey, Jose Santos. And he thrived
Saturday in the biggest race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he won the Bowling Green, I said he was very
impressive,'' Clement said, ``and I was pretty sure he would run
well today. The one horse to beat, to me, was obviously Yagli. But
I thought Yagli was vulnerable because I thought it was difficult
to run at that level two weeks apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to run him on a soft turf course, but I was
amazed that the course was `good' to `firm' when I walked it at
2:30. We didn't have enough rain to make it `soft.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey, who leads all jockeys at Saratoga in winners, especially
in stakes races, concluded that the turf seemed softer to Yagli
because he was carrying high weight of 125 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He handled the turf reasonably well,'' Bailey said. ``He
bobbled once going into the first turn. The thing that soft ground
does with 125 pounds, it seems more like 130. Down the backside, I
was ready to start creeping up on them. But he wasn't ready to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, reached back to Cigar for support and added:
``There's only been one horse that I've been around that could win
16 in a row. You've got to give them one bad race, then turn the
page.''
</P>
<P>
   Honor Glide ran the mile and one-half in 2:28 1/5. But Santos
moved Honor Glide into the lead when they turned for home, and he
scored with daylight over Val's Prince, who had another length on
Chorwon. The winner paid $14.60 for a $2 bet to win, and earned
$240,000 for his upset.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The three-day auction at Saratoga this past week showed that the
boom in horse sales is still booming. Prices rose 24 percent, to an
average of $251,456 for the 162 horses sold.

<P>
   Florida State and Tennessee ended the 1998 college football
season by playing for the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl.
If you believe the polls, the same two teams will meet for all the
marbles again, this time in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State and Tennessee were ranked 1-2 when the 1999
preseason Associated Press poll was released Saturday. The poll
receives votes from 70 sportswriters and broadcasters nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State received 48 first-place votes, while Tennessee got
15 and No. 3 Penn State got four. No. 4 Arizona, No. 5 Florida, and
No. 13 Virginia Tech each received one first-place vote.
</P>
<P>
   The first six teams in Saturday's AP poll were the same as the
USA Today/ESPN coaches poll which was released Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech, ACC co-champs with Florida State in 1999, was
ranked 11th, while Georgia was 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, which lost to Tennessee 23-16 in the Fiesta Bowl,
returns 16 starters and 58 lettermen. The Seminoles will be going
for their 13th consecutive season of 10 wins or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were close last year but came up short,'' said coach Bobby
Bowden. ``The good thing is I think the guys are pretty hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   With the return of running back Jamal Lewis and a veteran
offensive line, Tennessee has a good chance of winning its third
straight SEC title and getting back into the national championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has shown a lot of maturity and that's good,'' said
coach Phillip Fulmer. ``We know what it feels like to win a
championship. Now we want to feel that way again.''

 &HT;    Road to College Football
 &HT;    Tennessee turns to power game for '99
 &HT;    One in a series on SEC teams
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE _ When Tennessee opens the 1999 season on Sept. 4
against Wyoming, the Volunteers will be trying to become only the
second team since 1979 to repeat as national champions. They'll try
do it by emulating the last team to win back-to-back titles _ the
University of Nebraska (1994-95).
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Tennessee, which lit up the scoreboard through the
air in the 1990s, is going to turn to smash-mouth football as the
decade draws to a close. Coach Phillip Fulmer and the rest of the
Volunteers can hardly contain their glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' said running back Jamal Lewis, who returns to
the team after missing most of the 1998 season with a knee injury.
``When you look at the running backs we have and our offensive
line, we have to try and pound people. It makes a lot of sense and
we are looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was a very good running team in 1998. Despite the loss
of Lewis, who missed the last nine games, the Volunteers led the
SEC in rushing, averaging 211.3 yards per game. That was 35 yards a
game better than any other team in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent visit to campus revealed several reasons why
Tennessee should be good enough to grind it out even more against
SEC opponents in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   _ An offensive line that could be Tennessee's best ever. There
are two strong All-America candidates in guard Cosey Coleman (6
feet 5, 315) and tackle Chad Clifton (6-6, 320). There are two
other strong veterans in center Spencer Riley (6-3, 295) and tackle
Josh Tucker (6-4, 305). Sophomore Fred Weary (6-4, 290) was moved
over from defense and is pushing junior Toby Champion (6-4, 305)
for a starting guard spot. This is also the second year for this
group under offensive line coach Mike Barry, one of the best in the
business.
</P>
<P>
   _ The deepest backfield in the SEC. Lewis ran for 477 yards on
just 73 carries (6.8 avg.) before hurting the knee against Auburn.
In his place, sophomores Travis Henry and Travis Stephens combined
for 1,447 yards on 283 carries (5.1 avg.) All three players have
rushed for more than 100 yards in an SEC game.
</P>
<P>
   _ The team's overall improvement in the areas of strength and
conditioning. All but a couple of players stayed in Knoxville this
summer and went through a grueling weight-training program. Lewis
is in the best shape of his life at 225 pounds with significantly
more muscle. Clifton is a rock-solid 320. Even quarterback Tee
Martin has gotten stronger, setting a school record for
quarterbacks when he bench pressed 405 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be a smash mouth team,'' said Martin, the senior
from Mobile. ``Just about every guy on the offense is bigger,
faster, and stronger than he was a year ago. With Jamal coming back
we're even better. We should have a lot of confidence in our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason why Tennessee has chosen to bulk up and get
physical.
</P>
<P>
   If this team is going to win its third consecutive SEC
championship, it will need victories in three very difficult road
games at Florida, Alabama, and Arkansas. A team that can control
the ball and take the crowd out of the game has a better chance of
wearing down the opponent and winning in a hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like a few finishes that weren't so
close,'' said Fulmer. ``It would keep us all from aging so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think Fulmer, the old offensive lineman, is looking
forward to fielding this kind of team, you'd be right. His 1997
team faced Nebraska's national champions in the Orange Bowl and got
its doors blown off, 42-17. Since then, Fulmer has wondered what it
would be like to have a team that could physically overpower people
like Nebraska did when it won three national championships (1994,
'95, '97) in four years. This season he may find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a chance to be that kind of football team and
if you're going to emulate somebody, Nebraska's not a bad place to
start,'' said Fulmer. ``There is a reason why they are the only
team in 20 years to repeat as national champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people who are saying that about us are right.
We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we will.

<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ For seven years in the 1970s, Michael
Gallagher, a Catholic, and Stanley McCombe, a Protestant, lived
next door to each other, friendly but not really friends.
</P>
<P>
   They occupied a familiar patch in Northern Ireland where most
Catholics and Protestants are civil to one another but are still
distant, separated by national identity and segregated by school
and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drifted apart,'' Gallagher recalled, ``but tragedy reunited
us.''
</P>
<P>
   One year ago &UR;  &LR; Sunday at 3:10 p.m., a car bomb planted by Irish
republicans opposed to the peace process exploded in the center of
this County Tyrone town as it was crammed with back-to-school
shoppers. The bomb killed 29 people and injured 382.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were Gallagher's 21-year-old son, Adrian, who had
gone into town to buy a pair of jeans, and McCombe's 49-year-old
wife, Ann, who worked in a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Now Michael Gallagher and Stanley McCombe are close friends,
relying on each other to get through ``the bad days,'' when
memories and the sense of loss overwhelm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had that much in common,'' McCombe said. ``We've
become very good friends. We feed off each other, for strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship, and their vocal advocacy for those killed and
injured by the bomb, captures both the vulnerability of people here
and their determination to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Their mutual dependency is also something of a metaphor. The
first anniversary of the worst atrocity in Northern Ireland
coincides with a stagnant peace process, increasing violence on the
fringes, and a creeping sense that the progress of the last few
years is threatened by inertia, intransigence, and extremists who,
like those who planted the bomb here, are determined to exploit the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   As Gallagher put it, ``We have to stand together, or we'll all
fall.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of the bombers' goals was to drive a wedge through Omagh,
where about 65 percent of the 25,000 residents are Catholic and 35
percent Protestant, it hasn't worked. A study carried out by David
Clarke, a professor at the University of Oxford, found people felt
closer as a town since the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   David Bolton, the director of social work at The Bridge Center,
a counseling unit set up after the bombing, said his counselors
have found similar signs of solidarity and an absence of blaming
the Catholic community for the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was potentially divisive because militant republicans did
it. But people are holding together,'' Bolton said.
</P>
<P>
   While most atrocities in Northern Ireland have tended to
victimize one side or the other _ Protestant unionists who want to
remain British citizens or Catholic nationalists who aspire to
unity with the Irish Republic _ the Omagh bomb was remarkably
indiscriminate. Its victims included those from both religions, of
all shades of political opinion, some who were apolitical, and two
visitors from Spain, the only tourists ever killed here in the
Troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims were six children age 12 or younger, six
teenagers, and two unborn twins of Avril Monaghan, who was killed
alongside her 1-year-old daughter, Maura, and her mother, Mary
Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   The forlorn figure of Michael Monaghan is a reminder of the
devastation wreaked on so many families, none more than his.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife gone, Monaghan is raising his three surviving
children alone. ``Avril has three,'' he told a friend recently,
``and I have three.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of heroic stories here. Michelle Mimnagh, a
teenager who lost her right leg in the explosion, learned how to
ski over the winter and walks the town with a newly fitted
artificial limb.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the outward displays of strength, this is a
wounded place. Like the mist that often shrouds Omagh on winter
mornings, sadness hangs over the town.
</P>
<P>
   So does frustration. Aside from the arrest of an allegedly
peripheral player, the biggest cross-border manhunt ever in Ireland
has failed to result in charges against the bombers even though
many people seem to believe they know who was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Locals bitterly resent that the bombers have been able to recast
the town's identity for the outside world _ that Omagh is now known
as the place where the worst atrocity in 30 years of the Troubles
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want to move on, but there are others who are
still hurting,'' said Bolton, who believes more people than the 470
his team has counseled need help.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Byrne, who was elected to represent Omagh in the Northern
Ireland Assembly, said the town ``is still subdued.'' Many people
were dreading Sunday's memorial service, fearful of the memories
that will be dredged up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People go into town, do their business, and get out,'' he
said. ``There's less conversation on the street. A lot of people
have this sense of unease.''
</P>
<P>
   The unease is exacerbated by the political stalemate that led to
the assembly's suspension last month. Gallagher said many of those
whose loved ones were killed took some consolation from the fact
that the bomb seemed to make more people more determined to see the
peace process succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is stalled because unionists refuse to form a
power-sharing government with nationalists until the Irish
Republican Army begins disarming. Many here believe the IRA missed
a golden opportunity to make a token gesture just after the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the time to do it, and we would be well beyond this
impasse,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton said the political stalemate is feeding anxiety, and that
a collapse of the cease-fires by the main paramilitary groups would
cause a relapse for many here who have been treated for stress and
depression. He said there has been an increase in suicides in the
area, but it was too early to determine whether that trend is
because of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As he drew hard on one of the cigarettes that have become his
constant companions, 51-year-old Stanley McCombe said he often
finds it hard to not be consumed by his grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life's over,'' he said, sitting in the small office where
he and Gallagher run the Omagh Support and Self-Help Group. Before
the bombing, ``I took early retirement, for a better future with
Ann. Now there's no future. There's only tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He worries for his sons, Clive, 23, and Colin, 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clive is very unsettled. He's taken three different jobs this
year. Colin's gone back to work, but there are days when he can't
be bothered,'' he said. ``The boys don't say an awful lot. When
Colin talks about it, he gets angry.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombe said he constantly battles his emotions. One day, while
driving, he saw Francis Mackey, leader of the political wing of the
group that carried out the bombing. He said he had to resist an
urge to run Mackey down.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher seems less susceptible to fits of anger, but says it
is a conscious effort not to give in to darker impulses. He and his
son ran a garage together. But he quit that to devote his time to
representing the interests of the families who were bereaved. All
but a few of the families have come together, determined that they
will control the memory of their loved ones. Those who chose not to
get involved are too hurt to emerge from their seclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was important to come together,'' Gallagher said.
``The people who planted the bomb did so cynically, to destroy the
peace process and split the town. We won't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the families have been buoyed by the support they have
received from people in Ireland, Britain, and abroad. But he says
Omagh residents are upset by the inability of the police to arrest
the perpetrators and by the compensation process that forces them
to argue for the monetary worth of their loved ones' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a degrading process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watterson's clothing store in the town center used to be a
bubbly place, in large part due to the presence of salesladies like
Ann McCombe and Geraldine Breslin. They chatted up customers and
traded jokes.
</P>
<P>
   When the bomb threat was phoned into police, most of the two
dozen employees at Watterson's were evacuated to the rear of the
store. But McCombe and Breslin stayed behind to help a woman with a
baby carriage down some stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers at the front of the store shepherded the women,
and two other employees returning from lunch, Veda Short and Doreen
Preston, down the street. Because of inaccurate information called
in by the bombers, the police unwittingly brought them and dozens
of others to stand next to the car that held the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   McCombe, Breslin, and Short were killed. Preston lost a leg and
part of her hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the bomb, Watterson couldn't imagine
reopening the shop his father founded in 1938 and that he has run
for 35 years. But customers insisted he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never be the same,'' Watterson said. ``But we've
surprised ourselves. We've struggled through and keep going. Like
the town itself.''

 &HT;    Surprise Said glad to have front-row seat
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ In this Dale Jarrett-dominated,
what's-happened-to-Jeff Gordon Winston Cup season, the front row
for today's Frontier at the Glen is a breath of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace is on the pole because he didn't let the newly
poured concrete strips in the turns at Watkins Glen International
psyche him out as it did other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Said, who drives road courses and in trucks, is on the
outside pole because quirky things, like an outsider crashing the
party, happen occasionally in stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who has a commanding 274-point lead on Mark Martin,
starts ninth. Gordon, who is 507 points behind Jarrett but who has
won the last four Cup road races, starts third.
</P>
<P>
   But the front row pairing of Wallace and Said typifies this
peculiar weekend at the Glen: Saturday morning's second-round
qualifying was washed out by rain and an afternoon practice was
canceled after thick fog enveloped the area.
</P>
<P>
   Similar weather conditions this afternoon would be a problem.
The Cup cars have rain tires but not fog lights.
</P>
<P>
   That could spoil an otherwise wonderful birthday weekend for
Wallace, who turned 43 Saturday. He won this race in 1987 and 1989.
He finished fourth last year after taking the lead with 10 laps to
go in the 220.5-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, he broke the track record with a qualifying lap
of 121.234 mph to take the pole.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was concerned about the track after hearing other
drivers worrying about the concrete strips Watkins Glen added in
the corners because the asphalt was breaking up. Then he remembered
he likes concrete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been talking about the concrete and I was a
little spooked by it,'' Wallace said, ``but it's got a lot of grip
out there. I love it. It reminds me of Bristol and Dover. And I
kind of like those ol' race tracks. I love concrete. You hit the
concrete here and you get more grip, and I like it a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Said, driving the No. 14 Ford co-owned by Ernie Irvan (who
starts 36th in the No. 36 Pontiac) is thrilled to be in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second to those guys might not mean much, but to be a rookie
team with a rookie driver it sure means a lot,'' Said said. ``But I
do have a lot of experience here. My driving style is to go wide
upen into every turn and I had to restrain myself (Friday) to get
one good lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Said has two career starts at the Glen, both last year. He put
Jimmy Spencer's Busch car on the pole and qualifed Spencer's Cup
car fifth. ``All kinds of people have come up to me and said
`you're a road racer, you'll kick their butt.' '' he said. ``And
I'm like, these guys are all great road racers. I don't think that
I have an advantage. I just don't have a disadvantage like I do on
an oval.''
</P>
<P>
   FRONTIER AT THE GLEN
</P>
<P>
   When: 12:30 p.m., today.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Watkins Glen International at Watkins Glen, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   TV: ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champ: Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline: Jeff Gordon's reign as master of NASCAR's road
courses is in jeopardy. He has won the last four Winston Cup races,
three straight from the pole. He starts third today, behind
pole-sitter Rusty Wallace and road course veteran Boris Said.

 &HT;    Young guns aim at history
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ So much for the old guard. They've moved out of
the way at the 81st PGA Championship and back to reality. Led by
the always-dominant presence of Tiger Woods, there's a lineup of
young guns ready to shoot it out today at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 23, and Canada's Mike Weir, 29, are tied for the lead at
11-under-par 205. Two shots back at 9-under 207 are former Georgia
Tech player Stewart Cink, 26, of Duluth and Spain's 19-year-old
Sergio Garcia. All but Woods, the 1997 Masters champion, are in the
hunt for their first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go out there and think about what those other guys are
shooting,'' said Cink, who shot 4-under 68 Saturday under blue-sky,
low-humidity conditions in the Chicago suburbs. ``I'm just going to
dig down deep coming down the stretch and try to finish as high as
I can. I've been close in a few U.S. Opens. I know how to act and
what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who started the day two shots off the lead, also shot a
68, storming into contention with three straight birdies (Nos. 5, 6
and 7) _ highlighted by a 50-footer from way off the fringe at the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Eagling the 14th hole and then making a 6-footer at 18 to hold
his share of the lead, Weir is trying to become only the second
left-hander to win a major.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who opened with a 66 Thursday then slipped to a 73,
rooted home putts with a pump of his fist during a 68.
</P>
<P>
   There's a $630,000 first prize available today plus Ryder Cup
considerations. Garcia, 12th on the European standings, most likely
already has secured at least a captain's selection.
</P>
<P>
   Eight times Woods has owned the 54-hole lead since turning pro
in 1996 and seven times he has prevailed. It's a seven-event
streak, since losing to Ed Fiori in the 1996 Quad City Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who bested Weir in the final round of the Western Open,
has only once before led a major championship after three rounds _
the 1997 Masters, where he won by 12 shots.
</P>
<P>
   For the elder contenders it was a long day. Second-round leader
Jay Haas, 45, who started at 9-under, slipped to a 75 and five
shots behind Woods and Weir.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin, 54, who shocked everyone with rounds of 70-69,
three-putted the first hole for bogey on the way to a 78.

HIGH NOON FOR THE SHERIFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; It was well past bedtime, but this was not pillow talk.
</P>
<P>
   The phone lines were raging on the Dodgers' postgame show as
Ross Porter played host with a whip and a chair. The fans had
snacked on Raul Mondesi throughout Friday's 7-3 loss to Atlanta and
now it was Kevin Malone's turn.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk were desperate to learn how this Dodgers mess can
all be undone, the bad attitudes and finger-pointing, the
multi-year contracts and lousy ERAs.
</P>
<P>
   As the calls Ping-Ponged from Van Nuys and Santa Ana and Malibu,
the anger began to shift from Mondesi's midweek tirade to a much
bigger theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want my kids to be Dodger fans the way I was,'' one
caller said. ``That isn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone's task is daunting, but if he is the one to lead this
club out of this mess, he'd better get cracking. This winter, he
will be the most important name in L.A. sports. Bigger than Shaq
and Kobe, bigger than Michael Eisner or Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   At some point he'll have to call some general manager and say,
``You know, Carlos Perez just wasn't a good fit in L.A., but a
change of scenery is all he needs. All you need to do is pick up
the final $12 million on his contract and you can pencil in 240
innings next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Gary Sheffield? Yeah, he threatened to retire and demanded
to be traded, but it's just because he wants to win so badly. He's
a steal at $39.5 million and just think how he'll bond with your
fans during the next four years. I'm telling you, those 85 RBI are
as guaranteed as the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   And it will have to be done with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The perception now is that Malone will make the calls, but he
won't make the CALL. Fox hasn't decided how many salaries it will
eat in the name of progress. That will be the first step. Getting
Malone to stop saying he inherited all the problems is second.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need to budget another Kevin Brown, free-agent
contract and use the money to help loosen the burden. For the same
$15 million they'll annually give Brown over the next six years,
they can unburden themselves of the Eric Young, Eric Karros and
Todd Hundley salaries for the year 2000. Or Mondesi and Perez. Or
Sheffield and Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   Any combination will help.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone needs to set the tone and that hasn't happened. Last
spring an off-handed ``There's a new sheriff in town'' brought
giggles to the rest of baseball. The Dodgers' brutal season has
turned those giggles into roars of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he did not meet with Mondesi, saying he hoped his
troubled right fielder would someday apologize personally for all
the expletives that appeared in Thursday's sports section.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson got his meeting out of the way and claims
he has moved on. Sadly, Johnson looks in Mondesi's eyes and sees a
lot of Darryl Strawberry. But the fact that Malone and Johnson did
not sit down with Mondesi together and settle the dispute could
have long-term implications.
</P>
<P>
   Malone talks about needing the team on the same page, but by
taking a different approach to Mondesi, the bigger question is
whether the manager and GM are even in this together.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about the players Tom Lasorda and Fred Claire
let slip away, they confronted player issues as one. They weren't
very fond of each other: Lasorda because Claire got the job he
wanted, Claire because of the Lasorda bombast that so enthralled
Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   But together they left a big mark on baseball. Claire got Kirk
Gibson for 1988, which led to Lasorda's second World Series title
and his ticket to the Hall of Fame. Lasorda pushed every right
button and molded a champion from a team that was at least as
splintered as this bunch.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in part because the kids in the clubhouse couldn't
play one parent against the other.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see that now. The impression is that if Johnson really
wants a player he can go over Malone's head and straight to Fox. It
is certain that Rick Welts, Fox's new man at Dodger Stadium, has
been taking notes the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was Fox's hire, not Malone's, who was jilted by Felipe
Alou. Johnson is far more mellow than he was during his heyday with
the New York Mets and the approach has not clicked with his new
team.
</P>
<P>
   Malone has to get through all that and finally make this his
team. He can't agree with Gene from Redondo that Hundley has no arm
but a lot of guts.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been almost midnight on the airwaves Friday, but
it is high noon for the sheriff. &QL; 
NATIONAL LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers mess has masked the fact that most of the rest of
the NL West is playing terribly. The San Francisco Giants are
fading, the San Diego Padres lost 17 of 20 and suddenly were being
pushed by the Dodgers for third place.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks entered the weekend 17-4 since July 19,
a better record than any team in baseball. Only the Cleveland
Indians have a bigger division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anybody that can beat us right now, to tell you
the truth,'' Arizona catcher Damian Miller said. ``We're playing
that good a baseball. It's only the middle of August, but it's
awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   The big lead will help the Diamondbacks get healthy before the
playoffs. Center fielder Steve Finley and leadoff hitter Tony
Womack recently missed games with injuries. Todd Stottlemyre, out
two months with shoulder trouble, is expected back next weekend in
Pittsburgh. &QL; 
__ Wild, wild card
</P>
<P>
   In two of the three full seasons since wild-card teams were
added to baseball's playoffs, amassing 90 victories _ a .556
winning percentage _ was enough for clubs to capture a league's
extra postseason berth. But with Atlanta, New York, Houston and
Cincinnati hovering at or near .600, Reds manager Jack McKeon
doubts that 90 wins will be enough to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said that playing .500 for the rest of the season _ which
would give Cincinnati 91 victories _ won't do. The Dodgers (90-72)
won the wild card in 1996, followed by Florida (92-70) in 1997.
Chicago (90-73) won it last year after a one-game playoff with San
Francisco. &QL; 
__ Poor Sammy
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa entered this weekend's series against the Cardinals
at Wrigley Field just 3 for his last 28, with one homer in his last
eight games. Although there is a natural boost in any showdown with
Mark McGwire, Sosa has little else to think about with the Cubs so
far out.
</P>
<P>
   His defense has been terrible this year, with six errors and
many misplays. The Cubs have to get Sosa out of center, where he
has played more games this season than any year since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation doesn't look good,'' Sosa said. ``But it's not
going to stop me from what I need to do. I'll continue doing my
job.'' &QL; 
__ Welcome home
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, four outs away from providing a nice homecoming for
former Marlin Livan Hernandez, suffered their most-devastating loss
of the season on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez took a shutout into the eighth, then talked manager
Dusty Baker into letting him pitch the inning. Hernandez loaded the
bases with two out and Baker went to John Johnstone, who allowed a
grand slam to Mike Lowell, tying the game at 4-4. The Giants lost
5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Baker blamed himself, but it was a stinging loss for Hernandez.
He bolted out of the clubhouse moments after the game ended, with
two Spanish television stations in full pursuit. He sat alone in
his Range Rover in the players' parking lot for about 10 minutes
before leaving. &QL; 
__ Not just Drew
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of subplots in J.D. Drew's first visit to
Philadelphia, the place where he refused to sign two years ago.
Drew obviously drew the most attention, including boos and
batteries hurled from the stands on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But in that game, former Cardinal Ron Gant, who insinuated in
spring training that St. Louis manager Tony La Russa was racist,
won it for the Phils with a three-run double off Ricky Bottalico,
an ex-Philly.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game of the series, the Phillies were beaten 5-1 by
another former teammate, Garrett Stephenson, whose work habits were
questioned by staff ace Curt Schilling early last season.
Stephenson pitched the way he did two years ago when he beat the
Cardinals and struck out 12 in his first major-league start.
</P>
<P>
   He retired 14 straight at one point and allowed just a solo home
run _ to Gant. &QL; 
AMERICAN LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   Good teams don't bicker, especially the New York Yankees, which
is why a little dissension last weekend in Seattle was so
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   It came during a bench-clearing brawl with the Mariners when
several Yankees became angered that Derek Jeter stood on the side
and clowned around with his buddy, Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis, in particular, took offense to Jeter's
light-hearted approach and confronted him. Not once but twice. The
first time was on the field. The second time was in the clubhouse.
Jeter tried to walk away, but Curtis persisted.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be interesting to see if Curtis' oral attack on Jeter
costs him his roster spot in two weeks, when Darryl Strawberry is
scheduled to return from Triple-A Columbus. &QL; 
__ Hot and hotter
</P>
<P>
   With a comfortable lead in the West, the Texas Rangers' only
battle is with the elements. Thursday, the Rangers finished a
13-game homestand during which the average nightly temperature was
98 degrees. One day it reached 106.
</P>
<P>
   The most concern is for catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who has made 99
starts, most by any catcher in the league. Before this year,
Rodriguez batted .317 in his career before the All-Star break and
.272 afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez, who didn't start Thursday, was hitting .405 with
seven homers and 21 RBI in 25 games since the All-Star break.
Rodriguez attributed some of that to honoring the club's request
not to play winter ball last offseason. &QL; 
__ Rhodes less traveled
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have cooled on a long-term extension with
left-handed reliever Arthur Rhodes, creating the possibility that
Rhodes will explore free agency at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like a four-year, $16 million deal, but it seems highly
unlikely that anyone will give him that to be a middle reliever.
The only way he gets that type of money is if a team wants to use
him as a co-closer/setup guy or convert him back into a starting
pitcher. Trouble is, he never had much success as a starter and he
seldom throws more than two games in a row because of arm and knee
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Rhodes ends up in New York as a free
agent, setting up Mariano Rivera. The Yankees attempted to acquire
him before the waiver deadline. &QL; 
__ Wright is all wrong
</P>
<P>
   This has turned into a lost season for Indians pitcher Jaret
Wright, whose spot in the postseason rotation is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   First he had to deal with a headhunter label after an incident
with Detroit and then he changed his mechanics under the advice of
pitching coach Phil Regan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wright is back on the DL for the second time since the
All-Star break, having upset manager Mike Hargrove twice by not
telling him about pain in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Wright came off the DL on Aug. 3 and threw 42/3 innings against
the Red Sox. He started again last Sunday against Tampa Bay and was
gone before getting an out in the third. Wright usually throws his
fastball between 92-95 mph but was hitting only 85-89. &QL; 
__ Power outage
</P>
<P>
   Barring a late rush, Frank Thomas will see his power numbers
drop for a third consecutive season. He hit 40 homers in 1996, 35
in '97, 29 in '98 and has 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad enough that the White Sox dropped seven consecutive
games entering the weekend, but manager Jerry Manuel is having
trouble convincing Thomas not to become a full-time DH. Manuel
feels Thomas has trouble staying in the game when he is not playing
first and the numbers back it up. From 1996-98, Thomas hit .352 at
first; .274 at DH. This year he's hitting .346 at first and .286 at
DH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank has convinced himself that he can't play first, so what
used to be his greatest asset _ his will _ is sort of an enemy
now,'' Manuel said. &QL;

IT'S DOG DAYS OF SUMMER, SO BULLDOG PIAZZA GETS HOT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mike Piazza had been struggling coming into this
series, and he was back to being booed at home earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza knew the feeling well. But he may have seemed unfazed by
all the fuss because it was about this time last season that he
began to heat up after a summer full of boos at Shea Stadium. And
if the last few days are any indication, Piazza is about to explode
again.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon at 3Com Park, Piazza had four hits to tie his
career high and give him 10 hits in the last three games. The
All-Star catcher also hit his 25th homer of the season, one day
after belting No. 24 at the lame-duck park formerly known as
Candlestick. Saturday's two-run shot ignited a five-run rally in
the fourth inning as the Mets blew past the San Francisco Giants,
6-1, on a windy day on the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets (71-47) had dropped out of first place on Friday night,
falling a game behind Atlanta, and the victory edged them closer to
the Braves, who had a late game in Los Angeles. But the better news
might be that Piazza _ who batted .361 in the final two months of
last season with 14 homers and 52 runs batted in _ finally seems
poised to once again strap the team on his back.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, Piazza has some help this time.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the last month and a half of last season, Piazza
carried the Mets offensively as they drove toward their first
post-season berth since 1988, a goal they fell a game short of.
This season, however, with their revamped offense, the Mets have
not had to depend so much on Piazza's bat.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his two home runs in the last two days, Piazza still
does not lead the team. (Ventura has 26.) Until Wednesday, when he
caught up with Edgardo Alfonzo, Piazza was not even second on the
team in runs batted in. (He now has 83; Ventura leads the club with
93.)
</P>
<P>
   But Manager Bobby Valentine has never seemed worried, even as he
watched Piazza struggling with his swing the last couple of months.
And Piazza seems to have found his timing again, at just the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   His home run Saturday off Kirk Rueter (10-7), came after a walk
to John Olerud. Even with the wind blowing hard from left to right,
the ball cut through the jet stream and sailed into the left-field
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter, who had breezed through the first three innings, never
recovered. Ventura doubled to right, and then Benny Agbayani hit a
run-scoring double, the first of his three hits. Agbayani moved to
third on a Luis Lopez groundout. One pitch later, Agbayani scored
on a perfectly executed suicide squeeze by Rey Ordonez, whose bunt
was so well placed up the first-base line that Rueter could not
field it and Ordonez was safe at first with an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez moved to second on an Orel Hershiser groundout and then
scored on the third of Rickey Henderson's four hits on the day as
the Mets batted around, taking a 5-1 lead. Piazza's single during a
fifth-inning rally set up Agbayani's second run-scoring double of
the afternoon for the Mets' sixth run.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser (12-9), seeing the Dodgers for the first time since he
pitched for them last season, departed after six innings with the
Mets ahead, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza grounded out meekly in the eighth, the only blemish on a
4-for-5 day. Piazza had four hits in a game for the 16th time in
his career, and in his last three games he was 10 for 14 with two
homers, a double, three runs scored and five runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   And to think the fans at Shea were booing him on Tuesday. The
crowd here Saturday certainly was. The former Dodger probably felt
right at home.

PEE WEE REESE, 81, HALL OF FAME SHORT STOP FOR THE DODGERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pee Wee Reese, the Hall of Fame shortstop and hugely popular
captain of the Brooklyn Dodgers in their glory years of the 1950s,
died Saturday. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers confirmed Reese's death, but the cause
was not immediately announced. He had undergone radiation treatment
for lung cancer in 1997, after surgery to remove a malignant tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Reese was a superb fielder and an outstanding base runner; he
exceeded the 2,000-hit mark and he was a nine-time All-Star. But
Reese was remembered as much for attributes that transcended box
scores.
</P>
<P>
   His plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame, where he was inducted
in 1984, cites his ``intangible qualities'' of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Reese was indeed a presence, despite a modest frame and a
nickname that suggested perpetual boyishness. He gained the
nickname when he won a tournament shooting ``pee wee'' marbles
while growing up in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   He befriended Jackie Robinson when Robinson broke baseball's
color barrier in 1947, easing his acceptance among Dodger teammates
while standing up for him in the face of opposing teams' racial
taunts.
</P>
<P>
   And Reese was the leader of a club with a formidable array of
stars _ the likes of Robinson, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges, Roy
Campanella and Carl Furillo, the power hitters who would be
remembered with Reese as the Boys of Summer.
</P>
<P>
   Reese wore No. 1, and that was how his teammates saw him.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Reese was inducted into the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, Campanella observed: ``He was the leader of the team.
Everyone would look up to Pee Wee.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Carl Erskine said, ``Pee Wee was a senior _ the rest of
us were freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Henry Reese was born on July 23, 1918, in Ekron, Ky.,
some 45 miles south of Louisville, the son of a railroad detective.
</P>
<P>
   He was all of 5 feet 9 inches and 140 pounds when he began his
professional baseball career with the Louisville Colonels of the
American Association in 1938. Yet he was impressive at shortstop,
and the Boston Red Sox later bought into the minor league team to
insure the rights to Reese. But the Boston manager, Joe Cronin,
also happened to be the team's shortstop and was not ready to quit.
So Reese was sold to the Dodgers for a reported $40,000 after his
second year at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Reese was brought up by Brooklyn in 1940, envisioned as the
successor at shortstop to the Dodgers' manager, Leo Durocher. He
was sidelined for much of his rookie season by a beaning and a
broken heel, but in 1941 Reese became a regular, teaming with
outfielder Pete Reiser for a youthful spark on an otherwise veteran
team that captured the Dodgers' first pennant in 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   Reese enlisted in the Navy after the 1942 season, and played
baseball on naval teams in Virginia and the Pacific. When he
returned for the 1946 season, a new era was emerging in baseball,
and now he faced an unexpected test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aboard ship, coming back from Guam,'' he remembered.
``Someone on the ship knew who I was. He told me: `Pee Wee, the
Dodgers signed a black.' And I kind of laughed about it. I said:
`You gotta be kidding. They wouldn't sign a black.' They always
said the blacks couldn't play under pressure; things got hot, they
would fold up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe an hour or two later, he came back and told me _ this
same kid _ said he was not only a black, but he was a shortstop.
Now, then, he caught my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Robinson joined the Dodgers two years later, Reese set
a tone of tolerance. When another Southerner on the Dodgers, Dixie
Walker, instigated a petition against Robinson, Reese refused to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   As Snider recalled: ``One time in Boston early in that rookie
season, some of the Braves players began to heckle Pee Wee being a
Southerner and playing ball with a Negro. Pee Wee didn't answer
them or even look at them. He just walked over to Jackie and put
his hand on his shoulder and began to talk to him. That shut the
Braves right up.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Reese said: ``I wasn't trying to think of myself as
being the Great White Father. It didn't matter to me whether he was
black or green, he had a right to be there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing at first base as a rookie, Robinson shifted to
second, combining with Reese for a superb double-play combination
in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Reese would be enveloped in the fans' debates that punctuated
the golden age of New York baseball. Alongside arguments among the
worshipers of the center fielders Snider, Mickey Mantle and Willie
Mays would be the disputes over who had the better shortstop _ the
Dodgers with Reese, the Yankees with Phil Rizzuto or the Giants
with Alvin Dark.
</P>
<P>
   The 1955 season would be the sweetest one for Reese.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, the eve of his 37th birthday, he was accorded the
grandest tribute ever orchestrated for a Brooklyn player: Pee Wee
Reese Night. In a pre-game ceremony lasting 50 minutes, Reese
received gifts including a deep freeze with 200 pounds of food
ranging from hot dogs to shrimp. Seven different autos were driven
onto the field and his 11-year-old daughter, Barbara, reached into
a fishbowl and picked out one of seven ignition keys. (It fit the
Chevrolet.) President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President
Richard M. Nixon sent best wishes. And in the middle of the fifth
inning, two huge birthday cakes were wheeled onto the field. The
lights were dimmed and the 33,003 fans struck matches or cigarette
lighters, then stood and sang ``Happy Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate satisfaction came on Oct. 4, 1955, at Yankee
Stadium _ Game 7 of the World Series. At 3:43 p.m., the Yanks'
Elston Howard hit a grounder to shortstop. Reese scooped it up and
fired to Hodges. The Dodgers had a 2-0 victory and their first
World Series title. After suffering through five World Series
defeats at the hands of the Yankees, the captain had made the play
that sealed a championship.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers left Brooklyn after the 1957 season, Reese went
along to Los Angeles. He played one season there, then retired with
2,170 hits, 232 stolen bases (for teams that had little need to
run) and a career average of .269 over 16 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Flags were flown at half-staff at Dodger Stadium for Saturday
night's game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Reese served as a Dodger coach in 1959, then did baseball
telecasts for CBS and NBC. The man also known as the Little Colonel
later worked for Hillerich &AMP; Bradsby, manufacturers of Louisville
Sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century after he last led his teammates out of the
Ebbets Field dugout for the start of a game, Reese reflected on how
he still retained the admiration of the old Dodgers. He observed:
``Most of the players that are still alive to this day call me
captain.''

WOODS LETS THE CHIPS FLY, SEIZING A SHARE OF THE LEAD 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Tiger Woods drew the loudest roars Saturday at
the PGA Championship, but Mike Weir gained the most respect.
</P>
<P>
   Battling head to head for the second time this summer, but this
time for a major championship, Woods and Weir shared the lead
heading into Sunday's compelling final round. Woods and Weir were
11 under par for the tournament (205), two strokes ahead of Stewart
Cink and 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, who were tied for third place
at nine under.
</P>
<P>
   Those four players separated themselves from the field, but four
others were tied at six under par and remained in the hunt _ Nick
Price, Jim Furyk, the second-round leader Jay Haas and Skip
Kendall. But Woods, who shot a 68 Saturday, and Weir, who shot a
69, will start Sunday at Medinah Country Club as the front-runners,
paired together in the final group, as they were last month at the
Motorola Western Open, which Woods won by three strokes.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday will not be the Western Open. The atmosphere will be
more intense, the pressure will be higher and the reward will be
greater. For Woods, it will be a chance to win his second major at
age 23, a chance to silence those who have wondered when he will
win his next major. For Weir, a 29-year-old native of Canada, it
will be a chance to change his life, to win one of golf's most
coveted prizes against the game's most celebrated player.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday, Woods will be the favorite, and he seemed
comfortable with both his game and his position. ``I've learned
from my mistakes and my successes,'' he said. ``I'm ready, but I
need to play my own game. The guys at nine under par are right in
it, and the guys at six under could also win it with a great round.
So I have to take care of my own business before I start worrying
about trying to win my second major.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weir will benefit from his head-to-head battle with
Woods in July at the Western. Woods started that day with a
four-stroke lead, but Weir cut it to one stroke before Woods
prevailed. Weir showed he was not intimidated by Woods that day,
and he proved Saturday that he was not intimidated by his first PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   How many people think Weir will prevail? As long as Weir
believes, he has a chance. ``Tiger's a great player, but playing
with him in the last group before will be beneficial,'' said Weir,
who chipped in from 30 yards for eagle at No. 14, made a 20-footer
for birdie at No. 17, then made an eight-foot par-saving putt at
No. 18 after hitting his approach shot into the bunker. ``I know
I'm going to be nervous, but I have to settle down and play my
game, just like I did today, to give myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Saturday, it appeared Woods might take control, as
he made consecutive birdies at Nos. 5, 6 and 7 to reach 10 under
par and tie Weir. Woods took the lead with a birdie putt at No. 11,
hitting a beautiful approach shot to within three feet for an easy
putt.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vintage run by Woods, and the electricity could be felt
in the gallery. When Woods begins surging up the leader board, the
atmosphere resembles a train pulling into a subway station. The
closer he gets to the lead, the louder the sound becomes, as does
the commotion in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was enough to unnerve his playing partner, Lee
Westwood, who shot a 74 and fell to four under par, shooting
himself out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing good about shooting a 74 is that I don't have
to play with him tomorrow,'' Westwood said of Woods.
</P>
<P>
   But just when it looked as if Woods might pull away, he cooled
off. He bogeyed No. 13, missing a five-foot par putt, although he
came back to make a spectacular birdie at No. 14, hitting a great
bunker shot from 35 feet that nearly went into the hole for an
eagle. When the ball barely slid past the cup, Woods covered his
face in anguish, not wanting to believe that the ball stayed out.
Woods tapped in for the easy birdie, but he made pars the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weir's eagle at No. 14 moved him from eight under par
to 10 under and set the tone for his surge into a tie for the lead.
Weir floated a delicate shot over a greenside bunker, rolled the
ball toward the pin, then heard the gallery roar as the ball fell
into the hole. He raised his arms in celebration, and it was the
clearest signal of the day that he had no intention of folding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Weir said. ``I had played great up to that
time, but I was only even par. To get an eagle in that situation
can really change your day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive performance by Weir, a 29-year-old native
of Canada, who is one of only six left-handed players on the PGA
Tour. While Haas, who started the day with a two-stroke lead,
struggled to a 75, Weir was steady, calm and determined.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday will be a special day with Woods sharing the lead, Garcia
in the hunt and a talented group still in contention. But Woods,
who wants to secure a special place in history, will go a long way
toward setting the tone for how his 1999 is remembered with a
victory here. He has already won four times worldwide this year,
including three times on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   When Woods won the Masters in such dramatic fashion at age 21,
many thought he had a legitimate chance to equal or surpass Jack
Nicklaus' total of 18 professional major victories. But that record
looks more imposing with each passing major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods would have to average at least one victory in a major for
17 more years just to equal that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at Jack's career,'' Woods said. ``Jack finished second
many times in majors. How did he feel about losing that many times?
But he also won 18. The key is to keep giving yourself enough
chances, and eventually you're going to win a few.''

 &HT;    Funerals for shooting victims end

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The funerals for victims of Mark O. Barton's killing
rampage in Atlanta ended Saturday as services were held near St.
Louis for Scott Webb, 30.
</P>
<P>
   Webb was among the nine people Barton killed July 29 in the
worst mass shooting on record in Georgia. Barton, who had also
beaten to death his wife and two children, killed himself as police
closed in.
</P>
<P>
   Webb had moved to Atlanta from Chesterfield, Mo., a St. Louis
suburb, and worked at Momentum Securities, a stock day-trading
firm, in the fashionable Buckhead section of Atlanta. Momentum was
one of two day-trading companies that Barton, an unsuccessful
trader, targeted in his spree.
</P>
<P>
   Another former St. Louisan, Bradley T. Schoemehl, 24, was also
shot, but has since been released from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameras and reporters surrounded St. Peters Episcopal Church
in Ladue, Mo., where Webb's funeral was held, but members of the
press were not admitted to the church for the service. Webb's body
was cremated.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's family declined to speak to reporters. Friends have
described him as having a ready smile. He lived until recently with
his father, Roy Webb, in Chesterfield.
</P>
<P>
   Two people remained hospitalized in Atlanta Saturday, more than
two weeks after the shootings, which left 13 wounded. Yuzef
Liberzon, shot in the head as he day traded at Momentum Securities,
was in fair condition at Grady Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith Winnitt, 22, was listed in good condition at Northside
Hospital. Winnitt was an employee of All-Tech Securities.

 &HT;    Suburban Atlanta explosion injures 8
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMYRNA, Ga. _ An explosion Saturday afternoon at a Georgia Power
plant in the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna injured eight workers _
including three critically burned on much of their bodies and
another with severe burns to his face.
</P>
<P>
   The 1 p.m. EDT explosion at Plant McDonough-Atkinson occurred in
the sub-basement of the large coal-burning plant dominated by an
834-foot smokestack.
</P>
<P>
   Three employees were working on one of 10 coal pulverizers and
cleaning in the area, said plant manager David Garrett. An apparent
flash from the cleaning solvent, naphtha, ignited coal powder in
the air, causing a large explosion, said Cobb County fire spokesman
Stephen Mize.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the blast could be seen above ground. The blast
ripped a hole in the plant's metal wall on the ground floor,
shattered windows in upper floors and caused small fires throughout
the sub-basement, Mize said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is black down there,'' Mize said. ``It is hard to
tell the extent of the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the eight injured, were taken to Grady Memorial Hospital
in Atlanta with burns. One worker was treated at the plant with
burns, and an eighth employee was transported to a hospital with
inhalation problems, Mize said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the victims' identities was released.
</P>
<P>
   The three critically injured workers had severe burns over much
of their bodies, Mize said. Another had severe burns to his face
and head, but wasn't listed in critical condition, Mize said. One
worker was treated and released from Grady.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after the explosion, firefighters were still trying to
put out the flames in the sub-basement. About nine Cobb fire trucks
were called to the scene, as well as the county's hazardous
materials unit.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion occurred in Unit 2 of the plant, which was shut
down after the burst. The shutdown was not expected to affect power
service, Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Georgia Power, the plant was built in 1963. It is
the utility's sixth largest producer of power. In 1998 it had a
capacity of 490,000 kilowatts from coal and 78,800 kilowatts from
oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said the plant has had a good record for safety. None of
its 165 employees have required medical treatment from a
job-related injury in nearly two years, he said. Two of the men
injured Saturday were mechanics. Their department in July
celebrated its seventh year without a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disturbed about what happened,'' Garrett said.
``We'll find out what happened and correct the problem.''

WHEN IT COMES TO SEX, HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's ask and answer the obvious question first: Is there any
nudity in ``The History of Sex,'' the five-hour documentary on the
History Channel?
</P>
<P>
   Yep. Plenty. Less than 30 seconds into the first hour, we see a
naked breast, for example. By the time it's over Friday, we'll see
more _ much, much more. Naked men, naked women, the occasional
codpiece and chastity belt, that kind of thing.
</P>
<P>
   But the nudity in ``Sex'' is not especially sexy. More academic
than prurient, which is the point. This is the History Channel,
after all, not the Playboy Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Not to stretch a conceit, but this ``Sex'' is more functional
than passionate. And I didn't feel like smoking a cigarette
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. For the most part, I did.
Let's face it, an attempt to squeeze the entire history of anything
into a mere five hours is necessarily going to be a little shallow
(unless it's the history of Gap commercials). And people have been
having sex since . . . well, as long as there have been people. So
there's plenty of ground to cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex'' is presented in reverse chronological order. Monday
night's opening hour concerns sex in the 20th century, while the
following nights march back through time.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things we quickly learn is that nothing has changed
all that much, as evidenced by a few seconds of a porno film _ made
in 1915. (Actually, some things have changed. The Mayan practice of
piercing the penis with the spine of a stingray, dripping the blood
on a piece of paper and then burning it, for instance, no longer
exists. This is a good change.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the weirdnesses of ``Sex'' is its attempt to graft sex
onto every important moment in history. Dec. 7, 1941, for instance,
is usually thought of as the day the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,
the day the United States was thrust into World War II, a day that
will live in infamy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. According to Peter Coyote, who narrates
``Sex,'' it was also ``a day that changed intimate relations from
coast to coast in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   Must be true, though _ according to ``Sex,'' 80 percent of U.S.
soldiers stationed overseas for two years or more had some sort of
sexual activity abroad. A lot of grandpas watching this show with
their families are going to have some explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour suffers from popular but somewhat knuckleheaded
``experts,'' such as Hugh Hefner, the ubiquitous Dr. Ruth and Helen
Gurley Brown doing most of the talking. (Brown's appearance is
shocking; her skin is stretched so tight by what appears to be a
number of face lifts that if she wanted to lick the back of her
head, all she'd have to do is open her mouth.)
</P>
<P>
   Things pick up once we leave the 20th century and academic types
take over the talking-head roles.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Berkin, a professor at Baruch College, wins the Shelby
Foote Award for most entertaining talker in a documentary. (Foote,
you may recall, was an excellent but little-known writer until his
winning appearances in Ken Burns' ``Civil War'' documentary made
him a star.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent many a happy hour in an archive,'' Berkin says,
``reading about family incest, about potential lesbian
relationships, about adultery, about men and farmyard animals,
about women who had casual sex on the road going between their farm
and someone else's farm, about love on the woodpile, so that, yes,
Virginia, there was sex in Colonial society.''
</P>
<P>
   My fourth-grade Virginia history teacher never mentioned any of
this.
</P>
<P>
   Also included is the famous advice Queen Victoria supposedly
gave her daughter on how to endure sex: ``Close your eyes and think
of England.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, much humor in ``Sex,'' not all of it
intentional. For some reason, the producers felt the need to have
actors re-enact segments they didn't have illustrations for.
(Nothing explicit. Mostly just stupid.)
</P>
<P>
   And occasionally an actor reads, usually with a heavy accent,
some crucial writing about sex. When a fellow with a thick German
accent intoned in a grave manner about ``some sort of device or
implement in the shape of the male member of a size to match your
sinful desire,'' the guffaws were non-stop.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the most interesting parts of ``Sex'' concern the
Eastern world. India, after all, is where the ``Kama Sutra,'' the
most famous sex manual in history, was written _ written, by the
way, by an ascetic who likely never had sex. Although that's easy
to believe when you hear his advice for penile enlargement: sleep
face down on a cot with a hole in it, with weights hanging from the
part you'd like to enlarge.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   If it's just facts you're interested in, each commercial break
is preceded by a helpful tidbit. For example: ``Rumors that Julius
Caesar lost his virginity to the king of Bithynia led to his
political foes calling him the ``queen of Bithynia.''
</P>
<P>
   But what you really want in a documentary is information you can
use, and ``Sex'' provides that. For instance, we learn that India
is also home to an absolute gem of a pickup line used there in
ancient times: ``Your breasts are like the sinus lobes on an
elephant's forehead.''
</P>
<P>
   Feel free to use it at a singles bar. And don't forget to duck. &QL;

HUNDREDS REMEMBER SLAIN LETTER CARRIER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITTIER, Calif. _ In a confession to investigators, Buford O.
Furrow Jr. said he shot and killed Joseph Santos Ileto on Tuesday
because Santos was a ``target of opportunity,'' a man who became a
victim because he was not white and because he was employed by the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But friends, relatives and co-workers revealed so much more
about Ileto, a mail carrier who was born in the Philippines,
Saturday during a funeral attended by several hundred people. They
remembered him by his nickname, JoJo, recalling his passion for
chess, his love of basketball and the laugh that came with such
vigor that he sometimes was the only one who understood his jokes
by the time he finished telling them.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Ileto, Ileto's sister-in-law, said he liked to tell jokes
when the family gathered at his mother's house for dinners. ``He
would be laughing so hard, his laughter would make us laugh with
him,'' Ms. Ileto said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of Ileto, 39, lay in a white-shrouded open casket
surrounded by an explosion of red and white roses, sunflowers and
other floral arrangements in the Sky Rose Chapel at the Rose Hills
Mortuary in this suburb east of Los Angeles. Sunlight filtered in
from large skylights and a picture window that looked out on the
rolling hills beyond.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of mail delivery trucks sat in neat rows outside, and
dozens of postal workers paid their last respects in their
pale-blue uniform shirts and summer shorts. Mourners sniffled
quietly throughout the hour-long service.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Ileto recalled how Ileto and her husband loved the Los
Angeles Lakers and how they emphasized the importance of each game
they watched on television from the beginning of the season to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's sister, Racquel, recalled how unfazed he was when the
haircut she gave him ended up a mess. ``I'll just go to a
barbershop,'' she said he told her. His other sister, Carmina, told
of the time she received a call from him asking for help, when his
car had broken down on the way to work. When she arrived, she found
him helping another woman change a flat tire on her car, she said.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, had trouble understanding his jokes, but laughed along
with him because it was apparent he enjoyed them so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never did get his jokes,'' she said. ``But we would still
laugh because he was the only one who understood. I will never
forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   After spraying the North Valley Jewish Community Center in the
Granada Hills neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley with as many
as 70 rounds and injuring five people, Furrow told investigators he
stole a Toyota from a woman at gunpoint and saw Ileto as he was
driving through nearby Chatsworth. According to the statement,
Furrow approached Ileto, who was on his mail delivery rounds, and
asked if he could mail a letter for him, then drew a Glock 9mm
semiautomatic pistol and shot him twice. When Ileto doubled over
and tried to run away, Buford shot him again in the back and head,
until he fell down. After turning himself in in Las Vegas on
Wednesday morning, Furrow was brought back to Los Angeles, where he
has been charged in the mail carrier's murder. The case carries a
possible death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat whose district includes the
neighborhood where Ileto worked, read condolences from President
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer and Gov. Gray Davis. Noting Los Angeles' diversity, Sherman
called Ileto ``a martyr to the cause of us just living together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's best friend and co-worker, Glenn Ritona, told the
mourners he had wanted Ileto to marry his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would make Jo my brother-in-law, and a member of my
family,'' Ritona said. ``There just wasn't enough time.''

NICK PRICE CONCENTRATES ON THE SHOT AT HAND  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ As the co-leaders at 11 under par, Tiger Woods
and the Canadian left-hander Mike Weir will tee off Sunday in the
last pairing in the final round of the Professional Golfers'
Association Championship, but Stewart Cink and 19-year-old Sergio
Garcia are only two strokes behind. Can either win?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger and Mike Weir,'' Cink, a 26-year-old Georgian was saying
after his 68. ``One of the world's best and a guy who's making a
name for himself. I can't think about what they're shooting
tomorrow. I just have to do the best I can and dig deep coming down
the stretch and try to finish as high as I can. If that's first,
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, the Spanish prodigy, will be in contention in the final
round of a major for the first time, but he didn't sound as if he
would be too nervous to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I was not really nervous, but a little maybe on the the
last putt, I really wanted that putt for par,'' he said after his
68. ``In my first major, the '96 British Open at Royal Lytham, I
remember I was hitting a 5-iron to the green of a par-3 and I was
so nervous, I didn't think I would hit the ball, but I hit it
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was a 16-year-old amateur then. And now that he's 19, can
he catch Woods tomorrow?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he plays like he played today, maybe I finish second
best,'' he said, not realizing that Weir had birdied the 17th hole
to tie Woods for the 54-hole lead. `'I just try to do my best. I'll
try to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the other serious challengers to the co-leaders, only Nick
Price, the 42-year-old pro from Zimbabwe, has a major title in his
resume, three in fact _ the PGA in 1992, and the British Open and
the PGA in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to make no mistakes,'' said Price, five
strokes off the lead. ``If I don't make any mistakes, I think I'll
have a shot at it. There aren't many courses that don't suit
Tiger's game, but this one more than others because there's not
much run on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only three or four players in this entire field that
can reach all the par 4's and par 5's in two, and he's one of them.
So that makes it tough for the rest of us. If he drives the ball
well tomorrow, I think we're going to have a tough time catching
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Price added with a smile: ``He's obviously very focused and I
think he's been complaining about how poorly he's putting or how
he's not making as many putts as he'd like to. He'll be saying the
same things in 25 years' time, that he's not making as many putts
as he'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   Price acknowledged that his three major titles should give him
an advantage in experience if he gets within a stroke or two of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the leader board making the turn coming into the
last nine holes and see who's in the lead, who's around the lead,
and you figure out what you're going to need to shoot on the back
nine and who the contenders are going to be,'' Price said. ``It's a
different feeling when you're in contention on the last day of a
major. All sorts of things go through your mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players who do the best are the ones that think
more about what they're trying to do and the next shot at hand.
That seems to be the real secret. That's what I've found out,
anyway. Instead of thinking three or four holes ahead or what it
might be like if you win this championship, you must get intensely
focused on what you're trying to do: hit the next shot. The guys
that haven't won major championships, they don't do that very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   And except for Nick Price, Tiger Woods is the only golfer on the
leader board who has won a major, his 1997 Masters runaway.

 (HLW)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yogi was actually in uniform. Scooter was there, too.
So was Goose, Guidry and even Dave Winfield. It was another one of
those memorable days that can only happen at Yankee Stadium, so, of
course, David Cone was pitching for the Yankees. Who else would
pitch one of these momentous games?
</P>
<P>
   Even Cone admitted how weird it was that he often started on
eventful days in the Bronx, like Saturday's Old-Timers' Day. With
an army of former Yankees at the Stadium, with a crowd of 55,179
joining them and with the dreary Minnesota Twins occupying the
opposing dugout, Cone had another chance to make a special day feel
like an extraordinary day.
</P>
<P>
   It did not happen. Chuck Knoblauch dropped a pivotal pop fly,
and the Twins used an aggressive approach to score four two-out
runs during a four-pitch sequence against Cone, helping them
deflate and defeat the Yankees, 6-3. There was nothing special or
perfect about Cone and the Yankees on this distinctive day.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a lazy afternoon when Knoblauch's erratic
defense again became a topic, when the Yankees stranded 10 base
runners and short-circuited three innings with double plays, and
when Cone failed to baffle batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was by far my worst stuff of the year, no bones about it,''
Cone said. ``Even with that being said, I still think I could have
pitched better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone tried his fastball, his split-finger fastball, his
curveball and his slider, but he found nothing reliable. The Twins
are free swingers who put the ball in play and they harassed Cone.
Sometimes, Cone can wriggle through seven or eight innings without
a crisp repertory. Saturday, he struggled to make it through five
innings while allowing one earned run and seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't there today,'' Manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cone is now 1-3 with a 3.77 earned run average since
pitching the perfect game, and conceded that he has been ``shaky,''
it was surprising to see him fizzle in such a major setting. Cone
tossed his perfect game against the Expos on Yogi Berra Day on July
18; he stifled the Blue Jays on one run and earned a no-decision as
the Yankees honored Joe DiMaggio's memory on April 27, and he won
the home opener against the Tigers on April 9. Cone is used to
large crowds and he is used to winning at the Stadium, where he is
34-11.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone never found a rhythm Saturday and Knoblauch did not
help him. Terry Steinbach began the second inning with a bloop into
shallow right field. Knoblauch darted into the outfield, peered at
right fielder Paul O'Neill and then stopped when he realized he was
under the pop fly. With his back to the plate, Knoblauch stretched
out his glove to make a basket catch and the ball popped off the
heel of the glove for an error.
</P>
<P>
   While Knoblauch had to range about 80 feet, once he got settled,
Torre acknowledged, he should have caught the ball. It was
Knoblauch's 20th error of the season, the most among second basemen
in the major leagues, and it wound up being damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked for Paul and then I looked up for the ball again,''
Knoblauch said. ``I just missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Chad Allen singled and Cone walked Doug
Mientkiewicz, a .216 hitter, on four pitches to fill the bases.
Torii Hunter seemed too eager when he did not bother taking a pitch
after the walk and popped out to second.
</P>
<P>
   But the Twins kept attacking. Jacque Jones smacked an 0-1
splitter to right to knock in two runs, Denny Hocking followed by
slapping a fastball to center to drive in another and Todd Walker
stroked another single to center off Cone's first-pitch curveball
to put the Twins in front, 4-0. Four pitches, four runs, two
frustrated Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just hope that it ends as soon as it can,'' said
Knoblauch, recalling the annoying inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone added: ``Four runs with two outs is not good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone's frustration continued into the fourth inning, when
Mientkiewicz ended an 0-for-24 slump in style by crushing a homer
over the fence in right-center field. It was Mientkiewicz's second
homer in 242 at-bats this season, and Cone bowed his head as the
lead swelled to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who went 2 for 5 and is now 23 for 46 in
August, doubled in the bottom of the fourth and Tino Martinez
followed with a two-run homer off Dan Perkins to make the score
5-2. The Yankees later had runners on first and second, but Bob
Wells struck out Joe Girardi on a 3-2 pitch and Ricky Ledee was
nabbed trying to steal third to terminate the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch tripled and scored in the seventh and the Yankees
loaded the bases with two outs in the eighth, but Mike Trombley
retired Jorge Posada on a sinking liner to center. It was the
second loss in 10 games for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a flat day,'' Cone said. ``It was a
disappointment.'' &QL;

RYDER CUP RACE DOWN TO PGA'S FINAL ROUND (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Bob Estes estimates that the ``real'' drama of
today's final round _ the tournament within a tournament at the PGA
Championship _ should begin around the 13th hole.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Austin resident plans to begin checking the
status of Chris Perry, Steve Pate, Fred Couples and Jeff Sluman on
the leader board at Medinah Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   No, you won't find any of those names among the pacesetters
after yesterday's third round. All are at least eight strokes
behind co-leaders Tiger Woods and Mike Weir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all five remain in the running to land an automatic berth on
the U.S. Ryder Cup team, depending on their finish at the PGA
Championship. And all five remain within five strokes of each other
heading into today's final round.
</P>
<P>
   For each man, the minimum requirement for climbing into the top
10 on the final Ryder Cup standings is different. But the door was
left ajar when Jeff Maggert (10th), Steve Stricker (12th) and John
Huston (13th) missed the cut, preventing them from adding to their
point totals at the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Estes and Perry find themselves in position to make the most
significant moves. Estes is No. 15 in the Ryder Cup standings and
stands in 14th place at Medinah, at 3-under par. If he can climb
into a two-way tie for fifth by the end of today's round, the
former University of Texas golfer will have enough points to earn a
spot on his first Ryder Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Perry (2-under) is No. 14 in the Ryder Cup standings and 18th on
the Medinah leader board. By finishing in a two-way tie for sixth,
he can become a Ryder Cup rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The tasks are a little more daunting for Pate (1-under), Couples
(1-over) and Sluman (2-over), the players ranked Nos. 16-18,
respectively, in the Ryder Cup standings. Pate needs a solo finish
of fifth or better, while Couples and Sluman must climb into at
least fourth place to clinch a spot on the roster for the Sept.
24-26 matches in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, Couples _ a five-time Ryder Cup participant _ has
the best chance of being an at-large selection by captain Ben
Crenshaw. He sounded fairly confident about his chances yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup position, for me, is not based on today's round,
tomorrow's round or this week,'' said Couples, whose third round
deteriorated with what he termed a ``brain-dead'' triple-bogey at
No. 16. ``If I go back to hitting it like I did the first two days,
I can talk to Ben and tell him I'm playing well. If I'm playing
well, I think I might be picked.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, the No. 11 player in the standings, is considered a
lock for another at-large pick if he doesn't crack the top 10. And,
at 56th in the PGA field, he's not likely to add to his points
total.
</P>
<P>
   That makes today's final round a free-for-all for the No. 10
spot, with Estes and Perry the prime beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of doubt I'd be picked. That's unrealistic,'' Estes
said. ``Hopefully, I'll put myself in position so that, over the
last four or five holes, I can treat this \RRyder Cup race\S like a
tournament within a tournament. I'll check what they're doing, so
I'll know what I need to do to get to the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry plans to adopt a similar strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to put extra pressure on myself,'' Perry said.
``But I know \Rtoday\S is the whole deal for me. I'm not going to
be picked because I don't have a long history of success in major
championships. I've got a lot on the line, personally, and I hope
to give myself a few birdie chances early to get some momentum
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Pate, meanwhile, hopes to recapture a swing that deserted him
when he took three bogeys in his final five holes yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ryder Cup? I'm just trying to hit a stinking green, but I
can't even do that from the middle of the fairway,'' Pate said
after a round of 73. ``I'm going to the range and try to figure out
how to hit a stinking green.''

   ``There will always be lunatics out there, but we're urging
people to reach out and not hide away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another step Jews can take, he said, is to place a traditional
mezuza on their doors.
</P>
<P>
   The small cylinders carry a parchment scroll inside that
contains the basic beliefs of Judaism and symbolize protection for
homes and businesses from wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Lipskier said many of his congregation members do not support
placing more armed guards at their facilities because ``it sends
the wrong message to the children that we're under some sort of
military attack or something.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it's important to keep the perspective that last week's
violent attack is not commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in the Dark Ages anymore. Things have improved
greatly and we can't revert to living in fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven Jacobs from Kol Tikvah in suburban Woodland Hills
said he was telling Jews there to avoid creating a ``bunker
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was part of a delegation that accompanied the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to Belgrade, Northern Ireland, last May to secure freedom
for three U.S. prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an outpouring of support from other religious
communities and groups,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Fishel, president of the Jewish Federation, said the great
concern for security at the dozens of facilities the group
coordinates calls for Jewish leadership to come together to
reassess security and modify it if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're planning to hold a series of meetings with the
Anti-Defamation League and various leaders to discuss security,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having armed security at centers is regrettable. It doesn't
give the message of happiness that we would like to have ideally,
but it's a reality we have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the concerns about safety, however, many in the Jewish
community say they are determined to live their lives. While much
of Saturday's service at Temple Aliyah focused on the shootings,
for example, the congregation had other business at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perlo and her husband, Sandy, celebrated their 22nd anniversary.
Parents fought back tears through two b'nai mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   And fidgety children cried in the background, an insistent
reminder of the future.

HOPE, NOT `BUNKER MENTALITY' SHOULD GUIDE COMMUNITY'S RECOVERY

 TAKES-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOMINIC BERBEO

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the aftermath of last week's racist shootings,
Jewish religious leaders in the San Fernando Valley are urging
congregations to fight back - by praying for peace, reaching out to
others and tempering emotions.
</P>
<P>
   They said they are concerned about some who are grappling with
how to respond to the horrific shooting without becoming militant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to build bridges within the community by communicating
the message of what Judaism is all about: justice, compassion and
mercy,'' said Rabbi Richard Camras of the Shomrei Torah synagogue
in the community of West Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that as a congregation we have to be proactive by
beefing up security at our facilities,'' he said. ``But not to the
point where we ourselves are imprisoned by drastic measures. Simply
arming yourself does not necessarily make you immune to acts of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The synagogue, with a congregation of 630, is located just down
the street from where white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. is
accused of fatally shooting mail carrier Joseph Ileto Tuesday in
the community of Chatsworth. Police say his rampage began that day
by wounding five people at the North Valley Jewish Community Center
in suburban Granada Hills.
</P>
<P>
   One victim, 5-year-old Benjamin Kadish, remained hospitalized
Saturday. Doctors successfully weaned him from a respirator
Saturday, allowing him to breathe on his own for the first time in
days.
</P>
<P>
   The tragic shootings last week and subsequent disclosure of
Furrow's racist connections have piqued security concerns within a
community that has been violently targeted in racist attacks around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   At Temple Aliyah's shabbat services Saturday in suburban
Woodland Hills, Rabbi Stewart Vogel and his congregation struggled
with the sudden feeling of vulnerability the shooting left in its
wake.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel urged the more than 300 people present not to give in to
hatred following the attack. Instead, he asked them to concentrate
on the support pouring in from Jewish and non-Jewish neighbors and
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're Jewish, whether you're Christian, whether
you're Muslim, it's important to acknowledge that people don't
stand alone in these moments,'' Vogel said. ``When we focus on the
hatred, we lose ourselves. We lose our Jewish spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Perlo in the congregation admitted to feeling despair
after the attack. Suddenly, another place that had seemed safe had
been shown to be vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she too was heartened by the community's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the way synagogues and churches have banded together,''
Perlo said. ``It gives you a real shot in the arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Some at Temple Aliyah wondered how to deal with people who hate
Jews simply for existing. ``It's baseless hatred, just looking for
a scapegoat,'' said Tom Block. ``And I don't know that there's
anything we can do about it other than being good people
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of 50 to 60 volunteers, mostly college students, is
preparing to form foot patrols around the city in an effort to
deter attacks and give older Jews a feeling that something is being
done by their own.
</P>
<P>
   The ``PEACE FORCE'' was founded in 1981 by Phil Blazer,
publisher of the Jewish News, and is being revived this month after
more than 10 years of inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Blazer said the volunteers, mostly college students, will wear
``PEACE FORCE'' T-shirts and carry cell phones to contact police in
neighborhoods surrounding synagogues and Jewish centers around the
Valley, and elsewhere in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed security guards are definitely a deterrent,'' he said.
``But volunteers are a more positive deterrent because it gives
people within our community an opportunity to take action and
reassure the seniors, many of whom experienced the Holocaust and
may feel helpless against violent attacks on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Camras said discussion at synagogue this weekend will focus on a
biblical passage known as the Shoftim, which reads: ``Justice,
justice thou shall pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   Repetition of the word justice, he explained, signifies the
roles that both law enforcement officials and ordinary people must
play.
</P>
<P>
   He said many congregation members were of the opinion that their
``way of life as Jews should not be affected by hate or acts of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Valley rabbis had a similar message for those in their
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Menachem Lipskier from Chabad of Sherman Oaks said the
only solution to violence is to reach out to others to quell
ignorance and prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to double our efforts to show how love and peace
(are) part of our Jewish tradition,'' he said. ``The last Jewish
month of the year before Rosh Hashana is a time for evaluating our
past year to see what we did, what we could have done, and what we
will do to correct that.''

 By WILLIAM SERRIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lane Kirkland, who was president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995 _ an extremely troubled time for American workers _ and who
resigned after an unprecedented revolt of union presidents against
him, died Saturday morning at his home in Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as
president of the AFL-CIO and his longtime friend and mentor, led
the U.S. labor movement for nearly 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the
labor organization, the U.S. economy and the workplace experienced
drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership
shrank, and the importance of unions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   The growing concern for labor's future in the United States, a
concern that contributed to Kirkland's downfall, contrasted with
its relatively powerful influence abroad, an influence that
Kirkland helped to foster.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was an ardent anti-communist and proud of his
organization's efforts to help the Solidarity movement in bringing
democracy to Poland by any means it could. During the 1970s and
'80s he worked tirelessly to help Solidarity topple the communist
government, surreptitiously channeling organization money and fax
machines to the movement led by Lech Walesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The success of solidarity owes a lot to Lane,'' said Henry
Kissinger, a close friend of Kirkland. ``He supported it with funds
and organizers, and he had a big effect on American
policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   But a major criticism of the labor leaders who forced him from
office was that he lacked the same intense interest when it came to
energizing American workers and winning them over to trade
unionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has become more vigorous since Kirkland's
resignation, it remains unclear whether the U.S. labor movement can
ever rebound and recapture its former power. When Kirkland assumed
office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to
unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lane Kirkland _ everyone called him Lane _ was born on
March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers
Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson. A
great-great-grandfather, Thomas Jefferson Withers, signed the
Confederate declaration of secession, and Kirkland often referred
to the Civil War as the ``War of Northern Aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was raised in Newberry, S.C., where he attended public
schools, and where many of his classmates were sons and daughters
of mill workers. ``They'd leave school to work in the mills, and
conditions were rather bad,'' he once told The Washington Post.
``If they'd fire a guy, he'd lose his house; he'd lose everything.
There's no better way to get an education in becoming liberal than
to be exposed to those sorts of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the United States entered World War II, Kirkland
unsuccessfully attempted to join the Canadian military. In 1940, he
became a cadet on the SS Liberator, a merchant marine ship.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy.
Upon graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American
ships transporting war materiel, sailing to South America, the
beachheads at Sicily and Anzio, and the Solomon Islands in the
Pacific. He always retained his membership in the Masters, Mates,
and Pilots Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kirkland entered the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University, graduating in 1948. He then worked as a
researcher with the American Federation of Labor, becoming a
specialist on pensions and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   A skilled writer, he was on loan in 1948 to the Democratic Party
to write speeches for Alben Barkley, President Harry Truman's
running mate. In 1952 and 1956 he wrote campaign speeches for Adlai
Stevenson, the Democratic presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   He always impressed Meany, who had become president of the AFL
in 1952 and who became president of the AFL-CIO in 1955 when the
labor federation merged with the Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Kirkland became director of research and education for
the International Union of Operating Engineers, but in 1960 he
returned to the AFL-CIO as Meany's executive assistant. He directed
the organization's daily operations and often represented it on
Capitol Hill and at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Always negotiating, he helped resolve jurisdictional disputes
among AFL-CIO unions _ then a major problem in labor _ and helped
to settle the mass-transit strike in New York City in 1966. He
pushed strongly for a fair-employment-practices provision in the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1969, Meany selected Kirkland to be secretary-treasurer,
the No. 2 position in the organization. His opposition to the
policies of the Nixon administration earned him a place on the
president's notorious ``enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland continued his intense interest in international
affairs, maintaining that they were too important to be left to ``a
tight incestuous breed of economists and diplomats.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and
was instrumental in the AFL-CIO's refusal to support Sen. George
McGovern as the Democratic candidate for president in 1972. In 1976
he was a founder of the Committee on the Present Danger, which
demanded larger military budgets to confront the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as Meany's health declined, Kirkland often ran the
labor organization. In September 1979, Meany, then 85, announced
his retirement, and in November Kirkland was named president even
though he remained a remote figure to many union members.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech Kirkland set a tone for his
administration, making clear, in his tart manner, the importance
that he placed on getting nonaffiliated unions to join the AFL-CIO.
He said that ``all sinners belong in the church'' and unaffiliated
unions should renounce ``petty personal or pecuniary
considerations, or ancient and tedious grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   He regarded as his biggest achievement persuading the
autoworkers, the mine workers, the longshoremen and warehousemen,
and the teamsters to join or rejoin the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was proud of other changes under his leadership. He
placed the first woman on the labor organization's executive
council and increased the participation of blacks and Hispanics. He
agreed to establish an institute to train new organizers. He also
continued the AFL-CIO's vast foreign operations in Europe, Africa,
South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But huge problems emerged with his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was, as is said in the garment trades, an inside guy,
not an outside guy. He often seemed detached, sometimes arrogant,
incapable of banter or pleasantries. He was given to withering
ripostes, and seemed to detest the media, often refusing interviews
and requests to appear on television, even on Labor Day, saying he
found it demeaning. He said reporters should periodically be
condemned to their morgues to read their clippings, an exercise he
believed would show the shallowness and inaccuracy of much of
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Kirkland spent too much time on international
affairs and not enough time on domestic concerns and that he linked
American labor too frequently with conservative unions in foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
   They also maintained that in its foreign policy, Kirkland's
organization too often allied itself with American corporations. In
1993, when Congress debated a bill to ban permanent replacement
workers, Kirkland was in Europe. The AFL-CIO spent more money on
international affairs than on organizing, civil rights and workers'
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, fundamental change was occurring in the U.S.
economy. In the 1980s, one industrial plant after another closed,
and whole communities were in distress. The service economy, with
little union organization, expanded. Jobs were lost to new
processes and foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Strike after strike, including one by the air traffic
controllers in 1981, was unsuccessful, and labor suffered numerous
defeats in Congress, including its failure in 1993 to block passage
of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which unions opposed
because of concern over losing jobs in the United States. In 1994,
Republicans won control of the House and the Senate for the first
time in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, organized labor failed to expand its
membership and Kirkland's critics in the union movement said he
lacked the vision to reverse the slide.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, in a remarkable event for labor unions, whose
culture stresses loyalty, discipline and the private settlement of
problems, an open revolt broke out. Not since John L. Lewis and
others left the AFL in 1935 to form what became the CIO had such a
raucous, public fight occurred in American unionism.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt was led by Gerald McEntee, president of the municipal
workers; John Sweeney, then president of service employees; Richard
Trumka, then president of the mine workers; and Ronald Carey, then
president of the teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee doggedly followed Kirkland to speaking engagements,
engaging him in impromptu debates. Union leaders, acting
anonymously, condemned Kirkland in statements to reporters and he
was assailed at a February 1995 executive council meeting in Bal
Harbour, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney twice asked Kirkland to retire. He knew that President
Clinton had offered Kirkland the ambassadorship to Poland, and he
suggested that the union leader accept it and make way for new
leadership. But Kirkland, always a stubborn man, refused to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   In June that year, with presidents of some 20 unions opposing
him, Kirkland said he would resign in August, becoming the only
president in the American Federation of Labor's then 109-year
history to be forced to step down. Thomas Donahue, the AFL-CIO's
secretary-treasurer, and Kirkland's choice to be his successor,
announced his candidacy for the presidency. But in October,
Sweeney, the leader of an opposition slate, defeated Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Kirkland was rarely in the public eye. He
never forgot or forgave Sweeney and the other insurrectionists,
saying that they engaged in ``mendacity and falsehood.'' He said
the labor movement had always had difficulties, given its many
enemies, but was built for ``heavy weather.'' And he took pride in
the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, believing
that he and the AFL-CIO had helped bring it about.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kirkland was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include Kirkland's wife, the former Irena Neumann, a
German concentration-camp survivor whom he married in 1973, and
five children from his first marriage, to Edith Draper Hollyday,
which ended in divorce in 1972. The children are Blair Hollyday,
Lucy Alexander, Louise Richardson, Edith Hollyday and Katharine
Hollyday, all of whom live in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by five grandchildren and two great
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland had broad interests that included gardening, gin rummy,
wine, jazz, modern art, archaeology and hieroglyphics. He was a
constant smoker, and his trademark, along with a sharp tongue, was
a long, yellowed holder with a burning cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of articles about him over 20 years, only one, in 1984
in The Washington Post, showed him at ease. He was portrayed in his
home, in Washington, playing ``Amazing Grace'' on his Marine Band
harmonica, in the manner of a sailor at sea, with his dachshund
Stanley howling in delighted accompaniment.

<P>
   Lane Kirkland, who was president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to
1995 and who resigned after an unprecedented revolt of union
presidents against him, died Saturday morning at his home in
Washington. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was lung cancer, said his wife, Irena
Kirkland.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Kirkland and George Meany, his predecessor as
president of the AFL-CIO and his longtime friend and mentor, led
the U.S. labor movement for nearly 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Kirkland was serving almost 16 years as president of the
labor organization, the U.S. economy and the workplace experienced
drastic change. Plants closed, jobs were lost, union membership
shrank, and the importance of unions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was an ardent anti-communist and was proud of his
organization's efforts to help the Solidarity movement in bringing
democracy to Poland. But a major criticism of the labor leaders who
forced him from office was that he lacked the same intense interest
when it came to energizing American workers and winning them over
to trade unionism.
</P>
<P>
   Although the AFL-CIO has become more vigorous since Kirkland's
resignation, it remains unclear whether the U.S. labor movement can
ever rebound and recapture its former power. When Kirkland assumed
office, 24 percent of the workers in the United States belonged to
unions. When he resigned, the figure was 15.5 percent. Today, it is
13.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lane Kirkland _ everyone called him Lane _ was born on
March 12, 1922, in Camden, S.C., the son of Randolph Withers
Kirkland, a cotton buyer, and the former Louise Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he entered the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Upon
graduation in 1942, he served as a chief mate aboard American ships
transporting war materiel. He always retained his membership in the
Masters, Mates, and Pilots Union.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kirkland entered the School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University. He then worked as a researcher with the
American Federation of Labor, becoming a specialist on pensions and
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He always impressed Meany, who had become president of the AFL
in 1952 and who became president of the AFL-CIO in 1955 when the
labor federation merged with the Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Kirkland became director of research and education for
the International Union of Operating Engineers, but in 1960 he
returned to the AFL-CIO as Meany's executive assistant. In May
1969, Meany selected Kirkland to be secretary-treasurer, the No. 2
position in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland continued his intense interest in international
affairs. He strongly supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War
and was instrumental in the AFL-CIO's refusal to support Sen.
George McGovern as the Democratic candidate for president in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, as Meany's health declined, Kirkland often ran the
labor organization. In September 1979, Meany, then 85, announced
his retirement, and in November Kirkland was named president.
</P>
<P>
   He regarded as his biggest achievement persuading the
autoworkers, the mine workers, the longshoremen and warehousemen,
and the teamsters to join or rejoin the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland was proud of other changes under his leadership. He
placed the first woman on the labor organization's executive
council and increased the participation of blacks and Hispanics. He
agreed to establish an institute to train new organizers. He also
continued the AFL-CIO's vast foreign operations in Europe, Africa,
South America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But huge problems emerged with his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland often seemed detached, and sometimes arrogant. Critics
said that he spent too much time on international affairs and not
enough time on domestic concerns and that he linked American labor
too frequently with conservative unions in foreign countries. They
also maintained that in its foreign policy, Kirkland's organization
too often allied itself with American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, fundamental change was occurring in the U.S.
economy. In the 1980s, one industrial plant after another closed,
and whole communities were in distress. The service economy, with
little union organization, expanded. Jobs were lost to new
processes and foreign competition. Strike after strike was
unsuccessful, and labor suffered numerous defeats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this, organized labor failed to expand its
membership and Kirkland's critics in the union movement said he
lacked the vision to reverse the slide.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995 an open revolt broke out. John Sweeney, then
president of service employees, twice asked Kirkland to retire. He
knew that President Clinton had offered Kirkland the ambassadorship
to Poland, and he suggested that the union leader accept it and
make way for new leadership. But Kirkland, always a stubborn man,
refused to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   In June that year, with presidents of some 20 unions opposing
him, Kirkland said he would resign in August, becoming the only
president in the American Federation of Labor's then 109-year
history to be forced to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Donahue, the AFL-CIO's secretary-treasurer, and
Kirkland's choice to be his successor, announced his candidacy for
the presidency. But in October, Sweeney, the leader of an
opposition slate, defeated Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   After his resignation, Kirkland was rarely in the public eye. He
never forgot or forgave Sweeney and the other insurrectionists,
saying that they engaged in ``mendacity and falsehood.'' In 1996,
Kirkland was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, the former Irena Neumann, a German
concentration-camp survivor whom he married in 1973, and five
children from his first marriage, to Edith Draper Hollyday, which
ended in divorce in 1972. The children are Blair Hollyday, Lucy
Alexander, Louise Richardson, Edith Hollyday and Katharine
Hollyday, all of whom live in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   He is also survived by five grandchildren and two great
grandchildren.

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ who know him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Beach Boys' Love formed a company that bought Sandstone
Amphitheatre and later took over management of Memorial Hall in
Wyandotte County, Kory came to Kansas as the company's attorney. He
and the company projected successes that never came to pass.
</P>
<P>
   And when Kory began pitching his Oz theme park, he told
Wyandotte County officials the resort would be built there. He said
the park would open in 1995 or 1996, then 1997, then 1999. But last
year he moved his project to Johnson County. The opening date is
now 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their biggest impediment is this crude lack of credibility
they have with the public and a fair amount of public officials,''
said Steineger, who is not a critic of Kory's but has observed
other officials' skepticism. ``People refuse to believe them after
all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook says theme parks on the Oz scale usually take 10 years
to develop. Even after Walt Disney established Disneyland in
California, he took 16 years to open Disney World in Florida,
Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No theme park that's ever been opened has been closed,''
Westbrook said, speaking of projects on the scale of Oz, not
amusement parks. ``They may have taken on new ownership, but they
have not stopped operating.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Kory drew criticism in 1993 when Wyandotte County
officials questioned what had happened to $550,000 in public grants
for the Oz project. The FBI investigated the grant, but no action
was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Kory and other Oz officials said the money was well spent on
feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
   Oz must repay the $550,000 within a year of starting
construction, as part of the bill Graves signed in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be surprised if we ever see a nickel,'' said Hal Walker,
chief counsel for the Unified Government.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1993, Walker, then the city attorney, told The Star:
``The assurances in reference to Sandstone did not materialize.
Assurances about Memorial Hall never materialized. Certainly it
gives you pause.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to comment further for this story. Other
officials also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, a well-known real estate agent in Wyandotte County,
questioned Kory's follow-through. Kory hired Roberts in the early
'90s to secure options to buy land in the heart of the county for
the project.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1994, Roberts said he suspected that Kory had no
intention of buying the land tied up in options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to happen tomorrow,'' Roberts said. ``Just like
Oz says of Sunflower, it's going to happen tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also said he was having a hard time getting paid. For
example, in August 1996, Roberts wrote Oz that he still was owed
$6,500 for 1994 services. Roberts said he wrote off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Westbrook, Kory's spokesman, said Kory did not buy the
land because he decided it was overpriced. He denied that Kory owed
Roberts money, saying Kory disputed the value of the services
Roberts performed.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said Kory would extend the options _ increasing the
promised price per acre _ with a promise that the money was coming.
He'd throw out impressive names of his backers: Michael Jackson or
a Saudi Arabian prince, Roberts said, ``enough to keep me dumb and
doing what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oz lawyer for the real estate transactions, McDonald, tells
a similar story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their word was not always their bond,'' McDonald said. ``They
had deadline after deadline after deadline they told the city and
the landowners and then didn't meet it. I got tired of going out
and telling people why they didn't meet it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said he quit because he didn't do business that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my job and my privilege to not work for someone if you
have questions about their authenticity,'' McDonald said, ``and
that's what became apparent to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said it was common in land transactions for deadlines
to be extended. He called McDonald's comments a character attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customarily, members of the bar defend their clients against
such attacks in a courtroom rather than engaging in such attacks,''
Westbrook said. ``Mr. McDonald serves his profession and his former
client very poorly when he makes such accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Oz was to close on 122 acres of Frank and Virginia
Gray's land in Kansas City, Kan., Oz officials failed to show,
Frank Gray said. Correspondence from Oz stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of smoke and mirrors,'' Frank Gray said. ``You
could never talk to them about finances, about their finances.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said the closing was called off because Kory didn't
like the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Kory was criticized when a bill his company
helped write was introduced in the Kansas Legislature. The bill was
to lengthen the amount of time Oz had to repay $270 million in
state-issued bonds.
</P>
<P>
   What Kory and his lobbyist didn't tell the Legislature: The bill
also included a 1-cent sales tax increase to get more money from
the paying public to repay the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the time, Kory told a Star reporter the bill
did not include a sales tax increase, even when the language in the
bill was pointed out to him.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said Kory was confused about the local tax rates when
he said the legislation did not include a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Oz company's investment bankers and lobbyist
repeatedly told the Legislature and the Johnson County Commission
that the project would fail without the sales tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   While Kory has equally passionate critics and supporters, others
say Kory doesn't need to be liked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some fly-by-night operation,'' said Tom Page, the
chairman of the Kansas Development Finance Authority, the board
that will vote to issue the bonds for the Oz project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, are these ... guys you'd spend a long weekend with at a
ski resort in Aspen? Uh-uh,'' Page said, shaking his head. ``These
guys aren't Kansans.''
</P>
<P>
   Personality aside, many give Kory credit for launching the huge
project. Vaught, the Unified Government commissioner, said he
thought his investment was gone years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kory has ``pushed through when a lot of us had given up on the
project,'' Vaught said. ``It's easy to throw stones. But if it
wasn't for him, this project wouldn't be going anywhere.''

 &HT;    GOP hoopla underscores Iowa's clout
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Republicans used to talk about making their party a
big tent. On Saturday, they had several.
</P>
<P>
   Every GOP candidate who competed in Saturday's Iowa straw poll
had at least one tent outside the Iowa State University basketball
coliseum. The more prosperous campaigns had entire tent complexes.
</P>
<P>
   In the steel-reinforced, air-conditioned Steve Forbes tent,
supporters cooled off to the music of Debby Boone and Ronnie
Milsap. Over at Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch's more modest tent, Roger
Williams and Vic Damone performed.
</P>
<P>
   The hungry had their choice of barbecue _ the Taste of Texas in
Gov. George W. Bush's well-placed tents, the Taste of Tennessee at
former Gov. Lamar Alexander's, or the South Carolina 'cue of
Columbia restaurateur Maurice Bessinger at Pat Buchanan's. Then
they could stroll over to Alan Keyes' for an ice cream sundae.
</P>
<P>
   Parents left their kids among the giant inflatable playscapes
provided by Forbes, while thrill-seekers rode a funny car doing
wheelies outside the Elizabeth Dole tent.
</P>
<P>
   This was festival politics, a sort of corn-fed, conservative
Woodstock complete with giant balloons, T-shirt stands, clowns and
fresh-faced kids.
</P>
<P>
   And eventually, candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's votin' time here now! A lot of people are paying
attention to what's happening in Ames, Iowa,'' an upbeat Bush
shouted to his supporters, as his aides eyed an ominous tide of
orange Forbes T-shirts streaming out of buses in nearby lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flabbergasted. I stood outside shaking hands for two hours
and never shook the same hand twice,'' Rep. Bob Barr, Georgia
chairman for Forbes and a native of Iowa City, said. Barr and
Atlantan Alveda King, who is a national co-chair for Forbes,
campaigned for their candidate in the air-conditioned tent before
the voting began.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the winner of this symbolic but closely watched
first contest of the presidential season was named, it seemed clear
that overall attendance would set a record for the GOP straw poll,
which was first held in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll is ``a good midterm exam'' for the candidates,
Iowa GOP Chairman Kayne Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tents and the hoopla, the campaigns _ with
the exception of that of Arizona Sen. John McCain, who boycotted
the straw poll _ spent considerable money to prove they have the
organizational ability to prevail in next year's nomination
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, I think we will have demonstrated we
have the will, the organization, the ground forces, as well as the
message to win the presidency,'' said Forbes' national chairman,
Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the straw poll was so casually treated that the
campaigns brought in supporters from Nebraska to bump up their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with so much focus on the event, proof of Iowa
residency was required and participants were stamped with indelible
ink so they wouldn't vote twice.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates were brought before an arena packed with
Republicans like an all-star basketball team, with cheerleaders and
indoor fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Forbes and Bush took their turns to speak, the
atmosphere was similar to that of the old-time floor demonstrations
at national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes even had his own fireworks and spotlight, but the
exuberance backfired somewhat when the first half of the Fortune
magazine publisher's speech was drowned out by the popping of
balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the candidates took shots in the direction of Bush,
whose fund-raising prowess and family name have made him a strong
early favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vision is not raising money, my vision is raising our
children,'' former Vice President Dan Quayle said. Forbes said the
party doesn't need ``a candidate who depends on pollsters and
tutors to tell him what to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech seemed a response to his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to lead. I do not run polls to tell me what to
think,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said prosperity was not enough to sustain the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity must have a greater purpose. If prosperity were
enough, the wealth of Littleton would have shielded its children,''
Bush said.

TEAMS TURN UP HEAT AS TEMPERATURES RISE (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blistering heat is driving almost everybody in baseball
crazy, not just the Rangers' befuddled brass.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm just as surprised as they are that 46,000 people
aren't willing to pay top dollar and embrace 100-plus temperatures
every night just so they can catch a flying T-shirt, check out the
breath-taking home-run fireworks and go crazy when that guy who
suspiciously looks like Ed Belfour starts waving the Rangers' flag
on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers aren't the only ones with problems. ...
</P>
<P>
   Brewers boss Wendy Selig-Prieb decided eight years was enough
for general manager Sal Bando and manager Phil Garner, and she
cleaned house. Not that the House of Selig ever went all-out to
provide a winner _ or even come close _ but Bando and Garner could
never overcome the numerous injuries that always strike the
Brewers' young pitchers, from Teddy Higuera to Cal Eldred and Jeff
D'Amico.
</P>
<P>
   You can only go so far trying to revive the careers of Hideo
Nomo, Bill Pulsipher, Rocky Coppinger, Ben McDonald and Jim Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers will likely beg Paul Molitor to come back, either as
manager or general manager. Former Pirates general manager Ted
Simmons, who played for the Brewers, could also re-emerge there.
Otherwise, they'll round up the usual general-manager suspects,
including former Indians assistant Dan O'Dowd and Braves assistant
Dean Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Three with Rangers connections ought to be considered: Omar
Minaya, a former scout here and now the Mets' senior assistant
general manager who will be somebody's general manager soon; Dan
O'Brien, who helped the Astros get turned around before becoming
Doug Melvin's top aide; and Wayne Krivsky, Tom Grieve's former aide
who now works with the Twins and has wide experience in scouting,
player development and contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could resurface in Detroit, where Tigers manager Larry
Parrish is the first one to say he could be in trouble. The heat is
particularly high in Detroit, now that the Tigers have the worst
record in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's 8-2 loss to the Rangers, Parrish said, ``For the
year we've had, I can't imagine anyone giving me a vote of
confidence. ... I don't know how much they're going to put up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Tigers do make a move, they'll be paying three managers
next year: Buddy Bell, Parrish and the new guy. That might convince
the Tigers to keep Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Garner could also end up in Baltimore, where it's all but
official that Ray Miller won't be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot spot to watch is Los Angeles. The Dodgers' mess got
worse Wednesday when disgruntled outfielder Raul Mondesi went off
on manager Davey Johnson and general manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They try to put all of our problems on me,'' Mondesi said.
``They're trying to say that all this is my fault. That's the way
they feel, fine. Just get me out of here. I'm tired of all this. I
told my agent \RJeff Moorad\S to get me out of here as soon as
possible I can't take this anymore. I've tried to deal with this
all year. I told them to trade me because I don't want to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the G-rated version of what Mondesi said. The club issued
a statement the next day that had Mondesi apologizing. Just blame
it on the heat.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON J.D. DREW
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies drew 140,446 for their three-game series with the
St. Louis Cardinals last week, but it wasn't all because Mark
McGwire was in town. Phillies fans had long anticipated their first
opportunity to vent their anger at Cardinals outfielder J.D. Drew,
who was Philadelphia's first pick (second overall) in the 1997
draft but refused to sign with the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Drew got the usual ugly Philadelphia reception: plenty of boos,
taunting banners _ ``Greed will be your demise, J.D.'' was one of
the nicer ones _ and the usual assortment of debris thrown at him.
At one point on Tuesday, the Cardinals had to be pulled off the
field until the unruly crowd settled down.
</P>
<P>
   But the Phillie Phanatic caused the biggest stir by driving up
to the Cardinals' dugout and placing three bags with dollar signs
on the turf. Drew's agent Scott Boras said the mascot should be
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just disappointed,'' Phillies manager Terry Francona
said. ``It was a huge crowd and they were very vocal and that's
good. But then you get a couple of dummies up there and it kind of
ruins it for everybody else. We all have different opinions on J.D.
and where he signed. But no matter what your opinion is, he doesn't
deserve that. That's why I went over and apologized.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew, while admitting he'll never forget the experience, got in
the final say. His home run was the deciding blow in the Cardinals'
5-1 victory Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's timing is perfect,'' Drew said. ``He has a will for my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   Through the first 40 games, Oakland outfielder Ben Grieve was
hitting .131 with three home runs and 11 runs batted in. Then he
figured out he was holding his hands too high. Since then, he has
been hitting .321 with 16 homers and 49 RBI, helping the Athletics
surge back into the playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers were 21/2 games ahead of the Cubs when Phil Garner
and Sal Bando were dismissed. That doesn't say much for the chances
of Cubs general manager Ed Lynch and manager Jim Riggleman.
</P>
<P>
   A name to watch in the off-season: Arthur Rhodes. He's 29,
left-handed and eligible for free agency in the off-season. A team
like the Rangers could gamble on him as a converted starter and use
him as a left-handed setup reliever if it doesn't work out. It
could cost $16 million over four years _ that's what Mike Timlin
got _ but he could be worth it if he can start.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the free-agent watch: The White Sox aren't thrilled with
Greg Norton at third base and could use someone like Todd Zeile. He
could add power to the lineup and also be a stabilizing influence
for the White Sox young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Todd Stottlemyre, on the disabled
list with a torn rotator cuff, hit 94 miles per hour with his
fastball in a medical rehabilitation start last week. He's expected
to return Friday against the Pittsburgh Pirates, probably replacing
Brian Anderson in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa is thrilling people with his home runs, but he's
played poorly in the outfield. He's looking more like a DH every
day in a league that doesn't use one.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1, when he lost for the first time in a calendar
year, Roger Clemens is 5-5 with a 5.71 earned-run average. The
Yankees have lost seven of his 13 starts since then. Spring
training talk of a contract extension has quieted.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians aren't happy with pitcher Jaret Wright, who is back
on the disabled list with a sore shoulder. Manager Mike Hargrove is
upset Wright wasn't more forthcoming when he first injured the
shoulder in July, then obviously wasn't ready when he came off the
disabled list on Aug. 3. He looked terrible in two starts and was
put back on the D.L. Steve Karsay, who has been a terrific middle
reliever, has taken his spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, having dumped Darryl Hamilton and Brian McRae, are
going to take a two-month look at Edgard Clemente, nephew of Hall
of Famer Roberto Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly, tired of rookie mistakes, dragged
center fielder Torii Hunter back onto the field after last Saturday
night's game in Kansas City. Hunter had missed a hit-and-run sign,
so he had the rookie stand at home plate and stare at third-base
coach Ron Gardenhire while Kelly lectured him. It was after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees weren't happy shortstop Derek Jeter was seen joking
around with buddy Alex Rodriguez during last week's brawl with the
Mariners. Outfielder Chad Curtis confronted Jeter in the locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Giants have had Barry Bonds, Ellis Burks, Jeff
Kent and J.T. Snow in the same lineup together for 28 games this
season. They are 17-11 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. asked where's the pitching when he turned down a
contract extension offer from the Mariners. The answer? The
Mariners have nothing to show for sending Mike Hampton to the
Astros, Shawn Estes to the Giants and Joe Mays to the Twins. nn

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ the Oz author.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said Kory would simply outlast the Oz skeptics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who've come and gone. And he's come
and he hasn't gone. I give him a shot at it,'' Baum said.
</P>
<P>
   Kory's multifarious knowledge is what impresses his business
partners and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Kory graduated in 1973 summa cum laude from Yale University with
a bachelor's degree in philosophy. He also was named a member of
Phi Beta Kappa. He later graduated from the University of Chicago
law school.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, Kory developed interests that continue to drive him.
</P>
<P>
   One was transcendental meditation, a passion that became an
occupation. After graduating, Kory set up TM conferences in the New
York metropolitan area and went on to serve as a national vice
president in the movement.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote six self-help books based on transcendental
meditation, five of which he wrote with a friend from Yale. Titles
include .MDBR/.MDNM/``Happiness: The TM Program,'' ``Psychiatry and
Enlightenment'' and ``Lifemates: The Love Fitness Program for a
Lasting Relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   .MDBR/.MDNM/Kory meditates daily, Westbrook said.
</P>
<P>
   The practice gives him the energy to work 70-hour weeks, live a
moral life and structure his thinking to juggle the many details
involved in the Oz project, said Altbach, who met him in 1975 when
Kory was writing books with a friend of Altbach's.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/Another interest Kory developed at Yale also feeds Oz:
multimedia art.
</P>
<P>
   Kory met Patrick Clancy, chairman of photography and new media
at the Kansas City Art Institute, at Yale when Clancy was a
graduate student. Kory's interest in Clancy's interactive
multimedia art sparked a friendship.
</P>
<P>
   The two continue to exchange ideas. For instance, Clancy sent
Kory a book on complexity theory, a phenomenon that occurs after
chaos theory, for the two to discuss. Recently, Clancy sent Kory a
book on nonlinear dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Kory chose Clancy to lead a nonprofit research center that Oz is
helping create adjacent to the park.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy says Kory uses his broad knowledge to stay informed of
the details of the project, while maintaining his vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to put these things together and keep them moving
along as they are _ it's really a feat,'' Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kory honed that talent as a lawyer for a large, prestigious
firm. When he graduated from law school, he was rewarded with a job
at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher, the law office of such notables as
former U.S. Attorney General William French Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Meiers, a partner at the firm, often chose Kory to work
with him on corporate merger and acquisition matters. He recalled
when a client got a takeover threat. Overnight, Kory needed to
produce a perfect legal document for the client's board of
directors explaining the situation, Meiers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he did,'' Meiers said. ``He was a terrific young lawyer.
No doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kory also surrounds himself with talented people.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy taught at Yale, was a founding faculty member of the
California Institute of the Arts, and has shown his own work in
museums nationwide, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   William McKenzie, the company's treasurer, was the chief
financial officer for a leading concert promoter. Skip Palmer, his
theme park president, was operations director at Disneyland in
California before starting his own company.
</P>
<P>
   Even skeptics of the project were impressed when Kory announced
the hiring of Oz Vice Chairman Ron Bension, who built two Universal
Studios theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say Kory's success in building the Oz team comes from
his ability to win converts.
</P>
<P>
   One convert is Fred Ulrich, a Harvard business school graduate
who is chairman of Buttonwood Capital, an investment bank that is
helping finance Oz. He also serves on the Oz board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich got hooked on Kory when he called him to check out
Altbach's references for a business venture. He was so intrigued by
the man on the phone that he arranged a meeting to talk about Oz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found something magical about Robert's personality,'' Ulrich
said. ``I sometimes call him the Wizard, not in a sham sense, like
the movie. He's very animated, he likes to talk, to listen. He
likes to attract great people to his venture.''
</P>
<P>
   Others find that Kory's personality can alienate some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, Robert is the kind of guy, you either like him or you
don't like him, unfortunately,'' said Joe Vaught, a former Kansas
City, Kan., councilman and current member of the Unified Board of
Commissioners of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Chris Steineger of Kansas City, Kan., said Kory came
off as aloof and cool when they first met in the early 1990s. Kory
didn't offer much of a handshake, either. Since then, Kory has
begun to project a more down-to-earth image and ``he gives a good
handshake now,'' Steineger said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaught, who says he is an Oz investor, says Kory is good at
coming up with ideas, but less successful at presenting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tough time projecting himself,'' Vaught said. ``He
has too much attorney in him.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaught likes Kory, he said. But he acknowledges some missteps
Kory took in the project's early years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, promised financial backing from a Saudi Arabian
prince never came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's been too optimistic,'' Vaught said. ``It's made
him say things he could do that he absolutely couldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   And just as his personality draws and disturbs, the question of
what Kory is able to accomplish polarizes those who know him. MORE

FULL OF EXPECTATION, FRANCHIONE HOPES FROGS DON'T FILL WITH DOUBT
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ When last we left them, they were standing on the
field at the Sun Bowl, hugging the tuba players and wiping the
happy tears from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to long-held belief, TCU beating Southern Cal in
football was not one of the signs of an impending apocalypse. But
it did happen. On that one sunny day in El Paso, the Frogs were
princes.
</P>
<P>
   It was months later, perhaps, when TCU faithful, while wrapping
fish in old copies of the ``Star-Telegram'', noticed the months-old
headlines and gasped, ``Egads. We lost to Rice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Frogs did (14-12 in November). Barely beat Vanderbilt,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the margarita haze of the Sun Bowl upset, indeed, is the
fact that TCU finished 6-5 during the 1998 season. The record says
both everything and nothing about what Dennis Franchione
accomplished in his first year as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Frogs were light years from the half-interested,
1-10 bunch they were in Pat Sullivan's final season. But let's not
make any plans for the Rose Bowl yet, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 15 seasons, a TCU team enters the football
season riding a wave of lofty ambition. The Associated Press and
ESPN/''USA Today'' preseason polls both list the Frogs as noble
also-rans, which is fair enough. TCU is being trumpeted as the
class of the scaled-down WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing this for 27 years,'' Franchione said, ``and
I've been picked last and I've been picked first. And I guess I'd
much rather be picked first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing I have to guard against is the reality that
maybe people have based a little too much on the success of one
game. We still have some teams we didn't conquer last year.''
</P>
<P>
   As Franchione put it, ``We're not too far removed from that 1-10
season.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't trying to say he only had 1-10 talent. Far from it. He
knows the Frogs return 14 starters, enjoy depth at heretofore
wafer-thin places and have a schedule that, on the whole, looms as
roundly digestible.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione just doesn't want the balloon, for whatever reason,
to burst early. One of the remarkable things about his first season
came in convincing his inherited Frogs that they weren't a 1-10
team. In the end, they never quit. They played with heart _ and if
that sounds corny, well, it was a corny season.
</P>
<P>
   One of Franchione's earliest lessons was teaching his team not
to succumb at the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Against Oklahoma in the second week, the Frogs squandered a 9-0
lead in the final 21/2 minutes and fell, 10-9. But they bounced
back in the next game and upset 23rd-ranked Air Force, 35-34.
</P>
<P>
   There were tough losses to SMU, Wyoming and Rice to deal with,
but in the final chapter, there was Franchione on the field after
the Sun Bowl, drenched in Gatorade, posing for pictures with Super
Frog.
</P>
<P>
   It is only human nature, the coach conceded, for people _
players, fans and coaches alike _ to have high expectations. But
Franchione admitted, ``I still worry about their fragile emotional
state at times. I just don't want to see that reappear.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mention Arizona by name. He didn't have to. The
Wildcats are No. 4 in the country in the preseason wire-service
poll released yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   If any foe on the Frogs' 1999 schedule is capable of opening old
wounds, it's Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the Frogs and Franchione have been together for a full year
now. Players seem to believe in this coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   As Franchione said, ``I'd like to think that we've been together
enough that if the ship hits a little rough water, we can overcome
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wackier things have happened, all puns intended. The schedule is
stacked so that, if TCU emerges from its Arizona opener with all
vital organs still intact, the Frogs have a chance to start winning
the next week at Northwestern and keep rolling all the way to
December.
</P>
<P>
   From 1-10 to 10-1 in two seasons. Quit laughing.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be a Nebraska to have a top-10 season. Take
Tulane, which rose from college-football purgatory to an undefeated
season and a No. 7 final ranking last year. The Greenies did it
with sparkling quarterbacking and a schedule laced with cream
puffs.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane was last season's poster child for college-football
parity. Franchione doesn't mind the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that, other than the top 10 or 15 Division-I
schools, there's not that much difference in any of them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a matter of who stays healthy. Who gets off to a
good start and builds the momentum. Who has good feelings about
things. And who has a team that will hold together through
crises.''
</P>
<P>
   That team could be TCU, all giddy expectations notwithstanding.

RYAN'S THANK YOU TO MILLER WAS LONG OVERDUE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While watching television on a recent Sunday afternoon in his
Manhattan apartment, 82-year old Marvin Miller heard his name
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan was saying, ``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, what Ryan did that day became baseball's
version of a political-correctness debate.
</P>
<P>
   Was this the time and place _ standing there on the Cooperstown
podium, giving his Hall of Fame induction speech _ for Ryan to be
recognizing the Godzilla of all union bosses?
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig was on that same podium. Why make the commissioner
squirm uncomfortably on an otherwise joyous day for baseball?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Selig has always ranked high in style points. Formerly
a long-time owner in the game, Bud had to understand better than
most what Ryan was doing and why.
</P>
<P>
   Thanking Marvin Miller is the least any player can do. Better
still, major-leaguers from the late '60s through today should be on
their knees, uttering a prayer of gratitude every time the man's
name is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Which these days is seldom, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take what we have today for granted,'' acknowledged Rangers
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro. ``There is not nearly enough
appreciation for Marvin Miller. Even on a veteran club like ours,
you don't hear Marvin's name enough. And some of the young guys
probably don't even know who he is.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miller retired in 1982 as the executive director of the
Major League Baseball Players Association, he was undefeated,
untied and unscored on in constantly winning negotiating battles
with baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   Everything players have today in terms of salaries and
free-agency freedom, it's all because of Miller's work. Small in
stature, and very distinguished looking, Miller was never heard
raising his voice in anger. Miller's weapon was brain power. He
outfoxed the owners at every negotiating turn.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of family and baseball influences, Ryan thanking Marvin
Miller should have been Nolan's next highest priority. Ryan came
from an era, the late '60s, when he pumped gas in the off-season to
make ends meet. Major-league salaries were that low.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very gracious of Nolan to do that,'' Miller said last
week. ``I was shocked ... he's the first inductee to ever do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller retired 17 years ago. As Palmeiro said, with regret, the
players of today seem to forget him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just human nature,'' said Miller, graciously.
``It's no different than in all walks of life. This is a new
generation of players. I have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was a high-ranking official in the United Mineworkers
union when three desperate major-leaguers approached him in 1966.
That threesome _ Robin Roberts, Jim Bunning and Harvey Kuenn _ ask
Miller to form something totally strange. A players union. As a
baseball fan, Miller agreed. The average pay of players was around
$12,000 a year at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1999, and there are many who will say Miller was
too successful. By drumming the owners repeatedly in negotiations,
he lifted the players from powerless to total power.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Miller disagrees. Ask him when mushrooming salaries
stop, and he answers, ``when the revenue increases for owners stop.
It's a classic case of supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about the big-market/small-market canyon, and Miller
answers, ``there is more competitive balance today than at any time
in baseball history. The big-market/small-market thing has been
going on this entire century. People forget when only the New York
teams _ the Giants, Yankees or Dodgers _ made the World Series.
Until the Yankees recently, we went a lot of years without a New
York team winning the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   My long-standing suggestion _ and I defy anyone to tell me I'm
wrong _ is the owners should hire Miller as their negotiator. Stack
so much money in front of him, he couldn't say no. If baseball
owners had done that in the mid-'80s, the situation would be
different today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miller plays a lot of tennis, writes a column for a
sports business magazine, has a new book in mind, and is updating
his old book, ``A Whole Different Ball Game,'' which is about to be
reissued.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers pitcher Tim Crabtree has read the Miller book. As the
team's union representative, he also passed out 30 copies in the
clubhouse. This is just Crabtree's fourth major-league season,
``but all of us should know what Marvin Miller has meant to the
players,'' he said. ``We have plenty to be thankful for, and he's
the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The one thank-you from Nolan Ryan might have raised certain
eyebrows, but it was a long overdue gesture.

BCS WORKS WELL, FOR NOW, AND THAT'S NO BULL (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's August, the Hot 100 is not just a list of hit songs, the
Rangers are headed for another division title and the Cowboys are
answering the ``character question.'' All that means college
football season is near.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, dear fan, you will be hearing about the same ol' BCS.
That's short for Bowl Championship Series. In its debut season, the
BCS worked perfectly, if luck can be considered perfect. Instead of
one of three undefeated teams howling about being locked out of the
title game, upsets by Texas A&AMP;M and Miami (Fla.) produced a
serviceable Fiesta Bowl matchup of 12-0 Tennessee against 11-1
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS rankings that produced Tennessee vs. Florida State also
produced derision. Terms like ``maximum deviation'' and
``quartiles'' sound like they belong in a college level math class
but were key elements in the BCS formula. When Kramer announced the
BCS was adding five computer rankings this season for a total of
eight byte-driven polls to help determine the rankings, the howls
were loud.
</P>
<P>
   I hit the self-mute button. I don't get a ``Blair Witch
Project'' scare when I hear, read or type the letters B-C-S. I've
got no problem with the current system. Maybe you think the BCS is
BS. Maybe it is. But here's the deal: ``There is no playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS is the best of what Division I-A college football has
and that best is by far better than what it had 10 years ago. No
longer are teams tied to bowl games by conference affiliation. No
longer is the No. 1 team decided only in polls of writers and
coaches whose expertise is limited by ignorance, prejudice and/or
indifference. (Last season, two writers forgot to vote in the
Associated Press poll over Thanksgiving weekend; no big deal, guys.
We're just trying to decide a national championship here, that's
all).
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most fans (and more writers) don't understand how the BCS
rankings work. Perhaps adding more computer polls to the mix adds
to the confusion. The BCS method is better simply because it counts
strength of schedule and uses rankings where performance is
quantified.
</P>
<P>
   If the strength of schedule portion of the BCS formula is the
reason for Arizona at Penn State and Ohio State vs. Miami (Fla.) in
two weeks, then hooray for the BCS and computer chips. If trying to
finish with a perfect record was the only goal, those four teams
would probably be kicking off against Division I-AA teams.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-BCS faction in the media constantly write and harp
about a Division I-A playoff. Frankly, I'd love to see a playoff _
16, eight, four, two teams, whatever. But there's little use
wasting ink about something that's not going to happen any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS contract runs for two more seasons and then could be
renewed for at least another three years. The earliest a I-A
playoff could _ ``could'' happen would be for the 2002 season. More
likely, we could see a playoff starting in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   More and more coaches support a playoff. However, these same
coaches say they want to preserve the current bowl system. Aye,
there's the rub, mate. Few in college football believe that the
bowls would survive in a playoff environment. A playoff plan
proposed by ISL, a Swiss-based marketing company, not only offers
$300 million a year (more than twice the current bowl revenue), it
also has a plan to subsidize a limited number of bowl games. Sort
of like basketball's NIT.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many coaches throw their weight behind a
playoff, the decision will be made by school presidents in the Big
12, Big Ten, Southeastern, Atlantic Coast and Pacific 10
conferences. And while presidents of schools in the bottom half of
I-A are mostly in favor of a playoff (because of share-the-wealth
revenue distribution), the Big Cigars at the Big Schools are not in
favor.
</P>
<P>
   Until there is change among the big schools' leadership, a
college football playoff is a dead issue.

THE MAN BEHIND THE OZ THEME PARK GARNERS LOYALTY AND CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACE HOBSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On a June day in 1984, entertainment lawyer
Robert Kory was introduced to Mike Love, the Beach Boys' lead
singer.
</P>
<P>
   As they sailed near Los Angeles, Love told Kory about the
Washington concert he intended to play on July Fourth, just weeks
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked him (Love) detailed questions, but there were no
detailed answers,'' recalled Ron Altbach, who introduced the two.
</P>
<P>
   Love immediately hired Kory as his attorney, and Kory began
supplying the answers. In two weeks he hammered out contracts with
sponsors and negotiated agreements to allow the concert on the
grounds of the Washington Monument and to get cable coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Beach Boys celebrated Independence Day in front
of 500,000 to 750,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a typical Robert Kory thing where he said, `Yes, I can
do it,' '' Altbach said. ``He never says, `No, I was mistaken.' He
just keeps trying until he gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Kory's drive is the force behind his dream to create something
much greater than a concert: a $771 million Wonderful World of Oz
resort and theme park. He hopes this dream will draw 3 million
people a year to what is now the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant
near De Soto, Kan. He envisions a project more on the scale of
Disney World than Worlds of Fun _ but even better.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics point out that Kory, 50, is an entertainment lawyer
who has never built a theme park, that he is new to the theme park
industry and that Kory originally said the park would open in 1995.
The scheduled opening date is now 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saying, who the heck are these people?'' William Kostar,
the mayor of Westwood, Kan., asked at a Council of Mayors meeting
in March. ``What's their revenue stream? If we were dealing with
Donald Trump or even Wayne Newton, we'd say we have something going
here.''
</P>
<P>
   With more ambition than capital, Kory grabbed onto an idea that
had drifted around the Kansas City area for years.
</P>
<P>
   He secured the rights to the Oz name. He found a huge piece of
unused federal land, the Sunflower site. He attracted a
high-powered firm to sell bonds for the project. He persuaded the
Kansas Legislature to authorize issuance of those revenue bonds and
to direct the park's sales tax revenue to pay off the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of obstacles lie ahead. But Kory's longtime friends and
financial backers are sure he can pull off what naysayers call a
pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   Oz boosters describe a theme park packed with state-of-the-art
attractions designed to tap the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
   The resort, filling 1,750 acres in the initial development
phase, also is to have a 350-room luxury hotel with 50,000 square
feet of conference space, fine-dining restaurants, an RV park and
an 18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The park's theme will center on The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L.
Frank Baum, as well as characters in 39 other Oz books.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether Kory can make the ambitious project
happen. Kory's critics, including Kory's former lawyer, L.D.
McDonald, and his former real estate agent, Bud Roberts, question
his reliability. Some resent him for his dealings with Sandstone
Amphitheatre in Bonner Springs, Kan. Others begrudge him for
courting Wyandotte County, Kan., with promises to build his
lucrative project there before choosing well-off Johnson County,
Kan., to the south.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Robert Kory is selling, I'm not buying,'' said Bonner
Springs Mayor Ted Stolfus.
</P>
<P>
   But from the Johnson County Commission to the Kansas
Legislature, most politicians are buying. Gov. Bill Graves signed a
bill in May that allows the state to issue $270 million in bonds,
to be repaid with sales taxes generated at the park, to help the
project. The state will not guarantee the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds would not be issued until the Kansas Development
Finance Authority approves the project, possibly this fall. The
authority may begin the process to establish a redevelopment
district at the Sunflower site on Sept. 10. The taxing district
must be created before any bonds can be issued.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the heart of all this enterprise remains an enigma.
Is Robert Kory the 21st century's Walt Disney, a visionary with
talent enough to transcend the cynics? Or is this dream out of his
reach?
</P>
<P>
   From his days as a Yale University undergrad, his work as a
self-help book author and his later career as a lawyer, Kory has
assembled a devoted band of loyalists who sell the man and his
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Kory himself does little of the selling. He declined repeated
requests for interviews for this story. Although the Los Angeles
resident often travels to Kansas City to work on this project, he
has spoken publicly about Oz only three times this year, each time
before a small group, according to his spokesman, David Westbrook.
He skipped two well-attended public forums about Oz and never
addressed the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said developers such as Kory often leave the public
relations work to their managers while they build their company and
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Kory's supporters describe him as a workaholic who makes time
for family and church every week. They say he is a man who lives by
a list of values he created for his company, such as truth and
``the highest standards of integrity,'' open communication, a
system of rigorous checks and balances, and the use of conservative
projections to achieve realistic goals.
</P>
<P>
   They see a man who can take an out-there idea and turn it into
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't quit,'' said Robert Baum of Los Angeles, the
great-grandson of the Oz author. MORE

FLORIDA STATE IS AGAIN THE PRESEASON NO. 1, AND THIS SEASON THE
SEMINOLES MIGHT FINISH ON TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picking Florida State as college football's preseason No. 1 is
more akin to tree-hugging than limb-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, with 18 starters returning and quality players at
most key positions, are the ``Star-Telegram'''s choice to win the
national championship. It is familiar territory: Florida State has
been the preseason No. 1 team in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   For all their lofty preseason beginnings, however, the Seminoles
have finished No. 1 once _ 1993. There were near misses in 1995,
1997 and last year.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the Seminoles' year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it means to be ranked No. 1,'' said Florida State
coach Bobby Bowden, whose team lost 23-16 to Tennessee in last
year's national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl. ``No matter
where you start, you've got to go out and do it. We don't hide the
fact that we are No. 1. In fact, we'd like to be No. 1 all the
time. I tell our players that we want to be No. 1 every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being No. 1 in the ``Star-Telegram'' preseason
poll, the Seminoles were selected No. 1 in the Associated Press
(writers) and USA Today/ESPN (coaches) polls. Both polls factor
into the Bowl Championship Series rankings, which are used to
determine the top two teams to play for the title. This year's
national championship game will be played Jan. 4 in the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of those special years,'' said
27-year-old junior quarterback Chris Weinke, who returned to
football after playing minor-league baseball in the Toronto Blue
Jays organization for six years. ``There is some excitement around
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' schedule is championship-friendly. They play
eight of their 11 games in the state of Florida. Their first major
test comes Sept. 11 when Atlantic Coast Conference challenger
Georgia Tech visits. On Oct. 9, Miami (Fla.) travels to Tallahassee
to continue a rivalry that is returning to its previous levels of
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Florida State's most challenging road game comes Oct. 23
when the Seminoles visit Clemson. That game will be the first
father-son coaching matchup in college history _ papa Bobby against
son Tommy. If the Seminoles are undefeated, Bobby Bowden will be
trying to win his 300th game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State ends the season in the usual manner with a game
against bitter rival Florida. This year's game will be in
Gainesville on Nov. 20. The last time the Seminoles won in The
Swamp was 1993 _ the year they won their national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State has finished in the top four in the final polls
for an NCAA-record 12 consecutive years. Even with that amazing
stretch of success, Bowden doesn't sense any complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through the off-season program, you look to see a
bunch of kids slacking off,'' Bowden said ``And I haven't seen
that. They look like they have worked real hard. I see the key this
year as being hungry. Is this team hungry? That's the thing about
being around the top all the time, you are always afraid someone is
going to lose their hunger. We haven't seen any indication of it.''

THE '90S BELONG TO FLORIDA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decade has seen a helmet-full of changes in college football
_ scholarship limitations, overtime, refinement of the postseason
in an attempt to produce a true champion. But there has been one
constant: Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' 97-13-1 record is the best among Division I-A
teams this decade. If Florida State goes 12-0 this season, its
winning percentage in the 1990s will be .890. Since the NCAA
started keeping track of records by decade, the best has been
Oklahoma's .895 in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   So picking Florida State as the preseason No. 1 is more akin to
tree-hugging than limb-climbing. The Seminoles, with 18 starters
returning and quality players at most key positions, are the
``Star-Telegram'''s choice to win the national championship. It is

and last year.
</P>
<P>
   With Chris Weinke at quarterback, a Heisman Trophy candidate in
Peter Warrick, seven starters returning from the nation's top
defense and a championship-friendly schedule, this could be the
Seminoles' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a shocking disappointment if we don't win the
national title,'' tight end Ryan Sprague said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be one of those special years,'' said Weinke, a
27-year-old junior who returned to football after playing
minor-league baseball in the Toronto Blue Jays organization for six

A LITTLE JORDAN MAGIC? (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEDINAH, Ill. _ Mark Brooks closed locker No. 508 at Medinah
Country Club, the one holding his belongings but assigned on a
permanent basis to the club's highest-profile member: Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of Jordan's magic had rubbed off during the PGA
Championship, Brooks laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be now,'' Brooks said yesterday, moments after
acing the 17th hole with a 3-iron from 206 yards. ``Two is the best
score you make in golf. But a one is luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' latest ace, the 15th of his career and first in
competition since The Players Championship in 1997, came on a shot
Brooks thought he had pushed off-line. But the wind carried it
right-to-left, and the ball landed on the collar of the green
before rolling 30 feet and disappearing into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks exchanged high-fives with caddie Van Nunnally and playing
partner Mark James before parring the 18th hole to wrap up a round
of 70 that moved him to 3-under par for the tournament, eight
strokes off the lead and in a tie for 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it the whole way,'' said Brooks, who has not
finished better than 38th in a major since winning the 1996 PGA.
``It hit a dead spot on the collar and released right at it. It's
exciting, but it's just a score. It's a lucky deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd found anything interesting in Jordan's locker,
Brooks said: ``Not so far. But I'll look again before I check
out.'' CINK RISES TOWARD TOP
</P>
<P>
   In past PGA Championships, Stewart Cink had that sinking
feeling. He'd never made a cut in the event before arriving at
Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   But after matching the lowest score of the third round with
yesterday's 68, he finds himself two shots out of the lead, at
9-under. The difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a mental game. Some weeks you have your focus and some
weeks you don't,'' Cink said. ``This week, I've had a good game
plan and a good feeling. And every time I've hit into the trees,
I've made good recoveries.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Six players on the leader board are well-positioned to continue
a trend that has seen 10 of the past 11 PGA winners make the event
their first major championship. The list: co-leader Mike Weir
(11-under), as well as Stewart Cink (9-under), Sergio Garcia
(9-under), Jim Furyk (6-under), Skip Kendall (6-under) and Jay Haas
(6-under).
</P>
<P>
   Today's champion will own bragging rights about defeating the
toughest field since the advent of the world golf rankings. Of the
top 100 players in the rankings, 92 competed at the PGA, the most
ever in a single event.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Turner (4-under), on the best part of playing at Medinah:
``After Carnoustie and Pinehurst, it's nice to see a little red.''
Between them, the two courses that hosted the past two majors saw
one player finish under par (Payne Stewart, 1-under, U.S. Open).
Heading into today's final round, 30 players are under par at the
PGA.

GLORIES OF YOUTH PERISH QUICKLY BUT ENDURE IN MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When I was a young man in the Army, duty once obliged
me to attend a reunion of veterans of the unit in which I then was
serving.
</P>
<P>
   The affair was in New York. It was my first time in such a grand
city. But for all the dazzle of the place, I expected the reunion
itself to be a droll affair: a great gang of graying men, trading
memories enlarged and embellished though many tellings.
</P>
<P>
   It was incredible to me that those old soldiers ever had been
young, which only shows the narrowness of youth's perspective. For
actually they were not so old at all.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly they were veterans of World War II. Their unit, the 82nd
Airborne Division, had distinguished itself in the D-Day campaign
and many of the European theater's other key battles. I'd heard the
stories; they were part of the division's lore. But they were
legends of a conflict I thought of as distant history.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the war had ended only a dozen years before. So a good
many of those veterans would have been in their 40s, a few perhaps
in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Jim Gavin, who'd commanded the division in combat,
addressed the final banquet, and afterward stood an hour speaking
with the men as they passed through the line to shake his hand and
present their wives. I was astonished how many of them he greeted
by their names.
</P>
<P>
   Then the lights in the ballroom dimmed. And Marlene Dietrich
appeared, magnificent in a sequined sheath, to dance the first
dance with Gavin _ and after that with any soldier who had the
nerve to ask.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the veterans of the 82nd Division held another of
their annual gatherings, a three-day affair just up the road in
Omaha, Neb. A demonstration drop of 400 paratroopers was scheduled,
and because my wife had never seen a parachute jump, we decided to
drive up for one evening and part of a day.
</P>
<P>
   That first night there was a hospitality center, with food and
drink. Of the several hundred men and women in the room, perhaps 50
were young soldiers who'd come from North Carolina, assigned to
various convention duties as I once had been.
</P>
<P>
   They peered at us across a gulf of years, courteous as anything
but clearly wondering whether it was possible any of us had ever
been their age. There wasn't a soul in the room I knew, although we
did meet and share a table with a fine couple, Bill and Sally
Bidleman, who've raised their family on a farm near Kinsley, Kan.,
out toward Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning was the jump, and besides the veterans and
their kin, you never saw such a gang of luminaries as those on the
reviewing stand: the governor of Nebraska, at least four mayors, a
whole clutch of three- and four-star officers _ Army, Navy, Air
Force and Marine _ whose various responsibilities I failed to note.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser lights, generals with only one or two stars, sat in a
bunch on folding chairs down below. There were some colonels and
majors, too. And plenty of enlisted folk in camouflage fatigues to
help with the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And something new since my time, a division choral group _ 20 or
so singers, paratroopers every one. Their first number was a
popular tune, ``My Girl.'' The next, with a more direct connection
to the profession of soldiering, was ``America the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came an announcement over the loudspeaker, directing
attention to the sky at right front. Just coming into view was the
first in the line of five large transport planes in which the 400
jumpers, who'd risen in darkness that morning at Fort Bragg, would
now be on their feet and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``One minute out,'' said the voice on the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years rolled away. In my mind, I could hear the
jumpmaster's shouted commands over the engine roar, and hear the
excited drumming of boot soles on the plane's floor.
</P>
<P>
   Several passes over the field the planes made. In groups of 20
and 30 at a time, the 400 parachutes opened like pale olive
blossoms against the sky, each one perfect. And when the spectacle
had ended, the jumpers formed up in columns and marched in from the
drop zone to stand before the people in the bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   O beautiful for patriot dream... the lyric had said. ...God mend
thine every flaw ... and crown thy good with brotherhood...
</P>
<P>
   In those ranks could be seen all the very best of the country, a
country still flawed and not yet quite crowned with brotherhood,
but trying: young men and, yes, young women paratroopers, too.
Black, white, brown and every tone between _ alike in their
competence and their wonderful fitness. Alike, above all, in their
splendid and perishable youth.
</P>
<P>
   I found I had to look away, oddly affected by how short a time
it seemed since I'd stood in those ranks. Then, for an anticlimax,
the generals and the politicians spoke, as they invariably will.
And we drove home.

ABUSIVE FOG OF COCAINE AND ALCOHOL. FOR NEARLY TWO YEARS, HOWEVER,
HE HAS BEEN CLEAN AND SOBER
</HEADLINE>
 
Ex-MAVERICKS STAR ROY TARPLEY LOST A PROMISING NBA CAREER IN AN(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surprise, Roy Tarpley is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   And _ considering the former Dallas Mavericks star choked his
career in cocaine and almost drowned his life in alcohol and was
nearly traded to the home(less) team _ relatively well.
</P>
<P>
   At his best, Tarpley was a likable prankster who used his soft
hands and relentless energy to nip at the elite heels of Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, Patrick Ewing and Hakeem Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   At his worst, he was an irresponsible, paranoid, liar hell-bent
on a blameless, guiltless self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   When a gutted franchise and its fans freed themselves of Tarpley
four years ago, arguably the most talented player in Mavericks
history had just recycled their heartache with an NBA-record second
ejection for drug and alcohol abuse. While the Mavericks gasped at
his departure, he spiraled into an emotionally, physically and
financially bankrupt 7-foot waste of potential perilously close to
slipping right down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley didn't die, but for a while he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Released by a minor-league team on the tiny Mediterranean island
of Cyprus, divorced from his wife, Dawn, and forced to sell his
sprawling house on Lake Lewisville and living in a modest Dallas
apartment paid for by former Maverick-turned-angel Mark Aguirre,
Tarpley spent July 1997-January 1998 in and out of jail. Woozy from
drugs and wobbly from beer, he was arrested six times for abusing
girlfriend Elisha Spacek, whom, according to a Dallas police
report, he once even purposely burned on the arm with a hot clothes
iron during one of their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after Spacek was killed in an automobile accident in
December, Tarpley passed out intoxicated in a car and was taken to
the familiar surroundings of Dallas' Lew Sterrett drunk tank.
</P>
<P>
   When he awoke this time, however, the player who never knew how
good he was on the court finally realized how bad a person he had
become off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time ever, Roy got scared,'' said Aguirre, whom
Tarpley called when he discovered he didn't have enough money to
bail himself out of jail. ``Even through all the stuff before, he'd
always felt invincible. But this was it. He had no money, no food
and no idea where he was going to wind up. That was it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Scared, but more importantly stimulated, Tarpley immediately
heeded Aguirre's advice and completed another rehab stint, moved in
with his mother and resurrected his overseas basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   So close to flat-lining in his coagulation of red, droopy eyes,
the light behind Tarpley's backboard finally popped on.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he's a two-time loser turned two-bit player in a
fourth-rate Greek league earning one-eighth his previous salary.
But for a player who guzzled and snorted himself out of $32 million
and a promising place in the NBA, staying sober enough to hold a
steady job the last 20 months is a major milestone toward Tarpley's
ultimate rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Roy no news is good news, and I haven't heard from him in
a long time, so I'm encouraged, freaked-out encouraged,'' said
Aguirre, who has matured into a savior for Tarpley. ``But I saw him
hit rock-bottom, and it was very, very ugly. He's got a long way to
go, and I don't know if he'll ever really be over the hump. I hope
so. But I wouldn't be shocked to hear from him needing help
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Aguirre and the influence of longtime Mavericks
chaplain Dr. Tony Evans, Tarpley leap-frogged a waiting list two
years long to enter a rehab center in New York. Last summer he
moved in with his mother, in Mobile, Ala., then signed a
swallow-some-pride contract to resume playing in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   After an incident-free, productive season last year, he earned a
promotion _ and a two-year contract worth approximately $1 million
_ to play with Dafni Athens in Greece starting in the 1999-2000
season. In a basketball-rabid country where drug and alcohol
policies are lax, Tarpley has kept his name and nose clean.
</P>
<P>
   Even current Mavericks assistant coach Donnie Nelson, a constant
scout of European basketball, gets reports that Tarpley has been
nothing but impressive lately. Tarpley calls his mother weekly,
hangs out with former Michigan teammate and Cyprus player Richard
Rellford and is winning the fight with his addictions one battle at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a bad history, but for us he caused no problems and
performed well,'' said coach Grivas Dimitris, who saw Tarpley score
24 points a game to lead Cyprus' Apollon Limassol to a 19-3 record
last season. ``He is the complete player, running, jumping,
shooting, rebounding. I guess it's a shame because I don't see many
players in the NBA who have what he has. When he was younger, I can
only imagine how good he was.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, he is the saddest page in the Mavericks' yearbook
and the Metroplex's most expensive waste of potential this side of
the SuperCollider.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that potential and now the first question about him is,
`Is he alive?''' said former Maverick Brad Davis, who played with
and later coached Tarpley. ``It's just so sad, such a waste. I
honestly believe he had the skills to be one of the 50 best players
of all time. There was nothing he couldn't do on the court. Off the
court was another story.'' TICK ... TICK ... TICK Tarpley's
tumultuous eight-year Mavericks career ended Dec. 6, 1995, when he
yanked the short leash of the NBA's aftercare program by testing
positive for alcohol. Though he's been gone longer than the
Southwest Conference, his absence is still ruining the Mavericks'
decade, and his presence still haunts their memory.
</P>
<P>
   Former team owner Don Carter can't hold back the tears when he
talks about Tarpley, and longtime executive Keith Grant simply
won't address the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to succeed so bad I can still taste it,'' said
former general manager Norm Sonju, who keeps a picture of Tarpley
on his desk at home. ``Do I feel some personal responsibility by
him failing? Sure. We all do. No one really understands what went
wrong except Roy, and he'll probably never explain himself. He
never has.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to their public position at the time, the Mavericks
apparently knew all too well about the 21-year-old Tarpley's
addiction problems when they drafted him seventh overall in 1986.
The Mavericks protected Tarpley by having him live with the veteran
Aguirre his first two years in the league, even giving out a phone
number to Tarpley's supposed apartment only to have the line
permanently forwarded to Aguirre's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew he had a massive problem when he got here,''
Aguirre said. ``I think he respected me, and he knew up front that
I wouldn't tolerate any of that garbage in my house. But we had
some hard times. I lost my mom, so when I heard him on the phone
talking to his mother with such disrespect, we came to blows. But
he didn't really flip out until after I was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   While Tarpley stayed straight enough and played well enough to
be named to the NBA's All-Rookie Team in '86-87, the Mavericks
spent sleepless nights leery of a hiccup.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve '86, they paid an employee to knock on
Tarpley's door with a ribbon-wrapped shovel. When Tarpley asked
about the shovel, the employee responded, ``Just a reminder that
you'll be digging ditches with it if you don't stay clean. Merry
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tarpley's first ``strike'' came in July '87 when he
voluntarily entered the league's drug rehab program for cocaine
use. After Aguirre was traded to the Detroit Pistons in '89,
Tarpley moved out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   And trouble moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was at a point where he could handle it,'' Sonju
said. ``But looking back, it was the beginning of the end. It
turned into one of the worst experiences of my life.'' PLAYING WITH
FIRE
</P>
<P>
   Fans and critics put Tarpley's transgressions on pause in the
summer of 1988. A 250-pounder who ran like a sprinter, dribbled
behind his back, sank 18-foot jumpers and created a trademark of
tipping rebounds away from opponents until he latched onto the
ball, his career peaked when he was named the league's Sixth Man of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first reserve in NBA history to finish among the
top 10 rebounders, and his 21-point, 20-rebound performance against
Abdul-Jabbar pushed the Mavericks to a pulsating Game 4 victory
over the Lakers and tied the gripping Western Conference Finals
series (eventually won by L.A. in seven) at two games each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not kidding, he was physically one of the best ever to
play this game,'' said John Lucas, a recovering drug addict who
last year served as an assistant coach with the Denver Nuggets.
``There were nights when Kareem wanted no part of him, when he
totally outplayed \RSan Antonio Spurs center\S David Robinson. He
was Dennis Rodman as far as loose balls, rebounds and defense, but
he'd also score 20 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he not cratered to a multi-million-dollar six-pack, Tarpley
would be a free agent after the 2000 season and likely one of the
best players on a Mavericks team desperately seeking size in the
middle. While still drinking in 1994-95, he averaged 12 points and
8.5 rebounds, numbers current coach Don Nelson would probably love
to have from center Shawn Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad truth is he was a hell of a player even when he wasn't
sober,'' former teammate Jason Kidd said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his destruction and disregard, the Mavericks
haven't had a playoff game or even a winning season since Tarpley's
first banishment, Oct. 16, 1991. But instead of a eulogy about his
on-court prowess, etched on his NBA tombstone is the fact that he's
one of only eight players ever kicked out of the league. And the
only one twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had his life in order he could have been Michael Jordan,
because he had that charisma, that talent,'' said former Mavericks
assistant Clifford Ray, assigned solely to keep hourly tabs on
Tarpley from 1988-91. ``I've gotten on my knees many nights to pray
for him to find peace within himself and break free of those
bonds.'' THE MULTI-MILLION MIRAGE
</P>
<P>
   Before Tarpley could market himself as a household name with his
play, he dug himself a reputation with his partying. And
eventually, his immense raw talent was swallowed by his insatiable
drug demons.
</P>
<P>
   In January of '89, Tarpley received ``strike two'' in the NBA's
anti-drug program when he again voluntarily sought help from league
drug counselors for his cocaine addiction. After a string of DWI
arrests, domestic-abuse charges and missed team functions, he was
kicked out of the league for the first time when he refused to take
a drug test in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fell victim to the four F's: fame, fortune, free time and a
feeling of invincibility,'' said Lucas, who later coached Tarpley
in '92 in the United States Basketball League. ``His best asset was
also his worst detriment in that he never surrendered on the court
or off the court to drugs. He had a disease, but no one could see
it was terminal because there were no tumors, and no pill or chemo
could get rid of it. It killed him slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   After his first suspension, Tarpley spent three years playing in
Greece, the USBL and the Continental Basketball Association before
petitioning for reinstatement to the NBA in the summer of 1994.
Having sat the minimum two years in the penalty box and then
passing a face-to-face meeting with commissioner David Stern in New
York, Tarpley was allowed back into the league.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a move that ranks as one of the nicest and worst in
professional sports history and earned Carter the label of
``enabler,'' the Mavericks' huge-hearted owner not only welcomed
Tarpley back, but rewarded him with a six-year, $26 million
contract in October '94. While critics blamed Carter for risking
tomorrow's promise on yesterday's problem, the sentimental man in
the 10-gallon hat rejoiced in Tarpley's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a son to me,'' Carter said. ``I got second chances
in life, and I thought Roy deserved another chance, too. I felt
with all my heart that he could change, that he would change.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of changing, Tarpley only switched addictions from
cocaine to alcohol. Three weeks after signing his contract, he got
a ticket for driving 92 mph on the Dallas tollway. An hour later,
he plowed his Mercedes into a light pole, then denied he had been
driving the car that night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite injuries and suspensions after blow-ups with Grant and
coach Dick Motta, Tarpley became a key performer on Dallas' best
team of the 90s _ one that went 36-46 and seemed to be assembling
impressive pieces in Jim Jackson, Jamal Mashburn, Kidd and himself.
SCARY SIGNS
</P>
<P>
   But, like the calm before a storm, Tarpley's productive games
were only an appetizer for nights of binging on booze.
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley became moody, alternating days of cheerfully taking
teammates to lunch with whopping cover-ups that made Richard
Nixon's tale look like a little white fib. He blamed fits of wobbly
posture and slurred speech on everything, including Nyquil, Tabasco
sauce, natural mood swings, even residual anger from dropping a
water bottle on his toe.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour before a game in '95, Tarpley stood stark
naked in front of his locker swaying back and forth trying to pick
a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to like me,'' he slur-bellowed to no one in
particular. ``I don't care. But if you don't, I'll meet you at
Chuck E. Cheese's and we'll settle it.'' After a spurt of
uncontrollable laughter, he continued. ``But I don't care. I live
in a big house on a big lake with a big boat ... I just don't
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it was painfully obvious to teammates that he was too
drunk to recognize Popeye Jones from Popeye the Sailor Man, Tarpley
played and played terribly in that night's game and several more.
</P>
<P>
   When pushed for answers about Tarpley's peculiar behavior, the
NBA and its drug counselors claimed he was passing regular tests
for alcohol. In reality, he had discovered a way to beat the
system. According to a league source, he figured out he was only
tested on Mondays. Therefore, he wouldn't drink on weekends so his
system would show up clean, then began a binge on Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``A random test probably would have caught him a lot sooner,''
said former Mavericks team physician Dr. T.O. Souryal, who oversaw
Tarpley's rehab from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in '90.
``But it was just a matter of time. The Mavericks tried everything
in their power to help Roy, and he turned his back on them every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarpley tip-toed through the system in '94-95 but never played
in a Mavericks uniform again. He spent 32 days in the hospital the
following summer with pancreatitis, an ailment the Mavericks knew
was caused by excessive alcohol use but one he blamed on ``too much
spicy food, too much Tabasco.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the request of the Mavericks, the NBA pulled a
surprise Wednesday test. Hours before tip-off of their game in
Philadelphia, news hit the Mavericks locker room that Tarpley,
still on the injured list and back home in Dallas, had finally
drank himself dormant.
</P>
<P>
   He was paid $665,000 for the season, but his suspension voided
the remaining five years and $22 million of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more relief than sadness at that point,'' said Motta,
who suspended Tarpley seven times in six seasons. ``I gave Roy the
25-cent speech, the one dollar speech, the lecture from the heart,
and it was like talking to a brick wall.'' THE AFTERMATH
</P>
<P>
   Assessing the damage rendered by Hurricane Roy is difficult
because some former team officials believe it's still ongoing.
Tarpley's two swirling visits through Dallas obliterated
potentially numerous Mavericks playoff appearances, which in turn
cost them national television appearances, advertising dollars,
season-ticket holders and, eventually, employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real shame the Mavericks ever laid eyes on him,'' Motta
said. ``He was a bad guy that ruined it for a lot of good people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks' demise into the NBA cellar was nothing, however,
compared to Tarpley's impending implosion.
</P>
<P>
   After a failed stint overseas in which his drinking led to
sub-par play and an eventual release from Cyprus, Tarpley returned
to Dallas in the summer of '97 and climaxed his abusive
relationship with the 23-year-old Spacek. Aguirre quietly bailed
him out of jail on three separate arrests for hitting, choking and
threatening to kill Spacek from July to November.
</P>
<P>
   On each arrest report, Tarpley listed his occupation as ``Pro
basketball player'' and his employer as ``unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to sell the house; I had to take over his debts and set
him up in an apartment,'' Aguirre said. ``There were nights where I
have no idea where he slept and, believe me, I don't want to know.
It was almost out of control at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   That December, Spacek flipped her BMW on Dallas' LBJ Freeway. As
she stumbled onto the shoulder attempting to flag down help, a Ford
Explorer hit and killed her as she talked to Tarpley on her cell
phone. He thought it was only the phone that went dead.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week later, Aguirre said Tarpley experienced his
face-plant into rock-bottom. With Aguirre's help, Tarpley landed a
lawyer, a patched-up relationship with his mother and yet another
chance to save his life. Out of jail and back from rehab, Tarpley
phoned Dallas police last August asking if he could get his clothes
out of Spacek's totaled car.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Roy Tarpley left Dallas for good. RE-BIRTH OR
REPEAT?
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly twisted in the Terrible Tale of Tarpley,
Carter-the-good-Christian wound up carrying blame for letting
Tarpley fall while Aguirre-the-one-time-malcontent is credited with
helping him back to his feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I did was done because I cared about Roy so much, out of
love,'' Carter said. ``But seeing how it all turned out, it's easy
to say I wish we'd done things differently. I still care about him,
but Roy's one of my most painful failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre last saw Tarpley a year ago, when the two worked out
together and ``you could just see in his eyes he was clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Aguirre and his agent, George Andrews, Tarpley declined
to be interviewed. Though eligible to apply for reinstatement, he
has no immediate plans for a comeback in the NBA. Even if he did,
Stern would have to make the unprecedented, and unlikely, move of
granting re-admission to the league's only two-time substance abuse
loser.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tarpley is apparently content with staying out of
trouble and the limelight while trying to clear his reputation, and
his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scars and the heartache here ... they'll never heal,''
Aguirre said. ``I don't think he'll ever be back in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, just being alive is the perfect place for Roy
Tarpley. nn

COWBOYS LINEBACKERS KNOW NOTHING IS CERTAIN (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The starters are etched in stone: Dexter
Coakley at weakside linebacker, Randall Godfrey patrols the middle
and Quentin Coryatt, whenever he gets healthy again, will tackle
the strong side.
</P>
<P>
   Dat Nguyen, the fearless fan favorite, is assured a spot as a
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Then it gets sticky.
</P>
<P>
   For Darren Hambrick, Myron Smith, Nate Hemsley, Robert Thomas _
even throw in surprise TCU rookie free-agent Joe Phipps _ there is
nothing quite like realizing that three of them likely won't make
it to the Sept. 12 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but think about ... You become a unit, a family
in there,'' Coakley said. ``But you know everyone can't make the
squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches are thrilled with the talented linebacker
overflow this training camp. In a reversal from recent camps, this
one is stocked with more quality candidates than Lake Wichita
yields catfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a hard decision to cut any of those
players,'' said Hemsley, a burgeoning special-teams player last
year until a fractured ankle in Week 3 ended his season.
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for some interesting and intense practice sesssions
among a group that shares similar characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young, and they're fast,'' defensive coordinator Dave
Campo said. ``I really think this is the best group we have had in
long time as far as speed, the hungriness and the competitiveness
of this bunch. I really feel like it's going to be a real tough
deal at the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired special-teams play and versatility to play other
positions will eventually separate team members from the NFL's
unemployed. Coach Chan Gailey said he will keep five to seven
linebackers on the roster. In recent years the Cowboys have gone
with the minimum of five and opted to bolster the defensive
backfield simply because of better special-teams players at the
position. Campo said that trend is quickly reversing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the quality of the players making the evaluation
process difficult, but injuries are also hampering things. Coryatt
hasn't practiced at full speed, and Hemsley is still undergoing
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind,'' Hambrick said, ``all we can do is control what
we can control, and that's what we do on the field. You have to be
consistent. It's tough getting out there knowing it's your big
evaluation period.''
</P>
<P>
   Hambrick, entering his second NFL season, is the closest thing
to a lock outside of Nguyen. The second-round draft pick out of
South Carolina is aggressive and athletic, which showed in his
special-teams play last season when he finished second on the team
in special-teams tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Hemsley, if he can return to full strength, is the favorite to
nail down the sixth and likely final linebacker spot. He hopes to
impress enough to earn playing time on special defensive packages
such as nickel schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just competing against each other as linebackers,
we're also competing against DBs and wide receivers for
\Rspecial-teams\S spots,'' Hemsley said. ``It's set who's going to
be starting; the other six guys or whatever it is have to go out
there and work.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who recorded seven tackles in the exhibition opener
against Cleveland, is also clearly in the mix. He played on special
teams and on goal-line defenses last year, then played this spring
for the Rhein Fire of NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Smith, who was on the team last year but did not play, has
his work cut out, while Phipps is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, by far, is one of the better units I've seen since I've
been here,'' Coakley said.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is who will remain.

The Glen could halt D.J.'s roll (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Two-time NASCAR Winston Cup champion Terry
Labonte says current points-leader Dale Jarrett is on a
NASCAR-certified ``roll.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the history in this sport, you'll see
people who will get on `rolls,''' said Labonte, the native Texan
who won championships in 1984 and 1996. ``You've seen Rusty
Wallace, Bill Elliott, Dale Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon, Darrell Waltrip
and Cale Yarborough do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``D.J.'s on that deal right now. They can't make no mistakes.
Everything they do is right. Everything is clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he never has won a Winston Cup road race, Jarrett will
carry a 274-point lead over Mark Martin into today's Frontier at
The Glen.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2.45-mile, 11-turn Watkins Glen International road
course never has been particularly forgiving to Jarrett, who will
start ninth. That is an improvement of 20 spots for Jarrett from
the season's first road race, at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma,
Calif., on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 races at WGI, Jarrett's best finishes have been
fifth-place results in 1991 and 1998. He finished sixth at Sears
Point in June.
</P>

   ``There are some guys who are faster than we are, and that
certainly makes a difference here,'' said Jarrett, driver of the
No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus. ``We've made our
car better. It seems like we're still two or three tenths \Rof a
second\S off, which is a lot closer on a road course than it is on
ovals. But we're running good enough that if we make the right
choices, and the breaks go our way, then yeah, it \Rvictory\S could
happen.'' nn

EARNHARDT ADDS TO MYSTIQUE WITH 600TH CONSECUTIVE START (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ With little hoopla outside of a
commemorative T-shirt, Dale Earnhardt will make his 600th
consecutive career NASCAR Winston Cup start today at Watkins Glen
International.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance in the Frontier at The Glen will put Earnhardt in
further exclusive company. Only Richard Petty, NASCAR's all-time
leader in victories with 200, and Earnhardt have won seven Cup
titles. And only native Texan Terry Labonte and Earnhardt have
strung together 600 consecutive Cup starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make a statement that you've been around for a
while,'' said Earnhardt, who qualified 14th in the 43-car field for
the 90-lap event today. ``I don't feel any older \Rthan 48\S, for
sure. I'm excited about racing and feel good about racing. It's a
pretty monumental thing to see 600 starts.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly speaks well for NASCAR Class of 1979 teammates
Labonte and Earnhardt. Between them, they have won nine
championships, 47 poles, 93 races and nearly $56 million.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte is NASCAR's undisputed ``Ironman,'' having started 623
consecutive races since becoming a full-time Cup driver in '79.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big accomplishment, especially when so many of these
other guys out here come up and say something to you about it,''
said Labonte, a 42-year-old native of Corpus Christi. ``Because the
guys that have been doing it for only two or three or five years,
they know how tough it is. That's what makes you feel good, the
fact that everybody in this garage area knows how tough it is to
accomplish that. And to reach that number is something that not a
lot of guys will have an opportunity to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An injury suffered in a wreck at Pocono (Pa.) Raceway forced
Earnhardt to sit out four of 31 races in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, we'd probably be tied neck-and-neck for this
deal,'' Earnhardt said, referring to Labonte.
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, a two-time Cup champion, said he is pleased to have
Earnhardt join him in the 600 Club _ albeit as a solid No. 2
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Dale,'' said Labonte, who will
start 10th on the 2.45-mile, 11-turn road course. ``He's one of the
guys that when you retire[ that] you'll be proud you raced
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that, Labonte said, is because racking up numbers like
these has been incidental[ for himself and Earnhardt].
</P>
<P>
   ``You go out every week and do your job and do it the best you
can,'' said Labonte, driver of the No. 5 Kellogg's Chevrolet Monte
Carlo. ``I know he's the same way I am. If he didn't think he could
go out and win, he wouldn't do it. That chance for another
championship ... I mean, I know I want to win another championship
awful bad. He does too because he's stuck right there with Richard.
That's what drives you.
</P>
<P>
   ``This other record is something that just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Earnhardt and Labonte have seen their yearly victory totals
dip this decade but insist that is not tied to either diminishing
skills or commitment. Earnhardt arguably was near the top of his
game in 1990, when he won nine races and his fourth championship.
But he went winless in 1997 before logging his[ overdue] first
Daytona 500 victory, in 1998. Earnhardt's[ most recent, and] only
victory of 1999 at the Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway in April was
the 72nd of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so competitive in Winston Cup racing today,'' said
Earnhardt, driver of the No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevy.
``It's tougher to win than it's ever been. Look at me. We were on
top so long. We got sidelined with some things, and it's taken time
to get back on the game. You can't put your finger on it. Why do
you go out and race and not win, and why all of a sudden do you
win? How do you judge if it's the car or the driver or the crew
chief or the engine guy or components in between? One day you're on
top of the world, and the next day you're not winning, and somebody
is ready to retire you.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt said he and team owner Richard Childress, with whom
Earnhardt has won six of his seven titles, are working on a
contract extension that will carry them into the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard and I have a great relationship, and there's not been
any talk of retirement between us at all,'' Earnhardt said.
Goodwrench and he and I are working all the details out for our
agreement for three more years after the year 2000. We're going to
keep racing and go forward. We still feel like we can win
championships and win races. So, that's where we're at.'' nn

   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ with their own.
</P>
<P>
   What's unclear is how comfortable Sprint would be joining forces
with either partner, both of whom are lumbering bureaucracies just
awakening from long tenures as monopolies. Neither company is as
nimble as Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   With his focus on the company's share price, Esrey appears
disinclined to let either company increase its stake in Sprint
without a full buyout, if only because it might make Sprint less
appealing to other suitors.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sprint needs an international presence, and
could use a partner with deep pockets to fund its initiatives in
the United States. In the next few years, the company will need to
invest billions to upgrade its nationwide, $10 billion Sprint PCS
network to expand coverage and provide third-generation wireless
services, which incorporate high-speed data.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is investing heavily in its Integrated
On-Demand Network, a bundled package of voice and data services
that it eventually hopes to offer to customers throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts applaud the strategy of Sprint. But they question
how Sprint will keep pace with competitors without borrowing
heavily or issuing new shares, both of which would lean heavily on
the company's earnings and stock price. The answer they reach is
inevitably a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Deutsche Telekom got hold of Sprint, it would be all about
injecting capital and expanding the business, not a contraction,''
said Andrew Moffatt, an analyst with ABN Amro in London.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts are betting on the Germans as Sprint's ongoing
partner in Global One, if not its owner. The company has more cash.
And it is openly shopping for international deals to reduce its
reliance on the German market, where competition has reduced
long-distance prices by 35 percent in the last year and slashed its
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint would clearly be a large deal, a logical but expensive
move that Deutsche Telekom might have difficulty swallowing so soon
after its deal to acquire One2One. Also, there would be few
opportunities for cost-cutting synergies. Sprint already operates a
leaner business than the German company, and they have few
overlapping operations.
</P>
<P>
   That would be positive for Kansas City, Sprint employees and
vendors in the event of an acquisition. To date, most analysts have
been pairing Sprint off with domestic companies such as BellSouth,
which probably would eliminate redundant operations, consolidate
purchasing and take control of the operation to another city.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign buyer probably would leave Sprint's operations intact,
if not untouched. And, as with the merger of Chrysler and
Daimler-Benz, the company would need a U.S. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, in the Kansas City area.

SPRINT'S ROLE IN MERGER WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE ALL BAD FOR KANSAS
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Kan. _ Psychologically, it ranks right up there with
the possibility of the Kansas City Royals someday leaving town.
Economically, it could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   What if Sprint Corp. of Westwood _ the area's largest private
employer, one of its few Fortune 500 companies and a real estate
linchpin _ gets swept up in the next round of telecommunications
mergers?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a headline that any economic development specialist in
the region would dread waking up to,'' said Doug Luciani, senior
vice president of economic development and growth at the Greater
Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most telecommunications analysts think it's
inevitable. But even if Sprint ends up in a merger, that doesn't
necessarily mean the end of the company's presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint simply lacks the size, analysts say, to compete in an
industry increasingly dominated by giants, where every new
opportunity comes with a multibillion-dollar price tag.
</P>
<P>
   With each new megamerger, Sprint Chief Executive William T.
Esrey meets the inevitable speculation about his company with a
stock response: Sprint ``has everything it needs to compete'' _
alone.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he says the company's board is bound to
listen to offers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an impending merger resurfaced recently with the
latest round of unconfirmed reports that Europe's largest phone
company, Deutsche Telekom, is in takeover talks with Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   According to the German media, senior managers at Deutsche
Telekom say the company, which already owns 10 percent of Sprint,
``has the home straight in sight'' in talks to increase that stake
_ widely seen as a steppingstone to a full buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom and Sprint refuse to comment on what they
characterize as speculation. But part of the media accounts were
borne out when Deutsche Telekom announced plans to buy the British
wireless company One2One.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom Chief Executive Ron Sommer described the
One2One deal as a first step in the company's global expansion
plans, which will include a foothold in the world's largest
communications market: the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for us to not go after large mergers,''
Sommer said in a news conference Monday in London. ``We won't
become a global player if we are not equally footed in the U.S. and
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers think a Sprint buyout is a plausible scenario,
especially once Sprint, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom have
extricated themselves from their troubled international joint
venture, Global One.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Global One alliance likely to fall apart, the odds
are rather high that Deutsche Telekom buys out France Telecom's
stake in Sprint ... to own 20 percent of Sprint,'' Jack Grubman, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, wrote in a recent research report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't completely shock us if Deutsche Telekom ... over
time decides to buy all of Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   In parochial terms, a European offer for Sprint may be one of
the best alternatives for Kansas City, which is loath to see
control of its largest private employer slip local moorings. If
there is a merger, a foreign buyer is seen as much more likely than
a domestic one to maintain a large Kansas City presence.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Global One is coming undone.
</P>
<P>
   Originally billed as a model of global telecommunications
alliances, Global One is now described by industry analysts as a
three-headed monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an industry analyst based
in Atlanta. ``It clearly illustrates how sticky these alliances can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Global One is working to a degree. With a presence in
65 countries and more than $1.1 billion in revenue, the 3-year-old
venture has made big strides to become a one-stop shop for
multinational companies seeking voice, data and networking services
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, however, has been dogged from the start by
larger-than-expected losses, management turnover and the
difficulties of sewing together complex phone networks built by
three different companies.
</P>
<P>
   The venture also has been marred as the partners struggle to
share their most lucrative customers, bill one another for calls on
their respective networks and try to pursue new international
opportunities on their own.
</P>
<P>
   From Sprint's vantage, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are
establishing new ventures _ together and alone _ that could compete
directly with Global One, most notably an Italian phone company
called Wind.
</P>
<P>
   Esrey calls the Global One difficulties a ``misalignment'' and
talks in terms of ``restructuring the ownership interests.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the partners in Global One is eager to lose its stake in
the alliance, which is a valuable asset in spite of its troubles.
But the companies are currently negotiating who will sell what.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance isn't dissolved, it's clear that Sprint won't be
the one left sitting alone on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any European phone company that wants to be global has to have
access to the United States,'' said Peter Roe, an analyst with
Paribas in London. ``There's going to be a reckoning at Global One,
and the gem in that reckoning is the relationship with Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   For a European company looking for a beachhead in the United
States, there are few better targets than Sprint, which overnight
would offer a huge position in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Europeans already know what Sprint looks like from
the inside. They know Sprint's networks, back-office operations and
management team, and how they would meld with their own. MORE

MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS REMEMBER THEIR COMRADES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES and MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ First, some etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   The 155 living American veterans who hold the Medal of Honor,
this country's highest decoration for valor in action against an
enemy force, never describe themselves as ``winners'' of the medal.
</P>
<P>
   They are, instead, recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Second, anyone meeting the 20 Medal of Honor recipients who are
in Kansas City this week for the Veterans of Foreign Wars national
convention shouldn't expect to hear war stories.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing heard when these veterans gather is any talk of
that particular hill, bunker or pillbox.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis, instead, is on love of country and humility. The
humility, however, will be in inverse proportion to the remarkable
acts of valor described in their citations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is one Medal of Honor recipient who
feels he is a hero,'' said Donald Ballard of North Kansas City,
Mo., a former U.S. Navy corpsman who received his decoration after
throwing himself on a grenade to protect comrades in Vietnam in
1968. The grenade failed to detonate, and he continued fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will all echo the same sentiment, that `I am not a hero.'
We just saw the need to do what we did at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Honor recipients were to attend a VFW convention
gala Sunday at Bartle Hall in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Though the VFW has brought the 20 recipients to Kansas City,
it's not the only time Medal of Honor recipients gather. The
national Congressional Medal of Honor Society, which promotes
camaraderie among the recipients, holds an annual convention.
</P>
<P>
   Through these and similar events, many of the recipients have
grown close over the years by virtue of their one defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   They've had the chance to reflect on where they found the
courage on that one day, how their lives have changed since, what
they now have in common, how important it is to live their lives in
a manner befitting the medal, and _ finally _ the mystery of why
they survived when so many of their friends did not.
</P>
<P>
   The last question is especially vexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to heaven, one of my first questions to God will
be, `Why me?' '' said Hershel Williams of Ona, W.Va., who serves as
chaplain of the medal's national society. Williams received his
medal for his actions in the early days of the Iwo Jima landing in
February 1945 when he, then a Marine corporal, cleared a critical
path through Japanese forces with a flamethrower.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of Marines who died in the process of
giving me protection, so why did I survive when so many around me
did not?'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been a purpose. Perhaps God is using me for
speaking about how great this country is and how fortunate we are
to have been born in America.''
</P>
<P>
   A request that recipients often hear is to describe the
reservoir of inner fortitude they have in common.
</P>
<P>
   But David Dolby of Oaks, Pa., an Army veteran who received his
medal from actions in Vietnam in 1966, insisted that recipients
were normal in every way, except perhaps for that one instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we're all equal,'' he said. ``We all did things that, if
we had chosen not to do, nobody would have said we should have
done. We all had that one moment in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that, we're just normal people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many recipients also think they must conduct their lives in a
manner befitting the medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since receiving the medal, we have received along with it a
tremendous responsibility to maintain the dignity of the medal,''
said Joseph Rodriguez of El Paso, Texas, an Army veteran who
received his medal for actions in Korea in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The Medal of Honor dates back to 1861, when Abraham Lincoln
approved it as a way to reward gallantry in action.
</P>
<P>
   In the 138 years since, the United States has been militarily
involved in the Civil War, two world wars, Vietnam, Korea and
dozens of smaller conflicts. Still, out of the millions of
Americans who have served their country, only 3,410 have received
the award. Nineteen veterans have received the honor twice.
</P>
<P>
   Harry S. Truman once remarked, ``I would rather have that medal
than be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The standards for receiving the medal are high enough that in
1916, the Army stripped 911 past recipients of their medals, ruling
that their deeds had not been sufficiently ``heroic.'' Among those
who lost their medals was Mary Walker, a physician who served as a
surgeon during the Civil War and is listed as the only woman to
ever receive it. Her medal was reinstated in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients today wear the medal only on occasions they deem
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   For civilian attire, many recipients display a lapel pin that
can be worn in lieu of hanging the medal around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   But some recipients in recent years have found themselves
wearing the actual medal more often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear it more frequently now because of the support of the
country,'' Ballard said. ``Since Desert Storm, people have started
to appreciate the military again.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams agreed, adding that recipients wear the medal not to
honor themselves but their comrades, many of whom fell beside them
in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all have in common the idea that even though we
were awarded the Medal of Honor, it actually belongs more to others
than it does to us.''

MRS. MILLER EXPOSES THE NAKED TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm speaking with one of the many Mrs. George Millers in town
who does NOT pose naked and have sex ``live'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Mrs. George Millers from the metropolitan area, this
one has received a number of telephone calls lately from
individuals who believe they've seen pictures of her on their
computer, or who would like to see pictures of her, or who would
like to do things with her that Mrs. Miller finds repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television stations and radio stations from all over have been
leaving messages on our machine,'' she says. ``George Miller is a
fairly common name. There are a lot of us in the area. Still, it's
disgusting to me how the media has given these two people so much
attention. And worse, makes them out to be victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miller is referring to George and Tracy Miller, the married
nurses who lost their jobs at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn because
they operate an X-rated Web site in which Nurse Tracy plays doctor
with Nurse George for any computer owner willing to pay them $15 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses say they've placed their privates on public display
in order to put their two children through college. &QL; 
NEED A 2ND JOB? &QL; 
``That's just ridiculous,'' the fully clothed Mrs. Miller says.
``First of all, with what they earn (reported to be a combined
$92,000 a year) they don't need a second job to send their kids to
college. Besides, if you're looking for outside work, is this
something the parents of small children should do?''
</P>
<P>
   Only if they want put them through hell before putting them
through school.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Nurse George told me his 11-year-old son had not
been adversely affected by what his parents do in front of the
camera. As for the couple's 5-year-old daughter, Nurse George says
she's too young to comprehend the naked truth. Or is it the bare
facts?
</P>
<P>
   The raw details? The particulars?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter. I suspect that among the Miller kids'
classmates, there's a computer wiz who'll eventually uncover the
family enterprise and expose the youngsters to the mom and dad's
hard-core business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sad part to me,'' the well-attired Mrs. Miller
says. ``And it's so unnecessary. This isn't about the First
Amendment or about rights on the job. If you're a parent, your
first job is your kids. These people are thinking about only one
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (No, it's not sex. That's what their customers think about.) &QL; 
ALL ABOUT MONEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nurses are thinking about money.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the 1990s is defined by money and nothing else. A
pair of nurses who become millionaires having sex on the Internet
could get a book deal, a movie deal, stories in ``People''
magazine, talk show interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Respectability.
</P>
<P>
   After all, no one in my business is particularly interested in
the many George Millers who don't have an X-rated Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I put two daughters through college when we
were earning less than the nurses,'' the neatly dressed Mrs. Miller
says. ``You're not just giving kids an education, you're passing on
a legacy about behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Mr. and Mrs. George Millers live quietly, avoid publicity,
and work with their clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Nurse Tracy and Nurse George are in the news,
however, other George Miller families can expect to receive unusual

   It is the nature of racist groups to disavow isolated acts of
violence while creating a psychological climate capable of
triggering aggressive outbursts by impressionable young people or
unstable adults, Simonelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all kinds of manuals for urban terrorism,'' he said.
``These tend to be indictments of the Jews that would lead an
unstable person to take the next step to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They never come out explicitly and say, `Kill Jews, blow up
synagogues,' but what they do instead is draw a picture of the
supposed cataclysm that is coming and how everything we value is
being destroyed by the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically they end with a question like, `Who will stand up
for the white race?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The ``lone wolf'' strategy of providing incendiary materials to
a susceptible person to push them toward violence was adopted by
The Order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Order provided the impetus for the lone wolf
actions,'' &UR;  &LR; said Flynn, the Denver-based expert on the violent
white supremacists.
</P>
<P>
   The Order's founder, Robert Mathews, had recruited about 40
people into his ranks and kept a detailed list of the members.
During a shootout in Oregon with federal authorities, he dropped
the incriminating evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from that was to not write down members' names and
to form smaller cells. But even small cells could be broken up by
law enforcement,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That led to what's known as leaderless resistance with
independent actors. You can't infiltrate one guy like Buford
Furrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Under intense scrutiny from law enforcement agencies and civil
rights organizations, the groups have turned to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Hatred is promoted on a growing number of Web pages, many of
which are designed to mimic educational sites or child-friendly
fare.
</P>
<P>
   A recent review by the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles
found about 1,500 objectionable sites around the world. Using
different standards, the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery
Ala., a not-for-profit, public-interest law firm, counted about 300
U.S. sites.
</P>
<P>
   Cyberspace has increasingly become an inexpensive way to promote
racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if you were someone who lived in a small
community and you didn't know other racists, you probably thought
you were warped and sick,'' the ADL's Galatzan said. ``Now, with
what's on the Internet, you have a virtual racist community. You
can easily get to stuff that validates what you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti on synagogues in the communities of West Hills and
Northridge vandalized a year ago included Web page addresses for
the National Alliance, a West Virginia-based hate group that the
ADL has identified as the nation's most dangerous. A similar link
was made between the group and anti-Semitic fliers distributed in
the Valley about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   National Alliance leader William Luther Pierce was U.S. Nazi
leader Rockwell's right-hand deputy. After Rockwell's assassination
in 1967, Pierce adopted a more violent philosophy, Simonelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Simonelli said the new racists' tactics and the violent acts of
the past year should stir the country to action using a campaign of
intensive education, public awareness and monitoring of hate
groups' activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a terrible tragedy if we don't learn the lesson
that these things are teaching us: That these people who hold these
views are changing their tactics and becoming more violent while
staking out a new presence among the disaffected, especially the
young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't sit by while people of fascist mentality demonize and
victimize groups. It doesn't go away or get any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support free speech entirely, but I want the freedom to
condemn the groups for what they are, as groups that are out to
destroy everything that's good in this society.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   David Lehrer, ADL regional director in Los Angeles, said racist
acts are increasingly ``bizarre,'' indicating the movement's
``desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had delusions 25 years ago that if the moment came, their
message could have a receptive audience in the vast heartlands of
America, but they've figured out that's not going to happen,''
Lehrer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast bulk of Americans are beyond their reach. So they
focus on younger people, the disgruntled, militia, skinheads.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Richard Butler, the 81-year-old head of the
Idaho-based Aryan Nations, recalled Furrow as a ``nice, affable
person,'' who studied Scripture at his Church of Jesus Christ
Christian several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Butler performed the marriage ceremony for Furrow and Debra
Mathews, the widow of Robert Mathews, the founder of the neo-Nazi
group The Order who died in 1984 following an FBI standoff in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a former Lockheed engineer from suburban Whittier,
attracted people like Furrow - a former resident of Rosamond near
Edwards Air Force Base - with deep antipathy for the racial
diversity of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of recent arrivals to the Aryan Nations'
compound and surrounding towns have fled from L.A., Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   The compound's creed: ``We tell the so-called Jews moving in
here to go to Los Angeles because they have there what they want.
Don't destroy this area!''
</P>
<P>
   White supremacists long have been obsessed with Los Angeles,
said Kevin Flynn, who co-authored ``The Silent Brotherhood'' (Free
Press 1989), which chronicled The Order's 1983 assassination of
Alan Berg, the Jewish host of a Denver radio talk program.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Order's) next planned action was sabotage in the L.A.
area,'' Flynn said. ``They were going to take out the high voltage
towers and lines coming into Los Angeles to cause a blackout. Then
they intended to bring in guerrilla-trained units from Idaho to
start shooting randomly - like Furrow did - in minority
neighborhoods to start race riots.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuman Britton, who runs the Aryan Nations in California from
Escondido near San Diego, said that Christian Identity stamped L.A.
as ``a kind of sacred, a holy place.'' He said he dreams of a day
when the city would be all white.
</P>
<P>
   Butler refused to call Los Angeles a ``target'' of the Aryan
Nations, but talked longingly of a day when the city might be
``reclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is counting on the likes of Owens, whom he has heard
of but never met, and Britton to carry on the movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the Apostle Paul, I've served my time,'' he said.
``Someone will pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he first heard of Furrow after the Granada Hills
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment on that action because it was not an AIM
action,'' Owens said. ``Let me say the privileged class do not
realize how far down they have driven the working class, how much
angst is welling up in the white working class.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if they don't wake up and do something they can - there is
going to be a lot more turmoil than they've ever expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens founded the group in September and claims it has about 150
members, mainly in Southern California. The ADL estimated the
membership at 30.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the earlier neo-Nazi groups, AIM has no headquarters
building and doesn't fly the Nazi flag or lead marches.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIM's strategy is to recruit among youth and use more
sophisticated and modern techniques of political and social
activism to move toward a brighter future,'' he said. ``We don't
try to scare people.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the white separatists have launched a grocery
delivery service to help mothers, the disabled, and elderly ``white
folks'' in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Riverside counties. They
also run an ``anti-illegal labor campaign'' to place white workers
in homes that were previously hiring illegal immigrants to do yard
work and cleaning. Their Web site features special pages designed
to appeal to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not discriminate,'' Owens said. ``All white people are
eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a member of another group because before AIM
there was never a group of racial activism that had potential of
actually winning ... I wish our ultimate goal could be achieved
without violence, but history tells me otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Simonelli, who spent nine years researching neo-Nazism in the
U.S., said the packaging of white supremacism in terms of leaders,
symbolism and speech has changed over the years, but the core of
hatred has remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that all these people come back to
the same beliefs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Forbes, who headed the American Nazi Party operation in
Glendale and El Monte, called Furrow a ``nut'' who might have been
pushed to act because he sensed the ``cultural genocide''
threatening the white race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes a nut do that?'' said Forbes, 59, who lives near
Russellville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he senses this threat and has no other outlet, like the
last gorilla that's about to become extinct going after the people
poaching in the jungle.''

SEPARATISTS RECRUITING ON THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 and BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sunk into the cushions of a tattered couch in the
dark back room of a Hollywood cafe, Eric Owens appears to be no one
special, just another slight, white, tattooed, downtown denizen
without a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   What separates Owens from the crowd, to hear him and hate
experts tell it, is that he is the founder and ruler of the Aryan
International Movement, the most active of the Los Angeles area's
fragmented white supremacist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Owens stands out as the new face of hate - a 145-pound,
working-class white man from West L.A. who says his experiences in
an integrated high school prompted him to embrace racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have a complete revolution within 25 years this
country is done for,'' Owens said, measuring every word.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting his body into the purple glow of the cafe's fluorescent
black lights, Owens added: ``It will be such that there won't be
enough consolidated white areas for us to achieve the kind of
victory we want. I believe something drastic has to happen very
soon. I would like to see a complete and total replacement of the
United States government.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar intolerance, seeded and nurtured in cities, small towns
and military outposts across the nation, exploded into view again
Tuesday when a ``lone wolf'' white supremacist, Buford O'Neal
Furrow Jr., rampaged through the San Fernando Valley. Five people
were shot at the Jewish Community Center in suburban Granada Hills,
a Korean woman's car was hijacked at gunpoint and a Filipino
mailman was slain.
</P>
<P>
   With direct ties to the neo-Nazi movements of the post-World War
II era, white power groups in Southern California come in numerous
flavors and with varying degrees of danger. They are small, mobile
and incendiary, and boast tentacles that reach out for new
recruits, often through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, Los Angeles has long been their sacred
ground, viewed as a former holy land of white purity.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Identity, a racist church, was founded by Wesley Swift
in Hollywood after World War II. The American Nazi Party's Western
Division was headquartered in the city of Glendale and later in
suburban El Monte through the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Most old-school racist leaders died or fled L.A. for the Pacific
Northwest or other places where there are fewer blacks, Asians,
Latinos and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new generation preaches a hate-filled ideology through
telephone hotlines, impromptu meetings and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The growing presence of the Aryan International Movement, gangs
like the Nazi Low Riders, and religious sects such as the Christian
Identity Church are especially troubling because hate-related
violence tends to clump around the roots of organizations'
headquarters, said Sue Stengel, western states counsel for the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a decline of larger, ``more traditional'' hate
groups, the ADL and law enforcement agencies have had difficulty
getting accurate head counts for the new splinter organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best estimate is membership is declining, but the level of
violence is escalating,'' said Tamar Galatzan, ADL western states
associate counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those left may be the die-hards. Or it might be that as a
society we've become accustomed to a certain level of violence and
now, in order to get attention, you have to commit a really
violent, horrendous, vicious act to get noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   By the ADL's count, there are some 14 local hate organizations
and more than a half-dozen related ``skinhead'' or white power
groups in the L.A. area.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish individuals and organizations suffered the bulk of
religious hate crimes in Los Angeles County last year, but those
incidents declined 14 percent, from 100 in 1997 to 86 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Department statistics from the first six
months of this year show the largest number of 193 reported hate
crimes took place in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The active hate groups espouse similar beliefs and goals, and
increasingly have been able to abandon the kind of public
recruitment that law enforcement successfully infiltrated, for the
relative anonymity of post office boxes and Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be surprised if there are more than 5,000 hard-core
neo-Nazis in California,'' said Frederick J. Simonelli, author of
the just-released ``American Fuehrer: George Lincoln Rockwell and
the American Nazi Party'' (University of Illinois Press 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``What's worrisome and dangerous is where the battleground is,
where they are trying to entice people into the movement,''
Simonelli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts like burning the synagogues in Sacramento or the assault
on the Jewish center are designed to raise their profile to attract
the disaffected into their ranks.''

   LATHROP, Mo. _ horses or mules.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt and Foster said they were going to the seminar. Even
Larson _ who looks the part of the Marlboro Man _ could remember
two men hanging on to an unbroke mule with ropes while a third
gingerly climbed into the saddle. He said he saw advantages to such
methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd let go, and then it'd be Katy bar the door for a while
with that mule bucking every which way,'' Larson said. ``The
problem with mules is that once they get a bad habit, they're
harder to break of it. Lots of people are starting them slower _
ground training, longue lines and other stuff. Makes for better
animal in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Plowman said despite Lathrop's rich legacy as a mule center,
there are no plans to boom the annual show up into something bigger
than can't be handled locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a just a get-together for people who like mules,'' he
said. ``There's plenty of them around.''

MISSOURI TOWN CELEBRATES ITS HISTORY AS A MULE CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHROP, Mo. _ The eighth annual Lathrop Mule Show took place
here last Saturday _ 84 animals, 46 events from halter to flag
racing, and a good turnout of several hundred people from all over
Missouri, eastern Kansas and southern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Uncounted, of course, were all the long-eared ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Phantasms of soft-eyed, stubborn-willed equines, for those who
remember history, still faintly reside in this little town 50 miles
northeast of Kansas City. The town proclaims itself the Mule
Capital of the World, a sobriquet Maury County, Tenn., might
dispute, being big on mules itself and billing itself with the same
name.
</P>
<P>
   Still, signs leading into this town declare its link to mules
and its ``capital'' status.
</P>
<P>
   Lathrop deserved the title when it was bestowed 80-plus years
ago. What are now the surrounding soybean and corn fields then were
pastures. On any given day from 1914 to 1918 _ the years of what
was known as ``the Great War'' _ 30,000 mules and horses blanketed
those pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Most were mules _ so many, in fact, that dried manure in the
fields, ignited from a discarded cigarette or pipe's ember,
smoldered continually. There was constant pall of smoke over
Lathrop and its adjacent 20 ``mule stations'' with their massive
mule barns. One such structure measured 312 by 210 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the mules and horses had to eat. Feed came in by the
train load _ bran, oats, corn and hay. In those years, more rail
cars moved through here than on all the spider web of tracks the
Kansas City Terminal Railway had surrounding Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The trains brought mules, too, ones flushed from the back
country of Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and Iowa by buyers with
fistfuls of cash to offer eager farmers who invariably had an extra
2-year-old or a brace of 4-year-olds out behind the barn. Tractors
then were ``newfangled.'' Mules and horses were the motive power on
dirt farms.
</P>
<P>
   Even what's now Missouri 116 was a busy thoroughfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``One old man told me he'd take a white pony out to round up the
mules,'' said George McCorkle, 83. ``Mules will always follow a
white horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tie a knot in the pony's tail, halter just one mule, and
tie a lead line to the tail just above the knot. And then he'd
start to town riding that pony.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the mules would follow down what's now 116. There'd be a
parade of mules a quarter to half mile long, all following that
white pony.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for such mules was from the British government. Mules
then, at least to military men, were jeeps and Humvees. Mules were
indispensable in hauling the mortars, machine guns, rations,
ammunition, telegraph wire and all the other gear needed on the
evolving battlefield where no longer did two lines of closely
packed men line up and shoot at each other in volleys.
</P>
<P>
   War had become industrialized. And the mule was needed to pack
in its implements.
</P>
<P>
   The English had discovered Lathrop and its mules during the Boer
War at the turn of the century. In World War I they came back in
force and joined with what then was the biggest mule and horse
trading firm in the world, Guyton &AMP; Harrington, to ship Midwestern
mules to the Western Front.
</P>
<P>
   Clipped British accents mingled with the slower Missouri speech;
checks in $100,000-plus amounts (equal to $1.5 million today) were
common. For a time Lathrop, with its nearby rolling fields, black
with Roman-nosed, brown-eyed and braying hybrids, was indeed the
Mule Capital of the World.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, just south of Lathrop's pleasant homes and neat
streets, one fittingly named Mule Barn Road, the mules were back _
albeit in vastly diminished numbers _ at what's called the Antique
Car Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes, those days are part of us, except almost nobody knows
about them now,'' said Jim Plowman, who along with McCorkle got the
show organized several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd had some shows, and then it just sort of faded away,''
added Plowman. ``But the interest came back, and we got it going
again. This is our eighth one. And we get bigger every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Nora Foster, who has a mule, said there are now nine mule shows
a year on the Pony Express Horse show circuit in northwest
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``People just can't get enough of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amen, said Sandy Schmitt, who has a quarter horse but longs for
a mule named Bones whose owner won't sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bones is just a so nice to ride, so easy gaited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A goodly part of the market for mules these days, said Gary
Larson, a breeder and exhibitor, is women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies like them,'' said Larson. ``They're nice to ride. Take
about as much training as a horse, but once that's done, they're
real dependable. Especially for trail riding. Comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Larson, of Laredo, Mo., was here with his jack, J.R., who ears
span 38 inches and is named for the character of the television
show ``Dallas.'' J.R. has done of lot of breeding this year, said
Larson, explaining that a jack to a mare produces a mule; a horse
stallion to a jenny (a female jackass) begets what's called a
henny. They are rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sell some mules before they're even foaled,'' said Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, there was talk at the show here about Monty Roberts,
author of the best-selling The Man Who Listens to Horses, who will
conduct a seminar Tuesday at Hale Arena in Kemper Arena in Kansas
City. Roberts, over the last few years, has revolutionized equine
training in some circles through his methods of body language and
trust between trainer and animal.
</P>
<P>
   In short, according to Roberts, a length of 2-by-4 and brute
force are no longer required teaching aids for horses or mules.

<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. _ The phenomenon that Oscar De La Hoya has
become is difficult to understand until you sit on his sofa for a
few hours and watch it in action.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dinner with a dozen Mexican media members to plan for.
There's a T-shirt design for his Sept. 18 welterweight unification
fight with International Boxing Federation champion Felix Trinidad
to approve. There's a 15-minute radio interview to do with the
British version of Sports Illustrated that inevitably stretches to
25 minutes. There are five takes of a radio promo taped over the
phone that will be used to hype the fight's pay-per-view sales.
</P>
<P>
   There's a brief conversation with his marketing agent, Leonard
Armato, the same Leonard Armato who handles Shaquille O'Neal and
once took Brian Shaw to Europe. There's a brief conversation with a
representative of the food supplement company MET-RX. There's an
interlude with a dozen bigwigs from Mandalay Bay, who arrive at Big
Bear Lake Airport in a private plane and at Golden Boy Avenue in a
limousine to have a private audience with a man they're paying
millions of dollars because he can fight so well that rich people
in private planes are willing to come to their Las Vegas casino to
watch him.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the thrice-weekly voice lessons he's taking to
further a fledgling singing career, and another magazine interview
by phone. Prior to that, there are sit-down tapings with ESPN's Al
Bernstein and a television reporter from England's Sky-TV.
Sandwiched in between is the reading of a promo for Aruba cable
television, which leads De La Hoya to ask his longtime publicist,
Dena DuBoef, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief geography lesson in which he learns that Aruba is
a country, De La Hoya does the promo in English and then a language
he recognizes as something akin to Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say Spanish over there?'' he asks before reading the
message in an Aruban dialect. He does it several times before
satisfying himself that it's acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stretches his arms and sits for a few minutes with an
old acquaintance to talk about La Vida Loco, his own unusual brand
of this crazy life, before heading outside for a half-day session
under cool mountain skies with about 100 media members from Mexico
and the West Coast. De La Hoya moves contentedly from chair to
chair to chair doing TV one-on-ones with an assortment of
interviewers he's never met before from an assortment of places
he's not sure he's heard of before. Only after this exercise, which
takes several hours, does he sit down with about eight rows of
writers and radio reporters to hold an informal press conference
that begins with handshakes for each person and ends with a
surprising number of autographs being signed and pictures being
taken that will never appear in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a half-hour of controlled conversation, De La
Hoya finally stands in front of the gym he built for himself more
than 7,000 feet above the Los Angeles Basin and goes off to do what
the world thinks he's paid to do. He goes off to train for the
biggest professional fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, however, even the training was done for a media
audience. They stood around or sat on folding chairs outside what
appeared to have once been a garage door to watch De La Hoya work
under the close eye of trainer Robert Alcazar. Such promotion is
key to the creation and feeding of a media superstar, and De La
Hoya understands that as well as any athlete since Muhammad Ali. It
is why he is the only boxer with major endorsement deals, with an
assortment of companies ranging from McDonald's to MET-RX, the
latter of which has designed a nutrition plan for him. MET-RX
people will closely monitor everything he eats, adjusting his diet
to help him build lean muscle and stamina while keeping his weight
on target to hit the 147-pound limit at the weigh-in the night
before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   When that weigh-in is over, the tumult of publicity will finally
stop, but MET-RX's food engineers will continue to work on De La
Hoya, putting him on a different meal plan to rehydrate him while
adding only 5 or 6 pounds to his body weight overnight, rather than
the 12-15 many fighters gain.
</P>
<P>
   It is all part of an engineered life, a life in which De La Hoya
is seldom alone until the dark hours of the night or on the bright
night of the fight when he has only one other face to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   All the commotion that swirls around during a big promotion
convinced Alcazar that some changes had to be made in his fighter's
approach. It is a concession to both De La Hoya's popularity and
Trinidad's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting him in lockdown for the first time,'' Alcazar
explained. ``After this week, no phone, no family, no friends. One
month with nothing but Trinidad and training. Just boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a return to a spartan existence (if you can call it that
when you're living with a private cook in a beautifully appointed
log cabin jammed with video and audio equipment). It is something
De La Hoya has not been asked to do until this moment, a moment he
knows could define his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea, really,'' De La Hoya said.
``Everything in my life is compartmentalized. It can get pretty
hectic and confusing at times but it's what I choose to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one with any decision-making is me. The only one who
has any power is me. Everything has to go through me. It was
getting to the point (before the firing of adviser Mike Hernandez)
where I didn't have control of things. Now I've taken full control.
It's a lot of pressure, but it's what I choose to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes the choice to lock himself away at Big Bear Lake
for the next month to take care of his real business. The fight
business.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time enough later for all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although De La Hoya-Trinidad is still close to a pick 'em fight
among bookmakers, promoter Bob Arum is planning for the future as
if a De La Hoya victory is assured. He not only has De La Hoya
booked for a Dec. 11 fight at the new Staples Center in Los Angeles
against World Boxing Council 154-pound champion Javier Castellejo,
but also is talking about a title fight in Las Vegas at either 154
or 147 pounds next April, followed by a June fight against Laurent
Boudouani in Paris. Arum was in Europe last month and claims there
are plans already in the works to build a temporary 10,000-seat
arena under the Eiffel Towel to house that match . . . If Arum can
satisfy the financial demands of Johnny Tapia, there will be a
rematch with the man who took Tapia's bantamweight title, Paulie
Ayala, Dec. 4 at Mandalay Bay. Arum said he has already reserved
the date, ``So now it's up to Johnny.'' Tapia left Arum and signed
with Frank Warren, his third promoter in the last few years, after
losing to Ayala . . . World Boxing Association middleweight
champion William Joppy (27-1-1) is set to defend his title against
WBA ``interim'' champion Julio Cesar Green (25-3) Sept. 25 in
Washington, D.C., the rubber match between Joppy and Green. Green
survived two knockdowns to win a decision from Joppy two years ago
but Joppy avenged the loss by winning a unanimous decision last
year . . . Prince Naseem Hamed's Oct. 22 fight with Cesar Soto, the
WBC featherweight champion, appears headed for the Joe Louis Arena
in Detroit . . . Arum has nearly finalized a January unification
fight between WBC super bantamweight champion Erik Morales and
World Boxing Organization titleholder Marco Antonio Barrera, a
fellow Mexican. Morales's manager wants to put the fight in a
bullring near the beach in Tijuana, while Arum believes it's more
likely to end up at the Staples Center. Either way, it would be an
early contender for Fight of the Year . . . Former 140-pound
champion Vince Phillips has moved up to 147 and may go higher. When
he returned to begin training again in Las Vegas, he weighed 170 .
. . Add this to your list of bad ideas. Well shot ex-champion
Livingston Bramble will fight Theo Holland Aug. 26 in Atlanta . . .
Top heavyweight prospect Michael Grant continues to function
without a promoter now that his contract with the Duvas has ended,
but Cedric Kushner is said to have the inside track at taking over
on a fight-by-fight basis. In the meantime, No. 1-rated David Tua
turned down $1.5 million to fight Grant, so Grant settled for
Andrew Golota. The Foul Pole managed to stop substitute journeyman
Quinn Navarre in July in Poland without resorting to felonious
actions and is now 34-3. Now he's landed a big comeback shot with
Grant Nov. 20 . . . In case you missed it, WBA welterweight
champion James Page KO'd Freddie Pendleton in the 11th round last
weekend to improve to 25-3. The loss dropped the well-traveled
Pendleton to 44-24-4. ``He's nothing but pure power,'' Pendleton
said. ``He's the strongest boxer I've faced.'' That's why promoter
Don King would love to get him in with the winner of De La
Hoya-Trinidad, but that will never happen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a busy guy. Hector Camacho Jr. recently scored two KOs in
a week, improving to 22-0 by stopping first Miguel Angel Ruiz and
six days later cooling Mike Cooley in two rounds. The undefeated
super lightweight is rated No. 6 in the world by the WBC and No. 8
by the WBA, but who knows whether he can really fight or not since
he keeps facing the kind of guys that let you fight twice in a
week? . . . You have to hand it to New Jersey's judges. They've got
petty larceny down to a science. Had two of them not scored the
final round of the Francois Botha-Shannon Briggs fight for Botha by
2 points _ despite the absence of the traditional knockdown usually
required for such a score _ Botha would have lost a fight he
clearly won, and that might have brought new federal heat down on a
state where the boxing industry has a perpetual black eye. Former
light heavyweight champion Bobby Czyz, now a Showtime analyst, has
grown so accustomed to New Jersey's shenanigans that he predicted
the draw before it was announced. When it came through, he said,
``I hate myself for being right.'' At least Czyz had sense enough
to be embarrassed. Briggs did not. ``This is definitely what
Shannon Briggs needed to become a better fighter,'' Briggs said
when asked about the bloody beating he had just taken . . .
Speaking of Botha, he was asked about being knocked out by Mike
Tyson in their January match and about his apparent taunting of the
former champion during the bout. ``Tiger Woods couldn't have hit a
golf ball better than Mike Tyson hit me,'' Botha said of the
knockout punch that saved Tyson from a certain loss to Botha, who
won every round until then. As for taunting Tyson, Botha said
dryly, ``At least we're not only fighting. We're having a
conversation.'' . . . After several weeks of being pilloried quite
rightly in the press for trying to lure Buster Douglas into a
ritual suicide against Tyson, his promoters backed down last week
under the guise of Douglas refusing the fight. Fact is, the MGM
Grand refused the fight and they're paying for it. So a
still-reluctant Tyson is back to square one, with Orlin Norris or
Jorge Luis Gonzalez now likely to serve as his opponent, although
there were rumors in Las Vegas that the date may be shifted to Oct.
16. ``Tyson's not getting in the ring Oct. 2,'' Arum insisted.
``Even with Butterbean, he's not getting in the ring.'' . . . The
long-anticipated Kostya Tszyu-Miguel Angel Gonzalez fight for the
vacant WBC super lightweight title has finally found a home and a
date. The bout, which has been a political and promotional football
between King and Dan Goossen, finally landed at the Miccousukee
Indian Reservation outside Miami next Saturday after being promised
to Las Vegas. But don't put away your skepticism until the bell
rings . . . Frank Bruno may not have been the best heavyweight ever
to put on gloves, but he always understood the business and how to
make the most money in it. That's why it's no surprise to hear his
take on new WBO champion Vitali Klitschko, conquerer of Herbie
Hide: ``He has fast hands and a good defense and he wasn't as slow
as Herbie thought. He's big, he's white, and he can fight.'' In
other words, he's going to make some cash pretty soon, whether he
can fight or is just another European heavyweight mirage like
Golota.

CLASS OF 2000: GRIM PREDICTIONS COME TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE, JENNIFER BARRETT  
 AND ELIZABETH GREENSPAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Class of 2000 was just learning the alphabet when educators
began talking about how many of the kindergartners would never make
it to graduation.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a dozen pessimistic predictions the ad hoc group
Arizona Alliance for Education released in 1987 about today's
senior class. More than one-third would drop out before graduation,
it said. More than half who stayed in school would use alcohol or
drugs before graduating. A thousand would end up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The educators and administrators who made up the alliance said
they hoped the dire forecast would serve as a wake-up call for
Arizonans, illustrating the need for the state to spend more money
and time on education. They called the effort ``Vision for
Arizona's Schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reality today is even darker than they'd envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not made a dent on those issues brought up in 1987,''
said Dennis Van Roekel, who was co-chairman of the now-defunct
alliance and is now secretary-treasurer of the National Education
Association. ``We need to recommit as to why the country chose
public education for its students (in the first place).''
</P>
<P>
   If educators were to shine the spotlight on the Class of 2000
now, they would see that many of their predictions and few of their
hopes have come true.
</P>
<P>
   Kathi Foster, D-west Phoenix, a legislator since 1995 and former
Cartwright School District board member, says little has changed
since Van Roekel released the group's predictions, including
funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in good economic times, but you wouldn't know it by
looking at our schools,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past dozen years, state spending per pupil has actually
dropped in comparison with the nation's. When the alliance released
its predictions, Arizona ranked 45th among states on expenditures
per student for public schools. The state has stayed at or near the
bottom ever since.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Arizona is at the top of more dubious lists.
According to the most recent data, the state has the highest rate
of teenage dropouts in the country and is among the highest for
teen pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the face of such challenges, the students themselves
have managed to exceed expectations in academic areas. Test scores
have improved over the past decade and have remained consistently
above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers are not all going down in the dumps,'' said Joy
Richard, a senior at Seton Catholic School in Chandler. ``We need
to show people we can and do wonderful things.''
</P>
<P>
   More Arizona high school graduates than ever, for example, are
going on to college. During the past 13 years, enrollment at
Maricopa Community Colleges, one of the largest community college
systems in the country, has grown 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Educators caution, however, that some of that growth may be
attributed to the overall increase in the state's student
population.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and educators give the same reason for the disparity
in education funding. Arizona is one of the fastest-growing states
in the country. In 1996, the state's student-population growth was
the second-highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enrollment is growing so fast that keeping up with the need
seems to be a problem,'' said Vance Grant, statistics specialist
with the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Although Arizona's spending per student has increased 20 percent
in the past decade, the nation's average per-pupil expenditure has
jumped nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some state lawmakers say the numbers can be deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Schottel, R-Tucson, chairman of the House Education
Committee, said Arizona has pumped $1.2 billion new dollars into
education since he was elected to office seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a balancing act,'' he said. ``We have to look at
what's good for students and what's good for taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Roekel said lawmakers nationwide have tried to cut taxes
since the 1980s. Although taxpayers have saved money, students have
paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a whole generation of students who've gone
through the system with this burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's graduates faced funding problems throughout their
school years, but educators say there is hope for future classes.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Essigs, an assistant superintendent for Mesa Public
Schools, points out that the Legislature this year fully funded
inflation, for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's an encouraging note,'' he said. ``The '90s was a
very dismal decade for funding for Arizona schools by anyone's
standards. Hopefully, we've turned a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Arizona has a new way of paying for school
construction called Students FIRST. Spurred by a lawsuit, the
school funding program, passed last year by the Legislature,
attempts to bring all school districts up to minimum standards.
</P>
<P>
   The state also has a new way of measuring student achievement.
Today's students are guided in the classroom by academic standards
in a variety of subject areas. Beginning with the Class of 2002,
pupils will have to pass AIMS, Arizona's Instrument to Measure
Standards, in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull not only made improving education part of the
platform that got her elected in 1998, but she has remained a vocal
and active proponent since taking office. Most recently, she set
aside extra money to help the very young, kindergartners through
third-graders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor is pretty clear, funding still needs to
be a priority for education,'' said Jaime Molera, eduction adviser
to Hull. ``But we need to make sure education is accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be difficult when the school is asked to fill so many
roles. Counselors help kids deal with pregnancy and unstable home
environments. Teachers are on the watch for physical, drug and
alcohol abuse. Principals devise plans in case campus violence
breaks out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the primary mission should be on making sure schools are
focused on academics,'' Molera said. ``Everything at schools should
be centered around that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Legislature brought to life charter schools, which
are publicly funded and privately run and often cater to specialty
groups. One-third of the nation's charter schools are in Arizona,
which has more than 300 of them scattered across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Often, there is a different approach to academics in these
classrooms. On the first day of school at Arizona School for the
Arts in central Phoenix this month, students will sit in the
Orpheum Theater watching their teachers perform for them on stage.
</P>
<P>
   The home-school movement has blossomed as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there were an estimated 10,000 Arizona children who
were being taught at home. Three years later, there are more than
20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started 10 years ago, people didn't know what we were
doing,'' said Kim McInturff, a Mesa mother who home-schools her
children.
</P>
<P>
   Her family, with two boys and two girls, made the decision when
private school got too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of did it as an experiment,'' McInturff said. ``As
time has gone on, the resources have become incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these choices have affected traditional public schools.
Today, some advertise for students. Others have opened up their own
magnet schools, catering to back-to-basics instruction as well as
other niche markets.
</P>
<P>
   Given these changes, Van Roekel said the next step is to ask how
the kindergartners of 2000 will fare as they make their way to
graduation in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we have not done the interventions necessary, we need
to ask the same questions,'' he said. &QL;

MRS. MILLER EXPOSES THE NAKED TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm speaking with one of the many Mrs. George Millers in town
who does NOT pose naked and have sex ``live'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Mrs. George Millers from the metropolitan area, this
one has received a number of telephone calls lately from
individuals who believe they've seen pictures of her on their
computer, or who would like to see pictures of her, or who would
like to do things with her that Mrs. Miller finds repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television stations and radio stations from all over have been
leaving messages on our machine,'' she says. ``George Miller is a
fairly common name. There are a lot of us in the area. Still, it's
disgusting to me how the media has given these two people so much
attention. And worse, makes them out to be victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miller is referring to George and Tracy Miller, the married
nurses who lost their jobs at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn because
they operate an X-rated Web site in which Nurse Tracy plays doctor
with Nurse George for any computer owner willing to pay them $15 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses say they've placed their privates on public display
in order to put their two children through college. &QL; 
NEED A 2ND JOB? &QL; 
``That's just ridiculous,'' the fully clothed Mrs. Miller says.
``First of all, with what they earn (reported to be a combined
$92,000 a year) they don't need a second job to send their kids to
college. Besides, if you're looking for outside work, is this
something the parents of small children should do?''
</P>
<P>
   Only if they want put them through hell before putting them
through school.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Nurse George told me his 11-year-old son had not
been adversely affected by what his parents do in front of the
camera. As for the couple's 5-year-old daughter, Nurse George says
she's too young to comprehend the naked truth. Or is it the bare
facts?
</P>
<P>
   The raw details? The particulars?
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter. I suspect that among the Miller kids'
classmates, there's a computer wiz who'll eventually uncover the
family enterprise and expose the youngsters to the mom and dad's
hard-core business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the sad part to me,'' the well-attired Mrs. Miller
says. ``And it's so unnecessary. This isn't about the First
Amendment or about rights on the job. If you're a parent, your
first job is your kids. These people are thinking about only one
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   (No, it's not sex. That's what their customers think about.) &QL; 
ALL ABOUT MONEY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nurses are thinking about money.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the 1990s is defined by money and nothing else. A
pair of nurses who become millionaires having sex on the Internet
could get a book deal, a movie deal, stories in ``People''
magazine, talk show interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Respectability.
</P>
<P>
   After all, no one in my business is particularly interested in
the many George Millers who don't have an X-rated Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I put two daughters through college when we
were earning less than the nurses,'' the neatly dressed Mrs. Miller
says. ``You're not just giving kids an education, you're passing on
a legacy about behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Mr. and Mrs. George Millers live quietly, avoid publicity,
and work with their clothes on.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Nurse Tracy and Nurse George are in the news,
however, other George Miller families can expect to receive unusual
phone calls, along with the usual ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband gets kidded about it at work,'' Mrs. Miller says.
`` `Hey, George, saw you on TV,' they say. I get my share of it,
too. You've got to have a sense of humor about it. I tell them it's
a good thing we're not those kind of people. Not only is it the
last thing I'd ever do, but I don't suppose anyone would want to
see a 56-year-old woman undressed on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs. I laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Then I log onto my computer and type in words like ``mature
woman,'' ``older woman,'' ``old woman'' and ``granny.''
</P>
<P>
   After 1,581 X-rated Web sites pop up, I stop counting. &QL;

   BOSTON _ Deplorable. Reprehensible. Intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the words used to describe the actions of two
NASCAR Winston Cup crew members, Mike Culberson and Ray Labbe, who
were indefinitely suspended by the sanctioning body and
subsequently fired from their jobs for playing a racially
insensitive prank on David Scott, a black crew member on Jeremy
Mayfield's team, during the Jiffy Lube 300 weekend at New Hampshire
International Speedway last month.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three more words:
</P>
<P>
   Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Culberson and Labbe, who were motorcoach drivers for Derrike
Cope and Terry Labonte, respectively, went beyond the realm of
boorish behavior July 8 when they knocked on the door of Mayfield's
motorcoach and one greeted Scott wearing a pillowcase over his head
in an attempt to impersonate a Ku Klux Klansman.
</P>
<P>
   Acutely aware of the perception that stock car racing is a
``redneck sport'' _ attractive only to an all-white, all-male,
Confederate flag-waving audience from the South, as was portrayed
in a recent report on HBO's ``Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' _
NASCAR has fought long and hard to overcome that image and make its
sport accessible to people of all races and creeds, and both
genders.
</P>
<P>
   But to suggest that the actions of an ignorant few represent the
beliefs of the rest of the hard-working people in the sport is
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR should be applauded for taking the action that it did,
handing down indefinite suspensions and calling the men's actions
socially intolerable. And while it took almost a month for the
sanctions to be announced, Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of
operations, said the governing body was deliberate in ``giving the
matter its due diligence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue wasn't the timing, the issue was doing what was
right,'' Triplett said. ``The decision what to do was not that
hard. There's not a whole lot of gray area in determining that this
isn't proper behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR took the only option available; the drivers' employers
took things a step further by terminating both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find the episode deplorable and we're happy that NASCAR has
taken the measures that they've taken,'' said NHIS spokesman Fred
Neergaard. ``We applaud their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, during a recent stop in Atlanta, told the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution that his brother, Terry, was ``torn up about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It embarrassed him and put him in a bad situation,'' Bobby
Labonte said. ``It put me in a bad situation, too, because I'm his
brother and people are asking me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Triplett said NASCAR officials talked with Scott ``and we have
given him our support.'' He added that NASCAR president Bill France
also wrote a letter of apology to Scott and pledged his continuing
support to keep the sport intolerant of racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said Triplett, ``is that people have to
feel like if they want to make a living in NASCAR, then the only
hurdles they have to overcome are because of the difficulty of the
job and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   As it should be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The silly season has already started. In CART, Roger Penske made
a stunning announcement before last week's race in Detroit that he
and Al Unser Jr. were parting ways at the end of the season and
that he had signed Greg Moore and Gil de Ferran to three-year
contracts. And in NASCAR, Winston Cup owner Robert Yates announced
that Kenny Irwin would not be back behind the wheel of the No. 28
Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus next season. In both cases, the drivers
failed to live up to the lofty expectations of owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to emphasize that this change is being made in the
interest of all concerned,'' Yates said. ``As for the remainder of
this season, we are committed, as a team, to make the No. 28 car
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates said no decision had been made on a replacement.One
possibility could be Unser.
</P>
<P>
   Unser, it has been speculated, also could wind up with the new
Winston Cup team being put together for next season by CART owner
Cal Welles, who has Tide lined up as his primary sponsor. The
theory is that Welles would give Unser a full-time Winston Cup ride
and, as a bonus to his driver and sponsor, field an entry for the
2000 Indianapolis 500. Unser, 37, has not raced at the fabled
Brickyard since 1994, when he captured his second career Indy 500
triumph. He failed to qualify the following year and then was
forced to stay away because of the feud between CART and the Indy
Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indy 500 is the Indy 500,'' said Unser, who attended this
year's race as a spectator, rooting for cousins Robby and Johnny.
``I'm not going to wait for the other drivers just to race at
Indy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a trying year for Unser, who is winless in 11 races
this season and his last 64 overall with Marlboro Team Penske, for
whom he won the CART PPG Championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his right ankle in a crash on the first turn of the
first lap in the first race of the season at Homestead, Fla., then
struggled to get up to speed in the Penske-built PC27B chassis,
which will be scrapped at the end of the season. Then came news of
Unser's impending divorce from his wife, Shelley, with whom he had
four children.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes his separation after six years with Team Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this year, Al and I discussed the team's contractual
commitments with our manufacturers,'' Penske said. ``And we
mutually agreed it would be best if he evaluated other
opportunities for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser, ever the trooper, said he intended to strive for one last
goal before parting with Team Penske.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we keep trying our best, everything will turn out
for the best,'' Unser said. ``We're not lame ducks, by any means.
I'm going to try like the devil to get Roger his 100th victory.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon will be gunning for his fifth consecutive road
course victory in Sunday's NASCAR Winston Cup race at the 11-turn,
2.45-mile, winding circuit at Watkins Glen, N.Y. ``The track is a
little different since they put concrete down in the corners,''
said Gordon, who won the last road-course event June 27 at Sears
Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. ``I really like the concrete _ it's
got grip and I know it's going to be consistent.'' Gordon is sixth
in the points, 507 behind leader Dale Jarrett, who won last week's
Brickyard 400 to extend his lead to 274 over Mark Martin (3,199 to
2,925). ``If Jarrett keeps going this season the way that he has,
nobody's going to catch him,'' said Gordon, who has four victories,
seven poles, and 12 top-5 finishes. ``One race, or even one
position for us, isn't going to determine anything as far as points
are concerned. We just need to keep going out there every week and
work hard, try to win races and see what happens.'' . . . Martin
may have won the battle in last week's IROC XXIII series finale at
Indianapolis, but Dale Earnhardt won the war in outpointing Martin,
75-74, to capture the overall series title (the third of his
career) and earn $225,000 . . . IRL driver Greg Ray, who moved into
second place, 1 point behind Scott Goodyear, after last week's
victory at Dover, Del., left Las Vegas unscathed after wrecking his
two Team Menard cars during a test session Tuesday at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway. ``I'm really disappointed for myself and I feel
really bad for my team,'' Ray said. ``These guys have worked very
hard and they're true professionals. They don't deserve being put
through this.'' . . . FedEx CART driver Christian Fittipaldi
continues to recuperate at his home in Miami from the subdural
hematoma he suffered Aug. 2 in a wall crash during a test session
at Gateway International Raceway in Madison, Ill. Fittipaldi, the
27-year-old nephew of retired driver Emerson Fittipaldi, was
replaced by Roberto Moreno in last week's race in Detroit and will
miss Sunday's race at Mid-Ohio. He is expected to be out at least
eight weeks and hopes to return in time for the race at Houston
Sept. 26. ``I think everything happens for a reason in life,'' said
Fittipaldi. ``If God wanted it to be this way, maybe He is trying
to show me some other things in life and He is preparing me for my
future. I honestly believe it has to be this way, and I am sure
that the day I was testing I was doing everything correct. The team
had prepared for me a good, competitive car, and no one was working
in a bad way, so I believe that there are good things that come
from bad things in life.''

   BOSTON _ Team Lemieux could be in the stew.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the Penguins very well could hinge on whether
Beverly Hills billionaire Ron Burkle remains committed to ante up
$20 million this week, enabling Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux to move
ahead and close his purchase of the bankrupt franchise.
</P>
<P>
   If Burkle pulls out, as he appeared to do last week, then
there's big trouble in Steeltown. Harry Manion, representing
current owner Roger Marino, has another billionaire, Mark Cuban, at
the ready. In fact, Cuban may come aboard even if the Burkle-backed
deal closes, allowing Burkle to exit graciously from the picture.
Getting dizzy?
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, if the deal doesn't get done Wednesday, there is
no money for Penguin payroll. One source familiar with the
negotiations said there really isn't anything left in the till as
of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Manion said Friday that he figured a deal, even without Burkle
in the mix, could get done in time with Cuban's money alone _ but
that would depend on what kind of time was left after a Burkle
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   It's abundantly clear, however, that Lemieux has been tap
dancing around the fact that he just hasn't had the $50 million.
Working out myriad financial entanglements takes time, and some are
still ongoing. But the money is there or it's not. Even as of now,
no one truly knows.
</P>
<P>
   What a mess for the NHL. A doomsday scenario could find the
league taking over the Penguins for the '99-00 season and then
finding a surgar daddy (hello, Paul Allen?) to buy the franchise
out of bankruptcy and likely move it.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99-00 schedule already set and hotels and air travel
arranged, it's too late to move now. Just imagine the head count
inside the Igloo if the Penguins have to play there as lame ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the financial black hole on Long Island. For
a league that talks courageously _ and justifiably _ about
expanding its footprint, the Penguins and Islanders are two reasons
to not even think about expansion for at least another 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs aren't saying they'll walk away from Yanic
Perreault's arbitration award ($1.05 million), but they are saying
the price is too high and he soon will be an ex-Leaf (is his pay
too low for the Rangers?). Perreault made $750,000 last year. He's
small and soft, but he has some touch and he's only 28 years old.
The bet here: Given his last name and his fairly low compensation,
Colorado takes a stab . . . Mark Witkin, agent for Hal Gill,
reports that there have been no substantive talks with the Bruins
about a new deal for the hulking third-year defenseman. Gill made
$410,000 last season and got the standard 10-percent-added
qualifying offer from Causeway Street. The Bruins made it clear
last summer in their dealings with Kyle McLaren and Anson Carter
that they'll stick to the payroll guidelines of Group 2 free
agency, unless it's a scorer of Jason Allison's stature . . . The
soon-to-be-retired Dominik Hasek will make $7 million this year and
then walk away from up to $16.5 million that he likely would have
pocketed by April 2002 (the Sabres, if they chose, could have
walked away from the $9 million in '01-02). Meanwhile, in Detroit,
29-year-old Nicklas Lidstrom could be politely thumbing his nose at
$21 million. The Wings are prepared to pay the big-shooting blue
liner $7 million or more per season, but he has made it clear the
last couple of years that he misses Sweden and wants to raise his
kids there _ similar to Hasek's longing for the Czech Republic . .
. Not a good week for Penguins superstar Jaromir Jagr (due
$10,359,852 this season). Jags was quoted _ he now says misquoted _
in a Czech tabloid as saying the difference between his native
Czech Republic and Pittsburgh is like ``heaven and hell.'' It was a
call to arms for get-a-lifers, who called area talk shows and
voiced their displeasure. Jagr: ``I would be angry, too, if I read
something like that. I would like to apologize to everybody in
Pittsburgh, except that I don't have anything to apologize for,
since I never said anything.'' . . . Mike Smith, home on the
Vineyard after not being rehired to run the Leafs' front office,
could end up as Minnesota's first GM. The ex-Jets GM is the most
likely candidate, unless, say, Craig Patrick exits Pittsburgh or
former Minnesotan Bobby Smith were to leave Phoenix (highly
unlikely). Smith knows who can play, which gives him an edge over
50-60 percent of the GMs currently working in NHL front offices . .
. The Bruins should find out Sunday night what an arbitrator says
they'll have to pay Dmitri Khristich for next season . . . Far be
it from your faithful correspondent to figure out how TV's dim
bulbs in charge go about picking their talent for hockey coverage,
but there has to be room for Andy Brickley in someone's broadcast
booth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks will visit the Vault only once next season, a noon
matinee Nov. 26, and they won't have the Sedin twins, Henrik and
Daniel, when they arrive. Mike Barnett, agent for the talented
twins, told Canucks GM Brian Burke last week that they'll both play
one more year in Sweden. They could be in Vancouver's preseason
camp, but that's yet to be determined. Shocker? No. And, chances
are, another year in Europe will only make them better pros.
However, the lowly Canucks, still throbbing from the forced
departure of Pavel Bure, truly could have used the boost the Sedins
would have brought to waning fan enthusiasm . . . Don't bet on
Alexei Yashin caving in and showing up for the opening of Senators
camp. He is supposed to make $3.3 million in '99-00, the last year
of his deal, but wants to double that dough. The better bet is a
protracted holdout _ very much like Bure's last year in Vancouver _
that will lead to a whopping midseason deal. Question is: Will the
Rangers give up star-in-the-making Manny Malhotra this time? The
Blueshirts balked at sending Malhotra to the Canucks for Bure. It's
unfathomable that they would pass up that kind of swap again. Isn't
it? . . . Rumblings in Anaheim have the Mighty Ducks being shopped
around, a symptom of Disney stock languishing in the
twentysomethings. (Friday's close on the New York Stock Exchange:
27 3/16, down by about one-third over the last 15 months.) Henry T.
Nicholas 3d, cofounder of Broadcom Corp. in Irvine, Calif., and
reportedly worth some $2.3 billion in Broadcom stock, is believed
to be among those interested in the team . . . Good to hear that
Ben Smith will stick around to coach the US women in the 2002
Olympics in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, the NHL is expected to make
up its mind next month whether it wants to send its soldiers in for
an Olympus Redux in '02 . . . Score of the week was made by New
Jersey's Brian Rolston, who landed a two-year deal in arbitration
worth a total of $2.7 million, an award that about doubles his pay
of $750,000 last season. The Devils were hoping for about $700,000
less . . . Wrentham's Garth Snow remains standing as the No. 1
netminder in Vancouver, where he'll earn slightly less than $1.5
million in '99-00. Snow to the Vancouver Sun: ``You always hear
about professional athletes who are unhappy and want to play
somewhere else. They must be living in a different world than me.''
. . . The Lightning deal that sent Niklas Sundstrom to San Jose
could affect Belmont Hill defenseman Paul Mara, the Bolts' top pick
(No. 7 overall) in the '97 draft. Mara might have been penciled in
for regular time on the Tampa blue line if the package hadn't
included Andrey Zyuzin and Bill Houlder going to Florida. Now Mara,
unless he really lights it up in training camp, might be looking at
some minor league seasoning . . . The Blues/Kiel Center remain up
for sale. Clearly, it's a buyer's market. Meanwhile, in Ottawa,
Senators owner Rod Bryden wants the Canadian government to come up
with substantial tax breaks for all Canadian club owners by Dec. 1
or, he says, he'll put the Senators up for sale. There would be at
least a couple of American-based bidders, but it's a tricky club to
move out of Ontario because of the Ogden Corp.'s ownership position
in both the team and the building (Corel Centre).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good move for Ron Low, who resigned as the Oilers coach, taking
over as the Houston Aeros (IHL) coach and GM. He did an admirable
job with the low-budget Oilers and there's a better-than-even
chance that the NHL will come to Houston soon (Calgary and Ottawa
are the Canadian refugees in waiting). Low then could be well
positioned to step back into the NHL . . . You know time's flying
when Jumbo Joe Thornton is about to enter the final year of his
original three-year pact. Ditto for Sergei Samsonov . . . Typical
Las Vegas odds right now have the Bruins 22-1 to win the Cup,
ranking them 10th in the Original 28. The favorites: Red Wings
(3-1), Avalanche (7-2), and defending champion Stars (4-1). Tampa
Bay and Atlanta will go off at about 300-1. The Rangers, with a
payroll of some $60 million, are touted at around 50-1 . . . Proof
positive that America is one heck of a money grab: The Islanders
will pay ex-Bruin Marius Czerkawski $1 million this season as their
No. 1 right wing (check LA listings for one Palffy, Zigmund) . . .
Just back in the St. Louis area after a motorcyle tour/charity fund
raiser, Blues tough guy Tony Twist (1,121 career PIMs) cracked up
his motorcycle in Creve Coeur, Mo., Monday and required surgery
later in the week to fix a cracked pelvis. The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch reported Tuesday that Twist, prior to his accident,
had been told by the Blues that he wouldn't be asked back for the
'99-00 season . . . Ex-Flyer defenseman Behn Wilson, he of 1,480
career penalty minutes, is headed for some real jail time after
pleading guilty Wednesday in Philadelpia federal court to a couple
of financial felonies. Now 40 years old, Wilson admitted filing
false financial statements to a dozen lending institutions in the
early '90s, part of a real estate scam that came crashing down in
bankruptcy. The banks lost some $2.4 million. Wilson could get up
to 27 months in the slammer, but likely will skate for less. He
blew the whistle on others, gaining him some leniency . . .
Something that would really impress me: to see someone like Hasek
or Lidstrom agree to play one last season and then use that year's
pay to establish a health-and-welfare fund to aid some of the
game's greats who played before the big-pay era. Some of the golden
oldies see only meager pensions from their NHL days, and more than
a few could use a lift. If not for them . . .

QUICK HAND PERFORMS MAGIC TRANSFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John Gabriel has never been a typical general manager.
A few years ago, the Orlando Magic executive cashed in his
collection of quarters and purchased a beautiful set of Pearl
drums. He certainly can't play as well as his idol, jazzman Gene
Krupa, but Gabriel has been known to participate in a few
late-night jam sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play '70s and '80s rock, mostly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about soft rock, we presume. Because this summer,
Gabriel's message seems to have a shrill, hard-core edge to it. He
ripped up his team quicker than you can say, ``Drumroll, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Horace Grant is in Seattle. Penny Hardaway is in Phoenix. Nick
Anderson is in Sacramento. Isaac Austin is in Washington. Even the
coach, Chuck Daly, decided to leave. The Magic were the No. 3 seed
in the Eastern Conference playoffs last season. They won't be
making the playoffs next season. Everyone knows that. The new Magic
include Harvey Grant, Danny Manning, Tariq Abdul-Wahad, Ben
Wallace, and Corey Maggette, the 6-foot-6-inch forward who will
turn 20 in November.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, John. Is something wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that if we didn't think we were going in the
direction of a championship, we were going to change things up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   They changed so much that no one will be surprised if they have
to struggle to eclipse the win total (18) of their 1989-90
expansion team. But it might be a good idea to get all your Orlando
jokes in now. Next summer, also known as the Summer of Tim
(Duncan), the Magic will have plenty of salary cap room. They also
own 2000 first-round picks from Golden State _ the Warriors' last
payment for acquiring Chris Webber in '93 _ Denver and, if they
want, Phoenix. Their deals also created a $4.5 million trade
exception that they can use for a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be very athletic,'' Gabriel said of the
Millennial Magic. ``In Wahad, (Darrell) Armstrong, and (Bo) Outlaw,
we think we have three of the best defenders in the game. And you
should see Maggette. He has tremendous, tremendous athleticism. For
a young guy, he also has a good feel for the game. Every team has
to have a player that they point to as their future centerpiece,
and he is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   New coach Doc Rivers will have to be creative immediately. Not
including free agents, there are 18 names on the Magic roster. That
list will have to be pared to 12 by November. Of course, things
would be a lot easier if 7-footer Duncan arrived in 2000. Rivers
and the center are close from the time they spent in San Antonio,
where Rivers was a Spurs losing streak away from replacing Gregg
Popovich as head coach last season.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Duncan in Florida is speculation. Reality is this
strange mix of youth, veterans, and, essentially, free agency
bargaining chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger kids are more exuberant in their playing. They make a
better appearance and you can teach them the way you want 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Krupa said that when talking about young jazz musicians. But
this year, Gabriel will understand his idol's words in a different
context.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There had been some private talk among the Celtics that Greg
Minor's career could be over. His agent, Dan Fegan, said that is
not the case. ``He's got a long way to go in coming back,'' Fegan
said, ``but there's absolutely no way his career is over.'' If
Minor were out indefinitely, the Celtics would be eligible for some
salary cap relief. Minor suffered a severe hip injury last April in
a game at Miami . . . Another Celtic issue involves the stinging
words agent Tevester Scott directed at Rick Pitino. Scott, the
agent for Ron Mercer, has said repeatedly that the coach was
dishonest in his dealings with Mercer. According to Mercer's camp,
the Celtics caused the entire Mercer-not-reporting-to-Denver
episode. After learning of the trade to the Nuggets, Mercer says he
was told by the Celtics that Denver was going to give him a
six-year contract extension and sign him to the maximum allowed,
$73 million. Mercer relayed that news to some friends. But when he
spoke with the Nuggets, they didn't know what he was talking about;
they said there would be no offer until the end of the year. Scott
also blasted Pitino for agreeing to trade Mercer somewhere other
than Denver. Pitino said Scott is ``an inexperienced agent'' who
might not know the difference between Pitino's voice and that of
general manager Chris Wallace. ``Maybe he doesn't know a West
Virginia accent from a Northeast accent,'' said Pitino, emphasizing
that he has talked with the agent only once and that Wallace
negotiated with him. ``Maybe this is a case of mistaken identity.
Maybe he doesn't know who he's talking to. And if that's the case,
we have a deeper problem than we thought.'' . . . One of the themes
of the post-Aug. 1 signing/trading period has been
``misunderstanding.'' Gabriel said, ``The thing that has
disappointed me is the amount of guys who agree to contracts and
then go somewhere else. I'm not singling anybody out, but if you
can't take someone's word for something, what are you going to do?
How can you do business?'' Gabriel said he heard that the Celtics'
Calbert Cheaney originally agreed to sign with Miami before signing
a three-year, $6.6 million deal with Boston. There was also Dell
Curry agreeing _ twice _ to re-sign with the Bucks before going to
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every year, there are signings that people don't understand. The
Raptors gave Michael Stewart a deal that averages about $4 million
a season, even if he didn't average a hoop and two rebounds last
season. The Hawks gave up two first-rounders for Lorenzen Wright
and agreed to pay him an average of $6 million per season. He
averaged 7 rebounds and 6 points last season. Similar cases? Not
really. The 6-foot-11-inch, 260-pound Wright had discussions with
25 teams, according to his agent, Robert Fayne. The Pacers and
Lakers wanted him badly. Teams liked his youth (23), size, and
two-position versatility. In Atlanta, he can back up center Dikembe
Mutombo and power forward Alan Henderson. Wright is a typical
Clippers story: Everyone except the sad Clips could see his
potential. When he arrived in Atlanta, Wright was approached by a
couple of players who told him, ``Welcome back to the NBA.''
Stewart is different. He had major problems in Toronto. But there
had been speculation in January that Stewart and the Raptors had an
agreement for a sizable deal since he played for a comparatively
modest salary last season . . . If you want to talk sports with
someone who doesn't have much to complain about, find Jerry
Colangelo. His baseball team, the Arizona Diamondbacks, is leading
the National League West. His basketball team, the Phoenix Suns,
could have one of the best backcourts in league history with
Hardaway and Jason Kidd. Hardaway is going to see some of the
easiest shots of his career with the dynamic Kidd feeding him. The
Suns also added Rodney Rogers and rookie Shawn Marion, whom
Colangelo called ``a Scottie Pippen-type of player.'' ``If you look
at Hardaway at his best and Kidd, who is at the peak of his game,
it appears to be a perfect combination,'' Colangelo said. ``It will
be interesting to see how it turns out.'' Colangelo still is not
pleased with the way Antonio McDyess left for Denver (``I have some
strong feelings about what took place; I refer to it as `The Heist'
'') but he likes his team: ``I wish Antonio had stayed in Phoenix.
From what I understand, he has shared with people that he made a
mistake.'' McDyess supposedly was hidden from the Suns by the
Nuggets when it was time to pick his team. He anguished over the
decision before taking less money and going back to Denver. He
might be missing out on a championship season in the desert. But
don't give the title to the Suns yet. The Blazers improved, the
Spurs still have Duncan, the Timberwolves still have Kevin Garnett,
there's a center with a Superman tattoo in Los Angeles, and the
Sonics are desperately retooling. ``You'd have to say the power is
in the West,'' Colangelo said. ``There are a number of outstanding
teams who have helped themselves. Sacramento has done some things,
Utah is Utah, and Houston, if they stay intact with their people,
is dangerous.'' Colangelo paused and said, ``With all the power out
here, you almost have to make moves to keep up with the Joneses.''

   Eric Williams was asked about being traded back to Boston.
``It's like all the old wounds are healed now that I'm back,'' he
said. When Williams was traded two years ago, Pitino said the
forward couldn't play for him . . . The NBA's rule-changes
committee took part in a conference call last Thursday. There were
several complaints about officials' interpretations of impeding
progress and forearm checking during summer play. ``The game needs
changes and you will see them,'' said Colangelo, a member of the
committee. ``What we are talking about right now is fine-tuning
some things.'' One thing everyone should remember, Colangelo said,
is ``coaches, officials and players will adjust to whatever the
rules are.'' . . . The Cavaliers think first-round pick Andre
Miller can take the starting point guard job from Brevin Knight . .
. When Dale Davis said he was not willing to play in Boston, it was
nothing personal. The 6-11 forward is 30 and doesn't want to play
in a Pitino system. He expressed his feelings after hearing rumors
that he was going to the Celtics in a deal involving Antoine Walker
. . . Pitino said he wants the Celtics to be tougher. If that's the
case, he'll be pleased with Eric Washington. The 6-4 guard actually
spent some time at power forward during his last season at Alabama.
Washington also is known as a very good shot-blocker for a guard .
. . One of the best stories of the summer is Washington forward
Randell Jackson. When he was a freshman at Madison Park, he was
about 6-1 and not a very skilled player. Now, at 6-11, Jackson is
being counted on as a valuable member of the Wizards' rotation.
Last month, new coach Gar Heard said he was interested in seeing
four players during the summer league: Jackson, Richard Hamilton,
Jahidi White, and Calvin Booth . . . Yet another unknown player to
watch: Greg Buckner of the Mavericks. The guard's game has been
compared to Mario Elie's . . . Fegan also represents free agent
forward Shandon Anderson, who has drawn interest from several
teams, including the Jazz, Rockets, and Lakers. Utah coach Jerry
Sloan believes the departure of executive Scott Layden to the
Knicks could hurt the Jazz in their attempts to sign Anderson.
Layden did the bulk of the club's negotiating . . . Bizarre story
of the week: Pippen said he wants to be traded to the Lakers so he
can be reunited with Phil Jackson. But that's not the strange part.
This is: Pippen told Rockets vice president Robert Barr to work on
the trade; Barr, in an unrelated move, resigned a couple days
later.

RICE HAS SOLID GRASP OF NEW ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Jerry Rice is conceding nothing but he is
accepting a few more things than he used to, including the passage
of time and the passing of footballs in the direction of 49ers
other than himself at times when they used to come to him.
</P>
<P>
   But accepting is not conceding, something Rice has never done to
a defense, to a competitor, or even to his own body. It is
something he has no intention of doing now, at the dawn of his 15th
NFL season, despite his insistence last week that he has a new
attitude toward his role in the 49ers' legendary offense after
being accused last year of putting his desires above his team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had very high expectations last year and I felt, under the
situation (returning from a serious knee injury), I had a pretty
good year but I learned I've got to be very, very patient now,''
Rice explained. ``Other guys have to factor into the offense now.
That was a tough adjustment for me last year. I thought I could
jump right in and be fine with it, but it took time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've matured a lot. Now I know exactly what to do and how to
handle this. I'm not taking a lesser role but I know other guys are
going to factor in (more). Other guys are going to get more
opportunities and it's up to them to make plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approach I used to take was that I've got to prove myself
every year by making plays. This year I've got to realize other
guys have got to make plays, too. Now I have to wait for my
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting is something Rice has never been terribly proficient at.
He is a workout freak, a neatness nut, and a receiver without peer
who believes he is always open and usually has a point. He already
holds 12 regular-season NFL records and six postseason ones, yet
had shown little sign of slowing down until his knee injury two
years ago. Although he made two remarkable recoveries from that
injury, late last season his production slowed somewhat from his
own absurdly high standards, and the inevitable whispering about
his athletic mortality began.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rice again led the 49ers in receptions with 82, he
seemed to do less with them and ended up making five or fewer
catches in each of the team's final eight games (including
playoffs), topping 100 yards only once during that span. This
coincided with the rise to prominence of both Terrell Owens (14
touchdowns, 67 catches, and a 1,097-yard Pro Bowl season) and J.J.
Stokes, two in Rice's long line of apprentices. Initially, Rice did
not appear to take to the change in his situation, and he voiced
his complaints publicly.
</P>
<P>
   That led to predictably heavy criticism in some corners of the
Bay Area media and an attitude adjustment this summer that is still
being fine-tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be games now where I'm not the focus,''
Rice conceded. ``That's an adjustment for me. A major adjustment.
But I'm going to enjoy this year. I'm not going to let anything
bother me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, many things did. His balky knee preyed on his mind,
as did the 49ers' apparent decision to begin subtly changing the
focus of their offense. This in no way meant Rice would be
unproductive, but with age, infirmity, and the emergence of
talented new faces, some things had to change.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, that has been Rice. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He grudgingly agreed to take occasional days off from practice
to keep his legs rested and his knee free of fluid. He has also
listened to coach Steve Mariucci's explanation for why he wants to
limit Rice's appearances in the meaningless preseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different but I know it's for the best,'' Rice said.
``It's just being smart as I get older. I have to be more careful
now, even though I feel that I'm in great shape.''
</P>
<P>
   As he stood chatting, clad neck to toes in a black Spandex
bodysuit that looked better on him than it would on a mannequin, no
one would dispute his fitness for football. The greatest receiver
ever to play the game is looking fine, feeling fine, and doing just
fine as his 37th birthday approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his newfound sense of contentment, not too far under
that Spandex burn the same fires that have fueled his
competitiveness for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a competitor,'' Rice said. ``I still want the ball, But
it's up to the coaches now to say, `Let's get the ball to Jerry.'
I'm not going to demand it. I've never demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have accused me of being selfish when I've said I felt
I could make things happen if I got the ball more but they don't
understand. That's being a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Content or not with his new station in life, Rice has not
changed that part of his game. He remains a competitor, which means
the 49ers will very likely remain competitive for another year.
</P>
<P>

   The mystery continues as to why Patriots linebacker Ted Johnson
has twice torn biceps muscles while making tackles, a most unusual
injury. One belief among some in the NFL is that players who use
too much of the supplement Creatine to help build strength and
muscle mass are at greater risk for such an injury because their
muscles can lose water and become more brittle. Retired Jaguars
linebacker Jeff Lageman believes that's why he sustained a torn
biceps last season, an injury that convinced him to retire.
Lageman, in fact, warned Johnson about Creatine a year ago when
they were discussing the unusual injury each had suffered. Johnson
told Lageman he did not use Creatine. Johnson, who has had four
operations on his shoulders and arms in 18 months, realizes he may
be at a career crossroads. Perhaps because of that, he called the
MET-RX people in Southern California recently to ask about coming
out to rehabilitate himself on a program of diet and exercise
similar to the one MET-RX and fitness guru Marv Marinovich created
for New York Giants All-Pro cornerback Jason Sehorn after his
season-ending knee injury a year ago. The results with Sehorn are
taking on legendary status around the league . . . Creatine, by the
way, is not a banned substance like steroids. It is a legal
supplement popular with a lot of young athletes searching for more
strength and power as quickly as possible . . . After a season of
struggling to find an offense, the San Diego Chargers have decided
to look at their No. 1-rated defense for an answer. New coach Mike
Riley has decided to use All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau as an
H-back for 6-10 plays a game this season. The position is a more
glorified form of tight end, and the 6-foot-3-inch, 255-pound Seau
is happy to play it. The same is not true of his defensive coaches.
``They don't like it,'' Riley said. ``But even they can see what he
brings to any group he's playing with. If we put him in there
permanently, he could be an All-Pro at that position.'' Seau brings
unusual speed for a man his size and Riley hopes to use that to
create mismatches against opposing linebackers. This experiment is
far different from the more common switch of a defensive back like
Deion Sanders to wide receiver. ``This is not like putting in some
defensive back to catch a few passes,'' Riley said. ``He's going to
be in the trenches.'' That's what the defensive coaches are worried
about . . . With Reggie White retired, veteran Packer safety LeRoy
Butler has tried to take over the role of team leader. The way he
describes the job is a sign of the times. ``It's my job to make
sure none of these guys wakes up with seven hookers and a pound of
marijuana,'' Butler said. Whatever happened to making sure they
were lined up in the right spot on defense?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the reviews, the NFL won't be replacing the
Australian version of football in Sydney any time soon. The
Broncos' 20-17 victory over the San Diego Chargers there last
weekend inspired the Daily Telegraph to describe the game this way:
``They stop for regular television commercial breaks. They stop to
run on and off the field. They stop for up to a half dozen
timeouts. They stop where there is a kick to be taken. They stop
after a pass is caught. They stop to hear umpires explain
penalties. And they stop to measure distances. It's amazing that a
country like America, whose economy and social structure are based
upon being quicker and slicker, can enthuse about taking three
hours to play one hour of football.'' Considering that the NFL
players hated the long flight and the Australian fans hated the
game, one guesses the NFL won't be rushing back Down Under . . .
Glad There Are No Hard Feelings Dept.: Although Cleveland Browns
owner Al Lerner and club president Carmen Policy were in Canton,
Ohio, last weekend, no one from the Browns organization attended
the Hall of Fame induction of former Cleveland tight end Ozzie
Newsome. That's because Newsome now runs the personnel department
for Art Modell's Baltimore Ravens, the team that used to be the
Browns . . . Newly inducted Hall of Fame running back Eric
Dickerson needs a geography lesson. Dickerson, who might have set
the all-time rushing record if he'd stayed with the Rams instead of
forcing a defection to Indianapolis, of all places, said, ``I never
wanted to leave Los Angeles.'' Maybe that's because he never played
in Los Angeles. Dickerson played all his Rams days in Anaheim, down
in Orange County, which is definitely not Los Angeles . . .
Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams recently demonstrated that blood
may be thicker than water but it's not thicker than winning. When
he hired NFL Executive of the Year Jeff Diamond and named him team
president and chief operating officer, it not only reduced the
power of general manager Floyd Reese but put the wood to Adams's
son-in-law, executive vice president Tommy Smith. Both now report
to Diamond, and Diamond reports only to the owner. Diamond is the
second person to hold the title of club president, a position Adams
had maintained. Smith didn't attend the news conference that
announced Diamond's arrival in Nashville. Reese, meanwhile, saw his
power eroded in a subtle way. His contract, which has three years
to run, says he has sole control of all personnel decisions over
everyone but the club president. That used to be Adams. Now it's
Diamond, who built the powerful Vikings team that went 15-1 a year
ago. On the upside for Reese, he is a longtime friend of Diamond;
the two worked together for seven years in Minnesota during Reese's
coaching days . . . 49ers defensive tackle Bryant Young returned to
the field for the first time since breaking two bones in his lower
leg last season and is saying that he'll be ready for the season
opener, even though Mariucci has told him he will not be allowed to
play in an exhibition game. Young did no hitting last week but said
after his first workout, ``I guess it was good for me just to be
out there with them. Wearing a jersey means a lot.'' When Mariucci
saw Young lying on his back Tuesday during an onside kick drill, he
went over and told him, ``Wow, I just had a flashback. This is a
little different than the last time I saw you lying on your back.''
That was the night last November when Young suffered a terrible
injury that some said would take him a year to recover from . . .
Young and Oakland Raiders defensive tackle Darrell Russell were
both weighed in an odd fashion last week. As part of a charitable
promotion, the Campbell Soup Co. put them on a special scale that
looked like a spoon. Each, coincidentally, weighed the equivalent
of 262 soup cans, which translates into 290 pounds.

   With each passing week, it becomes clearer that the city of Los
Angeles doesn't have a clue what it's doing, which is why it won't
get the league's 32d franchise in 31 days unless there's a radical
change in approach, which is unlikely. A majority of the City
Council said Tuesday that it would not support the use of any
public funds to bring pro football back to the Coliseum, although
an official vote isn't to be taken until this week. Councilwoman
Laura Chick showed the level of delusion on the Left Coast when she
said, ``We have everything it takes to bring a team back. We have
the fans, the marketplace, the facilities, and the private sector
leadership willing to put together a financial package. What we
don't have and should not have is use of our precious and short
taxpayer dollars for this project.'' The fact is they don't have
the fans, the facilities, or the financing to get the Coliseum
retooled and a team paid for. Other than that, she was right on the
money. Now that I think about it, no she wasn't. She was wrong
about the money, too . . . As mentioned here a week ago, the 49ers
have only one cornerback taller than 5-7. This amused the brother
of defensive coordinator Jim Mora Jr. so much that he called asking
for one of Mark McMillian's uniforms for his 8-year-old ``before he
outgrows it.'' The situation may not be so funny a month from now .
. . Is it just my imagination or does new Redskins owner Daniel
Snyder think he's George Steinbrenner? In a letter sent before he
bought the team for $800 million, Snyder promised employees that
everyone's job was safe. Then he came in and wiped out 25 people,
including the entire PR staff and general manager Charley Casserly,
who did a fantastic job in difficult circumstances last spring,
making trades to protect the team's long-term future. Snyder also
told other owners and the media that he would not fire Casserly or
head coach Norv Turner because ``football will be a new experience
for me and I'm going to need experienced football personnel to run
the team.'' Apparently he didn't need many of the ones he said he'd
keep . . . Snyder, by the way, is rumored to be the next owner
ready to sell stadium naming rights for millions. Although the
Redskins publicly say they have no deal to rename Jack Kent Cooke
Stadium, insiders expect Federal Express or another bidder to have
its name on the stadium wall by the Sept. 12 season opener. Federal
Express tried to make a similar deal with the Ravens but pulled out
when the rights were sold to PSINet for $100 million. This brings
back to mind the perfect company for the Patriots to contact about
naming rights for the new stadium that will be built in Foxborough.
Owner Robert Kraft could sell the rights to Kraft Foods at a
discount, thereby giving two people the rights with one name . . .
Eddie DeBartolo decided to abandon not only the 49ers but also San
Francisco. DeBartolo has moved himself and his corporation to
Tampa, where he is building a house and relocating many of his
business ventures from the family compound in Youngstown, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team may not be any better, but at least one thing has
improved in Philadelphia. Hall of Fame center/linebacker Chuck
Bednarik visited training camp for the first time in 14 years,
ending a longtime feud with the team. Bednarik had felt unwelcome
around the Eagles since Dick Vermeil retired in 1982, but new coach
Andy Reid made a point of calling him and asking him to stop by.
Reid claims Bednarik was one of his favorite players. Bednarik, who
played 14 years for the Eagles, lives only 10 minutes from the
Lehigh campus where the Eagles train . . . One reason the Jets
chose to sign free agent safety Steve Atwater after Denver let him
go was the impression he made on assistant coach Eric Mangini
during workouts at the Pro Bowl in February. Instead of hitting the
golf course when he arrived in Honolulu, Atwater sought out Mangini
and sat down with him to study the playbook for the meaningless
game. This impressed Mangini and convinced Bill Parcells that the
eight-time Pro Bowler still wanted to play with enthusiasm . . .
NFL Properties, the league's off-field marketing company, recently
signed a contract with Ed Anzalone, known to Jets fans as Fireman
Eddie. T-shirts, dolls, and fireman hats will be marketed, with
Anzalone getting a piece of the action. It's the first
merchandising deal between NFL Properties and a nonplayer, and one
more reason to hate the Jets . . . The Hammer is back in the NFL.
Well, not the real Hammer _ ex-Kansas City cornerback Fred
Williamson _ but the onetime rap star and failed player agent,
Hammer. He has joined KGO radio in San Francisco as part of its
pregame shows before 49er games. Hammer worked as a batboy for the
Oakland A's under the name Stanley Burrell before he became a rap
superstar.

NYYC FEELS WIND AT ITS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ With kids racing little sailboats in the
distance and the ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II sliding
majestically into the harbor for the start of the Jazz Festival,
the meaning of Friday's sendoff of the New York Yacht Club's
America's Cup team was excruciatingly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest harbor in the world,'' declared Newport's
mayor, David Gordon, at a press conference on the lawn of Harbour
Court, summer clubhouse of the New York Yacht Club. ``We offer our
arms and hearts to put on America's Cup 2003.''
</P>
<P>
   The Young America sailing team stood in front of the unveiled
graphics on a 26-foot test model of the new IACC yachts, then
departed for New Zealand on what may be the most important of the
26 America's Cup campaigns waged by the NYYC since 1851.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the last time the New Yorkers tried to win the Cup in
Fremantle, they had a flawed campaign led by a club still angry and
bewildered by its loss to Australia and her tricks in the summer of
'83.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, the first chance in 13 years to win the
Cup back outright, the New Yorkers seem to have it all: an expert
development team led by veteran John Marshall (engineer of Dennis
Conner's 1996 Stars &AMP; Stripes Cup win), strong funding, two new
boats built by a proven Cup winner (Eric Goetz Custom Sailboats in
Bristol, R.I.), and a deep team of the best sailors and technicians
in the world. So the question arises, ``If not now, when?''
</P>
<P>
   And though questions linger about whether the NYYC has been
soured by its Cup experiences in the '80s, commodore George Isdale
gave a very different picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our members are tremendously behind this campaign,'' he said.
``To date, 30 percent of the membership have contributed millions
and millions of dollars to the effort, and we hope to get as high
as 50 percent. We have put aside the past and are committed to an
all-out effort to make this happen. We want the Cup, and we intend
to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   All morning, winds billowed the red, white, and blue spinnakers
used to veil the tank team model. Then team members drew them aside
to reveal a sleek black International America's Cup Class yacht,
with red and gray shark graphics on the side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boats this time will be slender compared to '95,''
explained Marshall, president of Young America. ``They will carry a
very high ballast-to-boat weight ratio, and will be lively in light
wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Though customized for different wind and sea ranges, the two
Bruce Farr-designed boats are more similar than different, and both
will be used in the early round-robins of the Louis Vuitton Cup, a
preliminary to the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our two boats are as different as two brothers in a family are
different,'' said Marshall. ``They belong together, but they have
different personalities in their designs. Which one will prove more
versatile in race conditions in Auckland, the sailors will have to
tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   One stunning achievement of the technology team is that Young
America's hulls have been honed to such a gleaming perfection that
they require neither fairing with putty nor painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are black,'' said Marshall, ``because carbon fiber is
black. They're not painted at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, reminded marine historian Michael O'Connor, New
Zealand's 1995 winning Cup juggernaut used boats nicknamed Black
Magic, so perhaps New York's black color constitutes a
not-so-subtle ``shot across the bow.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all modern Cup racers, the Young America is 75 feet long
with a 12-foot appendage of steel leading to a 20-ton bulb of lead
ballast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best steel in the world,'' said Marshall of the fin.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for so many structures on the boat seeks to combine
``strength, lightness, smallness.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Young America, already on the New Zealand docks, will
be assembled for shakedown sails as the team arrives over the next
couple of weeks, along with families and support personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the first round-robin, Young America will compete
with three other US syndicates, plus five from other countries, for
the right to sail against New Zealand in the Cup Match beginning
Feb. 18, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other US syndicates are Conner, San Diego; Aloha, Hawaii, John
Kolius; America True, San Francisco, Dawn Riley; and AmericaOne,
Paul Cayard, also San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long way to go,'' said Young America skipper Ed Baird,
who was part of the research and development process that created
the boats over the last two years. ``But we have done 200 days of
two-boat testing and we haven't lost a single day of sailing. It's
kind of amazing how far we've come to this point.''

MCCAIN RETREATS TO VACATION CABIN AS OPPONENTS BATTLE IN IOWA
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain traded the hullaba loo of the Iowa straw poll for
the peace and quiet of Arizona's Lake Powell and a cabin in
Cottonwood, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the decision of an uncon ventional candidate with an
uncon ventional campaign strategy, which, at least so far, places
far less emphasis on Iowa than do his GOP rivals.
</P>
<P>
   But skipping the straw poll was a calculated gamble.
</P>
<P>
   McCain believes his reformist message may be better received by
voters in other early-primary states such as New Hampshire, South
Carolina and California. He would be at a disadvantage in Iowa
because he opposes subsidies for ethanol, a fuel blend made with
corn that Iowans consider important to their economy.
</P>
<P>
   But shunning the limelight could backfire, especially if the
straw poll only adds more momentum to George W. Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa requires candidates to build strong organizations capable
of turn ing out supporters to caucus meet ings on a winter's night
early in 2000. McCain, whose campaign doesn't want to offend Iowa
voters, says he hasn't ruled out participat ing in the caucuses.
But he doesn't have much of a team in Iowa because he has been
focusing on other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bounce that a Republican gets out of both New
Hampshire and South Carolina will be even more important than it
has been in years past because of the brevity of the primary
campaign season,'' McCain said at a recent luncheon of Western
reporters. ``I believe the fastest-growing registra tion of voters
in California is independents.''
</P>
<P>
   Independents are a key voting group for McCain, who has bucked
the GOP on major issues and doesn't mind being called a ``mav
erick.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has criticized the Iowa straw poll as a ``spending
frenzy'' for candidates to buy votes. His boycotting the poll is
designed to dovetail with his broad campaign theme of reforming the
campaign system to reduce the influence of big money.
</P>
<P>
   While other candidates cam paigned in Iowa last week, McCain
geared up for a 12-day swing through California, beginning Mon day
with a Santa Monica speech. McCain's emphasis on California is
partly due to a change in the primary rules since the last presi
dential election.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in 1996, California Demo crats and independents will be
able to participate in the popular vote in the state's 2000 GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Their inclusion, McCain strate gists believe, opens a door for
the Arizonan.
</P>
<P>
   ``California voters have a long tradition of fighting back
against the establishment,'' said Dan Schnur, who served as a top
aide to former Gov. Pete Wilson in Sacramento, and is now working
for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the progressives at the turn of the century through the
tax cuts in Proposition 13 to the present day, you see an awful lot
of voter activism in the state. That's a market in which an
outsider candidate with a reform message can do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and California may seem an odd fit to some observers. The
neighboring states have quarreled about everything from allocations
of Colorado River water to whether too many Arizona tourists
descend on San Diego in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain recently began lunch with many California reporters by
joking, ``Any compliments that I pay the state of California, I'd
like to retract.''
</P>
<P>
   But he went on to credit Califor nia for initiatives on
campaign-fi nance reform and other issues. &QL;

PATRIOTS MUST LEARN FROM MISTAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tweaking. That's what Bobby Grier and Pete
Carroll must do before the Patriots' exhibition season gets too
close to the real thing Sept. 12 against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of player personnel Grier must tinker with the
roster; Carroll must fine-tune his coaching style, which has gone
from excitable to intense in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's 20-14 loss to the Washington Redskins wasn't
reason for anyone to call 911. It was just the first exhibition
game.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, though, some of the subplots were all too
familiar. The Patriots played shorthanded, with Willie McGinest
held out for precautionary reasons, which was a good thing. But Ted
Johnson was in street clothes and a cast on the sidelines, at one
point talking to Drew Bledsoe, who had an ice pack on his twisted
right ankle, which was a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Grier said all last week that he was seeking a defensive lineman
and a linebacker, believing the team was thin in both areas. His
instincts proved correct Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins ran up the middle with some authority and neither
rookie linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer, newly appointed starter Tedy
Bruschi, nor defensive lineman Brandon Mitchell, who was playing
with a cast on his broken right hand, did much to stop them. Safety
Chris Carter might have made a whopper of a hit in the second
quarter but otherwise did nothing to alleviate fears that the
Patriots might have let Willie Clay go too soon.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, it's a little too late for a major reworking of
the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line is the hardest spot to fill. The Patriots may be
able to bring in a veteran, but the likelihood of finding another
Henry Thomas appears slim.
</P>
<P>
   The team spoke internally about bringing in Pepper Johnson last
week, but it was decided that Johnson was too old and couldn't
provide any more than the young linebackers on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that decision needs to be reevaluated. Also out there is
veteran Seth Joyner, who is not a middle linebacker but could add
experience and direction.
</P>
<P>
   A player who auditioned last week, Steve Morrison, is a veteran
who played with Indianapolis, and he could add some expertise
regarding divisional opponents. Perhaps the Patriots need to
consider more how they think and what they know instead of how fast
they run and what the stopwatch says.
</P>
<P>
   If too much is being expected too soon of young players, the
Patriots created that situation, cutting veterans to get younger
out of either necessity or choice.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenmoyer didn't look like the answer to replacing Johnson, at
least not yet. He has too much to learn before we see the
professional version of one of the most ferocious players in
college football history. And it still appears the Patriots miss
Todd Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may have waited too long to shore up their depth.
One thing former Patriots coach Bill Parcells is known for, for
better or worse, is that when he recognizes a need, it doesn't stay
a need for very long. If it means giving up draft picks or signing
a player for more than he's worth, the Jets coach gets it done in a
hurry. That's why he signed Scott Zolak. He knew he had to have a
backup and he probably could have waited to see if a better one
became available, but he didn't want to let the situation fester.
</P>
<P>
   As for Carroll, he's already being bashed again as a coach and a
leader. He will get such treatment as long as he produces a team
inferior to the ones of the previous regime.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound curious, but Carroll's first two weeks of training
camp may have been too hard. The players weren't used to two-a-days
for so many consecutive days. By Thursday there was a dropoff in
intensity. Many veterans, who normally were able to take it easier
so early in camp, were showing signs of fatigue, and Carroll even
lashed out at them a bit because of the dropoff.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe now he needs to back off a bit, especially with his
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But there certainly were some positive things Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Faulk may have proven that the Patriots don't need to
bring in an older back with bad knees after all (the Terry Allen
talks have been the longest in history for what would be an
insignificant move). Bledsoe was sharp before his interception.
Chris Floyd showed he can play.
</P>
<P>
   Tebucky Jones was very physical, although he really does look
more like a safety than a cornerback. Michael Bishop proved he
should be used somewhere on the field this season. The receivers
were on their game.
</P>
<P>
   First-round pick Damien Woody just needs more reps and
experience at center. Despite Carroll's disappointment with the
kicking game (Lee Johnson punted for a 45.6-yard average, Adam
Vinatieri missed a 29-yard field goal), Vinatieri and Johnson
executed an onside kick successfully. And the third team did a nice
job in bringing up the spirits of the crowd and the rest of the
team in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't be happy with this,'' said cornerback Ty Law.
``We didn't perform well as a team. It's more like an intense
practice right now. We made some mistakes and we can correct
them.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the first game wasn't so good, but it was nothing that a
good tweak or two can't fix. That will be happening all this week
in Smithfield, R.I., as camp continues.

CHAMP OUSTED AT ACURA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Lindsay Davenport's homecoming to
Southern California ended prematurely in Saturday's semifinals as
Julie Halard-Decugis won the final five games of the second set.
The underdog from France ousted the tournament's defending champ
6-3, 7-5 in one hour, eight minutes at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if it's here or Tokyo or Europe,'' Davenport
said. ``When you don't play well on the surface you like, it's
disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, a Newport Beach resident, normally thrives on
hardcourts such as this one. She is also known for a powerful,
consistent forehand. But that shot failed her as she had 32
unforced errors to Halard-Decugis' 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed so many shots long and wide, and my forehand has been
a strength for years,'' Davenport said. ``Hopefully, it's just a
one-match thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and Halard-Decugis are power players, so their rallies
typically were fast. The games also were quick; only two went to
40-deuce.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those 40-deuce games, Halard-Decugis served while
trailing 5-2. Davenport had two break points and Halard-Decugis had
three double faults but recovered to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just so bad if she has three double faults and you
don't break her,'' Davenport said. ``I just couldn't put it
together.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis has not lost a set in the Acura Classic,
eliminating Iva Majoli, Amy Frazier and Mary Pierce. Davenport and
Pierce both said they were off against Halard-Decugis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Halard-Decugis said. ``If they don't want to
play good against me, I don't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   The first set was straightforward and lasted 31 minutes. Each
player won every serve until Davenport failed in the fourth game,
when Halard-Decugis had a triple-break point. On the second break
try, Davenport hit into the net to give her opponent the point.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other break points in the first set until the
final game, when Davenport failed to convert two break points and
repeatedly missed attempts at winners down the line.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport pulled her left hamstring in her victory Friday night
in a tight, three-set match against Conchita Martinez but insisted
the injury did not hamper her against Halard-Decugis.
</P>
<P>
   In her 13-year pro career, Halard-Decugis has never been ranked
higher than 15th. The 28-year-old came back to the tour in 1998
after missing more than a year with a variety of injuries. She
lives in Pully, Switzerland, and is married to her longtime tennis
coach, Arnaud Decugis.
</P>
<P>
   Halard-Decugis said she didn't notice that Davenport was off her
game because Davenport served well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she is best with her serve and backhand,''
Halard-Decugis said. ``Sometimes she is good with her forehand. For
me, I am best with my forehand, so I kept trying to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said the loss would linger in her mind ``for about a
day.'' She hopes to turn things around during the upcoming Pilot
Pen tournament in New Haven and the U.S. Open, which follows.
</P>
<P>
   She won at Stanford and made the semifinals in Carlsbad and Los
Angeles this summer. However, she won all three tournaments last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, (Halard-Decugis) played well,'' Davenport said.
``But you hate to say it. . . I think I was awful today.''

ANDERSON SUSPENDED BY UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA has suspended starting cornerback Marques
Anderson from school for the fall quarter for his participation in
the disabled-parking scandal and prior incidents with the dean of
students office, according to a statement issued by his family.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant dean of students Kenneth Kelly informed Anderson of
the decision Friday. Anderson, a junior from Long Beach, will
redshirt this season and return to school (and the team) for the
winter quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Anderson family is devastated and saddened by the behavior
leading to this suspension,'' the statement said. ``We regret what
has happened but must accept it as one of life's harsh lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing state and federal privacy laws, UCLA declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 current players involved in the parking scandal are
required to meet with the dean's office. A source said no one else
is expected to be suspended; Anderson's prior, undisclosed
incidents were his undoing.
</P>
<P>
   However, sources said the dean's office is adding 50 hours of
community service to the 200 court-ordered hours given to the
players at their July 28 arraignment. The players also were fined
$1,500, suspended for two games and required to participate in
educational programs to raise awareness of the rights of the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was one of UCLA's most experienced cornerbacks and
usually saved his best performances for USC. He contained Trojans
receiver R. Jay Soward in 1997 and forced two USC fumbles last
year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Corner concerns: Anderson's absence leaves the Bruins a man
short in the secondary once senior Ryan Roques returns from his
two-game parking scandal suspension. They have two options: put
Roques at safety and find a cornerback, or put Roques at cornerback
and find a safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty talented and we'd like to play him at safety,''
Toledo said. ``That way, he can roam the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety seems the best bet for Roques. Although inexperienced,
cornerbacks Lovell Houston, Joe Hunter, Julius Williams and Ricky
Manning Jr. are talented _ probably more talented than the players
competing for the safety vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to get by for the first couple games and see how
we do,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: The Bruins landed their seventh recruit
Saturday when Chris Kluwe, a punter from Los Alamitos High School,
gave Toledo an oral commitment.
</P>
<P>
   __ Movin' up: Sophomore DeShaun Foster is no longer the Pac-10's
most talented third-string tailback. Because of Keith Brown's
parking-scandal suspension, Foster has ascended to second string
behind starter Jermaine Lewis. And he might not be there for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep teasing (Foster) how I want to keep him third string so
he won't (enter the NFL) as a junior,'' Toledo quipped. ``But he'll
probably be the starting tailback. He's really talented.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Movin' up II: Another underclassmen set to challenge the
veterans is rookie tight end Mike Seidman from Westlake Village.
After four workouts, Toledo pronounced Seidman ready to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one (true freshman) on offense who will definitely
play,'' Toledo said. ``He's everything we thought he'd be.
(Tight-ends coach) Gary Bernardi is very impressed. He's strong. He
runs well. He catches well. We're very excited.''

   HATE-INTERNET (Los Angeles) _ Eric Owens appears to be no one

this summer with an astounding string of successes at the nation's

   IRON-GIANT (Los Angeles) _ What in the world happened to the
``Iron Giant''? Despite universally positive reviews of the Warner
Bros. animated movie, the ``Iron Giant'' opened with a massive thud
last weekend. It finished with $5.7 million at 2,171 theaters _
barely one-fifth of the business generated by Bruce Willis' ``Sixth
Sense.'' That's a flat-out disaster for a project that racked up a
tab estimated at $50 million and an embarrassment for the studio
considering ``Iron Giant'' debut during a supercharged summer in
which grosses have risen an astounding 20 percent over last year's
record-setting pace. By Dave McNary. (Has already MOVED in the

   Bush takes one-third of Iowa vote
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Herman and Scott S. Greenberger
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ In a battle waged more with money and buses than
message and policy, Gov. George W. Bush on Saturday won the biggest
preseason event of the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory in the Iowa GOP straw poll fell short of the
margins he has shown in most major nationwide polls, a result that
left Saturday's win open to spin and speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush finished first with 31 percent of the nearly 24,000 straw
votes cast. Forbes, solidifying his role as the leading alternative
to frontrunner Bush, ran a solid second with 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than accomplished what we set out to do,'' Bush
said after the results were announced. ``The victory today in Iowa
put me on the road to earning the nomination of the Republican
party.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Forbes camp also left pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happened on the way to the coronation,'' said
Forbes, ``the people voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole was third with 14 percent. The worst news for the
night came for former Vice President Dan Quayle, who ran eighth
with less than 4 percent, and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar
Alexander, who was sixth with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain, who called the event a ``sham,'' did
not participate, but still received about half a percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll, which plays no official role in the nomination
process, attracted a full-house crowd at Iowa State University's
campus coliseum. It cost $25 to vote, but the candidates bought the
tickets and handed them out to supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was on the rhetorical dart board for opponents struggling
to compete with his money-raising machine and high poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes was generous in his criticism of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, the power of these Washington elites won't be
tamed, bent or broken by a candidate who relies on pollsters and
tutors to tell him what he thinks,'' Forbes said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to forward the image of Bush as a candidate
without positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a candidate won't tell you where he stands that means he
either doesn't know where he stands or he doesn't want you to know
where he stands, and either one is not good for the American
people,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who offered up a truncated version of his standard stump
speech, had only kind words for his opponents, referring to them as
``good and decent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned you cannot lead by dividing people. I reject the
ugly politics of division,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, who served with Bush's dad,
joined Forbes and others who took direct aim at the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can ill-afford to have another president who needs
on-the-job training when it comes to foreign policy and
international experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Quayle took aim at Bush's big money advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington establishment, they want to control this
election. They want to tell you who to vote for. They say that
money will determine who our nominee is going to be,'' said Quayle.
``I say let's send them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Quayle got personal, targeting Bush's self-professed
young and irresponsible years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it doesn't really matter what you did before you were
40 years old. I'm proud of what I did before I was 40,'' said
Quayle, who had served two terms in the U.S. House and two in the
U.S. Senate before age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservative Gary Bauer urged voters to ignore money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of talk about how much money one guy has
raised and another has inherited,'' he said of Bush and Forbes.
``But campaigns are supposed to be about the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander summed it up simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the nomination can't be bought and shouldn't be
inherited. It should be earned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates made bold promises about ending legal
abortion and appointing judges who share that goal _ a vow Bush has
declined to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been told by politicians, including some in our
party, that this issue will take 50 years to deal with, 40 years to
deal with. No it won't,'' Bauer said, noting that the next
president could have two Supreme Court vacancies to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who usually does not mention abortion in his stump speech,
made two brief abortion references, saying ``a generous society
protects the vulnerable, the aged, the handicapped, the unborn''
and then touted the Texas Legislature's approval of a law mandating
notification of parents prior to abortions performed on minors.
</P>
<P>
   The only politician who took more flak than Bush was President
Bill Clinton. Pat Buchanan got the day's most boisterous response
when he announced the first thing he would do as president would be
turn to Clinton and say, ``Sir, you have the right to remain
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Though more than half the straw pollees did not vote for Bush
(and Sen. John McCain did not participate), the results met his
definition for victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a first-place finish is a win,'' he said late Friday
at a rally in Indianola, Iowa. ``That may not be the conventional
definition of a victory, I readily concede.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush knew that anything short of an overwhelming win could
be played as something of a loss for a candidate who is way ahead
of the pack in early polls and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is it's up to you all to determine who
wins or loses,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   An Iowa Project poll completed last week and carrying a margin
of error of 5.7 percentage points, showed Bush with a 37-15 lead
over Forbes among Iowans who said they are likely to attend next
February's caucuses. No other candidate was in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Though some questioned the validity of the event _ essentially a
fund-raiser in which votes cost $25 apiece, all paid for by the
candidates _ all of the candidates said it was, at least, a
credible test of ability to move and motivate supporters. In early
February, contenders who survive that long will be back here trying
to convince supporters to brave wintry weather to attend the
caucuses that kick off the for-real part of the presidential
selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of seeing where you are strong and where you need
to make improvements,'' Forbes said while campaigning here last
week. ``I see it as a critical milestone, a benchmark on the way to
the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Forbes waged high-dollar efforts here, with Forbes
spending about $2 million and Bush spending about $750,000. Forbes
ran television and radio ads, in addition to mobilizing a 90-bus
platoon to bring supporters to Ames. His campaign said it bought
more than 7,000 tickets to allow Iowans to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was in Iowa only one day last week. But his events drew the
biggest crowds and his campaign said it had purchased 11,000 entry
tickets. He ran no media ads, but depended on a sold organization
and more than 100 buses to move supporters to Ames.
</P>
<P>
   But a quick check on the straw poll grounds found that some
attendees were thinking convenience, not candidate, when they
picked a bus to ride to Ames.
</P>
<P>
   Retired state employee Richard Brackett from Rock Creek rode an
Elizabeth Dole bus and was standing in a Forbes barbecue line when
he declared himself uncommitted prior to the vote. ``I haven't
really decided, but I like Gary Bauer, Forbes, Buchanan and Alan
Keyes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ames, straw poll participants found a county fair atmosphere
leading up to the 13-minute speeches from each candidate. The
Forbes and Bush tents were at adjacent locations near the coliseum.
Bush won a bidding war for what his team considered the best site
by paying $43,500. Forbes paid $8,000 for a site that seemed just
as good.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes pumped up attendance at his site by offering kiddie rides
along with food and music.
</P>
<P>
   The carnival-like atmosphere drew the curious as well as the
committed. Rod MacBride, a graduate student at Iowa State who
described himself as an independent, said he came ``to see the
media watching the people and the people watching the media.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go down to the state fair if you want, but I think
this is more fun for the day.''
</P>
<P>
   As a throng of diners chewed happily in the Bush tent, a Bush
aide with a microphone felt compelled to give them a reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't vote with your fork,'' he said.

CLARIDGE MAKES MOVE UP FRONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's been a sore point for the previous three
years of USC offensive lineman Travis Claridge's career: At some
point during each of those seasons, his unit drew criticism as one
of the Trojans' weakest positions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Saturday was USC's first day of training camp, Claridge
already sees more talent in this year's line than any of the others
he played on. That's significant, because the outspoken Claridge
rarely tosses out compliments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see improvement in everybody,'' Claridge said. ``The one
who's really good is Lenny Vandermade. Lenny is a good, tough
football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Vandermade, a true freshman from Mater Dei, is one reason the
line is better. He is a backup at guard and might not redshirt this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Claridge is moving from right guard to right tackle as USC
attempts to get more athletic along the line. Redshirt freshman
Zach Wilson and senior Jason Grain (who lost 30 pounds this summer)
are battling at right guard.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Donta Kendrick and sophomore Faasea Mailo are the
candidates at left guard. Mailo started three games in 1996 before
going on a Mormon mission.
</P>
<P>
   As camp opened, the only weak point appeared to be left tackle.
Starter Brent McCaffrey (punctured foot) is out for the first few
days, leaving junior Trevor Roberts as a practice mainstay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll be a very good line,'' Claridge said. ``It has
the most potential of any line I've played on.''
</P>
<P>
   __ First-day report: Hackett was pleased with the Trojans' first
day at UC Irvine. Many of the true freshmen stood out, including
wide receivers Kareem Kelly and Marcell Allmond and defensive back
Darrell Rideaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but it looks like those guys can make
contributions and help us,'' Hackett said. ``Only time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman linebacker Chris Prosser also stood out in the
afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman tailback Sultan McCullough, limited by a
strained hamstring he suffered at the NCAA Track Championships in
June, was supposed to practice lightly this week but went full
speed in the afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he was ready to go,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tip-top condition: One player who arrived in great shape was
Allmond, who is one of the top junior decathletes in the country.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Allmond set the national record for 17-and-18-year
olds with 7,377 points in the decathlon. He also scored 7,111
points at the Junior Nationals, which used adult implements for the
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the best shape of my life,'' Allmond said. ``It's
helped a lot (here).
</P>
<P>
   It gives me a chance to run more routes in practice because I'm
in better shape and I don't get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Freshman Armand Holland is out with a strained
back, and Hackett said he will miss the first week of practice
while undergoing therapy.
</P>
<P>
   __ Crooked field: Training camp got off to an inauspicious
debut, when Hackett learned the practice-field chalk lines were
slanted and not square.
</P>
<P>
   USC called the crew that paints the Coliseum field and an
emergency repair job was done Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more involved in horticulture and agriculture now,''
Hackett said.

SOWARD'S SUMMER ABSENCE AFFECTS TEAM CHEMISTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ As fast as he is, R. Jay Soward couldn't outrun
suspicion. It overtook the USC receiver last Thursday, shortly
after he completed the eighth of 16 wind sprints with the football
team.
</P>
<P>
   It's plain to see Soward is a marvelously gifted athlete. He's
so speedy, he was just a blur to his teammates this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, 21, chose to prepare for his senior season in his own
way. So while 40 of the Trojans he'll go to war with this fall got
bigger, faster, stronger and closer, Soward built up his muscle in
the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Marquee players at the school have excused themselves from these
so-called optional workouts before, which might explain why recent
USC teams have failed chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're suffering and your teammates are sweating right
there with you, that's what builds ultimate respect,'' senior
safety David Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Respect is won on the field of battle, too. Soward's absence
from the summer mix might have gone unnoticed if his name hadn't
been so conspicuous by its absence from the 1998 All-Pac-10 and
All-America first-team lists.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows running back Barry Sanders used to eschew
Detroit Lions' conditioning camps. Of course, his Heisman Trophy
and 10 All-Pro berths were more than enough collateral for his
teammates. All Soward could offer is two All-Pac-10 second-team
berths. That's really not enough to warrant training apart from his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   As Gibson put it, ``I don't think he's at the stage to be doing
what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward sounded sincere when he said, ``I want to win a Heisman
so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But wishing won't make it so. You have to pay for that kind of
success with sweat and tears.
</P>
<P>
   God-given talent has gotten Soward this far. It's a shame he
won't at least chip in some determination and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The 41 summer conditioning sessions would have been a good place
to start. It couldn't have hurt Soward to run his routes over and
over and over with quarterback Carson Palmer until he knew them as
well as the notes to his favorite songs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the connection Soward spent more time strengthening was
with the people who call the plays in the music industry. In his
L.A. apartment, where a few weights, 1998 game tapes and a VCR
might have been put to use, Soward set up a pre-production studio.
He recorded a rap song titled, ``It's a Struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Film of his last wind sprint on Thursday would have worked
nicely for the accompanying MTV video. It was such a struggle,
Soward had to stop and catch his breath.
</P>
<P>
   Don't think his teammates didn't notice. Soward never has
demonstrated dean's-list discipline where hook-routes or school
books are concerned. So you could forgive Soward's teammates for
suspecting the only thing that has changed this year is his class
standing.
</P>
<P>
   When he bailed on the running drill, Soward acknowledged his
teammates ``gave me a look like, `Is he going to be ready?' '' He
said he was ``very embarrassed'' by his effort.
</P>
<P>
   He sounded sufficiently contrite when he said, ``As far as my
teammates, I regret that I didn't come around. I could have made
our team so much better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not too late. There are untold practices and at least 12
games to make amends. But the alliances cemented under the lazy
summer sun and the friendships fortified under buckled weights _
they are lost, never to be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just on the field that Soward has dropped the ball.
From the day he stepped foot on the USC campus, Soward seems to
have been taking his leave of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Having turned down the NFL to return to USC for one more year,
the hope here is Soward will make an effort to leave footprints.
</P>
<P>
   A bright young man, he hasn't invested any more in his studies
than is absolutely necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has a heaping helping of personality, but he hasn't
invested much of his charisma toward being a team leader. He's
friendly, but he hasn't cultivated many close relationships on the
team. Press clippings are nice, but they're no substitute for
lifelong friendships and lasting memories.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has committed so little of himself to college, he hasn't
left much of an imprint. Here's hoping he changes his course _ and
fast.

COWBOYS' NGUYEN POSSESSES EXTRA SENSE FOR FOOTBALL, LIFE (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The first clue that Dat Nguyen was going
to be rich, famous and always in the right place at the right time
came when he was a second grader at Rockport-Fulton Elementary. He
received $50 a day to appear in a handful of scenes of an Ed
Harris/Amy Madigan movie titled ``Alamo Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen doesn't recall all the particulars, except that the
filming lasted about three months, and he missed a few weeks of
school because the filming ran into September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows I'm a movie star,'' Nguyen said during a break
recently at Cowboys camp. ``Nobody knows that I co-starred in a
movie with Ed Harris.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is running second team behind Randall Godfrey at middle
linebacker for the Cowboys. For all his achievements _ 1998
Lombardi Trophy winner, Dick Butkus Award finalist, Big 12 and
national defensive player of the year _ he never takes himself too
seriously. But the rest of the NFL might want to. Based on what he
has shown in training camp, Nguyen seems to have some star power.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is the NFL's first Vietnamese-American player. He was
conceived in Vietnam and born to Tammy and Ho Nguyen on Sept. 25,
1975, in a Vietnamese refugee camp in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until several years after filming ``Alamo Bay'' that
Nguyen realized the movie was an unflattering portrayal of
Vietnamese shrimpers working off the Texas gulf coast near Seadrift
and Port O'Conner. It was filmed in 1982. The Vietnam War had been
over for seven years, but the emotional scars in this country were
still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young to understand the storyline,'' said Nguyen,
who eventually watched the movie when he could understand it. ``The
Vietnamese shrimper came in and took away business from the people
in that community. I didn't know that I was part of a movie that
portrayed Vietnamese shrimpers in a bad light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly? The movie wasn't very good,'' he critiqued with a
grin. ``In the end, though, I think it does prove a point. We're
all in this world together, and we have to learn to make
adjustments.'' According to Nguyen, the movie is hard to find in
video rental, but there is one copy at his cousin's video store in
Rockport.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Long ``Lee'' Cao at Kim Video said, ``''Alamo Bay''
rents out once, sometimes twice, a week. Maybe I miss something ...
\Rbecause\S I see the movie and I don't see Dat.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen doesn't have a speaking part in the movie but does appear
in several scenes. In one, he plays shortstop on a softball team
and makes a catch and tags out a runner.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey saw enough of the ``movies'' on Nguyen
at Texas A&AMP;M to make him the 85th selection overall in the April
draft. ``Don't take into account the way he looks, as far his size
\R5-foot-11, 231 pounds\S and speed. ... Just watch him play the
game,'' Gailey said. ``Wherever the football goes, Dat's right
there. He has a real knack for putting himself around the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how a great running back has great vision? You know
how a great running back has that `feel' for where the defender is
and knows that the crease will be there if he can just stretch a
linebacker and hit it back up in there. Well, Dat has that same
`feel' on the other side of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen seems cut from the same mold as former Texas Tech
lineback Zach Thomas. The 5-11, 235-pound four-year veteran was a
fifth-round draft choice from Texas Tech who recently signed a
multi-million-dollar contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to depict that this guy is totally a finesse
player. He's not,'' Gailey said. ``He's a pretty physical guy who
can take on people when he has to do that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M has been Linebacker U. for years, but Aggies coach
R.C. Slocum said this past week, ``Dat Nguyen is as instinctive a
player as we've ever had here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so alert; he sees things before they happen,'' Slocum
added. ``For example, if a guard is leaning back in his stance or a
running back is cheating up on the line, Dat sees it. He has great
anticipation. We had an onside kick once _ you know, you just hope
somebody falls on the ball _ but Dat picked it up and ran for a
touchdown.'' The Cowboys decided before the April draft to move
Godfrey to middle linebacker. Godfrey started all 16 games in '98
at strong-side linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   But if Nguyen continues to make big plays (he had a flying sack
against Cleveland), and if he continues to be around the ball as he
always is in practice, Gailey will be forced to get him onto the
field for more than just special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen has come a long way since being recruited by Slocum on a
tip that this Vietnamese-American could dunk a basketball from a
flat-footed start. But when Nguyen was redshirted as a freshman in
1994, he weighed a fat 240 pounds and was extremely lonely away
from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared to death that he was going to leave,'' Slocum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I nearly did,'' Nguyen admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Nguyen worked all her American life in the restaurant
business until she underwent eye surgery last year. For nearly two
decades, she ran Hong Kong, a Vietnamese-Chinese restaurant in
Rockport. Six years ago, she opened Hu Dat in Fulton. Ho Nguyen, a
longtime shrimper, now operates a marine supply store next to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In junior high school in Rockport, Nguyen found the security of
friends by hanging out with an older crowd. He sometimes wouldn't
get home until 2 a.m. His mother considered sending him to a
Missouri all-boys school because she felt that he needed structure
and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The mere threat of being uprooted prompted Dat to latch onto
something. He tried out for football. Rockport-Fulton gained a
great player, and Dat found the structure and discipline that he
needed to make his mom happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I started playing football, that took up all my
time and kept me out of trouble,'' he said. ``I look back on it
now, I wasn't really bad. I just stayed out late and worried my
mom. That was the good part. I was fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Slocum: ``I've heard those same stories about Dat. It's
hard for me to even imagine him getting into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen signs autographs and poses for pictures with fans for
20-30 minutes after every practice. He is so patient and thorough
that each time an equipment boy has to ask him for his blue No. 45
jersey and shoulder pads to take into the locker room ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   After one practice this past week, a teen-ager called Nguyen
aside just to ask if he could get Emmitt Smith's autograph for him.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen politely surveyed the practice field and said, ``Gee, I
don't see Emmitt Smith right now. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a sixth-grade boy named Quang Pham in College Station
who knows how helpful Nguyen can be. Nguyen is credited with saving
Pham academically a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Pham came to this country from Vietnam in 1996 at the age of 9.
When he was 10, he still had a prekindergarten English reading
level and was falling behind so quickly in school that the problem
had compounded into a total withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just shy,'' said Nguyen, who spent time with Pham and
helped him to read and comprehend. ``Now he's taking honors
courses.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Dat Nguyen, always in the right place at the right time.

BIG WIN FOR BUSH IN IOWA STRAW POLL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ In an early affirmation of his political prowess,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush bested his GOP competitors Saturday in an
Iowa straw poll that could winnow the crowded field of Republican
presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more than accomplished what we set out to do,'' Bush
told a crowd of about 250 cheering supporters after the nonbinding
vote was counted. ``We jump-started our grass-roots organization
for the main event, the Iowa caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush garnered about 31 percent of the vote in a 12-candidate
field to triumph in this first test of Republican candidates'
organizational strength.
</P>
<P>
   Magazine mogul Steve Forbes, who reportedly pumped more than $1
million into the straw poll effort, came in second with 20 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happened on the way to the coronation,'' Forbes
said in a written statement, after his strong second-place finish.
``The people voted.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cabinet official Elizabeth Dole, whose campaign sorely
needed a boost, came in third with 14.4 percent after spending only
$250,000 on the straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept the premise that money is the only thing that
matters in politics. Tonight shows that,'' said Dole spokesman Ari
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, a fund-raiser for state Republicans, took on greater
significance this year after Bush declared that he not only
intended to participate but to win.
</P>
<P>
   While the exercise is meaningless in terms of a candidate's
ultimate success, the media and the candidates have placed
increasing weight on the results as a barometer of the campaign's
early health. No straw poll winner has ever won the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Forbes relied on sophisticated operations to turn
out the vote, efforts that are likely to put them in good stead for
the Iowa caucuses in January.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes spent far more time in the state than Bush,
spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the results showed that the Texas
governor would be prepared to ``organize a grass-roots effort when
it counts _ the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Bush's supporters made it clear that the principle
reason they were backing the Texas governor was that he appeared to
have the greatest chance of winning back the White House for the
GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I think he will be a winner,'' said Margaret Whitlach,
74, of Pelfa, who was sitting in the Bush tent area. When asked if
any of the governor's positions particularly appealed to her, she
paused and then turned to her husband for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like that he is a conservative with a compassionate heart,''
said Forrest Whitlach, 76, repeating the Bush mantra that he is a
``compassionate conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll may mean more for the candidates who performed
poorly because it will be far more difficult to raise money to
continue the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk was former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, who
spent more time in the state than any other candidate, yet finished
sixth with 6 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bush suggested it was time to narrow the field. ``Everybody's
going to have to reassess their position to find out whether or not
they can stay competitive,'' he said. ``I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle is likely to find his quest for
the Oval Office finally out of reach, as he finished eighth, even
behind broadcaster Alan Keyes, with less than 4 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But a respectable finish of fourth place is likely to boost the
campaign of conservative activist Gary Bauer, who rallied his base
of social conservatives with his focus on abortion and family
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are looking for a new face that has strong
conservative values,'' Bauer said after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Other more conservative candidates did not fare as well.
Commentator Pat Buchanan, who finished third in 1995, placed fifth
this time with 7.3 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year, party officials estimated they sold more than 20,000
tickets, with most of them snapped up by the Bush and Forbes
campaigns to distribute to supporters. Party officials boasted that
they took in $520,000 on the event.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the straw poll were announced several hours after
the eight participating candidates addressed a sports arena on the
Iowa State University campus that was so packed that many
participants were barred from entering.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the candidates lobbed barbs not only at the Clinton-Gore
administration but also at Bush, who has led the pack in both in
terms of early polls and fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Bush avoided criticizing his opponents, and instead repeated his
major campaign themes that he would run an inclusive campaign that
focused on his message of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned you cannot lead by dividing people or pitting
them against one another. I'm a uniter, not a divider,'' Bush told
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes made it clear that he was running against the
political establishment in Washington, which he and others
suggested had tried to anoint Bush as the next GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power of these Washington elites won't be tamed, bent or
broken by a candidate who relies on pollsters and tutors to tell
him what he thinks,'' said the New Jersey millionaire whose entry
was greeted by bleating horns and a shower of confetti and
fireworks. The first half of his speech was drowned out by a group
of Buchanan supporters who popped dozens of balloons while he
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Others also took aim at Clinton, saying he had eroded the moral
values of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan received some of the loudest applause of the day when
he said one of his first actions as president would be to direct
the Justice Department to tell Clinton, ``You have the right to
remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   The straw poll, which drew a record crowd on this sun-splashed
day, was a cross between a carnival and national political
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the coliseum, vendors hawked campaign paraphernalia as
participants strolled through tent parties sponsored by each
candidate. The tents included barbecue spreads, sports figures and
entertainers. Caravans of buses from across the state rolled onto
campus with supporters who were sporting candidates' T-shirts, hats
and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes clearly threw the most elaborate party, as children
frolicked in a playground complete with a huge inflatable slide and
moonwalk. Adults stood around an air-conditioned tent and listened
to singer Debby Boone croon, ``You Light Up My Life.``
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sort of like Disneyland for politics,'' said Tom Rath,
a New Hampshire lawyer and political adviser to Alexander who was
checking out the Forbes party.
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Zeliff, Alexander's national chairman and former New
Hampshire congressman, was less amused by the circuslike
surroundings, including a man on stilts standing next to him
welcoming Forbes supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the real way to pick a president? If it is, we are in
bad shape,'' he said.

TCU RUNNING BACK TOMLINSON ANTICIPATES BREAKING FREE _ AND GETTING
HIT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Tiny charges, it seems to LaDainian Tomlinson, are
pulsing through his body as he takes his first step after receiving
the handoff.
</P>
<P>
   His senses, except for hearing, are jarred into heightened
awareness with each subsequent step. The sounds are around him but
don't penetrate. The silence is so thick that he swears he can hear
the tightening of his muscles as he prepares for the impact of the
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Only there is no tackle. There are only the coaches' whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been tackled since the Sun Bowl,'' Tomlinson said
ruefully. ``Coaches won't let them.''
</P>
<P>
   He is ``the'' tailback in TCU's backfield this season, and if
you think coach Dennis Franchione is going to let him get hit,
you're probably one of those people who hits on 19 when playing
blackjack. The Horned Frogs aren't going to do anything during
two-a-day practices to risk injuring their proven junior tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson has 717 yards and eight touchdowns worth of proof from
1998 when he backed up Basil Mitchell. With Mitchell in Green Bay
Packers' camp, Tomlinson is the only tailback returning with any
real experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has run for 165 yards against a Division I team \RWeek 10
against Tulsa in 1998\S, so he doesn't have a lot to prove,'' TCU
running backs coach Mike Schultz said. ``What I need to be doing
now is making sure on Sept. 5th against Arizona that LT's the guy
I'm lining up.''
</P>
<P>
   The quick whistle during two-a-days and the scrimmageless spring
were all to ensure that Tomlinson entered the 1999 season, arguably
TCU's most anticipated in recent memory, healthy and ready to go.
The precautions almost were for naught.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours spent in the wrong place at the wrong time had the
potential to do more damage than any would-be tackler.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, Tomlinson was arrested with two others on suspicion
of possessing marijuana and evading police. He said he didn't do
either. But he was in the same place at the same time with people
suspected of doing it, and that was enough to get him arrested. The
charges weren't pursued because of lack of evidence, but Tomlinson
said he hasn't forgotten the 24 hours he spent in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really sunk in how fast trouble can get to you,'' Tomlinson
said. ``Everybody had spent all summer telling me the sky is the
limit for me, and I saw that it could've all been gone. I learned a
lot that night, and it changed me in some ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change was in the way Tomlinson perceived himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had always seen himself as part of the team, no more no
less, and that's one of the great things about him,'' said Greg
Walls, Tomlinson's best friend on the team. ``But, in my opinion,
he is going to be the man for us this season. We all look toward
him to be a leader. I think now he knows we need him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Need is the understatement of the week. There is no more
Mitchell in the Mitchell-Tomlinson tandem that helped the Frogs
average 239.1 yards a game in 1998. When Mitchell went, so did the
days of the backup getting starter-like carries. ``We will probably
lean to playing LT a little bit more until one of the guys behind
him proves himself,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson is indeed ``the'' man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's ready,'' Franchione said. ``He has all of the
qualities to be a resilient back.''
</P>
<P>
   He weighs 221 pounds, can bench 430 pounds, can squat 610
pounds, can power clean 333 pounds, can incline bench 400 pounds
and can handle the go-to role the coaches need for him to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting very anxious,'' Tomlinson said. ``TCU fans have
never really gotten a full taste of what I can do. I can't wait for
the season to start to show them.''
</P>
<P>
   Just make sure to look real close when the first would-be
tackler heads his way, and there is no coach's whistle to prevent
the impact. The muscles will tighten, and then Tomlinson hopes to
really show everybody what all of the precautions were about. nn

PARCELLS' ACT CAN'T DISGUISE JETS (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. _ When we last saw Broadway Joe's Jets, they
were sad spectators to John Elway's conquering farewell at Mile
High Stadium in January, having squandered a 10-point lead in the
AFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Jets, with some smart off-season acquisitions,
have done enough to make you think they'll make the AFC title game
again.
</P>
<P>
   And why stop there. How does a New York Jets-Minnesota Vikings
Super Bowl sound?
</P>
<P>
   Last night, in their first on-field action since the debacle in
Denver, the Jets starters looked like they were ready for the
season opener. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde, a poster boy for
reclamation projects that go right, led the Jets on two long
scoring drives against the Green Bay Packers' first-team defense.
The Jets first-team defense, meanwhile, scored a draw against the
Packers' first-team offense, allowing a Brett Favre touchdown pass
on the Packers' first preseason drive of the year, and then forcing
a Favre third-down incompletion on the Packers' next drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but this is still the preseason. The tundra is not yet
frozen. The easy going summer two-a-days have yet to give way to
the pressure cooker Sundays of November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what this season holds _ I have no idea,'' said Jets
coach Bill Parcells, who is rumored among the New York media to be
in his last year as Jets head coach. ``There are things I like
about my team and several things I have a big degree of uncertainty
about. There are some ``big'' question marks and there is a
question of whether we can answer these question marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells can poor-mouth his team with the best of them. But
don't let his coachspeak fool you. Mark this down: The Jets will
hold off the Dolphins and Bills to repeat as AFC Champions this
year. They can make their first Super Bowl appearance since
You-Know-Who's guarantee with a break or two.
</P>
<P>
   The key, of course, is Testaverde. He won the job from Glenn
Foley in Week 3 last year and finished with 29 touchdowns, seven
interceptions and a career best 101.6 passer rating. He didn't show
much rust last night. He led the Jets on an 87-yard drive that
ended with a field goal, and a 66-yard drive that concluded with
his 19-yard touchdown pass to newly acquired free agent tight end
Eric Green. Testaverde left the game after completing 11 of 13
passes for 147 yards _ including the touchdown pass _ and
committing no turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From every Italian in New Jersey last year it was, `What you
get him for,'?'' Parcells said. ``Now, it's, `My man Vinny. That's
my man.' Yes, there is pressure on him this year. There is plenty
of pressure on him after what he did last year. But he's more
relaxed from the standpoint of knowing the system and the people
coaching him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets did not just stand pat after last year's breakthrough
season. Despite a talent base that already includes Testaverde,
running back Curtis Martin and wide receivers Keyshawn Johnson and
Wayne Chrebet, Parcells, who doubles as the club's general manager,
signed veteran free safety Steve Atwater, linebacker Roman Phifer,
and Green in the off-season. All will start in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The club's only question mark, albeit a pretty big one, is in
the offensive line. Starting guards Matt O'Dwyer and Todd Burger
were not resigned. The starter on the right side is expected to be
rookie Randy Thomas. Three players are competing for the starting
position on the left _ second-year player Kerry Jenkins, who was a
backup tackle in 1998, rookie David Loverne, and rookie Ian
Beckles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a litany of things I'm concerned about,'' Parcells
poor-mouths. ``Now you can just slough them off as, `That's just
Bill.' But those problems, and how we do with them will probably
determine how far we go this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It says here they'll go pretty far. nn

BUSH TRIUMPHS IN IOWA STRAW POLL; FORBES FINISHES SECOND IN
NONBINDING VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with results)   (Eds., this story is now on NYT Page 1, top center; the Kosovo
story moves inside)  
 (HLW)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMES, Iowa _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas triumphed Saturday
night in a straw poll here of nearly 25,000 Iowans, a nonbinding
but high-profile test of the Republican Party's presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher, placed second,
establishing himself as a force that Bush will have to reckon with
as the primary season unfolds. Elizabeth Dole ranked third,
quieting, at least for now, critics who said her campaign was
flagging after a fast start.
</P>
<P>
   In the competition for support from religious conservatives,
Gary Bauer, a former head of the Family Research Council, placed
fourth, ahead of Pat Buchanan, the conservative television
commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who has made Iowa
practically a second home, came in sixth. And there was even more
dismal news for former Vice President Dan Quayle, who ranked eighth
behind Alan Keyes, a radio talk show host. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
finished ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes poured the most money into the straw poll, followed by
Bush, and had been expected to place second. But the results
underscored that the Forbes operation is deft at turning its deep
resources into organizational prowess.
</P>
<P>
   The event at Iowa State University was devised as a money-making
operation by Iowa Republicans, and the straw poll victor has never
ended up in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice that critics say is meaningless because it verges
on outright vote-buying, the campaigns bused Iowans here, fed them,
entertained them and then paid their $25 entry fee. The hope was
that, in return, the sated participants would cast a vote for the
candidate who treated them best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the way to pick a president?'' asked former Rep. Bill
Zeliff of New Hampshire as he stood between a clown on stilts and
an inflatable playground, courtesy of Steve Forbes' campaign. ``If
it is, we're in bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Zeliff's candidate _ he is a national chairman for
Alexander _ eagerly took part. Alexander's enticement for voters:
the singer Crystal Gayle.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that in the 2000 campaign, this, indeed, may be a
way to pick a nominee. Because the campaign has started so soon,
with many states moving up the dates of their primaries, the straw
poll here could winnow the field. And because Bush has so dominated
the polls and amassed so much cash, some campaigns said that Ames
might be their last stand.
</P>
<P>
   As indoor fireworks illuminated the stage of a darkened arena
here, the announcer proclaimed: ``On this stage is the next
president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Neglecting those who questioned the fairness of the event, Bush
told the crowd, ``I am proud to be here for this grass-roots
exercise in democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first event in which nine candidates (except Sen.
John McCain of Arizona, who called it ``a scam'') took part. As
people waited in long lines to vote, each contender was allowed 10
minutes to make his or her pitch and three minutes for a
demonstration of support from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the revelry on this bright and festive afternoon,
campaigns were partaking in high-stakes politics. Campaign workers
scurried about in golf carts with walkie-talkies and cell phones,
sizing up the lines at their rivals' tents.
</P>
<P>
   The event was an organizational test to see which campaigns
could convince the most people to travel far and wide to this event
_ and then take the next step to support their candidate. Any Iowa
resident of voting age could participate, a change in the rules
that gave this event more credibility than the event four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, candidates turned this grass-roots exercise into the
campaign equivalent of a Berlin airlift, flying in supporters from
around the country. To prevent the rampant cheating that marked
that event, voters Saturday had their thumbs stamped with indelible
red ink.
</P>
<P>
   This spectacle was by far the most extravagant ever, and it drew
thousands more people than four years ago, when then-Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas and Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas tied for first place.
Republicans sometimes call themselves the party of the Big Tent
and, certainly, the scene was a sea of big and small tents. The
campaigns engaged in a bidding war to rent parcels of grass and
pavement in the parking lot around the Hilton Coliseum, with the
Bush campaign paying the most _ $43,500.
</P>
<P>
   If sheer resources were any guide to who would triumph, Forbes
would have won hands down. No one could stop talking about his
colossal, air-conditioned tent (with French doors).
</P>
<P>
   Marveling, perhaps, at the competition, Benjamin Ginsberg, the
Bush campaign's legal counsel, called it ``Chateau Malcolm,'' a
reference to Forbes' given name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people coming here to get cooled off _ in the
Bush tent they come off a little stodgy,'' said Greg Mueller, a
spokesman for Forbes. ``And we have the only kids' stuff _ Forbes
family values.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the pivotal Iowa caucuses nearly six months from
now, when people will actually vote in a binding contest, William
Dal Col, the Forbes' campaign manager, said, ``This is all a down
payment for a cold night in February.''
</P>
<P>
   One Forbes supporter who was cooling off was Joanne Pohlman, 62,
a retired schoolteacher from Webster City, Iowa. ``It's like a
carnival,'' she said, clutching a Forbes gift bag. ``But it's fun.
Great sport. Why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Max Eckstein, 22, a college student from Boone, Iowa, who was
surveying the band in a Bush tent, said the governor and other
candidates ``must be kicking themselves'' for not air-conditioning
their tents. But, he said, that would not in itself sway him to
back Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do food and entertainment make a difference?'' Eckstein asked.
``Maybe for the common person.''
</P>
<P>
   Some party-goers, while not shy about sampling the food and
accepting the free rides on hot air balloons, denounced the
extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes is trying to appeal to the side of us that says, `OK,
we can play so he must be good,''' said Tanya Bignell, a data-entry
worker from Bettendorf, Iowa, who was backing Hatch. ``I don't
think so,'' Ms. Bignell said as she picked over a modest spread of
chicken and baked beans in the Hatch tent.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns that spent the most were worried that some people
they transported here would use their tickets to vote for another
candidate. So before people could get their tickets from the Forbes
organization, they had to sign a pledge that said, ``I, the
undersigned, pledge to support Steve Forbes.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Jim Moore and his wife, Greta, farmers from Thornburg, Iowa,
peered into the Hatch tent, where Vic Damone was crooning, but said
they were backing Bush anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes' is probably the best,'' Moore, 69, said of the
entertainment. ``He had Debby Boone in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moore, 68, added, ``It was packed, I'll tell you.'' She was
not put off by the heavy spending, saying, ``That's their business.
You spend your money where you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Endicott, 34, an English teacher who lives near here,
said he was a Democrat but voted for Elizabeth Dole, hoping that
she would deprive Bush of votes, and soften him up for the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get her more points against Bush to keep her in the
race,'' Endicott said. He said he was ``turned off'' by some of the
fancy tents, even by the decor of the low-budget operation of
former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quayle's corn cobs and hay stacks,'' he said. ``It's just too
hick.''

CLINTONS TO GO HOUSE HUNTING IN NEW YORK'S WESTCHESTER COUNTY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a sign that President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton are close to reaching a decision on where to live after
they leave the White House, the first couple planned to visit
Westchester County on Sunday to inspect houses to buy, some
associates of the Clintons said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a race for the U.S.
Senate, has been doing the house hunting for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton will, for the first time, join his wife on the
search means that they are close to making a decision about a home
purchase, the associates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are expected to fly into Westchester County Airport
and look at homes only in Westchester. On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton
inspected a seven-bedroom, turn-of-the-century Colonial house in
Greenburgh, priced around $1.7 million. The house, in the town's
Edgemont section, is next to Scarsdale, one of the county's most
affluent communities.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of the Clintons would not say Saturday night what
other houses might be on their real-estate tour.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has come under increasing pressure by Democrats to
settle on a place to live in preparation for a race for the Senate
in New York, where she has not lived before. The first lady has
said that she and her husband would live in New York regardless of
whether she ran for the Senate.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; KAATERSKILL FALLS &LR;  By Allegra Goodman. Delta, $12.95. This
panoramic first novel explores the small excitements and larger,
religious rhythms of life in a cloistered Orthodox Jewish community
in the 1970s. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Daphne
Merkin said the author ``has an almost 19th-century ability to
create a sense of linkage, of one existence impinging on the
next.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGENDS OF THE AMERICAN DESERT: SOJOURNS IN THE GREATER
SOUTHWEST &LR;  By Alex Shoumatoff. Harper Perennial, $15. This
ferociously omnivorous narrative is as sprawling and unruly as its
terrain, the swath of land stretching from Mexico City to southern
Colorado and the Texas panhandle. ``Shoumatoff is a wily and
attentive guide'' to the region and its history, folklore and
amazing variety of cultures, Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote in The New
York Times Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW THE CANYON BECAME GRAND: A SHORT HISTORY &LR; , by Stephen J.
Pyne (Penguin, $12.95), shows how human attitudes toward the Grand
Canyon have changed over time, from indifference among Spanish
explorers in 1540 to wonder among today's visitors. Last year the
reviewer Timothy Egan called this an ``energetic paean'' to ``the
canyon's glories and the people who have tried to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUITE A YEAR FOR PLUMS &LR;  By Bailey White. Vintage, $12. In this
sweet-natured first novel, a plant pathologist falls for an ascetic
wildlife artist who shows up in his small Georgia town and sets the
locals abuzz. ``On one level'' the book ``is about chickens and
peanut cultivars and pine straw fires; on another, it's about art
and impermanence and freedom,'' Tom Drury wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STEPHEN SONDHEIM: A LIFE &LR;  By Meryle Secrest. Delta, $14.95. The
author puts her subject on the psychoanalyst's couch in this
portrait of the brilliant but insecure composer who brought
bleakness and maturity to the habitually sunny Broadway musical.
The result is an ``admirable biography'' by ``a tireless researcher
and marathon interviewer,'' Benedict Nightingale wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LONDON HOLIDAY &LR;  By Richard Peck. Penguin, $12.95. Three
American women _ a society wife, an interior designer and a
schoolteacher _ travel to London to renew their friendship and
unpack their emotional baggage at Mrs. Smith-Porter's charming
bed-and-breakfast. ``It's difficult not to lapse into Anglophile
burbles when describing this tidy little novel,'' Kimberly B.
Marlowe wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AMERICAN CENTURY: THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE UNITED STATES
AS A WORLD POWER &LR;  By Donald W. White. Yale University, $18. In a
cultural and intellectual tour of the American psyche, the author
argues that failure at home and abroad turned the self-confident
superpower of the early 1960s into a purposeless behemoth. ``This
is a first-rate work, a kind of inner history of the Cold War,''
Fareed Zakaria wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HALF-LIFE OF HAPPINESS &LR;  By John Casey. Vintage
Contemporaries, $14. This novel's sharp-eyed narrator looks back on
her parents' bohemian marriage in 1970s Charlottesville, Va., and
how it came apart after her mother fell in love with another woman.
``Casey is marvelous at conjuring up the excitement of a campaign
meeting or a boxing match or the repartee of a domestic row,''
Lorna Sage wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SAME EMBRACE &LR;  By Michael Lowenthal. Plume, $12.95.
Identical twin brothers find their relationship threatened when one
becomes a gay activist and the other embraces Orthodox Judaism.
This first novel ``is an eloquent exploration of the nature of
faith, the consequences of judgment and the stubborn endurance of
family ties,'' Linda Barrett Osborne wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEN AND WHALES &LR;  By Richard Ellis. Lyons, $30. This handsomely
illustrated volume tracks the complex relationship between humans
and the earth's largest living creatures, from classical and
biblical references to the 1982 worldwide ban on commercial
whaling. ``His achievement is impressive and considerable,'' Robert
Finch wrote in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SHIPWRECK OF THE WHALESHIP
ESSEX &LR; , by Owen Chase ($12.95), a vivid firsthand narrative of the
sinking of the vessel by a sperm whale in 1821, leaving the
survivors adrift in lifeboats in the South Seas for three months.
This edition also includes shorter accounts by the ship's captain
and a crew member, as well as notes by Herman Melville, who found
in Chase's book an inspiration for ``Moby Dick.'' ``The reading of
this wondrous story ... had a surprising effect on me,'' Melville
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A FLOATING LIFE: THE ADVENTURES OF LI PO &LR;  By Simon Elegant.
Ecco, $16. Based on fact and legend, this fictional memoir portrays
the great Tang dynasty poet Li Po (A.D. 700-762) as an inspired
roisterer, fond of wine and tall tales. ``The novel succeeds in
summoning up the man and his age in ways that are both deliciously
foreign and all too familiar,'' Philip Gambone wrote last year.

MATADORS DETERMINED TO PUSH ON

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There they were Saturday: Marcus Brady, Jaumal
Bradley, Aaron Arnold, Brennen Swanson and Chazz Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The doubts have been erased. The core of players who led the Cal
State Northridge football team to second place in the Big Sky
Conference last season all reported to the first full-squad
practice in preparation for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment of losing head coach Ron Ponciano and
offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie was nowhere to be seen when the
Matadors worked out for about 90 minutes in the afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the practice was ragged, but the players were vocal and
already itching for full-contact drills, which won't start until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of focus and optimism can be traced to several
players-only meetings in the last month. Bradley, a senior fullback
who was a first-team All-Big Sky selection last season, helped
organize the meetings in the aftermath of Ponciano's firing in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the talks we had were so energetic,'' said Bradley,
who was voted a team captain. ``There was a lot of emotion and a
lot of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   The first meeting, Bradley said, was the toughest. A few key
players, including Aarnold and Marcus Brady, had talked openly
about transferring in the weeks leading up to Ponciano's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled everybody to the table and asked them (where they
stood),'' Bradley said. ``It was a serious, emotionally draining
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Brignac, a freshman running back from Taft High and one
of CSUN's top recruits, said he was ``skeptical'' about coming to
CSUN after Ponciano was fired. But he was turned around after
meeting players such as Bradley, Swanson _ a senior linebacker who
had 15{ sacks last year _ and Sean Beard, the starting noseguard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have something to prove,'' Brignac said. ``I'm getting
back into the flow of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady, who was the Big Sky's Newcomer of the Year in '98 as the
Matadors' starting quarterback, had fleeting thoughts of
transferring during the tumultuous week when it appeared Ponciano
wasn't going to return. But he pledged his support to the program
and reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My home is here,'' said Brady, a sophomore. ``This is where I
wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Tackled by academics: Mel Miller, a senior who was scheduled
to start at cornerback, is academically ineligible and won't play
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Ashabraner, a 320-pound redshirt freshman offensive
lineman, didn't report Friday and head coach Jeff Kearin assumes
Ashabraner quit the team.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN lost two newcomers Thursday night when Cameron Stewart and
Jeff Connick also quit after participating in just two practices.
Both players were junior linebackers who played at Hancock College
last year.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hanging in there: The plan to build a new 1,500-seat softball
stadium at CSUN, which stalled last fall, isn't dead. In fact,
private donations to build the ``Field of Dreams'' complex have
reached the $750,000 mark, head softball coach Janet Sherman said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still alive,'' Sherman said, adding she hopes for
groundbreaking in June 2000. ``It got a little exorbitant and we
scaled it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium's approximate cost is $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting tool: The focus of this fall's student referendum
for a fee increase for new athletic facilities has been the $8
million stadium built primarily for football.
</P>
<P>
   But the men's and women's soccer teams will play in the stadium,
too, if the fee increase passes and the stadium is built. Allison
Lee, who is entering her first season as the Matadors' women's
soccer coach, said the facility would be the best in the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we are now isn't that bad,'' Lee said, referring to
North Campus Stadium. ``(But) we're excited to have a new place to
play. We (also) need a women's locker room.''
