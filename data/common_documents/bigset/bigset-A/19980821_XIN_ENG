<HEADLINE> Jetlag Linked to Breast Cancer in Air Hostesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The higher rate of breast cancer
in air hostesses may be due to jetlag, an American scientist said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The link between air hostesses and breast cancer was revealed
three years ago when a Finnish study found that air hostesses in
Finland were almost twice likely to get breast cancer than women
in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
Several explanations have been put forward, including exposure
to radiation at high altitude.
</P>
<P>
But Dr Anthony Mawson from North Carolina, USA, suggested that
jetlag, by suppressing levels of the hormone melatonin, may be to
blame.
</P>
<P>
"Flight attendants with breast cancer should have more
work-associated exposure to jetlag, and lower melatonin than those
without breast cancer." Dr Mawson said in a letter to the Lancet
medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland in the middle of the
brain, is associated with the body's sleep-wake cycle. When this
cycle is disturbed, as it can be severely with jetlag, less
melatonin is produced.
</P>
<P>
Experiments have shown that the growth of breast-cancer cells
is slowed by melatonin, and there is other evidence that melatonin
may be involved when normal tissue in the breast becomes
cancerous, through melatonin's influence on sex hormones.

<HEADLINE> Taking Care of Displaced Flood Victims Requires Massive Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.1 million people in Anhui,
Hunan and Jilin provinces have fled their homes to seek safety
from some of the worst flooding in China's history. But all of
them have found a place to live, food to eat and clothing to wear
thanks to endeavors of the central and local governments,
according to a source at the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui Province, one of the flood-hit areas, has
evacuated 822,000 people from flooded areas, a provincial official
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the flood victims, who used to live in
islets and areas which are in floodwater, sought refuge with
relatives in both urban and rural areas. Others are living in
temporary shelters where they are provided with food and clean
water, the official said. Medical workers make regular visits to
their tents and 9 million yuan in medicine has been distributed,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has set up 2,700 tents and 21,000
shelters, and has converted 13,000 buildings used for other
purposes to house flood victims, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Cai Qihua, head of the provincial water conservation
department, said his province had spent 300 million yuan on
fortifying Yangtze River dikes and building 20 reservoirs. These
projects have helped reduce flood losses by 40.7 billion yuan this
year.
</P>
<P>
Floods have driven 1 million people out of their homes in 40
flooded counties and cities in central China's Hunan Province over
the past month, according to a provincial official.
</P>
<P>
At present, half the flood victims live in 180,000 tents or
temporary shelters, 200,000 live in houses made available by
government institutions and schools, and 300,000 are living with
relatives, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The provincial financial department has allocated 200 million
yuan of relief funds, 15 million kilograms of grain and 1.1
million articles of clothing to flood-affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in northeast China's Jilin Province, the government
of Baicheng city has earmarked 2 million yuan to build houses for
280,000 evacuees and spent another 1 million yuan to provide food,
a city official said.
</P>
<P>
The central and provincial governments have also reportedly
shipped 5 million tents, food and medicine to Baicheng.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada on Friday urged the private sector to help the government
generate jobs and ease poverty which would lift his pro-poor
campaign pledge from the level of rhetoric to concrete action.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on poverty alleviation, Estrada voiced confidence
that he can lead the nation out of the economic storm as long as
there are more people willing to work than just talk.
</P>
<P>
Estrada underscored the urgent need for the government and the
private sector to join forces in creating jobs in urban centers
and the countryside, in agriculture and industries, as a vital
component of his administration's policy to give the poor
opportunities to be self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration has begun sorting out 86 loan
programs and opening wider the credit windows of all government
financial institutions for small enterprises in order to create
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has been a pernicious opponent, he said, noting that
effort by previous governments to fight it has failed to stop more
people from being driven into the poor house.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, the Philippines,
with a population of some 70 million, has a poverty incidence of
34 percent. Poverty alleviation has been listed as a top priority
for the Estrada administration.

OTTAWA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Revenue Minister Herb Dhaliwal
announced Thursday that Canadian residents will be required to
report foreign assets of more than 100,000 dollars (66,000
U.S. dollars) for 1998 tax returns by April 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa originally put that requirement in place in its 1995
budget, effective with returns filed this April for the 1997 tax
year.
</P>
<P>
However, faced with strong opposition from some Canadians,
especially those in the Asian community, Ottawa postponed the
requirement for one year.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision is said to be a compromise between the
revenue department's desire to combat tax havens and the concern
over privacy of some taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Dhaliwal said there will be "streamlined procedures" for
verifying foreign-based income earned by Canadian residents.
</P>
<P>
The government has also changed "foreign asset reporting" to
"foreign income verification."
</P>
<P>
Under the new reporting method, taxpayers need only indicate
the range and location of investments for different categories of
assets by checking a box on a reporting form.
</P>
<P>
The department has dropped the requirement to provide detailed
descriptions for each investment.
</P>
<P>
The new measures, which include a five percent penalty based on
the costs of assets, will be reviewed after two years, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S. Air Strike on Sudan, Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday expressed "serious worries" over U.S. air strikes on Sudan
and Afghanistan, while the State Duma, or lower house of
parliament, condemned the move as an aggression.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin, who was observing a naval exercise of
the Northern Fleet in the Barents Sea at the time, also expressed
indignation over the U.S. military action, said presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
However, Moscow's "joint work with the United States in the
struggle against terrorism, and the special services of the two
countries will continue," the Itar-Tass news agency quoted
Yastrzhembsky as saying.
</P>
<P>
Several people were killed and about 300 are still missing
following the destruction of a pharmaceutical factory near
Khartoum, capital of Sudan, by U.S. missiles on Thursday, Governor
Majzoub Khalifa of the Sudanese province of Khartoum said.
</P>
<P>
Initial reports said 15 people died in the bombing at a
training camp of Islamists near the Afghan city of Host on the
border with Pakistan, 165 kilometers south of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry, in its statement, said the
bombings would "not bring the eradication of terrorism any closer,
but may create a dangerous precedent of resolving international
disputes in this way, thus undermining the legal framework of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, while it does not address the essence of the
problem, such action can trigger a chain reaction whose
consequences cannot be predicted," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"A solid barrier to terrorism should be erected through
increased bilateral and multilateral interaction of countries,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia resolutely condemned the recent acts of terrorism
against the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin condemned them as a brazen challenge to
the entire international community," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, in a special statement, said the U.S. air
strikes on two sovereign countries "were largely due to the recent
developments in the United States," a veiled reference to the sex
scandal involving U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It also called on President Yeltsin to work out measures to
help avert a similar use of force in the future and reconsider the
advisability of Clinton's visit to Moscow scheduled for
September.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Regrets US Air Strikes in Afghanistan, Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Friday expressed
its disappointment over the air strikes launched by the United
States in Afghanistan and Sudan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are upset because the attack is said to have been allowed
by the U.N., but we don't know that the U.N. had given its
permission," Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told a news
conference in Kangar, according to Malaysia's national news agency
Bernama.
</P>
<P>
"How do we know if they (The U.S.) won't attack us later. They
will say it's self-defense too," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on the air strikes which the U.S. said were
aimed at terrorist bases in Afghanistan and Sudan believed to have
been behind the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania early this month, and on Washington's reported claim that
it was exercising its legal right to defend itself as provided for
by the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"Who is the one who decides? If I can decide where I want to
attack, the world will be in chaos. If it's a big power, it can
attack anyone. It decides and it executes, making small countries
feel it's dangerous to live in this world. We (small countries) do
not dare to say anything. If we do we may be attacked," Mahathir
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described the U.S. action as passing sentence and
enforcing it.

<HEADLINE> Ten Cambodian Parties Reject Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ten Cambodian opposition
parties said Friday they have decided to reject the results of the
July 26 election because of alleged voting irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Main opposition parties, namely Funcinpec, Sam Rainsy Party,
and Son Sann Party joined the move with seven small political
parties, such as the Cambodian National Sustaining Party led by
Pen Sovann.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the parties said in a joint statement that they
were committed to uniting all free democratic forces and did not
recognize the election results.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have called for a protest march on
Sunday, demanding a solution to their charges of election
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
But the call was rejected by the Interior Ministry, saying that
most police have the day off and security cannot be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties alleged electoral fraud by the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP)-- which is led by government leader Hun Sen
who won the election -- and threatened to boycott the new
assembly, the parliament, which is to convene on September 24.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results from the National Election Committee
show the ruling CPP won more than 41 percent of the valid votes
cast, followed by the Funcinpec with 32 percent and the Sam Rainsy
Party.
</P>
<P>
The 10 parties are collectively credited with 50.33 percent of
the votes, said the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first official entry
into electronic commerce has been highly successful and the nation
enjoys a promising future related activities.
</P>
<P>
The government website for commodities has recorded over 10
million hits since its opening in July.
</P>
<P>
The Internet website -- http://www.chinamarket.com.cn --
established by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), was officiated on July 8 and has since
blossomed into a major link providing information on commodities
carrying the label "Made in China".
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC's China International Electronic Commerce Center (CIECC)
administrator the website, which has attracted millions of hits
from people in more than 80 countries and regions, including a
record 470,000 hits in a single day.
</P>
<P>
Experts point to the fact that the highly successful beginning
reflects the promising future for using advanced information
technology to expand foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Some 82.7 percent of the total hits to the website originated
from abroad, with domestic hits accounting 17.3 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of inquiries centered on textile, electronic
and hardware commodities.
</P>
<P>
Virtually, unknown companies, including a dyestuff company, an
electromagnetic products manufacturer and a company producing
clothing for babies received the most attention.
</P>
<P>
Small to medium-sized enterprises accounted for a majority of
the 2,000 ventures linked to the website.
</P>
<P>
A recent CIECC survey of 100 businesses linked to the website
found that 72 percent of the ventures received clear feedbacks.
</P>
<P>
One Hangzhou trade company listed 14 textile commodities in
July and has since received 10-odd favorable inquiries from Japan,
the Republic of Korea (ROK), Australia, the United States and
Canada. The company manager expressed great satisfication with the
response and noted that additional products will offered via the
web market.

JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia said Friday it feels
"deep concern" about the implications of the bomb blasts at
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania but disapproves of any
intervention in and aggression against sovereign countries to
fight terrorism.

In retaliation for the explosions of the U.S. embassies in

"In this connection, Indonesia wants to stress that it condemns
terrorism in any form," the Indonesian Foreign ministry said in a

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Flood Situation Remains Rigorous in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation has not yet
eased in China, with the sixth flood crest on the Yangtze River
and the third one on the Songhua River moving downstream while new
floodwaters are possible on the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin's scheduled visits to Russia and Japan in
early September have been postponed because of the immensity of
the flood-control and disaster-relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Major floods may hit the Yangtze again this weekend as
torrential rains have, since Wednesday, deluged seven prefectures
and cities in the northwestern areas of the Sichuan Basin, which
is located on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, according to
the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters (SFCDRH).
</P>
<P>
The sixth flood crest of the Yangtze passed Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province, at about 11 p.m. Thursday with a
water level of 29.43 meters.
</P>
<P>
The figure dropped slightly to 29.36 m at 2 p.m. today. SFCDRH
authorities say that the drop of water level was so insignificant
that flood-fighting will remain difficult.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, the third flood crest on the
Songhua river today passed Harbin, the largest heavy industrial
center in northeast China, at an all-time-high water level of
120.82 meters.
</P>
<P>
This level, accompanied by a flow rate of 17,400 cubic meters
per second, is 2.72 meters higher than the danger mark, and 0.77
meters higher than the 1957 record.
</P>
<P>
The swollen Nenjiang River has inundated 1,443 oil wells in
Daqing, China's largest oil field, and production by 282 wells has
been suspended for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 soldiers and civilians are now working on the
flood-fighting front lines to protect the nine million residents
of Harbin. Banners bearing slogans such as "Defend levees to the
death" and "Protecting Harbin requires a life or death struggle"
are hanging from trees near the levees.
</P>
<P>
While millions of people are countering the flooding on these
rivers, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the provinces of
Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan along the Yellow River, have also been
busy repairing facilities to prepare for possible flooding.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Hu Jintao has called on Party organizations at
various levels and Party members to play a backbone role in the
disaster-relief effort.

<P>
The SFCDRH is sending more materials to flood-ravaged areas
along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze, the Nenjiang
and the Songhua rivers. By Wednesday, the headquarters had sent
200 million yuan worth of goods to the areas.
</P>
<P>
Domestic and foreign donations sent to the Ministry of Civil
Affairs and its sub-departments across the country have surpassed
1.06 billion yuan (130 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A large benefit performance for China's flood victims,
organized by the ministries of Culture and Civil Affairs, was held
at the Great Hall of the People this evening. The show included
performances by nearly 1,000 Chinese singers, dancers and movie
stars, including artists from Hong Kong, Taiwan and some foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
A similar event held Thursday by Beijing Television Station
reported the collection of 170 million yuan (20.48 million
U.S. dollars), which will be sent to the flooded areas as relief
funds.
</P>
<P>
A telephone survey in Beijing found that more than 88 percent
of the city's citizens have donated money or goods for flood-hit
parts of China and the rest say they want to make a donation.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents were sweating in oppressive heat, but still
doing their best to provide relief goods for flood-ravaged parts
of China. At least 160 trains carrying relief goods and more than
4,000 people have left Shanghai for flood areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Civil Affairs has pledged that every penny of
the funds raised will be used for the country's flood victims,
whose total number exceeds 240 million.
</P>
<P>
In a circular made public Thursday, the ministry told people to
give money and goods to local civil affairs or other departments
that are approved for receiving donations.
</P>
<P>
President and Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin made a phone
call on Thursday evening to Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang
inquiring about the spread and treatment of epidemic diseases in
the flood-hit areas, urging the ministry to do a good job of
treating and controlling diseases in the disastrous areas.
</P>
<P>
An official from the ministry has appealed to the public for
more potable water and water-purifying machines to be sent to the
flooded areas.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Friday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Dozens of American cruise missiles struck targets in
Afghanistan and the Sudan Thursday in what President Clinton
described as an act of self-defense against imminent terrorist
plots and of retribution for the bombings of American embassies in
East Africa two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
-- The most cherished axiom of American foreign policy is that
politics stops at the water's edge, meaning that political
opponents support the President when missiles are flying. Today it
mostly worked, but the challenge of President Clinton's latest
crisis crystallized when some critics uncharacteristically cried
foul.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Monica S. Lewinsky returned to the grand jury for the final
time Thursday to amplify her account of an extramarital affair
with President Clinton as new details emerged about his testimony
earlier this week and their conflicting versions of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
-- Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born Islamic militant whose
terrorist network was the target of U.S. missile strikes in
central Afghanistan, has spent the the past 15 months living about
200 miles south of the site of the attacks, using as his base a
fortified and heavily guarded hilltop compound outside the city of
Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Continued sanctions against Iraq were backed by the U.N.
Security Council after its regular 60-day review. The council
called Baghdad's suspension of cooperation with arms inspectors
"totally unacceptable," but the U.S. failed in a bid to threaten
Iraq with "severest consequences" in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
-- Germany's Social Democrats said tax reform and efforts to
ease unemployment would be their main goals if they defeat
Chancellor Kohl and his Christian Democrats September 27. Gerhard
Schroeder announced the platform as polls show some erosion of his
lead.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebel Group Renews Mass Indoctrination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' leftist rebel
group, the New People's Army (NPA), has renewed its massive
indoctrination in the countryside to regain some foothold in their
mass base organization, the military said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nestor Castillo, commanding general of the Public Affairs
Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, said that this is
part of a strategy ordered by exiled Jose Ma. Sison, chairman of
the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), to increase their
mass base support.
</P>
<P>
The NPA, the arm wing of the CPP-led National Democratic Front
(NDF), has suffered a big drop in number since 1986 after the
military successfully launched its counter-insurgency operation.
</P>
<P>
From a high of 26,800 in 1986, the NPA strength went down to
about 6,000 at present, Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
Castillo said Sison, who has been living in exile in the
Netherlands since March 1986, used the Internet last year to call
on the CPP and the NDF to increase their mass base indoctrination.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of their new strategy to recruit new members to
join the NPA as the peace talks between the government and the
communists resume next month," Castillo said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there is a slight increase in NPA-initiated
attacks in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
According to Castillo, the military clashed with a 70-man NPA
team for two hours in a remote village in North Cotabato province
on August 15.

<HEADLINE> China's Flooded Areas face Threat of Infectious Diseases (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua)-- The epidemic control situation in
China's flood-stricken areas is stable but infectious diseases
such as snail fever are threatening.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang while
addressing an emergency national conference on epidemic prevention
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
All major infectious diseases are now under control in the
flooded areas, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangsu and
Jilin provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which
have suffered most from the floods, the average incidence of
epidemic diseases has even dropped slightly from last year, he
added.
</P>
<P>
But the health minister conceded that the incidence of
intestinal epidemic diseases has increased, with over 1,500 cases
of such diseases reported from the above-mentioned provinces and
region.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of dysentery, hepatitis and colds are also
slightly up compared with the same period last year, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry is also greatly concerned about the health
of the people fighting the floods in areas with a relatively
high incidence of snail fever.

<HEADLINE> Flooded Areas Face Threat of Infectious Diseases (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 400 cases of snail fever infection have to date been
reported to the ministry from those areas. But experts have
expected more cases in the near future since snail fever has a
fairly long latent period of 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that the major problem for epidemic control in the
flood-stricken areas is a shortage of funds and medicines, adding
that the problem could become worse in the next three months,
usually the peak period for the spread of epidemics in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, a large proportion of the office buildings
and equipment of the medical institutions in the flooded areas
has been lost in the flooding.
</P>
<P>
In late July, the Ministry of Health allocated 10 million yuan
(about 1.2 million U.S. dollars) to 18 provinces and autonomous
regions afflicted by natural disasters, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, epidemic control efforts in the eight provinces and
autonomous regions most severely hit by the summer flooding have
already cost local governments and medical institutions some
62 million yuan (about 7.5 million U.S. dollars) as well as medical
supplies worth over 250 million yuan (about 30 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the ministry has persuaded the municipalities
of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi,
Zhejiang, Shandong and Guangdong to take immediate action to
provide medical assistance for the flooded regions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tells Jordan: Air Raids Target Terrorists, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
explained to Crown Prince Hassan, the Regent that the U.S. air
raids in Afghanistan and Sudan just targeted the terrorists, not
the Arabs and Muslims living there.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to Hassan late Thursday night and carried
by Jordan's official Petra news agency Friday, Clinton rejected as
baseless the saying that the raids were targeted against Arabs and
Muslims in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The air raids were carried out upon a number of sites in
Afghanistan and the Sudan alleged by Washington as terrorist bases
or facilities, causing dozens of casualties. The attacks triggered
a wave of protest in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move came as a retaliation for the bombings of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian Royal Court and the government have not responded
to the letter as well as the air raids yet.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Jordan is the U.S. third para-allied country in
the Middle East after Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. economic and military aid for Jordan reached 225
million U.S. dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Military Doctors Activated to Aid Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A team of 13 military doctors have
been activated to provide medical service for victims in the
flooding-ravaged area of east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The medical officers, from the Electronic Engineering College
of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), have been working for five
days in Wangjiang County at the upper reaches of the Yuanjiang
River which experienced the worst flooding this decade.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, they rowed a small boat to Pohu Village, ten km from
their base, and began operating a clinic to treat villagers.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Shengtao, a 70-year old farmer, said he had been
suffering from a serious cough for several days and had lacked
medicine and treatment.
</P>
<P>
A doctor told Cheng that his cold was the result of spending so
much time in the flood waters. After giving some medicine to the
old farmer, the doctor urged him to take it on time, drink more
water, and to keep warm while sleeping at night.
</P>
<P>
"I have experienced several flooding disasters in my lifetime,
this is the best service to the victims," Cheng said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with their work in hospitals, the doctors had a
difficult time in the poor village where they treated some
300 patients just in one morning.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollars Stumbles to Two-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar stumbled
to its lowest close against the U.S. dollar in over two months
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The domestic unit was sold off as Russia's economic problems
reached a crisis point and Asian currencies remained soft, Bank of
America foreign exchange dealer Andrew Le said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed the session at 58.75 U.S. cents,
down from 59.13 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the concern was now the unit would slide toward
58 cents, a level where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) jumped
into the market to defend the currency in June.
</P>
<P>
In its quarterly statement on the economy released earlier this
week, the RBA acknowledged it had bought 2.6 billion of the
domestic currency (about 1.56 billion U.S. dollars) in June.
</P>
<P>
The central bank blamed a belief by market participants that
Australian authorities were happy to see the local currency
continue to fall and an increased hedge funds' profile in the
market for June's slide.
</P>
<P>
In a break from its recent strong correlation with the Japanese
yen, the Australian dollar found itself sold heavily not only
against the U.S. dollar but the yen itself in the latter part of
the week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar slid lower to 83.93 yen, down from 84.52
previously, while against the German mark, the Australian dollar
was at 1.0564 marks from 1.0600.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- PICC Property, China's largest
property insurer, wrote an 8-billion-yuan (966 million US dollars)
policy on the Pudong International Airport, covering all risks
that might occur during construction of the first phase of the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport is
one of the largest infrastructures to be built during the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's sales/production ratio
of industrial products reached 96.29 percent in July, up 1.39
percent over the January-June period, the State Statistics Bureau
announced today.
</P>
<P>
A bureau official attributed the growth to an upturn in
China's consumer market and the efforts made by firms to
restrict their production.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that the country's industrial growth rate
will be higher in the second half of this year as the
government's policies to stimulate the economy gradually take
effect.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and
Sichuan Province are positioned at the two ends of the list in
this regard. Following a 100-percent sales/production ratio in
June, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region registered the same high ratio in July. Others
topping the list include Hainan Province and Chongqing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
In July, the country's industrial growth rate stood at 7.6
percent, 0.3 percentage points lower than in June.

<HEADLINE> People, Birds Lose Homes In Dongting Lake Area (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Standing on the dike, Zhang
Houyi, nearly 50 and a farmer in central China's Hunan Province,
can see neither his house, submerged by flood waters, nor the
summer migratory birds that used to fly through the sky like
clouds.
</P>
<P>
Serious floods inundated villages in the Dongting Lake area at
the middle reaches of the raging Yangtze River about a month ago,
and less than half of the summer migratory birds have come here
this year.
</P>
<P>
"Where are those birds, and where is the crane family which
spent 11 winters in my yard?" Zhang murmured.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Zhang found the family of three cranes beside a pool
in front of his house. Zhang, the best hunter in the area and
someone who has bagged more than 100 wild ducks, didn't aim at the
cranes because he was touched by these beautiful birds which came
from the Ganges River valley in India where their habitats were
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
He approached them carefully, offering them food and shelter.
The crane family gave birth to a new member each year for 11
years thereafter, and became friends of the Zhang family.
</P>
<P>
Zhang became a voluntary bird protector in 1984, after the East
Dongting Lake Nature Reserve was established. Since then, the
number of birds in the area had increased from about 4 million to
more than 10 million.
</P>
<P>
But with about one third of the 4,000-square-kilometer lake
developed into farmland, and an increasing number of factories
built around the lake, Zhang saw floods ravage his homeland more
frequently and more severely in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, I realized that human activities should be
held responsible for the natural disasters," he said.

<HEADLINE> President: Sudan Not to Submit to Tyrannical U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President General Omar
Bashir said Friday that the Sudan will not submit to the
U.S. tyrannical force, calling upon the Sudanese people to reject
the U.S. hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Bashir made the remark at a news conference held here following
an emergency session of the Sudanese National Security and Defense
Council to discuss the Thursday bombing of a Sudanese factory by
U.S. warplanes.
</P>
<P>
U.S. warplanes attacked the Al Shifa pharmaceutical factory on
the outskirts of Khartoum Thursday evening, injuring at least 10
people. Washington claimed that the factory makes chemical weapon
agents for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Bashir visited the site of the bombardment right after the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Out in streets, the Sudanese masses joined in demonstrations
right after the attack.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators thrust into the U.S. embassy building in
Khartoum, pulled down the American flag, tore it to pieces and
stepped over it, shouting anti-US slogans.
</P>
<P>
Washington had ordered the closing down of the embassy on
August 8 and pulled out the whole staff.
</P>
<P>
Bashir also strongly denounced the U.S. Administration and
described it as ignorant and incapable of defining the sites it
was after. He indicated that hitting that factory obviously
demonstrated that information gathered by the U.S. was far from
being real.
</P>
<P>
He said the attacked factory is a well-known model in the
pharmaceutical industry and open to foreign visitors, describing
it as a pride of the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Bashir underlined that the Sudan maintained the right to
complain to the United Nations, and would request the Security
Council to dispatch a fact-finding mission to examine the
badly-ruined factory.
</P>
<P>
He further reiterated that the Sudan maintained the right to
respond to the U.S. aggression.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Hold Peace Talks on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is set to hold peace talks Saturday, which will
bring together presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC), Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the culmination of two weeks' diplomacy of
South Africa to secure a peaceful solution to the conflict in the
DRC, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda were accused by DRC President Laurent Kabila
of backing rebels fighting him, but both countries denied the
charge.
</P>
<P>
In the past two weeks, South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo and Defense Minister Joe Modise shuttled between South
Africa, the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's peace efforts also involved phone calls between
Mandela, his deputy Thabo Mbeki, and Kabila and other regional
leaders, including former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki had reportedly worked throughout Wednesday night and
Thursday to try and secure the participation of all the leaders.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who was firmly in favor of
military intervention, was also invited to the meeting in
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said there was an agreement
in principle from all the parties to attend the talks. But he
declined to name the venue for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The aide said that the peace talks will be followed by a
summit of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) in
Pretoria on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is aimed at resolving the split within the SADC on
how to best deal with the crisis in the Great Lakes country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has reportedly sent troops and military hardware to
Kinshasa to help Kabila quell the revolt.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has made clear that it does not believe in any
military solution.

BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's urban air quality has
dropped slightly over the past week, according to the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The center's latest air-quality report said that as rainfall
decreased in north and northwest China from August 14 to 20, the
amount of some cities' suspended particles increased. However,
most cities enjoy good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Nine cities -- Zhuhai, Xiamen, Beihai, Guilin, Shantou,
Wenzhou, Nanning, Zhanjiang and Haikou -- enjoyed excellent air
quality during the period.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-one cities, including Shanghai, Beijing, Xi'an and
Nanning, reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, Huhhot, Urumqi, Taiyuan, Lanzhou and Zhengzhou
suffered from slight air pollution over the past week, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou's major problem was high levels of nitrogen oxide,
and five other cities all reported high levels of suspended
particles.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference on Domestic Animal Ends in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth Global Conference
on Conservation of Domestic Animal Genetic Resources ended here
Friday, with 49 papers presented on different aspects at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
At the four-day conference, a total of 161 participants from 32
countries representing six continents presented their papers on
sustainable agriculture, genetic distance and molecular markers,
and breed identification and characterization, according to the
summary report of the conference.
</P>
<P>
Papers were also presented on conservation of domestic animal
diversity, role of women, eco-tourism and farm parks, evaluating
land race and feral populations of genetic resources, and historic
sites, livestock and poultry conservation and public education.
</P>
<P>
The conference was jointly organized by the Nepal Agricultural
Research Council and the Rare Breed International (RBI).
</P>
<P>
Keith Ramsey, president of RBI, told the press Thursday that
the biggest challenge facing the world in conservation of domestic
animal genetic resources was the loss of diversity, particularly
in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing ceremony of the conference, Surya Nath
Upadhyay, secretary at the Nepali Ministry of Agriculture and
chairman of the conference, said that the conference would help
further identify and characterize the unidentified indigenous
animals, especially in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, RBI decided that the 5th global conference on
conservation of domestic animal genetic resources will be held in
Brasilia, Brazil, in 2000.

<HEADLINE> People, Birds Lose Homes In Dongting Lake Area (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crane family has not returned since the winter of 1992,
which was also a flood year. At that time, Zhang said, a new
road was being built in the village and machines and vehicles were
roaring day and night.
</P>
<P>
"It's not suitable for the cranes", Zhang said regretfully.
</P>
<P>
The area of the nature reserve, which is wintering grounds for
some 16,000 migratory birds, has been dwindling due to the encroaching
human activity. Villagers around the lake no longer hear birds
singing around their homes.
</P>
<P>
The destroyed vegetation at the upper and middle reaches of
the Yangtze River can also be attributed to the worsening
environment, experts say, adding that it has also caused serious
soil erosion. About 100 million-cubic-meters of silt are deposited
in the lake every year. Moreover, hundreds of floodgates built
around the lake have interrupted fish reproduction and migration.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino and La Nina phenomena are believed to be the main
causes of the current flooding, but excessive exploitation of
nature by human beings should be blamed first, experts emphasize.
</P>
<P>
This area, known as a land of fish and rice, has more than
660,000 hectares of farmland and a population of over 10
million. It is estimated that the lake area has suffered a loss of
nearly 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the
flooding.
</P>
<P>
"The birds have to find new habitats, but it is more and more
difficult for them to find new living ground, and what about human
beings?" Zhang asks himself.
</P>
<P>
"After the flood recedes, I would like to tell people more
about environmental protection, and the relations among birds,
fish, floods, and human beings," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will allocate significant funding for
environmental protection in the Dongting Lake area, and it is also
considering transforming farmland back to the lake as part of a
comprehensive treatment program to restore the lake, official
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's former
president P.W. Botha was sentenced Friday to a fine of 10,000
Rand (1,600 U.S. Dollars) or 12 months in jail after being found
guklty of flouting a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 months' imprisonment was suspended for five years,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The sentence was handed down by Magistrate Victor Lugaju in
the George Regional Court in Western Cape province at the end of
a trial that lasted eight months.
</P>
<P>
Botha's lawyers immediately said their client intended to
appeal and that documents had already been drawn up for the
action.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the sentence, Lugaju said that Botha, who is 82
years old, was not in good health and was a first offender.
</P>
<P>
However, throughout the trial he had shown no remorse and had
been granted enough opportunity to resolve the matter amicably,
but had not done so.
</P>
<P>
Lugaju said the aggravating factors in this instance far
outweighed the mitigating factors, and that he considered the
sentence appropriate.
</P>
<P>
Botha was found to have contravened the founding act of the
TRC, the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act, by
ignoring a subpoena to attend a TRC hearing on the now-defunct
state security council, which he chaired in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The maximum punishment for snubbing the TRC is a jail sentence
of up to two years and/or a fine up to 20,000 Rand (3,200 U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Botha's lawyers argued that the subpoena was technically
flawed and that he had an agreement with TRC Chairman Desmond
Tutu that he could answer any of the TRC's questions in writing.
</P>
<P>
In his judgement, Lugaju said: "It is the unanimous finding of
this court that the accused's failure to appear was unlawful and
intentional, and therefore he is guilty as charged."
</P>
<P>
He rejected Botha's defense counsels' arguments that the
subpoena was invalid, that the TRC had acted in bad faith toward
him, and that there was an agreement between Botha and Tutu.
</P>
<P>
Acting TRC Chairman Alex Boraine welcomed the court ruling,
saying it showed that South Africa was now a society in which
nobody was above the law. Tutu is in north America.
</P>
<P>
In its response, the ruling African National Congress said
that Botha's conviction would send a clear message that no one
was above the law.
</P>
<P>
However, South African President Nelson Mandela's office said
it would not comment on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter for the courts," Mandela's spokesman Parks
Mankahlana said.
</P>
<P>
About 50 demonstrators gathered outside the court before Botha
arrived Friday morning.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice President Paul
Kagame has paid a one-day visit to Zambia amid tight security as
Lusaka continues pursuing peace efforts to resolve the three-week
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Kagame, who doubles as Defense Minister was met at the Lusaka
International Airport Thursday morning by Vice-President Christon
Tembo and was immediately driven to the State House, where he
held a closed-door meeting with President Frederick Chiluba,
Zambia Daily Mail said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not immediately known, but the
talks are believed to have centered on the Congolese crisis and
steps being taken to stop it from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, which helped DRC President Laurent Kabila oust late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, has been accused by Kabila's
government of backing the Tutsi-led rebellion which started on
August 2 in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Thursday accused Rwanda of
directly being involved in the efforts to topple Kabila, who came
to power 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
While Zambia is a member of the four-nation reconciliatory
committee formed at the regional summit held on Agust 8 in
Zimbabwe. It has agreed with Zimbabwe and Namibia to conduct
military intervention in the Congolese crisis to help President
Kabila, disclosed Mugabe Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But up till now the Zambian government has remained silent on
whether or not the Zambian troops will join other countries in
the military intervention, which met strong objection from South
African President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela proposed a peaceful and political solution to the
Congolese crisis and urged all warring factions to stop fighting
and talk.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the 14-nation regional grouping, the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), Mandela said Thursday that
he planned a regional summit to discuss a peaceful end to the
rebellion in DRC, where the rebels have taken control of one
third of the territory and are threatening to capture the capital
Kinshasa by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Vows to Punish Those Responsible for Grenade Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Interior Ministry
has vowed to take tough action against the perpetrators of
Thursday night's grenade attack outside the ministry that killed
at least one person.
</P>
<P>
Khieu Sopheak, spokesman of the Interior Ministry, made the
remark Friday morning at a press conference held at the
information ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government and the interior ministry will do their best to
arrest those it has deemed ``killers'' and bring them to justice,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry will file charges in the municipal court
against those who entered the ministry compound without
permission, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people want to disturb the political atmosphere and
create a political crisis in Cambodia through legal or illegal
protests, various forms of violence, and attempt to change the
results of the July 26 election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The attack, which occurred just after 11 p.m. (1600 GMT) on
Thursday, killed at least one person. Gunmen opened fire and threw
a grenade outside the Interior Ministry gate.
</P>
<P>
The dead man was identified as Sieng Sean, a Cambodian driver
for the Japanese news agency Kyodo.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, the opposition party leader, was in the National
Election Committee headquarters in the Interior Ministry compound
at the time.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is still under way.
</P>
<P>
The incident may affect the relatively peaceful post-election
calm and raise concerns about the future of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Two main opposition parties Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy Party also
held a joint press conference Friday afternoon to condemn
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Yahya, Funcinpec Parliamentarian, said he was concerned
about the safety of opposition political leaders. He believes that
someone wants to eliminate Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
"So I came here just to show unity with Funcinpec and SRP. I
believe that at this time, the opposition party SRP and Funcinpec
are becoming stronger. We will at the end produce a lot of good
results for everyone," Yahya said.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing international pressure to quickly form a new
coalition government, Funcinpec and the SRP continue to boycott
the results of the election and appear poised for a protracted
battle with the ruling CPP.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties insisted that Hun Sen, the incumbent
second prime minister and vice president of the CPP, not be named
prime minister of the new government. CPP officials say the
request is ludicrous.

BRUSSELS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Friday that it had earmarked 500,000 ECU (550,000 U.S. dollars) in
humanitarian aid for victims of the floods in Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
The aid, to be managed by the European Community Humanitarian
Office, will enable Austrian and German non-governmental
organizations to carry out emergency relief programs.
</P>
<P>
The commission fund will cover such emergency relief items as
blankets, hygiene products and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Floods hit the eastern part of Slovakia in late July, claiming
35 lives, most of them children in villages and gypsy
encampments. Some 3,500 people had to be evacuated from the
hardest-hit areas, commission officials said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Strait Association Says Political Negotiations Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) says that Taiwan and the
mainland need to hold procedural talks on political negotiation as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
ARATS said it has helped settle hundreds of accidents that
involved loss of life and property across the Taiwan Strait, and
because ARATS is an authoritative non-government organization it
must assist relatives of Taiwanese who die on the mainland with
affairs afterwards.
</P>
<P>
When there was a boat accident on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang
Province in March 1994, for example, ARATS invited relatives of
the victims and SEF members to Hangzhou, Zhejiang's provincial
capital, to provide them with information about the case.
</P>
<P>
Since this non-government exchange channel was established, it
has become common practice for the ARATS to be responsible for
providing assistance to relatives of Taiwanese compatriots.
</P>
<P>
ARATS says that it has always tried its best to safeguard the
rights and interests of compatriots on Taiwan and the mainland.
</P>
<P>
In the first meeting of ARATS' President Wang Daohan and SEF's
Chairman Koo Chenfu, ARATS made a proposal on the rights and
interests of Taiwanese investment on the mainland and
cross-straits tourism. But, ARATS says, SEF has always been
evasive and has continued to postpone talks on these matters,
using "judicial jurisdiction" and other politically sensitive
issues as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
ARATS explains, however, that things like "judicial
jurisdiction" need to be discussed in light of the 'One China
Principle' and that it is in fact political disparity that is the
obstacle in the way of cross-straits relations.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Plans to Protect Environment of Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- the Chinese capital city of
Beijing plans to make huge investments in upgrading the processing
capabilities of its sewage plants in an effort to reduce the
amount of polluted water discharged into the Bohai Bay.
</P>
<P>
Home to a population of 13 million, the city discharges more
than two million tons of domestic and industrial waste water a
day, the bulk of which flows into the Bohai Bay, some 150 kilometers
southeast of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The foul waste discharged by major industrial cities on the
Bohai Bay has contaminated the maritime environment to such an
appaling extent that fish and shrimps have disappeared in
some areas of the bay.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the worsening situation, the city government has
speeded up construction of the Gaobeidian Sewage Plant, which is
intended to purify some one million tons of foul water daily by
September 1999 when it is scheduled to be completed.
</P>
<P>
Beijing also plans to set up a dozen sewage plants in
its suburban counties to facilitate purification.
</P>
<P>
"By the year 2010, more than 90 percent of the city's domestic
and industrial water will be treated before being discharged into
the Bohai Bay," said an official.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Promises Measures to Protect Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu cut short his holiday in the north Friday after
a Jewish settler was killed in Hebron, vowing to "do everything
possible" to protect Jewish settlers, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio reports said that Netanyahu will confer with his
security and intelligence advisers to discuss ways to strengthen
security measures in the Jewish neighborhood in the West Bank of
Hebron, where a 63-year-old rabbi was stabbed to death Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu added that he would "vehemently" demand that the
Palestinian National Authority fulfill their obligations to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was on his summer vacation in the northern
city of Tiberias.
</P>
<P>
The stabbing incident was the second of the type in less than a
month. Two Jewish settlers were ambushed and killed on August 4 in
a settlement near another West Bank town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Settlement leaders and some right-wing parliamentary members,
criticizing the government for not doing enough to protect Jewish
settlers, urged Netanyahu to halt the talks with the Palestinians
on the overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Environment Minister Rafael Eitan called on the government
Friday to enlarge the Jewish neighborhood where the murdered
rabbi lived.
</P>
<P>
Following the death of the two Jewish settlers in the
settlement of Yitzhar earlier this month, the Israeli cabinet
decided to enlarge the settlement.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers have beefed up security measures along the
way from Hebron to Jerusalem along which the slain settler would
be brought for burial.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers bolstered the security in the Old
City of East Jerusalem in an effort to prevent any disturbance as
the Palestinians were planning a mass prayer ceremony on the
afternoon to mark the 29th anniversary of an arson attack on
Al-Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that Israeli border policemen succeeded
in holding back about 100 Palestinians who tried to cross a
checkpoint in northern Jerusalem to stage a protest against the
burning of Al-Aqsa by an Israeli extremist 29 years ago. The
policemen were attacked by stones and bottles, the radio
said.

<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will propose the
formation of an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
parliament in the forthcoming ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary
Organization (AIPO) meeting, Indonesia's house speaker said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after a meeting with President B.J.
Habibie, House of Representatives (DPR) Speaker Harmoko said the
president as well as the DPR leadership had all agreed that the
proposal will be tabled at the AIPO meeting.
</P>
<P>
The AIPO meeting will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on
August 24-28. Harmoko will lead the Indonesian delegation to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said the ASEAN Parliament could be set up without ever
having to interfere in ASEAN member countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, it could serve as a vehicle for the
formulation of common stances or policies in support of the ASEAN
region's development, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal was approved and Indonesia was asked to provide
a venue for the body, "we will, of course, be ready to meet the
request," Harmoko said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei,
Singapore, the Philippines, Laos, Vietnam and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> Canada Develops New Asthma Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A new one-pill-a-day treatment
for chronic asthma sufferers is now available in Canada, the Globe
and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The new drug, produced under the brand name Singulair, reduced
asthma symptoms in half in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
"This is a Canadian success story, scientifically and
economically," said Andre Marcheterre, president of Merck Frosst
Canada Inc. which is marketing the drug.
</P>
<P>
The drug costs 2.06 Canadian dollars (about 1.34 U.S. dollars)
for a 10-milligram adult tablet, and 1.40 Canadian dollars (about
90 cents) for a five-milligram cherry-flavored chewable children's
dose.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.8 million Canadians suffer from the inflammatory
disease of the lungs and trachea; one-third of them are children.
</P>
<P>
Asthma is a major public-health problem. It kills 10 Canadians
a week and costs the health-care system more than 600 million
Canadian dollars (390 million U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Asthma afflicts 150 million people around the world and is
increasing by as much as 50 per cent every 10 years, said the

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Friday lodged a
strong protest against the U.S. overnight missile attacks on
alleged terrorist facilities in Afghanistan which resulted
casualties inside Pakistan border.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces on Thursday night attacked with cruise missiles
six sites in Afghanistan, located close to the Pakistani border,
which are believed to be the hideouts of the anti-American Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Ladin.
</P>
<P>
"On the presumption of violation of our sovereignty, we have
lodged a protest with the U.S. government," the spokesman said in
a special news briefing here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Thursday's missile attacks have also resulted some
casualties about 10 to 15 km beyond the Pakistani border, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the U.S. Charge d'affaires was summoned
to the Foreign Office and a protest was lodged with him.
</P>
<P>
He said "the U.S. official expressed his regrets over the
incident and said it must be a result of a technical error."
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. attack has caused outrage and aggravated
the situation in the neighboring Afghanistan, which, following a
decade of superpower military intervention, continues to be in the
grip of turmoil and internal conflict.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Raid, Bombings No Direct Links: FBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Director of the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Louis Freeh said here Friday that
U.S. air raid on Afghanistan and Sudan is not directly linked
with the probe into the August 7 bombings in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This is an investigation proceeding on many fronts," said
Freeh at a press conference at the Jomo Kenyatta airport before
returning home. "I cannot detail or characterize the type of
evidence we have gathered in Nairobi."
</P>
<P>
He said he cannot confirm there is any evidence linking the
bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania to the
Saudi millionaire and the allegedly main sponsor of anti-U.S.
terrorism, Osama Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of people have been interviewed" and investigators
probably have to take quite a long time to compile evidence in
the two bomb blasts so as to reach any conclusion, he said. Freeh
flew to Washington immediately after the press conference.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said Thursday that he had ordered
the strikes after receiving "convincing evidence" that the
terrorist facilities the U.S. raided in Sudan and Afghanistan had
played key roles in the bomb attacks in capitals of Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, Freeh said although the bombing investigators from
the FBI, Kenya and Tanzania have been working very hard and made
"very good progress" on the case, so far no conclusion or
decision can be made at this stage.
</P>
<P>
After touring Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam Thursday and
meeting with Kenyan police leaders Friday morning, the FBI chief
also said that he is very satisfied with the close and effective
cooperation among the FBI agents and the police in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The man who hurled a grenade at security guards at the U.S.
embassy here seconds before the bomb exploded was positively
identified Thursday as two more suspects -- one Arab, one
Sudanese -- who had been arrested, Kenya's national newspapers
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the plan of bombing U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers
destined for Kenya were dispatched through Somalia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official who saw the confessions of
suspects was quoted Friday by local media as saying that an
Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Laden, planned the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack at the U.S. embassy in Nairobi killed 253
people and injured 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in
Tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from
Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.

<P>
MACAO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The two bus companies in Macao
raised bus fares in Macao on Friday, claiming that this will help
them reduce losses.
</P>
<P>
Macao consists of three parts: the Macao peninsula and the
Taipa and Coloane islands. Buses have been a major means of
traveling in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The bus fares in the Macao peninsula was raised from 2.3
patacas to 2.5 patacas, and those for buses shuttling between the
peninsula and the two islands were raised by 0.3 and 0.5 patacas
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the price of monthly tickets will be raised from
180 to 210 patacas beginning from September.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Wins Battle against Yangtze River Flood Crest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The sixth flood crest on the
Yangtze River passed through Wuhan early this morning after
tormenting local people for 26 hours.
</P>
<P>
The long period of high water in this industrial city in
central China was caused by the confluence of water from the
Yangtze, Yuanshui and Lishui rivers and Dongting Lake, which
formed a gigantic body of water, said a local flood-control expert.
</P>
<P>
During the last two days, more than 280,000 civilians and
soldiers struggled against the flood on the Yangtze and Hanjiang
river embankments around the clock. They dealt with 1,757
dangerous sections of embankments in heavy rain and strong wind.
</P>
<P>
Qian Yunlu, secretary of the Wuhan City Committee of the
Communist Party of China, and city Mayor Wang Shouhai patroled the
river embankments and extended their regards to flood-fighters
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The city had prepared 350,000 cubic meters of sand and stones,
1.13 million cubic meters of earth and 7 million plastic bags for
use against the flood crest, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Introduce Plan to End Yellow River Water Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hydropower experts
contend that power generated in southern China can help to
alleviate seasonal water shortages along the Yellow River in the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages have for many years interrupted the flow water
in many sections of the Yellow River during the dry season and
have had a detrimental impact on life and production in northern
China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng, general manager of the Ertan Hydropower
Development Corp. recently suggested that Yellow River power
stations should concentrate on storing water during the rainy
season, while Yangtze River power stations in the south should
transmit power to fulfill demand in the north.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Yellow River facilities would then be able to
dischange water during the dry season.
</P>
<P>
Liu's concept is supported by the massive plan to build dozens
of large power stations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze and
the Three Gorges Water Conservation Project which is under
construction in the middle reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
The first of the six 550,000-kw generating units of the Ertan
Hydropower Station, the largest water conservation project
scheduled for completion during this century, went on line last
week on the Yalong River, a Yangtze tributary.
</P>
<P>
A previous plan to divert abundant water from the south to the
north involved individual project costs of several hundred billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liu's calculations indicate that each 100 million kwh of power
transmitted from the south during the flood season would add 10
billion cu.m. of water to the current Yellow River water level. He
also noted that a power transmission network could be completed at
a cost of several billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the plan centers on establishing a national power
transmission network free of regional economic barriers," said
Liu, a water conservation expert with 30 years of experience.
</P>
<P>
The plan has attracted wide-spread attention and related
departments are preparing to conduct related studies.

<HEADLINE> Third Flood Crest Arrives in Harbin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- No major damage was reported
today when the third flood crest along the Nenjiang River arrived
in Harbin, the largest heavy industrial center in northeast China,
at noon today.
</P>
<P>
The water level hit 120.82 meters, 2.72 meters above the danger
level and 0.77 meters above the 1957 record. The city also
recorded a record flow rate of 17,400 cu.m. per second.
</P>
<P>
Levees surrounding Harbin, considered to be the best in
Heilongjiang Province, are designed to withstand 100-year
floods. Nonetheless, sandbags were the last major defense against
flood waters which rose one meter above the tops of
levees. Surging waters in the Songhua River seeped through the
primary and secondary embankments, with water levels as 20
centimeters covering many streets. Soldiers used plastic bowls
throw seepage water back into the river.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 soldiers and civilians battled surging water
by placing sandbags atop levees.
</P>
<P>
Banners bearing slogans such as "Defend levees to the death"
and "Protecting Harbin requires a life or death struggle" hung
from trees near the levees.
</P>
<P>
Streets near the Songhua River were filled with trucks hauling
plastic bags and stone to workers on Songhua River levees.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers supplied weary workers with food, including stuffed
buns, gruel and green beans, considered to provide relief from
the summer heat.
</P>
<P>
Daily life and production essentially continues as normal in
Harbin, a city located in close proximity to both the Songhua and
Nenjiang rivers, according to Luan Fang, general manager of a
local commercial center.

"Although the cruise missiles fly very low, so far the
government is not aware of any violation, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack on the sovereign Muslim state of Afghanistan
is a serious matter. "The attack of cruise missiles resulted in
loss of innocent lives, which is a cause of serious concern for
us."
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan, he said, "expresses its indignation
over the attacks" no matter what justifications are given.

<HEADLINE> HK Consumer Price Inflation Keeps Easing in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price inflation
maintained its easing trend in Hong Kong in July 1998, according
to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures released by the Census
and Statistics Department Friday.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year rate of increase in the Composite CPI was 3.2
percent in July, significantly lower than the 4 percent in June.
It was also the lowest monthly figure recorded since September
1986.
</P>
<P>
The lower year-on-year rates of increase in the CPI in July
than in June were mainly attributable to a decline in food prices
from a year earlier and to the continuing easing in private
housing rentals. In addition, the lower year-on-year rate of
increase in the prices of miscellaneous goods also contributed.
</P>
<P>
Analyzed by component, lower year-on-year rates of increase
than the overall average in July were recorded for durable goods
(0.7 percent in both the Composite CPI and CPI(A)); clothing and
footwear (1.2 percent in the Composite CPI and 2.1 percent in the
CPI(A)); meals bought away from home (1.9 percent in the Composite
CPI and 2.1 percent in the CPI(A)); and fuel and light (2 percent
in the Composite CPI and 1.6 percent in the CPI(A)).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prices of food (excluding meals bought away from
home) declined by 2.3 percent in the Composite CPI and 3.1 percent
in the CPI(A) in July over a year earlier, as the higher vegetable
prices in the summer of 1997 renders a higher base of comparison.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first seven months of 1998 together, the increase in
the Composite CPI averaged at 4.5 percent over the same period of
1997. The corresponding increases for the CPI(A), CPI(B) and Hang
Seng CPI were 4.2 percent, 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months ended July 1998, the Composite CPI was, on
average, 5 percent higher than that for the preceding 12-month
period.
</P>
<P>
Monthly consumer price indices are compiled on the basis of
expenditure patterns of relevant households and prices collected
currently in the month.
</P>
<P>
The CPI(A) is based on the expenditure pattern of about 50
percent of households in Hong Kong, which had an average monthly
expenditure of 4,000-15,999 HK dollars in 1994/95 (broadly
equivalent to 4,600-18,200 HK dollars at 1997 prices). The CPI(B)
is based on the expenditure pattern of the next 30 percent of
households, which had an average monthly expenditure of
16,000-29,999 HK dollars in 1994/95 (broadly equivalent to
18,200-34,600 HK dollars at 1997 prices).

<HEADLINE> China Offers Special Fund To Rescue Rare Monkeys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance has
decided to offer Deqin County, home of the Yunnan snub-nosed
monkey, an additional 3 million yuan (360,000 U.S. dollars) each
year to protect these endangered monkeys with human-like faces.
</P>
<P>
Before this decision, southwest China's Yunnan Province was
providing 8 million yuan (966.000 U.S.dollars) a year for the
monkeys in Deqin County.
</P>
<P>
So these monkeys have now become the lucky rare wild animal
enjoying top preferential treatment among other species of rare
wild animals in China.
</P>
<P>
A recent investigation reports that there are now only about
1,000 Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys in the world, and these live in 13
groups in the four Yunnan counties bordering the Tibet
Autonomous Region. Around 700 live in Deqin County.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the preservation of the Yunnan snub-nosed
monkey in Deqin County is of great importance for the protection
of this endengered species.
</P>
<P>
An adult male monkey usually weighs over 20 kilograms and the
female is usually about half that weight.
</P>
<P>
The most striking feature of the monkeys is their slightly pink
face and red lips, most other monkeys have a red face.
</P>
<P>
Experts say fewer than 10 Chinese and foreign zoologists have
ever spotted Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys in the wild.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists believe that the study of the Yunnan snub-nosed
monkey may be of great importance to the study of species
evolution.
</P>
<P>
Since Deqin County is one of the poorest areas in China,
farmers often fell trees to sell and use for cooking. The
felling of the trees breaks the monkeys' food chain resulting
in a reduction of their number.
</P>
<P>
A 190,000-hectare nature reserve for the monkeys has been
established in Deqin County. It covers one-fifth of the county's
total area, and felling trees or hunting in this forests has
already been banned.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Visitor arrivals to Hong Kong
in July increased, for the first time this year, by 26.5 percent
compared with the figure for July 1997, according to figures
released by the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total arrivals for the month were 832,664, about 86,000 more
than the June figure and the biggest monthly total since last
December.
</P>
<P>
The highest increase in arrivals, by 150.8 percent, was
recorded from the Chinese mainland. This was due partly to the 30
percent increase in the tour group quota, which came into effect
on July 1 this year, the HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
Most other market regions also showed growth in July, with
arrivals from Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific
combined up by 23.9 percent. Those from the Americas were up by
18.7 percent, from Europe, Africa and the Middle East combined up
by 11.8, and from Taiwan also up by 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Encouragingly, Japan arrivals increased by 11.7 percent, the
HKTA said.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from South and Southeast Asia fell by 16.6 percent.
Arrivals also fell by a large margin from the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Individual markets showing good growth in July included the
United Kingdom (up 37.6 percent), Canada (up 28.7 percent) and New

<HEADLINE> China's Mainland Remains HK's Largest Re-export Partner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese mainland remains
the largest partner for Hong Kong's re-export trade, according to
re-export statistics for the first half of 1998 released by the
Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong Friday.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports originating from the Chinese mainland accounted for
58 percent of Hong Kong's re-export value in the period.
</P>
<P>
Taking the two directions of trade flow as a whole but counting
only once the value of merchandises originating from and
re-exported back to the Chinese mainland, about 90 percent, or
510.7 billion HK dollars (65.5 billion U.S. dollars), of the total
re-exports going through Hong Kong in the first half of 1998 were
related to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that much of the re-export trade involving the
Chinese mainland is related to outward processing, as raw
materials and semi-manufactured goods are exported to the mainland
for processing, with the final products subsequently returned to
Hong Kong and then re-exported to overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports accounted for 86 percent of the value of total
exports and 41 percent of the total value of external trade of
Hong Kong in the first half of 1998, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
In the same period of 1997, the corresponding shares were
broadly similar, at 86 percent and 40 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other main origins of Hong Kong's re-exports in the first half
of the year included Japan (11 percent), Taiwan (6.4 percent), the
United States (4.8 percent) and the Republic of Korea (3.5
percent).
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Trading House Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court declared
on Friday that Okura and Company, a medium-sized Japanese trading
house, is bankrupt. This is the country's third largest corporate
failure in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Okura filed for bankruptcy with 288.3 billion yen (about 2.1
billion U.S. dollars) in group liabilities early in the day.
</P>
<P>
The trading house, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's First
Section, is the fourth listed Japanese company to go bankrupt this
year.
</P>
<P>
In announcing the bankruptcy at a press conference, Okura
President Yoshihiko Okura attributed his company's failure to
mountains of nonperforming real estate assets as a result of
aggressive real estate investment made during the bubble economy
of the late 1980s and difficulties in raising funds through bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
The company had 98 billion yen (about 68 million dollars) in
nonperforming assets, including those held by group companies, or
about one-third of their total assets in the last business year,
which ended March 31, Okura said.
</P>
<P>
According to private credit research agency Teikoku Databank,
the collapse of the bubble economy left Okura with huge investment
losses, forcing it into the red during the last six years.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed, Lebanese Civilian Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was wounded
by Israeli retaliatory bombardment on villages of south Lebanon
Friday after two Israelis were killed by guerrillas overnight, the
Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Amin Nadar, 70, was wounded by shrapnel of shells which
were fired by Israeli artillery troops onto the village of Arab
Salim in the Iqlim al Tuffah area facing the Israeli occupied
south Lebanon, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes raided the village of Agmeta and Tale Imliti
in the same area and fired air-to-surface missiles onto the
villages.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen Lebanese civilians have been killed and 72 others
wounded in south Lebanon so far this year in the clashes between
Israeli forces and Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli attacks came apparently as a retaliatory action
against a Hezbollah bomb blast which killed an Israeli soldier and
a construction worker on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb set off when the car carrying the
victims was passing at Golea Shqif village in the edge of the
Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The deadly blast brought to 12 the number of the Israelis
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 76
others were wounded during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Following the attack, Israeli senior army officials, including
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Army Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofaz and northern front commander Lt. Gen. Ghabi Ashkinazi, held
an emergency meeting to assess the situation in south Lebanon and
its impact on Israel, the radio quoted Israeli media reports as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The new events came one day after Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani threatened to strike Lebanon's
infrastructure facilities each time an Israeli soldier was killed
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that could force the Lebanese government to deploy army
on the borders to maintain security and prevent guerrillas from
using the south as a base to attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses Israeli forces suffered in the south have sparked
heated debate in Israel over the value of continuing military
presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April, Israeli cabinet endorsed the 20-year-old United
Nations 425 but conditioned the implementation of it on the
Beirut government guarantees for Israeli north security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon flatly rejected the offer and demanded Israel leave its
south without any conditions as the resolution stipulated.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAQING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The swollen Nenjiang River has
inundated 1,443 oil wells in Daqing, China's largest oilfield, and
production in 282 wells has been suspended since August 12.
</P>
<P>
 The production breakdown has affected 13,455 tons of oil
output. The amount of crude oil transported out of Daqing,
however, has been steadily increasing. On Thursday, 154,626 tons
of oil was sent out, a relatively high daily transport.
</P>
<P>
Production in other oil wells here remain under pressure as
more roads and railways have been damaged by floodwater. Vehicles
loaded with oil exploration materials have had to take detours of
hundreds of kilometers in order to reach wells in Hailar and
Bei'an.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 oil wells under the No.4 Oil Exploration Plant
are now operating in water.
</P>
<P>
Oilmen in Daqing, which produces a third of China's crude
oil, are doing their utmost to maintain normal production.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns U.S. Raids on Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday condemned the
United States for its attack on Sudan Thursday, terming it as a
move violating Sudan's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Tehran radio quoted the Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi as saying that the U.S. raid on a Sudanese factory was a
measure against the Sudanese people and "we condemn it."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi stated that Iran always condemns terrorists. However,
he said, no event could be used as a pretext for the U.S. to do
what it likes and to attack the Islamic lands.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that innocent people of Sudan and
Afghanistan were killed during the U.S. attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the military strikes on
alleged terrorists' bases or facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan
simultaneously Thursday, in retaliation for the explosions of
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.S. attack on a base of the Saudi dissident
Osma bin Laden in Afghanistan, the spokesman said that what
happened in Afghanistan was the result of the U.S. double standard
policy towards terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. police has helped create a suitable
circumstance for the growth of terrorism throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that anywhere the U.S. interest is threatened,
the Americans would react strongly, but anywhere others' interest
is threatened, their reaction would be another kind and even help
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that to fight against terrorism is possible only
through a clear and comprehensive international cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Govt Approves 2,400 Registered Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Federal Government has
approved 2,403 products as fit for human consumption, The Post
Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the products registered by the National Agency for Food
and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), 984 are human drug
products, 802 food products, 484 cosmetic products and 24
veterinary drug products, according to a government gazette.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted NAFDAC Director General Gabriel Osuide as
saying Thursday in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, that it was now
mandatory that such medicines, foods, drugs, chemicals and
packaged water products should have their NAFDAC registration
number printed on their labels.
</P>
<P>
By an agreement reached between the agency and the
manufacturers, he said, the registration number should be
progressively printed on the labels.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the registration number would guide consumers
and give them the assurance that the products they buy are
genuine and legal in the market.
</P>
<P>
The agency's main instrument of protecting public health is
product registration, Osuide said, adding that "in this way,
every manufacturer or importer of processed food, medicine,
cosmetics or packaged water, intended for Nigerian market, is by
law, required to register such product with the agency, before
the product can be lawfully manufactured, imported, distributed
or sold in the country."
</P>
<P>
Before a product can be accorded registration, he noted, it
must meet the requirement of documentation, evaluation of the
documents, analysis of sample of product before a registration
number is allocated to it.
</P>
<P>
This is the second approval of registered products in the West
African country since last year when the gazette listed 1,805
products.

LAGOS, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of President

<HEADLINE> China to Build World's Highest Concave-Shaped Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China has announced plans to
build the world's highest concave-faced dam, a Chinese official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 325-meter high dam will be part the Jinping Hydro-Electric
power Station scheduled for construction along the Yalong River in
Sichuan Province, said Liu Junfeng, general manager of the Ertan
Hydro-Electric Power Development Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The structure, the highest dam of its kind in the world, will
fall 10 meters short of the height for a different style dam in
Russia, but the Russian dam is an earth and stone dam, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jinping facility will have a designed capacity of 3.6
million kW and is one of 21 power stations planned for the Yalong
River. The design of the structure is scheduled for completion in
the year 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
The first 550,000-KW generating unit of the Ertan
Hydro-Electric Power Station, with a designed capacity of 3.3
million kW, went on line on a trial base last week. The station
will be the largest hydropower project completed in China during
this century. The 240-meter high dam of the station is currently
the country's highest.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Currency Stabilizes for Six Weeks Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian ctprency Kwacha has
relatively stabilized for six weeks running against the U.S.
Dollar as a result of 3.5 million Dollar supplied on the market
by the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) during the week
ending August 17.
</P>
<P>
And it is anticipated that the exchange rate of the Kwacha
against Dollar will remain static and the Zambian currency may
even appreciate slightly by the end of this month, Zambia Daily
Mail said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest weekly Treasury Newsletter of the Barclays Bank
indicated that banks counter rates are now in the range of
1920-1930 Kwacha and 1970-1975 Kwacha for buying and selling
respectively, compared to 1910-1925 Kwacha and 1965-1972 Kwacha
in the week ending July 20.
</P>
<P>
The Kwacha has in the recent months suffered a great deal from
the shortage of foreign exchange which pushed up demand and
eventually eroded the purchasing power of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the situation is still not very good despite the
few Dollars that are now being offloaded on the market by ZCCM, the
traditional and biggest foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Donor inflows are still a pipedream as donors are reluctant to
release their pledged aid amounting to 5.3 billion Dollars until

Inflows from donors to Zambia's central bank as at June 26

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Former South African state
President Pieter Willem Botha was Friday sentenced to a fine of
10,000 Rand (1,600 U.S. dollars) or 12 months' imprisonment for
snubbing a subpoena of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC), South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Handing down the sentence, George magistrate Victor Lugaju
said Botha at 82 was not in good health and was a first offender.
</P>
<P>
However, throughout the trial he had shown no remorse and had
been granted ample opportunity to resolve the matter amicably,
but had not done so.
</P>
<P>
Lugaju said the mitigating factors in this instance far
outweighed the aggravating factors, and he considered the
sentence to be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
He also sentenced Botha to a further 12 months' imprisonment,
suspended for five years.

 end at 933.16 after moving on a downward slope for a week.
</P>
<P>
The total volume contracted to 189.13 million units worth

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Starts to Build Regional Road Networks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, the
three members of the East African Cooperation, have started to
re-build the battered regional road networks with 62 billion
Shillings (some 1.04 billion U.S. Dollars) from foreign donors.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the European Union have agreed to offer the
money to help uplift the region's devastated infrastructure that
had been rendered almost worthless by the El Nino rains and lack
of maintenance, media here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A report from the EAC secretariat based in the northern
Tanzanian town of Arusha said five major regional road corridors
and their feeder links, which connect most parts of the region,
have been identified for repair.
</P>
<P>
The move "intends to promote the regional trade and
investment, provide the required competitiveness to the regional
products through the reduction of transportation cost and
enhancing the overall transport safety," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The corridors, noted the 62-page report, also provides
required linkages and connectivity to areas of production,
markets and other modes of transport such as sea ports, railway
and airports.
</P>
<P>
Tourism in Kenya has also taken a back seat due to the
dilapidated road network.
</P>
<P>
As a result of politics and poor infrastructure, in 1997
earnings from the sector dropped from 24 billion Shillings in
1996 to 22 billion Shillings last year.
</P>
<P>
The cost of vehicle maintenance has increased threefold as
vehicles degenerate rapidly on the poor roads. Transport costs
have skyrocketed - pushing up prices of foodstuff and other
essential commodities.
</P>
<P>
The surface conditions of the targeted road networks are
generally poor. Those unpaved account for 8,668 km while paved
measures 6,605 km only, said the report.
</P>
<P>
To improve the region's road network to desirable standards
for trade, a total of 4,674 million Dollars will be required in
the next five years, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, says the EAC secretariat in the report,
rehabilitation of the sections of the Mombasa-Malaba road and its
branches will provide the quality of infrastructure necessary to
support Kenya's overall economy strategy.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-Malaba road is one of the most heavily trafficked
routes in Kenya - and the most battered - serving both domestic
and international traffic to and from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and
Zaire. Experts consider the road as one of the engines of EAC
transport network.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, a joint task force set up to formulate an EAC
Development strategy on surface transport (1997-2000) identified
the Sironko-Namalu-Morinka-Moroto-Kenya border road as one of the
important feeder road linking to the whole region.
</P>
<P>
In Tanzania, the EAC secretariat will concentrate on the
232-km-long Mwanza-Biharamulo road which is part of the country's
national trunk road network.
</P>
<P>
The Lake Victoria circuit road network is given top priority
due to its strategic location. The secretariat expects its
rehabilitation will help boost agricultural production around the
lake region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Leader Calls for Research Despite Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B. J.
Habibie said Friday that research and technology development
activities should go on despite the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are facing heavy economic problems, research and
technology development activities must continue," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 20th anniversary celebration of the Agency for
Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) here, Habibie
stressed that it is important for a nation to have mastery of
technology to enable it to become equal with other nations.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that investments in research are very costly --
almost similar to investments in human resources. But I must
convince you that such investments will not go to waste," he said.
</P>
<P>
Returns would even be greater than the amount of investment,
said Habibie, who had chaired the agency for almost 20 years
before he became vice president in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Habibie became the country's president after former President
Soeharto resigned on May 21.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed the importance of research in
solving present and future problems.
</P>
<P>
He further reminded BPPT researchers that the people need
technology to build low-cost houses and increase food production.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Economy Could Be Affected by Crisis in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The impact of the Russia's
financial crisis will be felt sooner or later by Romania's
economy, and the devaluation of the Russian ruble will cause
foreign capital to a flee from not only Russia but also
neighboring markets, the local daily Nine O'clock reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the crisis in Russia and its impact on Romania's
capital market, Viorel Pana, a senator and director of the
Bucharest Stock Exchange, was quoted as saying that "the financial
crisis in Russia makes us approach a subject of utmost importance
regarding the domestic economy and the increase in Romania's
country risk rating in an international context which is not
favorable at all."
</P>
<P>
"Under these circumstances, a crisis of the magnitude witnessed
by Russia could not but have some repercussion on Romania's
economy; Also, since Western Europe is more scared of the Russian
than the Asian crisis in autumn," Pana said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pana proposed some solutions to avoiding the
aftershock of the Russian crisis, which included speeding up
privatization and restructuring, and dropping the 1.5 percent tax
on foreign investments in Romania.

<P>
HANOI, August 21 (xinhua) -- In Vietnam 84,500 people have been
infected by dengue fever and 186 died by August 15, Vietnam news
agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number increased three and four fold over the same period
last year, the preventive medicine department said.
</P>
<P>
The disease is spreading mainly in Vietnam's central and Mekong
Delta provinces. The worst is the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre
with 13,332 patients including 25 deaths. There are 8,844 patients
in the central province of Quang Tri.
</P>
<P>
The number of patients is unlikely to decline in the provinces
of Kien Giang, An Giang, Dac Lac, Quang Binh and Kon Tum.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Health Minister Do Nguyen Phuong demanded the Hanoi
Institute of Traditional Medicine and the army to
study and produce easy-to-use traditional medicine packages to
help the prevention and control of the disease.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
scheduled visits to Russia and Japan in early September have been
postponed due to the immensity of the flood control and disaster
relief efforts in China.
</P>
<P>
The timetable for the visits will be rescheduled through
diplomatic channels between China and the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan informed Russian
ambassador Igor Rogachev and Japanese ambassador Sakutaro Tanino
of this decision during separate meetings with them here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tang also asked the two ambassadors to convey President Jiang's
letters explaining the postponements to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Tang said that this summer, China has
continued to suffer from the most severe flooding of the Yangtze,
Songhua, and Nenjiang rivers since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949. The flooding has inundated vast
regions, affected large numbers of people, and has lasted a very
long time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that after two months, the disaster has still not
eased and in some regions the situation is deteriorating. The
floods are imposing serious threats to the life and property of
the people in the disaster-stricken regions, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Chinese service men and civilians are fighting
against the flood, Tang said, adding that China is fully confident
that, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, China can overcome the
difficulties and the disaster.
</P>
<P>
At present, however, it is necessary for President Jiang Zemin
to remain in the country to supervise the pressing flood fighting
and disaster relief efforts, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
After careful consideration, it was decided that President Jiang
put off his visits to Russia and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Defense Force Leans Toward Opposition: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The commander of the
Lesotho Defense Force Thursday moved to allay rumblings within
the ranks of the army amid indications that the government was
losing the support of the military, The Star daily reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Makhula Mosakeng, who has been accused of
involvement in corruption and the alleged rigging of the May 23
general election, urged members of the army to be wary of reports
aimed at "sowing confusion within the ranks of the army and
creating distrust of the leadership", said the paper.
</P>
<P>
This came after claims surfaced that senior government
officials had bought a farm for Mosakeng at Ladybrand in South
Africa's Free State province.
</P>
<P>
The farm was allegedly bought with funds from the army's
secret security fund to which Mosakeng, Prime Minister Pakalitha
Mosisili and Foreign Minister Tom Thabane are the only
signatories.
</P>
<P>
In a circular read verbatim on state-owned Radio Lesotho,
Mosakeng admitted that the farm had been bought but said it was
for the army's "breeding purposes".
</P>
<P>
Mosakeng's move came a day after signs that the army was
beginning to sympathize with opposition parties which had staged
a three-week day and night vigil outside King Letsie III's
palace, demanding the dissolution of the government.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted observers as saying that Mosakeng, as head of
military intelligence, had been compromised by claims that he was
also involved in the electoral fraud.
</P>
<P>
The army's intelligence unit is said to have played a pivotal
role in arranging logistics for the election.
</P>
<P>
Aspects of these logistics, particularly the voters' roll,
have been found to have been manipulated.
</P>
<P>
A South African forensic company, OF&AMP;A, has said the voters'
roll was not a legit and accurate document and therefore would
fail as a control measure for a free and fair democratic
election.

<HEADLINE> Reserve Bank of India Acts to Check Fall of Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) took steps Thursday to check the free fall of the country's
currency, the rupee, and curb excessive speculation, including
hikes in the cash reserve ratio and in repo rates.
</P>
<P>
The measures included an increase in the cash reserve ratio
from 10 to 11 percent, a three percentage point rise in its daily
fixed repo rate and steps to curb speculation by importers,
according to press reports here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measures were taken at a time when the rupee had plunged to
a historical low of 43.7 against the U.S. dollar in mid-day trade
Wednesday, largely reacting to a slew of external factors as well
as statements by Commerce Minister R. K. Hegde that there was
further room for the rupee to weaken.
</P>
<P>
The RBI medicine had a prompt impact on the exchange markets
with the rupee recovering to 42.7 for a dollar before closing at
42.8 Thursday, an appreciation of 70 percent over Wednesday's
close.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Times reported Friday that the RBI package has
four distinct strains: sucking out liquidity from the money
market, bumping up the forward premia, discouraging speculation
and inducing further foreign exchange inflows.
</P>
<P>
Attempt to drain out the excess through the increase of cash
reserve ratio, which takes effect on August 29, is expected to
suck out liquidity of over 50 billion rupees (about 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This, combined with a three percentage point increase in repo
rates from 5 to 8 percent, is expected to push up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In terms of indirect measures, the RBI announced Thursday that
foreign institutional investors would be allowed to hedge 15
percent of their portfolio investment made before June 11.
</P>
<P>
The bank had earlier only allowed the investors to hedge their
incremental investments made after June 11.
</P>
<P>
The RBI hopes that this would induce foreign institutional
investors to start hedging their outstanding investments, meaning
that they would want to buy dollars forward at current prices to
avoid taking a depreciation hit when they liquidate investments at
a later date.
</P>
<P>
However, market players are skeptical about the efficacy of the
move, given that foreign institutional investors find present
levels of premia unattractive.

ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of angry Afghans
took to the streets in southern Afghanistan on Friday morning to
protest against U.S. missile attack on their country, the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bazaars and shops in the Taliban's southern stronghold of
Kandahar remained closed in protest, Taliban sources were quoted
by the APP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators chanted slogans against the United States.
The people started gathering at Eidgah Chowk in the heart of the
town and later marched through the streets carrying banners and
Taliban flags.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators ended their march at the starting point of
Eidgah Chowk where a big public meeting was held. The speakers at
the meeting strongly condemned the missile attack on Afghan
territory. They vowed that no power on earth could force them to
hand over Osama bin Laden to the United States. They demanded that
the United Nations ensure that such attacks do not happen again.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in Tokyo
Friday on reports that medium-sized trading house Okura and Co. filed
for bankruptcy due to financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 93.21 points, or 0.61
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 15,298.20.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 5.16 points or 0.44 percent to 1,176.51.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went slightly up to an estimated 360
million shares from Thursday's 352.08 million shares.
</P>
<P>
The overall decline was minimized in part by a surge in banking
shares following news reports that the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
(LTCB) will restructure itself ahead of a "bailout merger" with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.
</P>
<P>
LTCB was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Okura, a Tokyo-based trading house specializing in steel products
and machinery, became the fourth company listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange to file for bankruptcy this year.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, steel shares plunged and firms with close ties to
Okura weakened.
</P>
<P>
But the overall downslide in stocks was apparently limited by
bargain-hungry public fund managers as the Nikkei drifted between
15,226.62 and 15,416.88, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,335 issues listed on the First Section, losers surpassed
gainers 672 to 396, with 213 issues remaining unchanged.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Bill Clinton suddenly interrupted on Thursday the national
serial drama consecrated to the examination of his ``inappropriate''
adventures with Monica Lewinsky and put on the helmet of the
Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces ``in a war against
terrorism.'' Speaking at the hall of the press near his vacational
site of Martha's Vineyard, and then more solemnly on the television
after his return to Washington on Thursday, Clinton said that the
United States has operated the strikes against ``terrorist'' targets
in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton announced from his vacational
sites military intervention against Afghanistan and Sudan before his
return to Washington on Thursday. The United States Secretary of
Defense William Cohen estimated that more attacks are ``necessary.''
The attacks were launched with cruise missiles by the U.S. warships,
said U.S. military sources.
</P>
<P>
-- As the crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo has become
internationalized, France Thursday relaunched the idea of holding an

CAIRO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The net profits of Lebanon's biggest bank Banque

in the second quarter of this year from 9 million dollars in the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to BLC's balance sheet released Wednesday, the

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Friday expressed
"indignation" over U.S. overnight missile attacks on alleged
terrorist facilities in Pakistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces Thursday night attacked with cruise missiles
six sites in Afghanistan, located close to the Pakistani border,
which are believed to be the hideouts of anti-American Saudi
millionaire Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said in a statement read in the
senate that he was not aware of any violation of his country's
airspace. However, "it is being investigated."
</P>
<P>
"Although the cruise missiles fly very low, so far the
government is not aware of any violation, " he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the attack on the sovereign Muslim state of Afghanistan
is a serious matter. "The attack of cruise missiles resulted in
loss of innocent lives, which is a cause of serious concern for
us."
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan, he said, "expresses its indignation
over the attacks" no matter what justifications are given.
</P>
<P>
"The people of Pakistan are justifiably outraged over the act,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, reiterating Pakistan's stance over
international terrorism, said, "Pakistan is against terrorism. It
has been a victim of terrorism including state-sponsored
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He said like in the past Pakistan will continue to support the
cause of fighting international terrorism.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
overnight in south Lebanon by a Lebanese guerrillas roadside bomb,
the National Broadcast Network radio reported Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb set off when the two Israelis in
their car passed at Golea Shqif village in the edge of the Israeli
occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The deadly blast brought to 12 the number of the Israelis
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 76
others were wounded during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Another radio report said the attack was carried out by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
The new fatalities came one day after Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani threatened to strike Lebanon's
infrastructure facilities each time an Israeli soldier was killed
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that could force the Lebanese government to deploy army
on the borders to maintain security and prevent guerrillas from
using the south as a base to attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
He issued the warnings after one Israeli soldier was killed
and four others wounded also at Soujod by the roadside bomb on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Hezbollah has been fighting against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Reopen Aquino-Galman Double Murder Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Joseph Estrada administration
Friday expressed willingness to reopen the Aquino-Galman double
murder case if a crony of the late President Ferdinand Marcos can
provide new evidence to the case.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, presidential spokesman Fernando Barican
told reporters that it has been the judicial practice not only in
the Philippines but in other countries that cases are reopened
whenever new evidence providing a new twist is presented.
</P>
<P>
Opposition senators Benigno Aquino and Rolando Galman were
killed on August 21, 1983, at Manila International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The assassination and disgruntlement against the government led
to a popular revolt in February 1983, in which the then President
Marcos was unseated and went into exile in the United States.
Aquino's wife, Corazon Aquino, succeeded Marcos as the president.
</P>
<P>
Marcos' crony, former Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces
General Fabian Ver, has reportedly applied for approval to return
to the Philippines and agreed to tell the truth about Aquino's
death.
</P>
<P>
"If there are new facts... then the Philippine government will
do that at the appropriate time," Barican said, responding to
queries on the possible reopening of the case.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada had already said his administration
will not block Ver from returning to the country, but added that
Ver will have to face the criminal charges filed against him.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, some local government officials gathered here
to mark the 15th death anniversary of Senator Aquino.

in Senen, Central Jakarta, Friday.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began at 9:15 a.m. and was put out by the

gathering details about material losses," Kenari village head
Sukarna told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fire victims will temporarily be sheltered in a nearby building
owned by the Betawi Consultative Board and in the village
administration building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another fire broke out at 6 a.m. at a timber company
in East Jakarta, burning hundreds of cubic meters of timber.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lowers Cash Ratio, Targeting High Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
has decided to reduce the average monthly cash ratio deposits by
financial institutions from 14 percent to 13 percent with
effective from September 1.
</P>
<P>
The reduction aimed at lowering current high interest rates
charged by the financial bodies, according to a CBK circular to
commercial banks and non-bank financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The circular also announced that the daily minimum cash ratio
deposits has equally been lowered to 10 percent from 11 percent
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the government is reducing the cash
ratio since the 1998/99 (July/June) budget was announced on June
11. Prior to the budget reading, the ratio stood at 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The move also comes as part of the governmental efforts to
bring down prevailing high interest rates which tends to stifle
private sector borrowing and investment, analysts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates have been blamed on heavy government
borrowing in recent years through the use of the Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has since June announced a series of
measures to curb the interest rates and restructure the huge
domestic debt, including the introduction of a two-year floating
rate bond and the reduction of cash ratios.

<HEADLINE> Community Service Center Serves Senior Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Retired doctors Li Suqing and
Huang Yunliang recently expressed delight with the unexpectedly
high quality of services and facilities offered by the Sunshine
Project, a new apartment complex for the aged.
</P>
<P>
The Community Service Center in Beijing's Dongcheng District
invited 500 elderly citizens, including Li and Huang, to spend a
week at the facility prior to the formal opening.
</P>
<P>
The center offers air conditioned apartments with
well-appointed bathrooms and other essential facilities, as well
as ample lighting.
</P>
<P>
Ren Aijun, an official with the Dongcheng District Civil
Affairs Bureau, said the center will open formally after all
invited guests have completed their one week visit.
</P>
<P>
Senior citizens are welcome to apply for apartments regardless
of how long they plan to live in the facility, said Ren.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for two years ago show that senior citizens aged 60
and above accounted for 13.13 percent of Beijing's total
population, with 272 homes for the aged in place by the end of
last year, according to today's edition of China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of beds and other facilities in local homes for
senior citizens constitutes a major problem for fulfilling the
different needs of senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Sunshine Project enables elderly people to select
entertainment programs and find friends with similar
interests. The center offers chess and card rooms, calligraphy and
painting programs, a rehabilitation center and a school for senior
citizens.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Backs U.S. Attacks on Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has expressed his strong support for the U.S. actions on
Thursday night against terrorists in both Afghanistan and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office Friday
morning said that as a regular victim of terrorism, Uganda
supports U.S. warplanes' operations and expresses gratification
at American attacks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright informed Museveni
of their actions in a telephone talk Thursday night, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
But it did not say the call was before or after U.S. planes
attacked their targets in Khartoum and a terrorist site 94 miles
(150 kms) south of the Afghanistan capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
She told Museveni those sites accommodated factories that make
explosives with which the terrorists make bombs and it is those
bombs that they use to carry out criminal and terrorist attacks
like the recent ones in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said Uganda does not have diplomatic relations with
Sudan because of its terrorist behavior. He accuses Khartoum of
backing rebels of Lord's Resistance Army to fight against his
administration and to kill and abduct civilians.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes, carried out at 8:30 p.m. East African
Standard Time, were approved by U.S. President Bill Clinton who
said he had compelling information to prove the terrorists are
behind the east African bombings on U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported that American citizens are divided over this
surprise attack. Some back Clinton's decision while many others
accuse him of putting U.S. citizens abroad at more risky
situation by these attacks and of using these attacks to divert
attention away from his sex scandal.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Man Identified in Nairobi, Two More Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The man who hurled a grenade at
security guards at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi seconds before the
deadly bomb exploded on August 7 has been positively identified
as two more people arrested, Kenya's national newspapers said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mohammed, a suspect held by the Kenyan-U.S. joint probe
team following the bomb raid, was picked out by three of eight
witnesses Thursday, according to a report from the Daily Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report said it now appears that only two suicide bombers
died in the blast, compared with earlier reports that all the
three bombers who drove to the embassy died.
</P>
<P>
"The man who was positively identified was slightly injured by
the August 7 blast but he escaped with minor wounds which have
healed. This is the man who jumped from the pick-up at the
parking bay of the embassy, hurled a grenade at the guards before
the bomb exploded," the report quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
It said Khalid, who can not speak English or Kiswahili but
only Arabic, was identified by a guard and a civilian worker at
the embassy and a third witness. The witnesses also sustained
injuries from flying objects.
</P>
<P>
Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Louis Freech is expected to issue a statement about the bombing
probe before he leaves Nairobi for Washington at noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
He came here Thursday evening after a one-day visit to
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the investigators also raided offices of Mercy
Relief International Agency, a non-governmental organization, in
the Kenyan capital Thursday and arrested an Arab and a Sudanese,
the East African Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said the plan to bomb U.S. embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania took three months to complete and bombers destined
for Kenya were dispatched through Somali and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A senior government official who saw the confessions of
suspects was quoted by local media Friday as saying that an
Egyptian Islamic Jihad group, linked with Saudi millionaire Osama
Bin Laden, who now lives in Afghanistan, planned the attacks.
</P>
<P>
The car bomb attack at the u.s. embassy in Nairobi reportedly
killed 253 people and injured some 5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
A nearly simultaneous car bombing outside the U.S. embassy in
tanzania killed 10 people and wounded about 70 others.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Thursday ordered air raids on
terror facilities allegedly used by Laden in Afghanistan and
Sudan in a clear revenge attack for the bombings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S.'s demand for Laden's extradition from
Afghanistan has been refused by the Taliban government.

<HEADLINE> Experts on China's Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Coal will occupy a major part of
China's energy early next century, but its importance will begin
to decline, and by 2050, China will have various energy sources in
coal, petroleum, natural gas, and nuclear and solar energy,
according to Xie Heping, president of China Mining University.
</P>
<P>
Xie told the China Association for Science and Technology's 3rd
Academic Conference of Young Scientists here today that coal's
dominant position in China's energy structure can not be changed
for a long time because of the low level of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts predict that coal will account for 65 percent of
China's total energy consumption in 2010, compared with the
present 75 percent. Petroleum will increase from 17 percent to
18.7 percent, natural gas, from 2 percent to 5.6 percent, and
hydroelectric and nuclear power, from 6 percent to 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Xie says that when China is more economically and
scientifically developed in the mid-21st century, it will reduce
the use of coal and petroleum, which are non-renewable sources.
</P>
<P>
He estimates that coal will account for 50 percent of China's
energy in 2050 and the use of petroleum will also decrease.
</P>
<P>
When China's per capita GDP reaches the level of developed
countries in the middle part of the next century, people will pay
more attention to the quality of life and the environment, and
China will develop more efficient and clean energy, Xie says.
</P>
<P>
But, he points out, China's current science and technology
level in the energy sector is still quite low, and environmental
problems caused by coal have been an important factor in China's
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He says that China needs to develop energy-saving technology
and products and to increase their use, improve the energy
structure, introduce advanced technology from foreign countries to
develop natural gas, and focus on renewable energy sources like
solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal energy.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Wheat Production Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Shortfall in Kenya's wheat
production stands at 300,000 tons currently, Minister for
Research and Technology Andrew Kiptoon has said.
</P>
<P>
The east African state's total demand for wheat stands at
600,000 tons, which could not be met following a drop in the size
of wheat planting acreage from 150,000 hectares to 135,000, he
was quoted by Friday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister told farmers and agricultural researchers at
Njoro, central Kenya, that the reduction was due to a shift by
wheat farmers to other crops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged more land especially in marginal areas to
be re-opened up for wheat growing.
</P>
<P>
With 80 percent of the country arid or semi arid, there is
need to intensify food production in potential land, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kiptoon noted measures should be taken to ease the constraints
facing small-scale wheat farmers who have limited resources to
improve production and are yet to acquire technology.
</P>
<P>
He described agricultural research as the driving force in
achieving sustainable agricultural growth but regretted that only
0.4 per cent of Kenya's gross domestic product goes to research.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Group Vows to Hit Back at U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- One of the militant groups hit
by U.S. missiles inside Afghanistan has vowed to retaliate against
the U.S. attacks on its base in Khost province of Afghanistan,
which it said is in fact a training camp for the Kashmiri
Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Harkat ul Mujahideen, Fazal-ur-Rahman Khalil, whose
organization has close links with Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
announced Friday that his organization would respond to the U.S.
"naked aggression" against Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the camp provided training to Kashmiri Mujahideen (holy
fighters) who were fighting for freedom in Indian-occupied
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Now it is our turn to give a tit-for-tat response to Americans
for killing innocent people in Afghanistan," Khalil said in a
telephone interview with the News Network International.
</P>
<P>
He said Karkat ul Mujahideen would not remain silent over the
brutal attack and would take revenge on the killings. "The
Americans should know that Osama bin Laden is not alone and every
Afghan and Kashmiri will emerge as Osama," he added.
</P>
<P>
Khalil said Harkat ul Mujahideen leaders have started
consultations to give a befitting response to the U.S. attack and
teach a lesson to the Americans for targeting innocent people.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Aims to Post Balanced Budget by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Joseph Estrada administration
is confident of achieving a balanced budget, if not a surplus, by
the year 2000 despite fiscal constraints caused by the Asian
financial crisis, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a report to President Estrada, Diokno said the government
aims to reduce its budget deficit from the estimated 40 billion
pesos (930 million U.S. dollars) this year to 17.9 billion pesos
(416 million dollars) next year.
</P>
<P>
"The progressive reduction may even translate to a budget
surplus by the year 2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government earlier projected a 70 billion-peso
(1.63 billion dollars) budget deficit this year, prompting the
president to enforce a series of austerity measures that are
expected to bring down the deficit to 40 billion pesos (about 1
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the national government will register
a budget deficit during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration is due to submit its 1999 budget
plan to the congress on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Diokno, the largest share of the 579.5
billion-peso (13.5 billion dollars) budget proposal will be
allotted to social services including education, health, poverty
reduction and housing reforms as Estrada promised in the May
presidential elections.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 21 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin left
here Friday for northern Russia to watch a major naval exercise
while deputies in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
prepared to debate the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was heading for Severomorsk in Murmansk Region for the
exercise of the Northern Fleet in the Barents Sea that will involve 50
warships, including the state-of-the-art Peter the Great
nuclear-powered missile cruiser.

since Monday, might make a statement on the issue upon arrival at
the Murmansk airport, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

<HEADLINE> Bankruptcies, Liquidations in NZ Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Bankruptcies and liquidations
in New Zealand are rising sharply, according to the latest data
released by the Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
In the year to June, 2,974 people were declared bankrupt, up 21
percent from a year earlier while 1,074 companies were liquidated,
a 48-percent increase.
</P>
<P>
The rise in bankruptcies was caused by an increase in consumer
bankruptcies, with people getting into debt through personal
spending rather than business-related spending.
</P>
<P>
Consumer bankruptcies were up 42 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's insolvency service manager, Andrew Bridgman,
said the reason could be people getting into trouble with their
credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
Of the bankruptcies, 63 percent were at the request of the
debtor, a proportion that was also rising.
</P>
<P>
Bridgman said people were less shy about using the bankruptcy
option.
</P>
<P>
A crackdown on companies not paying their tax bills was the
main cause of increased liquidations, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year to June 1997, only 43 percent of liquidations were
triggered by the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), but in the
following 12 months, the IRD petitioned for 63 percent.

strengthened its ties with non-governmental organizations (NGOs)

LOS ANGELES, August 20 (Xinhua) -- While global chip sales
decreased in recent months, revenue of the worldwide networking
industry gained a big increase in the second quarter, according to
a U.S. market analysis firm's report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The industry, driven by the local area network (LAN) switch
market, earned 2.1 billion U.S. dollars during the period, up 78
percent from the second quarter a year ago, said Dataquest Inc.
</P>
<P>
LAN is a communications network that serves users within a
confined geographical area. It is made up of servers,
workstations, a network operating system and a communications link.
</P>
<P>
According to Dataquest's preliminary statistics, revenues of
LAN switches, routers and shared media hubs reached 4.1 billion
dollars, up 27.8 percent from the second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The switch market has been driven by the demand for more
efficient use of bandwidth, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
Cisco Systems, a leading U.S. supplier of network switching
systems, continued to lead the LAN market, which grew by 168
percent in the second quarter, and Cisco's own share of this
market surpassed 40 percent.

<P>
Meanwhile, the embassy and its neighbor, the British High
Commission, both located on the Parliament Avenue, are still

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Party to Protest Against U.S. Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A major Pakistani party,
Jammat-i-Islami, has decided to observe a protest day on Friday
all over the country against U.S. military attacks on Afghanistan
and Sudan Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision in a statement here Thursday night,
Secretary General of Jammat-i-Islami Munawar Hussain also accused
the Untied States of "promoting terrorism around the world."
</P>
<P>
To protest against the U.S. attacks, a large number of
Jammat-i-Islami workers staged a procession here late Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, head of the party Qazi Hussain has urged all the
independent nations of the world to adopt a unanimous course of
action against Washington for its attacks which Qazi termed as
"clear violation of the international norms and human values."
</P>
<P>
Condemning the United States for its attacks on Afghanistan and
Sudan, Qazi said, "This naked aggression has endangered the
security and sovereignty of all the independent nations of the
world."
</P>
<P>
"This is a cowardly act in a sense that there is no
justification for destroying the civilian population of the two
countries even if Osama bin Laden was guilty of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Thirteen days after the deadly U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania, the U.S. forces retaliated by attacking alleged
terrorist camps in Afghanistan and a chemical plant in Sudan
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
At 22:00 P.M. local time, six sites were hit in Afghanistan,
located about 150 kilometers south of the Afghan capital of Kabul
near the border with Pakistan in a bid to eliminate Saudi
dissident Osama who was allegedly involved in the embassy bombings
earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were killed
overnight in south Lebanon by a Lebanese guerrillas roadside bomb,
the National Broadcast Network radio reported Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The remote-controlled bomb set off when the two Israelis in
their car passed at Soujod village, an Israeli post in the
eastern sector of its occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There has been no group claiming responsibility for the
attack, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The deadly blast brought to 12 the number of the Israelis
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 76
others were wounded during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The new fatalities came one day after Israeli Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani threatened to strike Lebanon's
infrastructure facilities each time an Israeli soldier was killed
in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that could force the Lebanese government to deploy army
on the borders to maintain security and prevent guerrillas from
using the south as a base to attack Israel.
</P>
<P>
He issued the warnings after one Israeli soldier was killed
and four others wounded also at Soujod by the roadside bomb on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its north from
cross-border attack by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Passenger Plane Forced-Lands at Bangladeshi Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A Qatar Airlines plane with 232
passengers and crew on board made an emergency landing at the Zia
International Airport here Thursday, causing the suspension of all
flight operations for 11 hours, press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers and crew members came out of the damaged
aircraft safely through the emergency chutes and all domestic and
international flights were delayed while incoming flights were
diverted to other destinations.
</P>
<P>
The Doha, Qatar-bound Airbus-300, flight No. QTR-345, with 222
passengers including eight children and 10 crew members narrowly
escaped a major accident as its rear wheels caught fire before
takeoff at 7 a.m. local time. Three passengers were hurt during
the emergency exit from the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one international flights of different airlines and 10
domestic flights of the Bangladesh Biman were postponed due to the
accident. The airport resumed normal flight operation at about
6:30 p.m. after the plane was removed from the runway.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority has formed a five-member committee
headed by B.K. Biswas, deputy director of the Aircraft Engineering
Department of the Bangladesh Biman, to investigate the accident.
</P>
<P>
The mishap took place after the plane suffered a bird-strike to
its engine when it was preparing for the takeoff.
</P>
<P>
The pilot implemented the engine shut-down procedures and
applied emergency brakes which resulted in overheating in its
undercarriage, according to the reports. Eight wheels at the rear
were badly damaged, and the landing gears and some other parts of
the aircraft were also damaged by the fire, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar Airlines was making arrangements to fly the passengers,
mostly Bangladeshis, to Doha and the Airbus would be repaired in a
few days, the reports added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel has expressed its
support for the U.S. strike on "terrorist-related" bases in
Afghanistan and Sudan, saying it stood by Washington in its fight
against international terrorism, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by his office late Thursday night,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the
U.S. "particularly for choosing to hit the terror infrastructure
and terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also said he
supports U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of Defense
William Cohen for what he called "the courageous decision and
action against terrorist targets."
</P>
<P>
"The war against terrorism, wherever it may be, is never
ending and vital to ensure security and stability in the world,"
Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military forces launched surprise attacks Thursday against
several sites in Afghanistan and Sudan in an effort to destroy
what the U.S. said were key bases used by terrorists believed to
have been involved in the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa
early this month.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear whether the U.S. informed Israel of its
intention before the attack, but an Israeli newspaper, Haaretz,
reported Friday that Israel has provided the U.S. with
considerable information on the international infrastructure of
Islamic terrorism following the terror attacks on the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak declared that his party supports
the U.S. in its "determined and vigorous struggle against
terrorism," saying terrorism constitutes "a constant threat to the
stability of the enlightened world and to innocent civilians."

OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- German star Steffi Graf
surffered another defeat after her comeback Thursday when she was
beaten by Spain's Magui Serna 4-6, 4-6 in the third round of the
Canadian Open in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
The loss ruined an anticipated Graf-Jana Novotna
quarter-final. The Czech second seed advanced by trouncing
Italy's Silvia Farina 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Top seeded Martina Hingis of Switzerland reached the
quarter-finals after a 6-3, 6-0 win over Japan's Ai Sugiyama.
Hingis won an exciting, side-to-side 29-stroke rally.
</P>
<P>
Monica Seles, the three-time defending champion at the
Canadian Open, defeated Indonesian Yayuk Basuki 6-3, 6-3 and will
meet German Anke Huber in Friday's quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The 21st-ranked Huber, playing in her second tournament since
foot surgery in April, edged eighth-seeded Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa 7-5, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
"I just made so many mistakes on my backhand," Graf was quoted
as saying. "and I really didn't feel like I was getting into the
match.
</P>
<P>
"I do have to say that she served really well and made very
few mistakes."
</P>
<P>
Graf was obviously shaken by her erratic and uninspired play.
</P>
<P>
She has won only four matches at three tournaments over the
past four weeks. That concern was likely the reason she has
accepted a wild card into the WTA Tour tournament in New Haven,
Connecticut, starting next Monday. reports said.
</P>
<P>
Seles was able to outhit Basuki from the baseline and now she
will meet Huber, whom she beat in the Canadian Open final in
Toronto a year ago. She holds an 8-0 career head-to-head
advantage on Huber and has never lost a set.
</P>
<P>
Hingis next meets the winner of ninth-seeded Irina Spirlea of
Romania and 14th-seeded Sandrine Testud of France. That match was
postponed by rain at 6-6 in the first set.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Semiconductor Industry Urges Y2K Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The semiconductor industry
of the United States Thursday called on President Bill Clinton and
Congress to support an act that will enable U.S. companies to
share information about solutions for the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the president and Congress, the Semiconductor
Industry Association (SIA), acting on behalf of the nation's
large chip manufacturers, urged quick passage of the "Year 2000
Readiness Disclosure Act," authored by representatives David
Dreier and Anna Eshoo.
</P>
<P>
The Dreier-Eshoo bill encourages companies to exchange Y2K
information without fear that the information will subsequently be
used against them as evidence in civil suits.
</P>
<P>
"With only 500 days left before the onset of the Y2K
phenomenon, the time for congressional action on this issue is
now," said the letter from the SIA based in California's Silicon
Valley and more than 50 other major business groups.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the bill, which the SIA described as "Good
Samaritan," presents "the most effective approach to encourage
voluntary disclosure and will result in meaningful and necessary
information exchange."
</P>
<P>
In addition to urging quick passage of the bill, the SIA and
other business associations want Congress to address the broader
liability consequences of the Y2K problem. "The Congress also must
address the liability issues of Y2K to ensure a fair and equitable
resolution of any problems that surface after the year 2000," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The Year 2000 problem affects computer software that uses two
digits to represent the year in software date fields. When the
year 2000 arrives, these computer systems could interpret the year
as 1900. Considering its consequences and possible lawsuits, some
business leaders have called it not just a technical issue, but a
management issue, a political issue and a social issue.
</P>
<P>
"Even though the Year 2000 problem is primarily a software and
systems issue," the SIA letter said, "chip companies are doing
everything they can to address the problem in their own businesses
and on behalf of their customers."
</P>
<P>
At an online conference on the issue Wednesday, Dreier said
that he doesn't foresee the imminent passage of a bill to limit
companies' legal liability for problems caused by the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the bill, from the American Lawyers Association and
the Clinton administration, will hamper the bill's chances of getting
passed quickly, Dreier said.
</P>
<P>
"Some people out there are saying that the only thing that will
drive the solution to this problem is the threat of a lawsuit," he
said.

SOFIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Wider economic relations between
Ukraine and Bulgaria will constitute a basis for closer bilateral
cooperation, Ukrainian Ambassador Vyacheslav Pokhvalski told a
news conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pokhvalski said his country sees Bulgaria as a strategic
partner, especially after it joined the Central European Free
Trade Agreement and signed a free trade agreement with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
However, he said immense bilateral economic potentials have
remained untapped, adding that two-way trade, which now stands at
333 million U.S. dollars, can increase substantially.
</P>
<P>
He said his number one task is to place bilateral relations on
an economic basis.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of existing bilateral agreements is being

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Closely Watches Situation After US Strikes </HEADLINE>

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the region
has become very volatile after the U.S. air strikes to eliminate
Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden inside Afghanistan, The Nation
quoted a senior defense official as saying Friday.
The U.S. on Thursday launched military strikes against what it
said was a complex of terrorist facilities allegedly run by Saudi
exile Osama bin Laden about 150 kilometers south of the Afghan
capital of Kabul close to the Pakistan border.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that the U.S. forces hit an Afghan town of
Khost Thursday night with Tomahawk cruise missile in a bid to
eliminate Laden who was allegedly involved in the bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Polish Financial Market Troubled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Polish financial market has
suffered a series of turmoils in the wake of a drastic devaluation
of the Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
The Polish zloty fell 2.05 percent Thursday against the
U.S. dollar to a record low of 3.6 to the dollar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the zloty dropped one percent in the exchange rate
against the dollar on August 17, which was followed by another
wave of depreciation of 2.04 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic depreciation of the zloty, which remained sound in
the past few months, shocked Polish economists and triggered panic.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that foreign investors had withdrawn their
investments from Poland for fear the financial crisis in Russia
might affect eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the inflow of investment in the first half of the
year from Asian countries, foreign investment in Poland rose by
nearly three billion U.S. dollars to 26.5 billion U.S. dollars,
nine percent of which turned bad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, foreign investors have been selling off
Polish treasury bonds and negotiable securities and then buying
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have reportedly withdrawn a total of nearly
one billion dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
Recent days have also seen a tumbling stock market. Stock
prices for 97 listed companies fell on August 17 while 105
companies suffered Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Strives to Keep Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kazakh financial market has
remained stable despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis
and the collapsing Russian banking market.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year Kazakhstan's balance of payments
were 280 million U.S. dollars in the red due to shrinking east
Asian markets and investment.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation of the Russian ruble also triggered fluctuation
in the financial market. By August 1, the Kazakh zenge had lost
2.25 percent of its value, settling at 78 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, because Kazakhstan has long been independent of the
Russian financial system and the ruble makes up only seven percent
of the foreign trade settlement, the Kazakh financial market on
the whole is free of turbulence and under control.
</P>
<P>
On August 19, the Kazakh government and the state bank issued a
joint statement attributing the sound market to high gold and
foreign currency reserves and the low rate of foreign capital in
its stock market.
</P>
<P>
The state bank has a total of two billion dollars in gold and
currency reserves, which is 40 times the foreign investment in the
stock market and more than enough to ensure a healthy money supply.
</P>
<P>
The economy is largely self-reliant and depends little on
foreign loans. Its annual repayment of foreign and domestic debt
accounts for only nine percent of the national budget.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government this year has taken a series of measures
to counter the fallout of the Asian and Russian financial crises
and achieve stable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The government has reduced transportation fees for mineral and
finished products, lowered tariffs and prices for some imported
commodities and abolished the double value-added taxation imposed
on products made by other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The government has also carried out a stringent budget by
slashing the size of the civil service and freezing investment on
some non-essential projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, to further protect the zenge, the state bank has
adopted the floating exchange rate and raised the discount rates,
the interest rate on loans and the securities buy-back interest
rate.

<HEADLINE> Polish President Signs Law on College Students Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski signed a law Wednesday requiring commercial banks to
provide low-interest loans to college students starting from
October 1, the new school year.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, college students with Polish nationality,
under the age of 25, are entitled to the loans for no more than
six years.
</P>
<P>
The National Education Ministry estimated that each student can
borrow 600 zloty(171.4 U.S. dollars) per month, with a total not
to exceed six times of the average pay of employees in the sectors
of national economy, at an interest rate lower than that of
commercial bank's
discount rate loans.
</P>
<P>
Students in public colleges, private colleges, evening schools
and correspondence schools all can apply for the loans, but have to
begin repayment in the first year after their graduation.
</P>
<P>
Loans will not be available to those who repeat class, drop
out or being expelled from school, but will be totally or
partially remitted for those from poor families or making high
grades.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh Takes up Fight Against Dengue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Phnom Penh health and
municipal authorities Friday began to mobilize the citizens to get
a thorough cleaning to prevent the dengue fever which is spreading
rapidly in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sophara, Phnom Penh's first deputy governor, and Health
Minister Chhea Thang will be among thousands of other Phnom Penh
citizens to clean up the environment.
</P>
<P>
The plan is to get city residents to fill in holes, cover water
jars and dispose of garbage around their homes that could collect
water and become breeding sites for mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
The Dengue fever is a disease spread by the bite of the "Tiger"
mosquito. The most effective way to prevent it is to keep areas
outside homes clean and destroy mosquito breeding sites.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is part of an internationally organized effort to
fight a dengue fever epidemic.
</P>
<P>
About 8,700 children have been admitted to hospitals and more
than two hundred have died since an outbreak in January, a Health
Ministry official told Xinhua Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The number could rise to more than 15,000 by the end of
this year's rain season, making it the worst dengue epidemic in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
So far the worst-hi areas are Phnom Penh, and Kandal, Takeo,
Battambang and Kampong Cham provinces.

<HEADLINE> Armed Group Members Surrender in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22 members of anti-
government armed groups laid down their arms to the government
last month, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The armed group members, which include those from the ethnic
Kayin National Union (KNU) and the All Burma Students' Democratic
Front (ABSDF), "exchanged arms for peace" with the government at
different military command areas between July 1 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Both the KNU and the ABSDF have been reportedly operating on
the Myanmar-Thai border in armed opposition to the Myanmar
government.
</P>
<P>
In April, former KNU Central Committee member Phado Aung San
crossed over to the government side with more than 200 of his men
in Hpa-an, the country's Kayin State, as part of KNU's surrender.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, a total of 17 anti-government ethnic armed groups in
the country have made peace with the government, leaving the KNU,
led by Bo Mya, still in insurgency on the Myanmar-Thai border
although four rounds of peace talks have been held between them.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Expatriate Workers Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of Sri Lanka's new
expatriate workers in the first half this year was over 70,600, 10
percent more than the corresponding period last year, Labor
Ministry officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A record foreign exchange remittance of 1.08 billion U.S.
dollars has been sent by expatriate Sri Lankans in 1997 compared
to 770 million dollars in 1996. This year the amount is expected
to increase to 1.2 billion dollars, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Around 1.05 million Sri Lankans are employed abroad, most of
them working as housemaids in the Middle East countries such as
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman and the United
Arab Emirates while others are employed in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
As they bring in such a large amount of foreign exchange, the
government has launched welfare schemes for them, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly the Peoples Banks in collaboration with the Bureau
of Foreign Employment has commenced a loan scheme for expatriates
to either build a house or set up business.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Foreign Employment plans to provide overseas
employment opportunities for some 1.2 million Sri Lankans by the
year 2,000.

<HEADLINE> Looking After China's Flood Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Civil
Affairs has told people to give money and goods to local civil
affairs or other departments that are approved for receiving
donations.
</P>
<P>
In a circular made public Thursday, the ministry said that
money and clothes can also be given directly to civil affairs
departments in flooded areas, or donations made to the Ministry of
Civil Affairs and China Charity Federation.
</P>
<P>
Post offices will send such donations free of charge, along
with a letter of thanks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign governments and individual donors can send their money
and goods to the Red Cross Society of China, the Civil Affairs
Ministry of China or to Chinese embassies and consulates in their
own countries,
 The circular asked people not to take part in other donation
activities held under the pretence of providing flood relief, and
not to be fooled by these.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, China Youth Daily reports that some
people have used donation hotlines to disrupt the normal process
of donations and some people have put donation boxes on the
streets to cheat donors out of their money.

<HEADLINE> Grenade Attack Kills One in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A 45-year old driver for
Kyodo News Serves was killed in a grenade attack Thursday night
outside the Cambodian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The incident shattered the relatively peaceful post-election
calm and raised the concerns about the future of the new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The attack followed a series of confrontations between police
and Sam Rainsy party supporters, who were attempting to sleep at
the Interior Ministry compound with election ballots, witnesses
said.
</P>
<P>
Sieng Sean, who had worked for Kyodo since the Untac era, was
struck by grenade shrapnel in the back of the head at about 2300
local time on Norodom Boulevard as he waited for his colleague to
return from interviewing Sam Rainsy, said police and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the attack, Sam Rainsy was detained inside
the compound for three hours, where he was preparing to sleep with
party members who were guarding ballots from the July 26 polls.
</P>
<P>
Several minutes after the explosion, witnesses said Interior
Ministry guards pointed their guns at Sam Rainsy -- who raised his
hands -- and fired one round near his feet.
</P>
<P>
"They threatened to kill us many times, I thought I was going
to be another Ho Sok tonight," Sam Rainsy said at about two
o'clock Friday as he was leaving the compound with UN escort. Ho
Sok was the Funcinpec general slain at the compound last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts suspected it was a deliberate political terrorism.
Government spokesman Khieu Kanharith said: "We suspect this might
be an attempt to stir trouble. But we assume nothing."
</P>
<P>
He said a complain would be filed with the municipal court
Friday because Sam Rainsy entered the ministry compound.
</P>
<P>
Sieng Sean was survived by his wife, a daughter and two sons.
</P>
<P>
"My father never had a quarrel with anyone. It was perhaps related
to politics. I was very shocked. I just had dinner with him this
evening," his son said sadly.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Reassert Control Over State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government will
reassert its control over businesses in which it has a
stakeholding in order to reclaim lost profits, it was announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Economy Leonid Mininh said the government
would increase its representation in its business interests so it
would have more influence in management.
</P>
<P>
The state holds shares in 6,500 companies which made a net
profit of three billion hryvnya (1.67 billion U.S. dollars) last
year, but only 20 million hryvnya (11.1 million dollars) was
turned over to the treasury, said Mininh.
</P>
<P>
Of the 6,500 businesses, the government held a controlling
interest in only 2,300 and posted representatives in just 1,318.
</P>
<P>
The government intended to increase the number of
representatives under a presidential mandate signed on July 4
concerning the management of state assets, added the
minister.

<HEADLINE> Ukranian Currency Depreciates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ukranian currency, the hryvnya,
is depreciating rapidly due to the sagging Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was traded at 2.1435 hryvnyas in cross-bank
transactions on August 14, rising to 2.236 on August 20. In the
past two days, some commercial banks even bought one U.S. dollar
with 2.25 hryvnyas.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the commercial banks, the National Bank of
Ukraine urged them to stop illegal purchase of foreign currencies
at a premium price.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor, Victor Yuchenko, said the exchange
rate of hryvnya against the dollar would probably break the
ceiling of the currency corridor -- 1.8-2.25 hryvnyas to the
dollar, which was jointly set by the government and the central
bank for this year.
</P>
<P>
Observers expect that Ukraine is likely to raise the ceiling of
the currency corridor as Russia did, which would accelerate the
hryvnya's fall and price rises.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Release Social Security Fund for Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Ministry of Thailand
is planning to release 10 billion baht (250 million U.S. dollars)
of its Social Security Fund to finance the costs of further
education and living for the jobless, the Nation newspaper said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Deputy Labor Minister Jongchai Thiangtham
as saying that the plan had the preliminary backing of Labor
Minister Trairong Suwankhiri, who will present it to the cabinet
for approval.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, which will draw its financing from the 53
billion baht (1.3 billion dollar) Social Security Fund, an
eligible unemployed person or laid-off worker could access 50,000
baht to 60,000 baht (1,250 to 1,500 dollars) in yearly loans or an
average of 5,000 baht (125 dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
The rate of interest for the loan is yet to be decided,
Jongchai said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the government released 5 billion baht (125 million
dollars) from the Social Security Fund in a bid to ease the
liquidity crunch plaguing medium and small-size businesses, via
loans extended through commercial banks and Small Industry Finance
Corporation bonds.
</P>
<P>
Jongchai said the ministry will also begin offering
psychological and labor counselling to white-collar workers who
have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Association of Thai Construction Industry president
Jaroon Janjamratsaeng predicted that if the government's recent
financial sector reform package fails to ease the liquidity crunch
of the construction sector, the lay-off figure of the industry
would rise to 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed people in Thailand had already exceeded 2 million,
or 7 percent of the total work force.

<HEADLINE> Catching Tax Evaders in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Enwei Pharmaceutical Factory, a
branch of Chengdu's Enwei Group, a leading producer of women's
hygiene products, will have to pay 54.8 million yuan (6.6 million
U.S. dollars) in overdue taxes and a fine of 6.48 million yuan for
bad tax practices.
</P>
<P>
The story has caught the attention of the Chinese press in the
past two months. It resulted from the company's overuse of tax
breaks for overseas-funded enterprises between 1994 and 1995. Its
overseas partner, a Hongkong investor, did not provide the
required investment until the end of 1995. Hongkong investors also
enjoy the preferential terms given to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The group will also have to pay overdue taxes of 46.74 million
yuan for the Enwei Shiheng Pharmaceutical Factory which was
registered in August 1990 but dissolved in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
Enwei Shiheng made the same mistake of asking for tax breaks
for a Sino-overseas joint venture, even after its overseas
partner, a Hongkong firm, withdrew 1.4 million of its 1.5 million
Hongkong dollars of investment one week after putting the money in
place.
</P>
<P>
A group spokesman says they will go along with the decision and
pay the overdue taxes and fine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese press has gone after the group in recent months,
accusing it of evading 100 million yuan in taxes in two years, to
which the group responded angrily, calling it exaggerated
reporting and saying it had adversely affected sales.

and in the next diminishes.

which totalled 1.216 billion dollars and a 9.8 percent increase in
the imports.
</P>
<P>
In this way, the trade deficit accumulated in the first seven
months of the year amounted to 1.629 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Capital Flight Surges Sharply in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- As a region-wide recession looms
over the horizon, hot funds that flew out of the Philippines
increased by 76 percent during the first six months this year.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that at
least 730 million pesos (16.9 million U.S. dollars) of investments
left the country during the period as against 414.1 million pesos
(9.6 million dollars) a year ago, Business World reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Painting an even more bleak picture, the vacuum left by
volatile portfolio investments are not being replaced by fresh
capital.
</P>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission reported that new
investments from new and existing companies took a 42.2-percent
dive to 48.21 billion pesos (1.12 billion dollars) in the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the data showed that there was only a 3.5 percent
increase in the number of companies which were forced to cease
operations to 59 from 57 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the research department of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the ongoing Asian financial crisis and the El
Nino weather phenomenon caused investors to temporarily stop
putting up new businesses in the country, in an attempt to cut
their losses during the slump.
</P>
<P>
The data also showed that the number of new business entities
which registered with the commission fell by 18.1 percent to only
9,309 from 11,367 in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Young Priests Help Keep Taoism Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Increasing numbers of young
well-trained Taoist priests are helping to boost the popularity of
the 1,800-year-old religion in China, today's China Daily quoted
Zhang Jiyu, deputy secretary-general of the China Taoist
Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remark when addressing the opening session of
the association's sixth national conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The problem of China's Taoist circles being dominated by older
people has existed for a long time.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the 1990s, the Taoist Theological Institute
of China and two training classes in Shanghai and Qingchengshan
Mountain, in southwest China's Sichuan Province, have trained more
than 400 Taoist priests. These priests form the backbone of Taoist
temples and associations across China.
</P>
<P>
However, the problem of a predominance of aged Taoist priests
still exists, said Ye Xiaowen, director of the State Bureau of
Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Ye suggested that local Taoist associations should organize
training courses for Taoist priests with the help of the China
Taoist Association.
</P>
<P>
China's Taoist temples, numbering more than 1,600, are in great
need of staff to look after them.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country has 133 local Taoist associations above
the county level and more than 25,000 Taoist priests, including
members of both the Quanzheng and Zhengyi sects.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Bankruptcy Court Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Thursday opened the first commercial court under the new
bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
The new bankruptcy law, which took effect Thursday, is expected
to filter out inefficient businesses in an attempt to create a
feeling of security without ignoring the rights of debtors, Antara
News Agency Friday quoted Justice Minister Muladi as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed at paving the way for a resolution of the
country's 64 billion U.S. dollars in corporate foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has been the hardest hit by the regional currency
turmoil with the rupiah (national currency) losing about 80
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar, making it virtually
impossible for companies to repay their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Under a previous bankruptcy law that dated back to 1905 during
the Dutch colonial times, creditors had little leverage over the
debtors. Because of the law, not even one company has declared
bankruptcy despite the fact that about 70 percent of Indonesian
companies are now technically insolvent due to the dramatic fall
of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The court and the new law are part of sweeping reforms the
Indonesian government has agreed to in exchange for the 43 billion
U.S. dollar bail-out package led by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
When opening the court, Muladi said, "This is a historic and
significant move. It will help us get rid of inefficient firms
which will in turn boost investor confidence in the country and
boost the economy."
</P>
<P>
The court will settle bankruptcy cases in public hearing,
allowing a maximum of 30 days from the time of filing for
settlement.
</P>
<P>
There is also a 30-day appeal period.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, creditors are allowed to send debtors into
bankruptcy nine months after they file a claim.
</P>
<P>
Fifty cases are ready to be filed with the newly established
commercial court, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Businessmen Want Technology from Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Thai businessmen urged the
government to force foreign companies to transfer technology and
management techniques to local firms as the country has
liberalized the Foreign Business Law, the Bangkok Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Khemadhat Sukondhasing, secretary-general of the Federation of
Thai Industries (FTI), was quoted as saying that the FTI wants
foreign firms to agree to its proposals regarding the number of
local staff employed by the companies.
</P>
<P>
The FTI suggests that during the first three years of
operation, some 80 percent of the middle-level management of
foreign-owned businesses would be Thais.
</P>
<P>
It also wants at least 40 percent of executives to be Thais
during the first five years.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet Tuesday approved an amendment to the Foreign
Business Law, under which restrictions governing foreign ownership
and participation in 33 industries are to be eased.
</P>
<P>
The FTI will present its proposal next week to a committee
drafting the amendment set by the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Khemadhat said the technology transfer proposal would benefit
Thai people in the long-term.

BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- A telephone survey in Beijing
found that more than 88 percent of the city's citizens have
donated money or goods for flood-hit parts of China and 100

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Rafter Beaten in Pilot Pen Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- American Pete Sampras and
Australian Patrick Rafter, who were bidding to gain the top place
in the world rankings, surprisingly lost to little-known rivals
at the Pilot Pen tennis tournament in Connecticut, the United S
tates Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, trying to regain his number one ranking, came out
flat against Indian qualifier Leander Paes and lost 6-3, 6-4 in
74 minutes. At the same time, Rafter, No. 3 and second seed here,
fell to No. 16 Guillaume Raoux of France 7-6 (10-8), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Sampras lost to Rafter in three intense sets Sunday in the
final of the ATP championship in Cincinnati and the players
eagerly spoke of a rematch.
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was coming in a lot and would be frustrating to
play," Sampras said after losing to the 100th-ranked Paes. "He
played well but I felt I was very flat. I think playing three
weeks in a row has taken its toll a little bit emotionally. I
give him credit."
</P>
<P>
Sampras can end Marcelo Rios' latest reign as the No.1 player
if the Chilean loses Thursday night at the RCA championship in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
The rankings, released next Monday, most likely will be the
basis for seedings for the U.S. Open in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The second-seeded Rafter had a chance to grab the top spot but
succumbed to Raoux, whom he had beaten last week.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't moving well today," said Rafter, who had a
career-best 11-match winning streak stopped. "Everything seemed a
lot quicker, the ball was flying. I was a little bit flat
mentally."
</P>
<P>
Five of the remaining seeds advanced to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands dispatched
Israeli Harel Levy 6-2, 6-4, and sixth seed Tim Henman of Britain
rallied past Italian Davide Sanguinetti 4-6, 6-3, 6-3.

<P>
KHARTOUM, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The Al-Shifa Pharmaceutical
Factory on the northern outskirt of Khartoum was leveled to the
ground in a U.S. bombing attack Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
A huge fire caused by the air strike was raging in the factory,
which is located just five kilometers away from the presidential
palace in downtown Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said at least 10 residents living near the factory
were seriously injured in the attack and their condition was very
serious. They were dying, the witnesses added.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that factory workers on the night shift
were all killed.
</P>
<P>
But police declined to give any information on casualty.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known how many workers were at the
factory when a U.S. bomber attacked.
</P>
<P>
Policemen and firefighters sealed off the site, keeping
reporters and residents, who gathered to see what was going on,
from entering the factory.
</P>
<P>
Nobody was allowed to take photos.
</P>
<P>
A witness said he heard thundering explosions just seconds
after he saw a plane flew over the roof of his house at about
19:30 local time.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought the plane must have crashed before he
arrived at the scene and saw a three-story building of the
factory was reduced to ruins and burning.
</P>
<P>
The factory was built in 1980s and it was the largest
pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, producing and processing
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the attack, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a
televised address that he ordered air strikes at what he called
"terrorist-related" bases in Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that the groups attacked by the U.S. forces Thursday
had played a key role in recent bombings on the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came a week after the United States ordered the
withdrawal of U.S. diplomats from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir condemned the
U.S. attack, describing it as "a provocation to the Sudanese
people."
</P>
<P>
Some Sudanese were reported to have taken over the evacuated
U.S. embassy compound after the bombing.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil may soon lift its
ban on United States wheat imports imposed two years ago to
prevent disease contamination of local crops.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Agriculture Minister Francisco Turra and U.S. Senator
Max Baucus met to discuss the purchase of U.S. wheat by Brazil,
Brazilian newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
"We want Brazil to open its market to our wheat," said Baucus,
adding that the U.S. had a big surplus of wheat which could be
exported to Brazil and the cereal had never threatened Brazilian
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Brazil stopped importing U.S. wheat in 1996, suspecting that
diseases affecting wheat plantations in the United States could
contaminate its grain.
</P>
<P>
Turra said that Brazil's wheat output is 2.7 million tons a
year, but the domestic wheat consumption is 8.5 million tons per
year.
</P>
<P>
Argentine and Canada also are Brazil's main wheat suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Public Debt nears 40 percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's public debt
reached 334.8 billion reals (some 291.13 billion U.S. dollars) at
the end of last may, accounting for 36.9 percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP), press reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Demosthenes Madureira De Pinho Neto, director of international
affairs of the central bank, said that the public sector liquid
debt could reach 40 percent of the GDP very soon.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank said that the internal debt began to skyrocket
in 1996, the second year of the government of President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso. By December of 1997, public debts had climbed to
308.4 billion reals, or 34.5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1995, the public sector internal debt stood at
208.5 billion reals, or some 33.3 percent of the GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government has
adopted a whole package of preventive measures in response to
Russia's worsening financial crisis and a devalued ruble,
Ukrainian Vice Minister of Economy Leonid Minin said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, he said it is not yet time to make all the documents
public as they may affect the country's relationship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The first measure to be taken, he said, is to "restrict the
circulation of the ruble."
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian businesses are advised to settle accounts with their
Russian trade partners in convertible currencies and to rewrite
their contracts with Russian firms immediately.
</P>
<P>
If the ruble continues to devalue drastically, Minin said,
Ukraine will have to introduce more thorough measures including
imposing restrictions on trade with Russia, which accounts for 40
percent of Ukraine's entire foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Since Ukraine has suffered considerably from the ruble
devaluation, it may have to request rescheduling of its debts with
Russia, which reportedly has topped 2 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Smallest Thermometer Developed in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A university research group in
Finland has developed the world's smallest thermometer, and it is
ready for commercial production, reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The thermometer, the first commercial application of
nanoelectronic technology, consists of a nanosensor about one
thousandth of a millimeter and electronic measuring equipment.
</P>
<P>
The sensor is a linear array of nanoscale metal islands
separated by thin oxide layers, forming a chain of junctions that
change with temperature in a unique way.
</P>
<P>
The extremely small size of the sensor opens up new
possibilities for applications, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The prototype of the nanothermometer was originally developed
in 1997 by Professor Jukka Pekola, who headed Jyvaskyla
University's nanophysics group.
</P>
<P>
Its commercial application was achieved by a doctoral student
in the group, Juha Kauppinen, who improved the design of the
sensor.
</P>
<P>
The physicists have established a company called Nanoway to
take charge of the production and the marketing of the
thermometer.

QUITO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Sluggish world oil and banana
market has decreased Ecuadoran exports for more than 16 percent in
the first half of this year, the country's Central Bank said in a
communique Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran export were down 429 million dollars in the first
half of this year to 2.166 billion U.S. dollars, from 2.595
billion in the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
the Central Bank attributed the decrease mainly to the weak
export of oil products which only reached 430.4 billion dollars in
the first semester down from 673.7 million dollars in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Banana sales also dropped this year, down from 690.4 million
dollars in 1997 to 596 million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The exports of cocoa, tuna fish, and natural flowers, among
other products, also suffered losses during the first half of this

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justifies Its Military Strikes at U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Thursday told the U.N. Security Council that its military strikes
against targets in Afghanistan and Sudan were conducted under
the United Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
The move is widely seen here as an apparent effort to head
off any U.N. actions.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Bill Richardson, U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations, said Washington had obtained
convincing information that the organization of Osama Bin Laden
was responsible for the August 7 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the Bin Laden organization maintained "an
extensive network of camps, support facilities in Sudan, which
have been and being used to mount terrorist attacks against
American targets."
</P>
<P>
"In particular, U.S. forces struck a facility being used to
produce chemical weapons in Sudan and terrorist training and
basing camps in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the attacks were conducted only after
"repeated efforts to convince the Government of Sudan and the
Taleban regime in Afghanistan to shut these terrorist
activities down and to cease their cooperation with the Bin
Laden organization."
</P>
<P>
"That organization has issued a series of blatant warnings
that 'strikes will continue from everywhere' against American
targets and we have convincing evidence that further such
attacks were in preparation from these same terrorist
facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States, therefore, had no choice but to use armed
force to prevent these attacks from continuing," Richardson added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, in a brief statement
issued by his spokesman's office, condemned terrorism in all its
forms and expressed his concern at the U.S. military strikes.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he had been informed by Washington minutes after
the strikes took place and awaited further details.

<P>
HANGZHOU, August 21 (Xinhua) -- More than 800 very old trees in
the city of Hangzhou in China's Zhejiang Province, which is known
for its West Lake, are getting government protection.
</P>
<P>
There are 60 species that are several hundred years old, and
the oldest, a gingko, is 1,400 years old.
</P>
<P>
Each of the trees has a stone tablet alongside it with the
tree's name, age, and health situation.
</P>
<P>
The city government has spent over 200,000 yuan (24,000
U.S. dollars) on the tablets and establishing files for each of
the trees since 1984, says a local official.
</P>
<P>
When the city built a new road this year, it had to include a
big detour to give way to two very old trees.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the city's green coverage rate is 44
percent, as a result of people's increased awareness of the need
for protection in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan President Faces Impeachment in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Several Paraguayan
political parties Thursday demanded an impeachment against
President Raul Cubas, for the release of General Lino Oviedo last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary sources said today that the resolution draft was
signed by the heads of the caucuses of the Colorado, Liberal, and
the National Encounter Social Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
The resolution accuses Cubas of inadequately discharging of his
duties, referring to the recent freeing of Oviedo, who had been
sentenced to 10 years in prison for attempting a coup against
former president Juan Carlos Wasmosy in April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cubas, who assumed the presidency last Saturday, ordered the
release of Oviedo, an action that provoked a political crisis in
his own party and in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
The motion calls for the punishment of Cubas and his Ministers
of Defense and Justice for exempting Oviedo by decree from serving
his 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
The decision of Cubas met with condemnation from the congress.

<HEADLINE> IOC Launches Plans to Catch Drug Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Olympic leaders in Lausanne on
Thursday announced multi-million dollar plans to catch drug
cheats around the world, reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Accordint to reports, Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC), said the idea for setting
up a new drug testing agency would be put to international sports
federations and Olympic chiefs at a key doping conference next
February.
</P>
<P>
The IOC presently carries out drug tests during the Olympic
Games but the responsibility for the more efficient out-of-
competition tests is presently in the hands of international
federations and national bodies.
</P>
<P>
The new agency would improve on the current system by putting
out-of-competition testing under one umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Not all countries and international federations carry out the
tests, which are much more efficient at catching athletes who use
serious drugs like steroids than competition tests.
</P>
<P>
The agency will be funded by the billions of dollars that the
IOC receives from television rights for the Games.
</P>
<P>
IOC marketing chief Dick Pound, who is responsible for the
financing of the project, said the IOC expected at least $40
million per year to be spent on the out-of-competion testing
alone.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's decision was taken after the IOC's executive board
meeting heard the depressing story of doping at this year's Tour
de France from leading race official Jean-Claude Killy.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was called after the Tour de France scandal and
high-profile positive tests in other leading Olympics sports like
swimming and athletics.

BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Municipal Government
decided recently to tear down all illegal signboards and

Among the first group of signboards to go last week were a

</P>
<P>
The number of signs on city streets and on medial strips have
gone down since early August. Some organizations or companies have
used improper places to put signposts, signboards and
advertisements without getting permission from government
departments. These signs have increased the risk of traffic jams
or accidents, a government official says, and some drivers have
complained that they obscure the traffic and roads.
</P>
<P>
Some shelters along streets will also be removed to improve the
appearance of the city and provide better traffic conditions, he
said. The work has been done in 573 places and at least 350 units
or individuals have been fined for putting up illegal structures.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton's Address on Strikes in Afghanistan, Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Following is the text of U.S.
President Bill Clinton's televised address to the nation on
Thursday about the military strikes in Afghanistan and Sudan:
</P>
<P>
"Today I ordered our armed forces to strike at
terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan because of
the imminent threat they presented to our national security.
</P>
<P>
I want to speak with you about the objective of this action and
why it was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Our target was terror. Our mission was clear -- to strike at
the network of radical groups affiliated with and funded by Osama
Bin Laden, perhaps the preeminent organizer and financier of
international terrorism in the world today.
</P>
<P>
The groups associated with him come from diverse places, but
share a hatred for democracy, a fanatical glorification of
violence, and a horrible distortion of their religion to justify
the murder of innocents.
</P>
<P>
They have made the United States their adversary precisely
because of what we stand for and what we stand against.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, and again this week, bin Laden publicly vowed
to wage a terrorist war against America, saying -- and I quote --
"We do not differentiate between those dressed in military
uniforms and civilians. They are all targets."
</P>
<P>
Their mission is murder. And their history is bloody.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, they killed American, Belgian and Pakistani
peacekeepers in Somalia. They plotted to assassinate the president
of Egypt and the Pope. They planned to bomb six United States 747s
over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
They bombed the Egyptian embassy in Pakistan. They gunned down
German tourists in Egypt. The most recent terrorist events are
fresh in our memory.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, 12 Americans and nearly 300 Kenyans and
Tanzanians lost their lives. And another 5,000 were wounded when
our embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed.
</P>
<P>
There is convincing information from our intelligence community
that the Bin Laden terrorist network was responsible for these
bombings. Based on this information, we have high confidence that
these bombings were planned, financed and carried out by the
organization Bin Laden leads.
</P>
<P>
America has battled terrorism for many years. Where possible,
we've used law enforcement and diplomatic tools to wage the fight.
The long arm of American law has reached out around the world and
brought to trial those guilty of attacks in New York, in Virginia
and in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
We have quietly disrupted terrorist groups and foiled their
plots. We have isolated countries that practice terrorism.
</P>
<P>
We've worked to build an international coalition against
terror. But there have been and will be times when law
enforcement and diplomatic tools are simply not enough.
</P>
<P>
When our very national security is challenged and when we must
take extraordinary steps to protect the safety of our citizens.
With compelling evidence that the bin Laden network of terrorist
groups was planning to mount further attacks against Americans and
other freedom-loving people, I decided America must act.
</P>
<P>
And so this morning, based on the unanimous recommendation of
my national security team, I ordered our armed forces to take
action to counter an immediate threat from the bin Laden network.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the United States carried out simultaneous
strikes against terrorist facilities and infrastructure in
Afghanistan. Our forces targeted one of the most active terrorist
bases in the world. It contained key elements of the Bin Laden
network's infrastructure and has served as a training camp for
literally thousands of terrorists from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
We have reason to believe that a gathering of key terrorist
leaders was to take place there today, thus underscoring the
urgency of our actions.
</P>
<P>
Our forces also attacked a factory in Sudan associated with the
Bin Laden network. The factory was involved in the production of
materials for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not take this action lightly.
Afghanistan and Sudan have been warned for years to stop
harboring and supporting these terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
But countries that persistently host terrorists have no right
to be safe havens. Let me express my gratitude to our intelligence
and law enforcement agencies for their hard, good work. And let me
express my pride in our armed forces, who carried out this mission
while making every possible effort to minimize the loss of
innocent lives.

<HEADLINE> ...the loss of innocent lives. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I want you to understand; I want the world to understand that
our actions today were not aimed against Islam, the faith of
hundreds of millions of good, peace-loving people all around the
world, including the United States. No religion condones the
murder of innocent men, women and children. But our actions were
aimed at fanatics and killers who wrap murder in the cloak of
righteousness, and in so doing, profane the great religion in
whose name they claim to act.
</P>
<P>
My fellow Americans, our battle against terrorism did not begin
with the bombing of our embassies in Africa, nor will it end with
today's strike.
</P>
<P>
It will require strength, courage and endurance. We will not
yield to this threat. We will meet it no matter how long it may
take. This will be a long, ongoing struggle between freedom and
fanaticism, between the rule of law and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
We must be prepared to do all that we can for as long as we
must. America is and will remain a target of terrorists precisely
because we are leaders; because we act to advance peace, democracy
and basic human values; because we're the most open society on
earth; and because, as we have shown yet again, we take an
uncompromising stand against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But of this I am also sure; the risks from inaction to America
and the world would be far greater than action, for that would
embolden our enemies, leaving their ability and their willingness
to strike us intact. In this case, we knew before our attack that
these groups already had planned further actions against us and
others.
</P>
<P>
I want to reiterate: The United States wants peace, not
conflict. We want to lift lives around the world, not take them.
We have worked for peace in Bosnia, in Northern Ireland, in Haiti,
in the Middle East and elsewhere, but in this day, no campaign for
peace can succeed without a determination to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Let our actions today send this message loud and clear: There
are no expendable American targets. There will be no sanctuary
for terrorists. We will defend our people, our interests and our
values. We will help people of all faiths in all parts of the
world who want to live free of fear and violence. We will persist
and we will prevail."

has concerned himself with the anti-flood battle along the two
major rivers in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jiang placed two calls to Wen Jiabao, vice-premier
and head of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief
Headquarters, to ask about the flood situation on the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers. Jiang also issued a series of important directives
to Wen.
</P>
<P>
-- China's Supreme People's Court yesterday dismissed the
appeal by Chen Xitong, former secretary of the Beijing Municipal
Committee of the Communist Party of China, and affirmed the
original judgement.
</P>
<P>
-- While the sixth flood crest flowed through the middle
reaches of the Yangtze river yesterday, the flooding situation on
the Nenjiang and Songhua rivers caused concern.
</P>
<P>
A new flood crest on the Songhua river is pressing toward
Harbin, a major industrial city and capital of Heilongjiang
Province. A large numbers of soldiers and civilians are pledging
their lives to safeguard the city.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Premier Zhu Rongji yesterday morning phoned Wang Maolin,
secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), inquiring about the flood situation there.

<P>
Zhu urged flood-fighters to abide by flood-control regulations,
patrol the river dikes round the clock and deal with dangerous
situations at any cost.
</P>
<P>
-- A China-made Long March 2C carrier rocket launched two
iridium satellites made by the U.S. Motorola Corp. at 7:01
a.m. yesterday (Beijing time) from the Taiyuan Satellite Launching
Center in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
China has fulfilled the contracted launching tasks of all the
iridium satellites into orbits. The current launch of iridiums
aims to make up the satellite communications network.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"

the first rush of the Nenjiang River floods, temporarily quelling
the fears of millions of residents.

-- China has issued regulations to step up management of human
genome resources and promote international cooperation in the
field.
</P>
<P>
Without approval from the scientific and health administrations
of the State Council, no domestic or foreign individuals or work
units can be allowed to collect, develop, trade in or export
anything related to human genome resources, according to the
regulation issued yesterday by the Ministry of Health and the
Ministry of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>

will be devalued, and reaffirmed the yuan will remain solid.

<HEADLINE> Military Officers Spreading Coup Rumors: Defense Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Powerful military officers,
including some retired generals, are spreading coup rumors to stop
the Joseph Estrada administration from investigating fund
irregularities at a military financial institution, Manila
Bulletin reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado as saying
that no psychological operation can prevent the probers from
conducting an investigation on the anomalies.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said he has received information on who are responsible
for the spreading of the coup rumors but declined to identify
them.
</P>
<P>
"This is what we call psychological operations and the
objective, I believe, is to try to rattle us or try to see how
much resolve we have thinking that we would run away with our tail
between our two legs," the defense chief said.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said he confided the coup rumor issue to President
Estrada last Wednesday and the president instructed him to
continue with the investigation, "whether there is a coup or
none."
</P>
<P>
He said he has also been getting death threats but added these
will not deter him from digging deeper into the anomalies and
nailing down the culprits.

<HEADLINE> Australia Supports US Strikes Against Afghanistan, Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia said Friday it
supported U.S. strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan Friday,
describing the attacks as defensive acts by a nation protecting
its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio in
Melbourne, Australian Prime Minister John Howard said the actions
were clearly prompted by the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
U.S. intelligence officials said the targets of the raids were
six military-style camps in Afghanistan and a pharmaceutical plant
in Sudan believed to produce a key ingredient in nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
But Sudan denied the charge, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
"My advice is that the strike was based upon very strong ...
evidence." Howard said.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Quicken Pace in Selling State Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 21 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
expected to quicken its pace in selling state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Friday quoted newly-appointed
Treasurer and Finance Minister Bill Birch as saying that the
government will look at further asset sales now that it is no
longer constrained by the coalition with NZ First.
</P>
<P>
In the past 21 months, the New Zealand government has been a
coalition one formed by the NZ National Party and NZ First. But,
on the issue of handling the state-owned assets, the two political
parties have always disputed with each other.
</P>
<P>
The National Party with Prime Minister Jenny Shipley as its
leader advocates a greater involvement by the private sector in
the areas of business now controlled by the government. Shipley
once said: "Where the private sector can do it better, we will
allow them to do that."
</P>
<P>
As the minority partner in the government, the NZ First, with
then deputy prime minister and treasurer Winston Peters as its
leader, always has objections to the National's privatization bid.
</P>
<P>
The public disputes between Shipley and Peters took place when
the latter walked out of a special Cabinet meeting on August 12 as
a decision was about to be taken to sell the government's
shareholding in the Wellington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The event of "walkout" led to the dismissal of Peters from his
post in the government and the breakup of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
Because of the splitting of the NZ First with a number of its
ministers and Parliament members resigning from the party and
voicing their support to Shipley on August 18, the National Party
will be allowed to continue in power as a minority government.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper "The Dominion", Birch, who is also
deputy leader of the National Party, said Thursday that the
government would set out clearly early next month what its
priorities and objectives were in the wake of the coalition's
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Birch said that it was possible that the government might
record a budget deficit next year, with its tax take hit by the
slowing-down in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the forecasts of his Treasury would be "broadly
consistent" with projections issued Thursday by the Reserve Bank,
New Zealand central bank, which forecast the economic growth of
the country of only 0.1 percent in the year to next March.
</P>
<P>
However, Birch hinted that the Reserve Bank's expectation of a
strong rebound in 1999 and 2000, with growth rates of more than
four percent projected, might be "too optimistic".

He told Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday: "We should be
concentrating on the championships and not being worried about
all these stupid meetings, to be honest."
</P>
<P>
The former sprinter also criticised the sport's governing
bodies:"They make their rules and nobody asks the athletes what
is going on so I just think it's insignificant."
</P>
<P>
Christie said the problem (of doping) was being exaggerated
and also criticised current attitudes towards athletes.
</P>
<P>
"If they win, it's great, but if they lose, people are on
drugs. It's a lot of rubbish," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IOC's executive board decided in a meeting in Lausanne on
Thursday that four task forces would be set up to investigate
drug abuse in sport before the matter is considered fully at a
world doping conference next year.
</P>
<P>
The task forces will consider what the committee considers to
be the four main areas of concern before the conference next
February, in which all sports will be asked to adopt common rules.
</P>
<P>
The four points are the protection of athletes' health, the
political and legal aspects of anti-doping campaigns, education
of competitors and the financial aspects of the problem.

NEW YORK, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Semiconductor Industry

bipartisan legislative initiative which will enable companies
share information on solutions for the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Administration and Congress, the San

<P>
The bill encourages companies to exchange Y2K information
without fear that the information will subsequently be used

"With only 500 days left before the onset of the Y2K
phenomenon, the time for congressional action on this issue is

LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) - Tottenham Hotspur had turned down
a
10 million pound (16.28 million U.S. dollars) bid for England
defender Sol Campbell from premier league rivals Blackburn Rovers.
</P>
<P>
Hotspur manager Christian Gross said on Thursday:"Blackburn

accept
for Sol. He will not be leaving. Not for the moment."
</P>

Central defender Campbell, 23, rose to prominence with
several outstanding displays for England during the World Cup in
France.
</P>
<P>
Gross also confirmed he was interested in buying Manchester
United's Norwegian striker Ole-Gunnar Solskjaer. Solskjaer could
be available after United signed Aston Villa's Dwight Yorke for
12.6 million pounds (20.51 million U.S. dollars) on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Yorke Joins Manchester United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United has completed
a signing in a club record transfer fee with Aston Villa striker
Dwight Yorke on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by the club, the transfer
fee is totalled at 12.6 million pound (20.51 million U.S.
dollars). United said that 6.6 million pounds was payable
immediately, followed by four quarterly instalments of 1.5
million over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The Trinidad and Tobago player later appeared at a news
conference with United manager Alex Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
"Of all the strikers who've played against us in the last few
years he was the one who gave us the most problems," said
Ferguson, who had chased his man since last year.
</P>
<P>
"He's got two good feet, he's brave and he's got good endur
ance. He can beat a man and score goals so all the parts add up."
</P>
<P>
Yorke, who had two years on his contract at English premier
league rivals Villa, signed a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
It came before a 2200 GMT European transfer deadline,ensuring
he can play in this season's Champions' League.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old said although he had nine "fantastic years" at
Villa he was desperate to come to Manchester once he first heard
of their interest and was not worried about the price tag or the
competition for places.
</P>
<P>
"I've played here against some great players and one day I
hoped I would be here to play with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm here I don't expect to walk in without
competition for places because there are so many good players
here. I will be working extremely hard to get a place and then
keep it," he added.
</P>
<P>
The signing topped United's transfer record set in May when
they paid PSV Eindhoven 10.75 million pounds for Dutch
international defender Jaap Stam.
</P>
<P>
United also signed Swedish international Jesper Blomqvist from
Parma for 4.4 million pounds in July and Ferguson said the big
money buys were now complete.
</P>
<P>
"I have quite a considerable squad and I am covered in all
areas. But I may end up with some unhappy players and that may
mean things change, but that is football," he said.
</P>
<P>
Villa, who had offered Yorke a new five-year contract and a
higher basic wage than he would get at United, had initially
demanded 16 million pounds for a player pursued by the northern
club since last September.
</P>
<P>
Villa's chairman Doug Ellis said that 12 million was always
the club's minimum value and he added that he was personally sad
to see the player leave.
</P>
<P>
"We were prepared to resist all of Manchester United's efforts
to sign Dwight until recent events made us change our mind," he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It has become apparent in recent days that Dwight Yorke
wanted to join Manchester United and would not sign an extension
to his remaining two year contract."
</P>
<P>
Ellis said United had increased their offer late on Wednesday
with a "few add-ons subsequent to that".

<HEADLINE> Albright Urges Other Nations to Join Anti-terrorism Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday urged other nations to join the fight
against terrorism after the U.S. launched attacks on targets in
Sudan and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference hours following the U.S.
actions, Albright said those responsible could not escape the long
arm of justice.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be intimidated," Albright told reporters. "Today
the United States is asking every nation to stand publicly against
those who perpetrate, finance or otherwise support terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"We're asking governments to join us in taking the actions
necessary to deter and defeat terrorist acts and we recognize that
this is a long-term struggle," she added.
</P>
<P>
"There may in fact be retaliatory actions -- we are very
concerned about that, we have issued high-threat warnings at our
embassies -- but we are very concerned about what is going on
internationally which is why we are gathering international
support," she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration said the raids were targeted at groups
believed to be responsible for deadly bombs which exploded outside
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, killing more
than 260 people and injuring some 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"Together decent people everywhere must send the message to
terrorists everywhere that they can hide, but they cannot escape
the long arm of justice," Albright added.

LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ralf Schumacher denied on
Thursday that he had finished signing with Formula One team
Williams
</P>
<P>
There has been reports that the Jordan driver has joined the
team with a four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher, younger brother of world title challenger Michael
Schumacher, said: "This is all speculation, pure and simple.
Nothing has been signed with anyone yet and nothing was signed
last weekend at Budapest (Hungarian Grand Prix venue).
</P>
<P>
"My manager Willi Weber is in talks with many teams, one of
which is Williams and one of which is Jordan, but we are still in
negotiations. Nothing has been finalised."
</P>
<P>
Williams are said to have offered Schumacher a substantial sum
to be the German driver, who heads the team when they are powered
by BMW engines in the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
The new British American Racing team (BAR) are also said to be
trying to sign him as team mate for newly-recruited world
champion Jacques Villeneuve.
</P>

WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

"terrorist-related" bases in Afghanistan and Sudan because there
is imminent threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the Oval Office, Clinton also said his order
to strikes was based on the unanimous recommendation of his

</P>
<P>
"The countries that persistently host terrorism have no right
to be safe havens," said Clinton, who interrupted a Martha's
Vineyard vacation to rush back to Washington.
</P>

He said the facilities attacked by U.S. Tomahawk cruise
missiles were linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
whom U.S. officials believe to be a major sponsor of terrorism.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that he had ordered attacks on
"terrorist-related" bases in Afghanistan and Sudan because there
is imminent threat to U.S. national security.
</P>
<P>
"Today I ordered our armed forces to strike at
terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan because of
the imminent threat they presented to our national security,"
Clinton said from the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. intelligence indicated that a "gathering of key
terrorist leaders" was planned at the site in Afghanistan for
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Missiles launched against Sudan came from Navy vessels in the
Red Sea, and the missiles launched on Afghanistan came from
ships in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the strikes, Clinton made a speech at a
hastly-called news conference before leaving for Washington from
his cut-short vacation on the island of martha's Vineyard,
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
He said he acted on intelligence information that pinpointed
"one of the most active terrorist bases in the world" in
Afghanistan and an industrial plant in Sudan that was believed
to make agents for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his order to strikes was based on the unanimous
recommendation of his national security team.
</P>
<P>
"The countries that persistently host terrorism have no right
to be safe havens," said Clinton, who interrupted a Martha's
Vineyard vacation to rush back to Washington.
</P>
<P>
He said the facilities attacked by U.S. Tomahawk cruise
missiles were linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire
whom U.S. officials believe to be a major sponsor of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not say whether the mission had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen said earlier U.S. forces
alone were involved in the attacks on what he called a terrorist
training and support compound in Afghanistan, 94 miles south of
Kabul near the Pakistani border, and on the Shifa Pharmaceutical
plant in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, which was suspected of
making agents for chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the motivation driving the attacks was "our
absolute obligation to protect the American people from
terrorist activities."
</P>
<P>
He said the administration believed it had to act quickly
after learning that more terrorist attacks might be forthcoming.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Leaders and members of the
U.S. Congress expressed their support for President Bill Clinton
in bombing the suspected terrorist targets in Sudan and
Afghanistan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the United States did exactly the right thing," said
House Speaker Newt Gingrich during an interview with the Cable
News Network (CNN) television. "We cannot allow a terrorist group
to attack American embassies and do nothing."
</P>
<P>
"And I strongly support the United States government having
acted that way," said Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
John McCain, Chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee,
also expressed his support for the president although he has not
been briefed about the actions.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the president acted in the interest of
protecting American lives and property and responding to acts of
terror." McCain told CNN.
</P>
<P>
"I regret the lack of consultation with Congress... However,
again, I think the president did the right thing. I think the
majority of the American people will support him," said the
senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
"Our response appears to be appropriate and just," said Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, terrorists will realize that America's
differences end at the water's edge, and that the United States'
political leadership always has, and always will, stand united in
the face of international terrorism," Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms.
</P>
<P>
Other Senate and House leaders including Republican
Representative Lee Hamilton and Senator Orrin Hatch also expressed
their support for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Clinton announced that the U.S. Air Force
had bombed a medicine plant in Sudan and a "terrorist base" in
Afghanistan in retaliation for car bomb attacks on its East
African embassies.
</P>
<P>
Some critics questioned the timing of the actions, saying that
Clinton was trying to move the attention from the embarrassing sex
scandal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Plans Small Satellite Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States Air Force
researchers are working on tiny satellite operations to replace
large ones for more reflexibility and less vulnerability, the
Defense News said in its latest issue.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) have begun laying the technological
groundwork for such missions starting early next century, the
weekly said in its August 17-23 issue.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force early this year launched TechSat21, a two-phased
effort that would culminate in a three-satellite flight experiment
in 2003, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Objective is to demonstrate that the functions of large and
complex spacecraft can be broken up among smaller, collaborating
spacecraft, it added.
</P>
<P>
Techsat21 demonstration spacecraft would be about 70 kilograms
apiece, compared with today's operational military satellites that
are as heavy as tons.
</P>
<P>
Distributing the functions of a large satellite among several
smaller ones could offer improved mission flexibility and
survivability, said Alok Das, technical adviser to the space
technology and integration division of the space vehicles
directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Kirtland Air
Force Base in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
He said, if the mission is radar imaging, for example, the
satellite could fly in a formation optimized to detect moving
targets on the ground. Meanwhile, it could be better for spotting
airborne objects and suited for imaging small stationary objects
on the ground.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States embassy in
Lagos announced Thursday the suspension of non-immigrant visa
services in Nigeria as a security precaution and the suspension
is expected to last until Friday.
</P>
<P>
The embassy announced the measure in a statement, but the
statement did not mention a reported bomb scare which took place
at the U.S. Embassy Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said that a gardener at the embassy
discovered Wednesday an object wrapped with wire in a black
cellophane bag hidden under the flower hedges close to the
entrance lobby of the embassy's main building.
</P>
<P>
The gardener informed a local security staff of the object,
who later drew the attention of the Regional Security Manager and
the American Marines who immediately evacuated all visa
applicants and members of staff from the building.
</P>
<P>
The embassy later invited security agents and members of the
Nigeria Police Bomb Disposal Unit who picked up the object
suspected to be a bomb.
</P>
<P>
The bomb scare incident has led to a step-up in security
measures around the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of visa services at the embassy was reportedly
connected with alleged bomb threats against U.S. missions in some
parts of the world following two recent bomb explosions at the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 250
people.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Canada's Top Court Rules Against Quebec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Canada ruled
here Thursday that Quebec does not have the right to separate
unilaterally, which represents a legal victory for the Canadian
government.
</P>
<P>
In its historic ruling on the Quebec issue, the top court said
the French-speaking province can't separate unilateral from Canada
under the Constitution of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The nine-judge court also ruled unanimously that Quebec does
not have the right to separate under international law.
</P>
<P>
But the court noted that if a clear majority of Quebecers vote
to get out of Canada, then the federal government and the rest of
provinces would have the obligation to negotiate with Quebec and
amend the constitution so that Quebec could leave.
</P>
<P>
The ruling has been a key part of Ottawa's unity strategy since
it almost lost a referendum on Quebec's independence in October
1995.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa is hoping that Thursday's ruling by the top court will
persuade middle-ground Quebeckers to support the unity of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It also sent a strong message to hardcore separatists in Quebec
that a vote for sovereignty would mean a prolonged and painful
process.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said it is very satisfied and pleased
with the ruling Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The court has made a "balanced and carefully-considered
decision" and Ottawa will respect it, Canadian Justice Minister
Anne McLellan told a news briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised the court for
having "well served all Canadians by bringing clarity to
fundamental rules which must guide our democratic life."
</P>
<P>
"The court has confirmed that any possible process of
independence must proceed in a manner that respects shared values
that include federalism, democracy, constitution and the rule of
law, and respect for minorities," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It (the ruling) deserves the respect of all Canadians,"
Chretien noted.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa asked the court for its opinion on three deceptively
simple questions. Can Quebec unilaterally declare independence
under domestic law? Does international law give Quebec a right to
secede? If two laws conflict, which prevails?
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Quebec does not have the right to go
unilaterally under either domestic or international law, and that
there is no conflict between the two.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the separatist Quebec government, which refused
to take part in the reference, also put a positive spin on the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"The Supreme Court recognizes the democratic legitimacy of the
project and the process that could lead to the sovereignty of
Quebec," Quebec Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Jacques
Brassard told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the sovereigntist Bloc Quebecois
party of the federal parliament, said the decision confirms
Quebec's position that it has the right to negotiate separation.
</P>
<P>
"We have repeated that for more than 25 years already. This
really repeats what we said," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian market reacted positively to the court ruling,
giving the Canadian dollar a quick boost when the ruling was
released in the morning. The dollar ended the day at 65.28 U.S.
cents, only slightly weaker than Wednesday.

BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The German Defense Ministry said
Thursday it would review plans to airlift relief supplies to
famine-ridden areas of Sudan following an U.S. air strike on an
alleged terrorist target in the country, German press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe ordered earlier on
Thursday two German Transall military transport planes to start
relief flights in southern Sudan next Monday.
</P>
<P>
German news agency DPA quoted a defense ministry spokesman as
saying that the plan would be reviewed due to the U.S. airstrikes
on Thursday and a decision would be made on Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced earlier Thursday that the
U.S. airforce struck a chemical weapons facility in Sudan as well
as a terrorist base in Afghanistan in response to the recent bomb
attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
So far Bonn has not made any official response to the U.S.

<HEADLINE> "Millennium Bug" Summit to Be Held in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A global summit meeting on the
"millennium bug" problem, organized by the World Bank, is
scheduled to take place in London in October, local media reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The conference will be the first of its kind in looking at the
"millennium bug" from a global perspective.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the World Bank, the International Chamber of
Commerce, the International Telecommunications Users Group, and
the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
are involved in organizing the gathering.
</P>
<P>
It will bring together top-level government and business
representatives from all over the world to discuss last-ditch
efforts to tackle the millennium compliance problem.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that British Prime Minister Tony Blair, thought
by the organizers to be "perhaps the most outspoken world leader
on the subject", has been invited to address the summit.
</P>
<P>
The "millennium bug" problem, caused because early computers
expressed years with just the final two digits rather than four,
is estimated to cost between 300 billion and 600 billion U.S.
dollars worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Address on U.S. Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton will
make a televised address from the White House shortly after
returning to Washington Thursday, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cut short his vacation to the Massachusetts island of
Martha's Vineyard Thursday after announcing two air strikes on
"terrorist-related" bases in Afghanistan and Sudan believed to
have been behind the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he expected Clinton to
return to Washington at around 4:15 p.m. EDT (2015 GMT) and will
address from the Oval Office around 5:30 p.m. EDT (2130 GMT)
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton told a news conference that the United States
made the two strikes on bases in Afghanistan and Sudan because he
had "convincing evidence" that groups attacked by U.S. forces had
played a key role in bombings at the U.S. embassies in East
Africa, in which over 250 people were killed, including 12
Americans, and more than 5,000 wounded.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tries to Wrest Arms Market in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia has launched a major
offensive to wrest a share of Latin America's military aviation
market away from the U.S. manufacturers that dominate it, reported
the latest edition of the Defense News Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Top Russian Air Force commanders, arms dealers and
manufacturers joined hands on August 11 at the Yuri Gagarin Air
Force Academy near Moscow last week to show fighters and
helicopters for Latin American military officials, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It was the first such conference in Russia to attract military
attaches from most of the Latin American embassies in Moscow and
senior national defense officials who oversee imports of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said that Russia is trying to interest Latin
American countries in Su and MiG-series fighters, as well as Mi-
and Ka-series helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Brazil boasts the largest Air Force in Latin America with 1,200
aircraft, and is expected to buy up to 100 fighters by 2005,
according to the "Military Parade" survey.
</P>
<P>
Colombia is seeking to buy spare parts for the 10 Mi-17
multipurpose helicopters it has purchased from Russia while
Peru, in particular, has displayed interest in buying up to
eight MiG-24 combat helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Air Force estimates that Latin American countries
will spend up to one billion U.S. dollars in each of the next five
years to overhaul military aircraft, although most current fleets
are largely U.S. or French made, the magazine quoted Russian
officials as saying.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Announces New Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar announced Thursday the list of a new cabinet,
one month after the previous cabinet was sacked, the Nigerian TV
Authority said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 31-member new cabinet, only seven were survivors of the
old cabinet which Abubakar inherited from his predecessor,
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
They include Mrs. M.O. Akande, former minister of industries,
Air Commander Emeka Omeruah, former minister of youth and sports,
and Major-General Patrick Aziza.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of Works and Housing, G.A. Mohammed, former
Justice Minister Abdullahi Ibrahim and former Minister of Science
and Technology, Sam Momah, are also among the lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
Former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Alhaji Buhari
Bala, is also a member of the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The portfolio of the ministers, however, will not be announced
until the sworn-in ceremony scheduled for Saturday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the sudden death of Abacha on June 8 and that of
detained opposition leader Moshood Abiola, Abubakar has announced
the release of all political detainees and the annulment of all
elections held under Abacha's transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The move won Abubakar the trust of the country's opposition as
well as the western countries which have imposed sanctions
against Nigeria for its poor human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, however, refused the opposition's demand for a
national unity government. Instead, he sacked the cabinet and
promised that the new cabinet will reflect the interests of
different groups.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Launches War Against Illiteracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ordered related government agencies to launch a war
against illiteracy and also to provide support to the artists in
the country, the Philippine News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall declare war on illiteracy and promote reading at the
lowest grades," Estrada was quoted as telling a meeting on
illiteracy Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Estrada pledged greater government support for artists,
craftsmen and writers.
</P>
<P>
Since assuming the presidency in July this year, Estrada has
launched war against criminality, hunger, poverty, official
corruption, and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
To help his administration wage war against illiteracy, Estrada
called for the formation of a volunteer corps of young men and
women who will reach out for the illiterates -- young and old
alike -- and teach them the joy of reading.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said it will be his administration's long-term goal to
build a public library in every town and city, which he envisions
to become part of the core of the civic community.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Directly Involved in Congo War: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Thursday accused Rwanda of being directly involved in
efforts to topple President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told reporters that a fact-finding mission which
returned from central Africa had reported that Rwanda is involved
directly and indirectly in the ethnic Tutsi revolt against the
15-month-old government of Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the Zimbabwean president as
saying that Rwanda, a former ally of the DRC, has sent troops
into eastern Congo as pointed out by residents in Goma.
</P>
<P>
The information was provided by a verification committee set
up by a regional leaders meeting on the Great Lakes crisis in
Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The committee was headed by Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge who returned Wednesday from the fact-finding mission to
the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was speaking soon after his meeting with Ugandan
Minister of Foreign Affairs Amama Mbabazi, who brought him a
special message from Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the
Congo situation.
</P>
<P>
"I may not say so about Uganda," noted Mugabe. "But the people
of Goma in the DRC were saying the Rwandan soldiers were there
and their trucks were coming there and going."
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean president, who also chairs the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) organ on politics, defense and
security, said that the verification committee's report was being
finalized for publication soon.
</P>
<P>
Nine SADC defense ministers who met in Harare earlier this
week agreed that the region should support the embattled DRC
government and bring back peace and order to the central African
country of more than 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
This decision has, however, brought a rift between some SADC
member states such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, with President
Nelson Mandala preferring diplomacy to solve the problem while
Mugabe supported a regional initiative to prop up Kabila's
government.
</P>
<P>
"We are involved in accordance with the decision taken and
recommendations by our defense ministers," Mugabe said, adding
that "each country will support the DRC according to its
capacity."
</P>
<P>
"If South Africa does not want to participate, then fine. We
will participate as Zimbabwe is working together with other SADC
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the apparent rift between himself and Mandela,
Mugabe said: "No, I don't think there is any rift. No-one is
compelled within SADC to go into a campaign of assisting a
country beset by conflict."
</P>
<P>
Mugabe and Mandela have differences over the running of the
SADC organ on politics, defense and security, which Mandela
thinks should fall under SADC structures.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, however, refused to disclose logistics of how the
interested SADC countries would intervene in the two-week-long
revolt in democratic Congo which Kabila has been claiming all
along was being sponsored by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reports that the rebels were saying they were
prepared to have talks with Kabila, Mugabe said that "the rebels
will talk peace and act war... They would obviously say things
they want the international community to hear. We did that
during the war because we knew what we wanted."
</P>
<P>
"A threat to a member of SADC is a threat to the region."
Mugabe said. "Loss of peace and stability to the DRC is a loss of
peace and stability to the region and I'm glad the OAU is
supporting our initiative."
</P>
<P>
He said he had just received a message from the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim
offering support to the SADC decision to help the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan foreign minister said that his government
supported the rebels' initiative for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"We do welcome it because we want to solve the political
problems in Congo. We have to take every measure possible to
ensure the situation gets back to normal," said Mbabazi.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to state categorically that Uganda is not
involved in the Congo revolt," he said. "Congo is an important
neighbor to us in the region as we feel concerned that it is
unstable."

<HEADLINE> Disease Brought Under Control in Flooded Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of diseases in
China's eight flood-affected areas is lower than that of previous
years, Yin Dakui, vice-minister of Health, said here today.
</P>
<P>
No widespread breakout of epidemic diseases has been reported
so far and the spread of disease has been brought under control,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 13,790 medical teams with 80,000 health workers have been
sent to flooded areas. They came from the Ministry of Health as
well as from the provinces of Hebei, Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong,
Sichuan and Guizhou and the municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen medical departments under the Ministry of Health held
a meeting today to coordinate the supply of medicine to
flood-afflicted areas.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of badly needed medicine should be shipped any
day now to Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi -- provinces heavily hit by
floods.
</P>
<P>
In Hunan Province, more than 200 medical teams are patrolling
the embankments and going door-to-door to assist flood victims.
</P>
<P>
When 120,000 people in Gong'an County were found suffering from
13 kinds of diseases, more than 300 medical workers were sent
there to inoculate local residents against epidemic diseases of
various kinds and spread 20,500 kilograms of disinfectant.

<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday met with U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel to discuss enhancing
bilateral trade and breaking the deadlock in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting in the northern port city of Alexandria,
Hagel, chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on International
Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion, said the U.S. is
keen to promote trade cooperation with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Hagel, who arrived here Thursday after visiting the Palestinian
self-rule areas of West Bank and Gaza Strip, is on a Mideast tour
that will also take him to Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He and Mubarak also discussed the U.S. aid to Egypt and the
deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The senator urged the international community to exert all
possible efforts to help achieve a breakthrough in the peace
process, saying the U.S. shared the view with Mubarak on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the U.S. administration in Washington is to
encourage all parties concerned to make progress along the road to
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hagel insisted the problems that U.S. President Bill Clinton is
facing would not affect the Middle East peace process, referring
to the legal battle against Clinton over his affair with a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have voiced concern that the Mideast
peace process is paying the price for the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace process has been stalled since
early last due to Israel's expansion of settlements and repeated
delay in carrying out the next stage of troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has failed to persuade Israel to accept a proposal on
a further 13.1 percent West Bank withdrawal in return for stronger
Palestinian security guarantees.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Issue Call for Truce in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni was expected to issue a call for a cease-fire by the
rebel forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), South
African President Nelson Mandela said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his Cape Town home, Mandela said he
had asked his deputy Thabo Mbeki to speak to Museveni Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident President Museveni will issue that statement,
and that statement will therefore bring about a relaxation of
tension," Mandela was quoted by South African Press Association
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said DRC President Laurent Kabila believed Congo is
being invaded by Uganda and that a call for cease-fire and a
peaceful meeting between Museveni, Kabila and Rwandan President
Pasteur Bizimungu would be an important step toward resolving the
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said he wanted a Southern African Development Community
(SADC) summit on the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
There was however a difference in opinion between him and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe on whether it should be a full
summit or only a SADC sub-committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Mugabe and the South African government
intensified Thursday when he told Pretoria to be silent over his
hopes for regional military intervention in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe was quoted by Zimbabwean state radio as saying that no
SADC country was compelled to intervene militarily in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"Those countries which want to, can do so. But those countries
who do not should be silent."
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told parliament
Thursday afternoon that his country was committed to a political
solution to the DRC crisis.
</P>
<P>
"In fact there can be no military solution to the problem."
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa was hoping to broker a cease-fire in the
DRC, so that a broad-based political order could be established.
</P>
<P>
"A solution that we are convinced will be meaningful will be
one decided upon by the Congolese people themselves," said Nzo.

<HEADLINE> Manila Confident of Meeting Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
confident that the country will post a 2-3 percent growth in its
gross national product (GNP) despite the prolonged Asian financial
crisis, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu told reporters that the prospects of the Philippine
economy remain bright and the country can attain its economic
growth target.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to the projection of an International
Monetary Fund (IMF) resident representative that the country would
be lucky if its GNP could grow by one percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, IMF resident representative Heri Lorie was quoted as
saying the Philippines' GNP growth target will have to be revised
from 2-3 percent to a much lower figure, due to the poor
performance of the agriculture sector and the lingering regional
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines was able to secure a 1.02 billion U.S. dollar
emergency fund facility in March this year after sealing a
two-year precautionary agreement with the IMF prescribing a 3
percent GNP growth for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the government need not revise its growth target.
He expressed optimism that there would be a turnaround in terms of
agriculture, since the country is expecting the results of the
efforts made in addressing the drop in agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural output dropped by a substantial 7.15 percent
during the first half of this year, its worst record in the last
20 years. The drop has been attributed primarily to the effects of
the drought caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon and the
regional currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
"That's the reason why we are doing some pumpriming to create
more economic activities. Maybe they should understand our
situation (is) better than the other Asian countries," Espiritu
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, President Joseph Estrada himself said the
Philippines is expecting one of the best economic prospects in the
region and is "the only one among the countries hit by the crisis
which will have a positive growth this year."
</P>
<P>
"Our GNP is expected to grow by a respectable two to three
percent in 1998 and four to five percent next year," Estrada
insisted.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Suggests Truce Extension in S. Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General's
Special Envoy to Sudan Tom Vraalsen said Thursday that his
proposal on the six-month extension of the current truce is being
considered by the main warring sides in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The current three-month cease-fire in Bahr el Ghazal Province
in southern Sudan, starting on July 16 due to the seriously
spreading famine, will end in six weeks from now.
</P>
<P>
John Garang, the leader of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), has indicated that he would agree to extend the
cease-fire "if there is a need," Vraalsen told a press conference
here.
</P>
<P>
The extension "would happen," the Khartoum government answered
Vraalsen in a vague manner, assuring that it will consider.
</P>
<P>
During his visit starting August 11 to Khartoum and parts of
war-torn southern Sudan, Vraalsen held talks with Sudanese
Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail, two other cabinet
ministers and Garang subsequently.
</P>
<P>
Vraalsen said during his visit, he was also trying to expand
the truce to cover all war-torn areas in Sudan. Now the
cease-fire is only limited in Bahr el Ghazal, where people suffer
most from the famine.
</P>
<P>
However, in response, Garang was quoted by Vraalsen as saying
that this needs "a much bigger political settlement" through
negotiations between SPLA and the Moslem-led Khartoum government.
</P>
<P>
"A solution has to be found... The world expect them (Sudan's
warring sides) to take responsibility to their people," Vraalsen
said, calling for more regional and international efforts to stop
prolonged civil war in the largest African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the famine situation is still very serious
in Sudan which has seen a bloody civil war since 1983 when SPLA
started fighting for more autonomy and religion freedom in the
Christian and animist-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
"Food needs (in Sudan) will continue to be very great through
next April," Vraalsen told reporters, adding that the starvation
claimed some 70 lives per day in Wau, a main town in Bahr el
Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
"South Sudan is facing its most severe food crisis for 10
years," said a statement from the U.N. Operation Lifeline Sudan
(OLS), estimating that about 1.2 million Sudanese need urgent
food assistance.
</P>
<P>
More than one million people are estimated to have died in
fighting and famine while more than more million people have been
displaced during the 15-year Sudanese war, one of the world's
longest, unresolved conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Greek Parliament Approves Civil Defense Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Parliament Thursday
approved a civil defense bill which is mainly aimed at organizing
local civil defense forces in border areas to provide support in
emergency situations in times of peace and war.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill tabled by Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos, women in the country's border regions will be
obliged to serve in civil defense units for the first time in
Greece, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense units will be set up in each municipality or
community according to available manpower, in addition to national
guard units.
</P>
<P>
Participation in the civil defense units will be on a voluntary
basis for young men and women aged 16-18, and for men and women
above 65 and 50 respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, it will be mandatory for men aged 18-65 except those
serving in the armed forces, national guard and security corps and

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Stress Impairs Memory Retrieval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Stress may affect people's memory
by making it harder to recall information, American scientists
reported Thursday in Nature, the international science journal.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of California, Irvine, have
demonstrated that stress and glucocorticoids, the hormones
produced in response to stress, impair rats' retrieval of
long-term spatial memory.
</P>
<P>
Their study shows that rats have impaired performance in a
water-maze spatial task after being given footshock 30 minutes.
The stressed rats were unable to find their familiar way to a
platform.
</P>
<P>
Non-stressed rats who were injected with glucocorticoids also
couldn't reach the platform, the scientists have found.
</P>
<P>
The researchers concluded that these new results indicate that
besides the effects of stress and glucocorticoids on acquisition
and consolidation processes, which is well-known from animal and
human studies, glucocorticoids also affect memory retrieval
mechanisms.

<HEADLINE> Figures Show Britain's Economy Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Official figures released today
confirmed that Britain's economy is slowing down, dashing
economists' earlier expectations that the growth rate would be
upgraded.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office for National Statistics, total UK
output grew by 0.5 percent in the three months to July compared to
the previous quarter and that the economy is growing at an annual
rate of 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
That is down from a year on year increase of 3 percent in the
first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The news came as a leading indicator of Britain's consumer
industries fell to a two-year low of 102.7 in July.
</P>
<P>
A slump in consumer confidence, rising interest rates and
slower retail sales are considered behind the fall. That is the
fourth consecutive month the indicator had fallen and economic
growth is likely to continue to slow over the remainder of the
year and the first half of 1999, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Neil Parker, economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: "We
have seen another fall (in consumer expenditure)... I think that
is very important in that it does show consumers are becoming more
cautious as the economic slowdown continues."
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending slowed in the second quarter, with the
service sector also showing signs of coming off the boil after a
period of rapid growth, according to the figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the figures offered some hope to the country's
beleaguered manufacturing industry, whose output edged up 0.1
percent in the second quarter, having fallen during the previous
six months.

goods to and from Burkina Faso and to cooperate in combating
cross-border crimes.
</P>
<P>
They appealed in the communique to the international community
to provide the necessary humanitarian and economic assistance to
the people of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>

Guinea Bissau and called on the Economic Community of West
African states (ECOWAS) Committee of Seven on Guinea-Bissau to
exert every effort to achieve a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>

atmosphere at all levels in order to promote gender equity within
the national context so that women can cope with modern
technology, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Media should use their influence to expose any activities of
those who frustrate the goals of the liberation of women through

As the flood-control effort enters a critical stage, the
Shenyang Military Area Command has issued an urgent call to mobilize
soldiers and armed forces to overwhelm whatever difficulties exist
and fight to the end to win the anti-flood battle.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains have caused the worst flooding on the Nenjiang

Daqing, where China's largest oil field is located, and Harbin,
capital of Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Songhua River measured at Harbin reached
an all-time high today, with a large mass of farmland and a large
number of houses on the north bank submerged by water. Traffic on
some highways has also been halted.
</P>
<P>
In Daqing, flooding has remained critical. The 50,000 soldiers,
though worn out after long hours of labor for many consecutive
days, are continuing to work to their limits to counter floods and
protect the major embankments.
</P>
<P>
This morning, another 2,800 armed policemen were sent to Daqing
to guarantee the safety of the oil city.

<HEADLINE> Tarawneh Formally Appointed New Jordanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan issued two
royal decrees Thursday to accept the resignation of Prime Minister
Abdul Salam Majali and appoint Chief of Royal Court Fayez
Tarawneh to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Majali following the issue of the decrees,
King Hussein, who is hospitalized in the U.S. for cancer
treatment, said he would choose a new government that "serves the
people's interests in a way that satisfies our conscience," the
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Majali and his cabinet ministers Thursday pledged to cooperate
with the new government to ensure a smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh is now making contacts and consultations to form
the new government and a preliminary list of new cabinet
members is expected to be produced soon.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh, 49, has served as Ambassador to the United States and
Foreign Minister in Majali's government. He was also one of the
members of the Jordanian team that negotiated Jordan's 1994 peace
treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
He has a strong family background. His father Ahmad Tarawneh,
had served as cabinet ministers, the parliament's Deputy Speaker
and chief of Royal Court from the 1950's to the 1970's.
</P>
<P>
Majali offered resignation late Wednesday due to the complaints
about the economic policy of his 18-month-old government and the
accusation of negligence in the July water pollution in the
capital, that caused several deaths and widespread protests.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Majali at the Royal Court Thursday, Crown Prince
Hassan urged the outgoing prime minister to cooperate with
Tarawneh to ensure the smooth transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
The Regent also expressed thanks and appreciation to Majali and
his government for their efforts in serving the country and the

Robert Mugabe's announcement that Zimbabwe will offer military
intervention to try and resolve the rebel crisis in Congo (K).
</P>

Kabila came to power in May last year after an uprising

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. Asia Strives For Well-being of Children, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- In South Asia, where children
aged under 16 account for about one-third of its total population
of 1.2 billion, notable achievements have been made in efforts for
their survival, development and protection.
</P>
<P>
"The primary focus of the social sector for the member
countries has been the conditions of women and children," said
Kunzang C. Namgyel, director at the Kathmandu-based Secretariat of
the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of the principal areas of cooperation
identified by SAARC from its very inception," she told Xinhua in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
At their second summit in 1986, one year after the
establishment of the seven-nation grouping, SAARC leaders
recognized that meeting the needs of the children was the
principal means of human resource development, and decided that
children be given the highest priority in the national development
planning.
</P>
<P>
A regional consensus was reached at two ministerial conferences
in 1986 and 1992, on sustainable measures to realize the rights of
children to survival, development, protection and participation.
</P>
<P>
A third ministerial meeting on children held in August 1996
adopted a resolution setting a number of goals to be achieved by
2010, including establishing a sustainable social and physical
environment in both rural and urban settings, and reducing under-5
child mortality rate to below 35 per 1,000 births and maternal
mortality rate to 100 per 100,000 births.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also called for enabling all children of primary
school age to complete school at the required level of learning
and the elimination of the evil of child labor from the region.
</P>
<P>
In order to generate greater awareness in the region, the
member states of SAARC -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- observed 1990 as the "SAARC Year
of the Girl Child," 1991-2000 as the "SAARC Decade for the Girl
Child" and 1993 as the "SAARC Year of Disabled Persons."
</P>
<P>
In addition, both national and regional plans of action have
been adopted on children, girl child and the disabled persons. And
all the member countries have ratified the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the non-governmental organizations in the region are
doing a lot in complementing the governments' efforts. SAARC also
works closely with a lot of international agencies like the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) which has been involved in
complementing the efforts of the member countries, Director
Namgyel noted.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of advancement made in this field," she said.
</P>
<P>
When making a mid-decade review in December 1996 of the
implementation of the plan of action for the SAARC Decade of the
Girl Child, a SAARC Technical Committee found that member
countries had made considerable progress in the areas of health
and nutrition and education and literacy.
</P>
<P>
In terms of single state, Bangladesh had run a highly
successful expanded immunization program with immunization of 12
to 23-month infants being nearly universal.
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in primary education there was 79.5 percent for
girls and 81.6 percent for boys, and allocation of funds for
education had increased to three percent of GDP from two percent.
</P>
<P>
In Bhutan, women were treated equal to men under the law and
there was no discrimination against the girl child. The national
plan of action included policies and strategies focusing on
drawing women and girls into the mainstream of the development
process.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese government provided equal opportunity to both the
sexes to avail them of the educational facilities at all levels,
and vocational training was launched for school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
India had done well in reducing child mortality rate from 177
per 1,000 births in 1980 to 109 per 1,000 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
And in that country, enrollment of girls in primary level had
increased from 41.5 percent of total enrollment in 1990-91 to 43.2
percent in 1995-96, and 63 percent of enrolled girls completed
primary education.
</P>
<P>
In the Maldives, girl child had equal chances of survival,
growth and development without discrimination in health care. The
infant mortality rate there was 31 per 1,000 births.
</P>
<P>
Primary education was available for all girls in the atolls and
at least 80 percent of girls of primary school age had seen
completion.
</P>
<P>
Nepal had achieved the goal of one-third reduction in infant
mortality rate. Female literacy rate of 23 percent had been
achieved while the target was 33 percent, and there was a 71
percent rise in budget allocation for education.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government launched a social action program in
1993 to look after child and mother's health and sanitation. And
enrollment in 1995 was 66 percent for girls and 91 percent for
boys in the country.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, 12 out of 13 children survived the first year of
life and life expectancy for females had also increased.
</P>
<P>
Education was free from kindergarten to university for both
boys and girls. Dropout rates were less for girls in every
province in the island country.
</P>
<P>
However, malnutrition and trafficking in girl child, among
others, remained the serious concerns of the member countries.
</P>
<P>
At their 9th summit in May 1997, SAARC leaders decided to
examine the possibility of launching an initiative on nutrition
which aims to promote availability of food of essential
nutritional value to individual household.
</P>
<P>
Namgyel said the SAARC Technical Committee on Health had come
up with a number of proposals in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the member countries are strengthening their
national policies on nutrition, she said. "We have noticed that it
is treated more as a national problem, and not just as a sectoral
problem."
</P>
<P>
At the 10th summit held last month in Colombo, Sri Lanka, SAARC
leaders agreed to sign the Regional Convention on Combating the
Crime of Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution at
their next summit in 1999 and suggested that the scope of the
convention be broadened to cover purposes other than prostitution.
</P>
<P>
They also recommended the exploration of the feasibility of
establishing a Regional Fund for Rehabilitation of Victims of
Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution on a voluntary
basis.
</P>
<P>
Namgyel said the member states are now working on a Convention
on Regional Arrangements on the Promotion of Child Welfare in
South Asia in launching SAARC Decade of the Rights of the Child
From 2001 to 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping that by the next summit we'll also have this
draft convention ready for the member countries to sign," she
said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister, U.S. Ambassador Discuss Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of State for
international cooperation Kiddu Makubuya Thursday discussed with
U.S. Ambassador to Uganda Nancy Powell the worsening situation in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador delivered a message of the U.S. government
on the current situation in the DRC, a press release from the
Ugandan Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides shared the fear that the armed conflict between
troops loyal to DRC President Laurent Kabila and the ethnic Tutsi
soldiers, which has caused untold sufferings to the civilian
population, has been deteriorating so fast that it is getting out
of control and can easily spill over to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that concerted efforts should immediately make to
bring about a cease-fire and find an eventual peaceful resolution
to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has been concerned about the situation in
the DRC. The ambassador had previously met with Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni in northern Gulu district over the
issue.
</P>
<P>
According to British Broadcasting Corporation reports, the
rebel forces have occupied some other towns in the southwestern
part of the DRC, having cleared last obstacles on their way to
the capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The southern African countries seem to be split over the
situation in the DRC. Some countries such as Zimbabwe pledged to
support Kabila militarily while others, like Botswana and South
Africa, prefer to take a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been accused by Kabila of formenting the rebellion
to oust his 15-month-old administration, a charge Ugandan Foreign
Ministry vehemently denied at once.

<HEADLINE> Golan Settlement Expansion Sparks Debate in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Israel's plan to expand
settlements on the Golan Heights sparked a fierce debate Thursday
in which major opposition leaders condemned it as "provocation."
</P>
<P>
A ministerial committee headed by the hawkish National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon approved Wednesday the plan
to build 4,800 new housing units in four settlements in south of
the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, of the leading opposition
Labor party, on Thursday called the plan to build 4,800 units in
four settlements in the Golan Heights as an "unnecessary and
irritating provocation."
</P>
<P>
Yossi Sarid, leader of another dovish opposition party Meretz,
urged Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, regarded as a moderate,
to foil Sharon's plan, saying he should resign if he fails to keep
the plan from being carried out.
</P>
<P>
Sarid said that Mordechai has repeatedly appealed to Syria to
come back to the negotiating table, so he would lose his
credibility if he does nothing to prevent the settlement expansion.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai reportedly said earlier this week that Israel should
withdraw from the Golan Heights, but the depth of the withdrawal
depends on the level of security it obtains from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Sharon has denied that the expansion would undermine the
resumption of peace talks with Syria, saying that it is not
building new settlements but only expanding the existing ones.
</P>
<P>
But Sarid dismissed this claim as "old bad tricks."
</P>
<P>
"There is no difference between establishing new settlements
and enlarging existing settlements," he was quoted by Israel Radio
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, defended Sharon's
decision Thursday, saying the development of existing settlements
was always the policy of his government.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the expansion, Israel was ready to renew peace
talks with Syria at any time, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that the expansion decision would have
severe consequences at a time when Syria was weighing the
positive and negative aspects of renewing talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Haaretz quoted an official Syrian newspaper as
saying Thursday that peace talks with Israel would never resume
without an irrevocable Israeli commitment to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been suspended since early
1996 after making considerable progress on an informal promise made
by the previous Labor government on a withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
While the Netanyahu-led government has repeatedly called on
Syria to resume the talks without any preconditions, Damascus
insists that they should be restarted from the point where they
were left off -- namely Israel promises a full pullout from the
Golan Heights.

ISLAMABAD, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Thursday
reiterated its earlier pledges not to allow anybody to use its

<P>
"The government of Pakistan, for its part, is fully committed

the American decision to withdraw its non-essential diplomats and

<HEADLINE> Nature Is Harming Ozone Layer: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found evidence
suggesting that nature's impact on ozone layer is far bigger than
people thought, The Times newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a fifth of the damage to the ozone layer is being caused
by natural emissions, with the fungi alone releasing 160,000 tons
a year of ozone-killing chemicals, the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
It may mean that the thinning of ozone layer and the appearance
of holes over the Poles could, over hundreds of thousands of
years, be triggered by natural emissions rivalling man-made
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe our use of CFCs is not as catastrophic as we tend to
think, given that natural processes produce similar compounds."
David Harper of Queen's University, Belfast, one of the
researchers, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The research is part of an international effort to uplanet, The Times said.

ATHENS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The rescue teams in Greece
continued Thursday their search for the two pilots who were

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supplies Ahmad Gowaili
said Egypt has increased its wheat self-sufficiency from 20
percent two decades ago to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government target in the immediate future is to become 75
percent sufficient in wheat production, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili, addressing a meeting of students at Cairo University
on Wednesday night said foreign currency reserves at the Central
Bank are now enough to cover the country's imports for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
But he said Egypt should continue to broaden its policy of
agrarian reform and increase wheat and corn production.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt said it is implementing the Arab free trade
zones ahead of schedule in a bid to open new markets for its
products, the Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab free trade zones will be completed by the year 2008 as
stipulated in resolutions adopted by the 1996 Arab Summit in
Cairo. In the next 10 years, customs tariffs will be reduced by 10
percent each year.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt along with several Arab countries did not wait for the
10-year phased period and started immediately to reduce customs,"
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supplies Ahmad Gowaili said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Agreements to this end were reached with Morocco, Tunisia and
Bahrain to do away with customs tariffs within five or seven years
at most, he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar agreements were under negotiations with Lebanon,
Jordan, Syria, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The United Nations Sanctions Committee has approved
seven contracts for Jordanian companies to supply 7 million
U.S. dollars worth of goods to Iraq under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
According to the seven contracts, Jordan will supply Iraq with
veterinary drugs, eggs, fodder concentrates, medicines and milk
powder.
</P>
<P>
This increased the total number of Jordanian-Iraqi contracts
approved by the U.N. to 10, valued at 594,567 dollars, in the
fourth stage of the program.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- There are 28 hotels under construction in Jordan. The
building boom is a result of investors' expectation of a huge
influx of tourists into the kingdom by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
At least 7 million tourists and Christian pilgrims are
expected to buy regional package tours that include Israel,
Egypt, Palestine and Jordan in the coming few years.
</P>
<P>
The new hotels have to be completed by that time to meet the
high wave of tourists.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels Favor Cease-fire Talks: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A leader of Congo (K) rebels
said Thursday he is willing to negotiate a cease-fire in a war
with President Laurent Kabila and appealed to South African
Leader Nelson Mandela to help, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Wamba Dia Wamba, Head of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition, said in Goma in eastern Congo that it is up to
regional leaders to work out a cease-fire to be followed by talks
with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for a cease-fire. We are ready for negotiations
with Kabila because we believe the problems of the Congo are
political and beg a political solution," Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela appealed for talks between the warring sides
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to end the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Wamba said the rebels would favor Mandela's mediation because
other countries in the region had already taken sides.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that the prospects for a political solution
could be jeopardized if Kabila continues his "random arrests and
sporadic killings of Banyamulenge ethnic Tutsis."
</P>
<P>
"We appeal to Mandela to use his weight to stop Kabila from
the widespread killings of Tutsis in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of Congo's ethnic Tutsi community staged a mutiny on
August 2 in east and west Congo to oust Kabila, who seized power
in May last year after a seven-month bush war which toppled late
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stands Firm on Missile Deal: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Thursday that his government is standing firm on the
decision to buy and deploy Russian-made anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being, the decision of the National Council (on
buying the missiles) is still valid," Clerides told reporters upon
return from his vacation.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot National Council is the top advisory body for the
president on handling the protracted Cyprus problem. It insists on
deploying the missiles unless significant progress is made in the
peace talks with the Turkish Cypriots or demilitarization of the
divided island is agreed on.
</P>
<P>
"The government has no plans to postpone the arrival of the
S-300 missiles," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia early last year to buy the
surface-to-air S-300 missiles, which are expected to be delivered
in November.
</P>
<P>
The deal has sparked strong protests from Turkey, which has
vowed to block the delivery of the missiles and threatened to
launch preemptive strikes if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north
and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus to protect
the Turkish Cypriot minorities, who unilaterally declared in 1983
the breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized
only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Polio Drive Successful in Somalia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The largest ever anti-polio
campaign has successfully ended in the central and southern
regions of Somalia despite rampant banditry, a senior health
official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Health Authority (JHA) coordinator, Dr. Mahamud
Dufle, said that the vaccination campaign against polio has been
a total success.
</P>
<P>
Dufle told reporters that almost all of the scopes behind the
vaccination drive had been achieved with what he called the
courage and honest activities by hundreds of Somali volunteers
with the aim of eradicating polio from Somalia and from the earth
by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Even though the latest vaccinated figures are not available in
Mogadishu, more than 180,000 children under the age of five years
are believed to have been given two drops of the vaccine against
polio plus vitamin A for the children between 6 months and five
years.
</P>
<P>
Similar successes against polio have been reported in the
towns of Jowhar and Merca and the regions of Galgudud, Bay,
Bakol, Gedo and Lower Jubba.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the southern port town of Kismayo, 500 kilometers
south of Mogadishu, said that more than 24,000 children under
five had been vaccinated during the campaign in the past five
days.
</P>
<P>
According to JHA, the vaccine planting body, more than 400
volunteers had been operating in Mogadishu alone while at least
2,600 others had been working for the campaign in central and
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
One of the vaccination campaigners was shot dead Wednesday
near the town of Balad, 30 kilometers north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said that the man was killed when he was
carrying a loudspeaker asking the fathers and mothers to bring
their children for free vaccine against polio in the health
centers and posts created for this campaign.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the killing is reported to have been a banditry
act carried out by an unidentified gunman who shot the volunteer
after the latter refused to drop down the loudspeaker.
</P>
<P>
The gunman took away the microphone. And the vaccination
campaigner died of hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
This incident just shows how serious the banditry activities
are in Mogadishu and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
As planned by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), more than 900,000 Somali
children under five had to be vaccinated in the central and
southern regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Dufle said that the Somalis owe a lot to the UNICEF in their
part of the campaign in the public awareness and mass
mobilization programs and to WHO which has offered all of the
related supplies including the vaccine itself.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the campaign will start on September
13-17.
</P>
<P>
This campaign has been inaugurated by faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed who dropped the first two drops of the vaccine into the
mouth of a two-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was also participated by Mr. Ali Ma'ow, the last
small pox victim survivor in the world.
</P>
<P>
He has been telling the Somalis not to become again the last
victim of polio in the world as he happened to have become the
last victim of small pox during its eradication program in 1997.

MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A top official of the Russian
central bank on Thursday criticized Western banks of isolating the
Russian banking system.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Aleksashenko, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank

following Moscow's announcement of a 90-day moratorium on debt
repayments to foreigners, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He listed such moves as a halt on current payments and transfer
of funds on the instruction of Russian banks and the suspension of
deposits on Russian banks' accounts.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to explain to representatives of foreign banks
that this is not normal business practice and we hope that they
will reconsider their approach," Aleksashenko said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted a break-down in recent months of cooperation
between Russian and foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that this is a process of Russian banks being
pushing out of international cooperation," Aleksashenko said.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed confidence that the problems between the
Russian banks and their overseas counterparts would be solved
eventually.
</P>
<P>
He believed that all the problems would be smoothed out in
talks scheduled to start here next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Aleksashenko said CBR Chairman Sergei Dubinin had sent a letter
to heads of central banks of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations and Switzerland, explaining the situation in Russia and
clarifying the measures taken by the government.
</P>
<P>
Already, nonresident investors are expressing fear that they
would be discriminated against in terms of future exchange of GKO
T-bill and OFZ federal loan bonds for new ruble-denominated
securities issued by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Regent European Securities investment
company warned that if nonresidents are discriminated against,
Russia's access to international capital markets would be hampered
for a long time, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said earlier that
the government would redeem 113 billion rubles (16.2 billion U.S.
dollars) worth of GKO and OFZ bonds this year.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said up to 14 billion to 20 billion rubles (about 2 to
2.86 billion dollars) will have to be spent on the redemption and
servicing of GKO and OFZ bonds before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko met Thursday evening with more than 50 officials from
foreign investment banks and companies such as Deutsche Bank,
Citibank, Chase Manhanttan, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
"The topic that we have to discuss today is very difficult for
us," he said before the session, which was also attended by
Russia's chief negotiator with international lending agencies
Anatoly Chubais, Finance Minister Zadornov, Central Bank Chairman
Dubinin and Boris Fyodorov, the newly appointed deputy prime
minister in charge of macroeconomics and state debts.

CAIRO, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The output of sea fisheries in Tunisia amounted to
33,403 tonnes during the first five months of this year, as
compared with 31,446 tonnes during the corresponding period of
last year, an increase of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian daily "Al Sabah" attributed the increase to the
rise in production of blue fish, which amounted to 10,090 tonnes
during that period.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- The volume of Tunisian exports during the first six
months of this year were valued at some 3,205 million U.S. dollars,
whereas imports stood at 4,753 million dollars, a trade deficit of
24 percent, or 1,548 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a source at the Tunisian Ministry of Commerce, the
deficit is basically due to a slowdown of exports of olive oil and
energy material, and an increase in imports of equipment and
machinery.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Foreign investment in Israel plummeted to 1.04
billion dollars in the first half of the year, a 36.6 percent drop
from 1.64 billion a year ago, and a sharper 50.7 percent fall from
2.11 billion in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
Real foreign investment, which is directly spent on the
purchase of Israeli assets, dropped even more drastically by 72
percent from 1.027 billion dollars in the second half of
1997 to 285 million in the first half of this year, according to
official statistics seen here Thursday,
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, financial investments (purchases of Israeli equities
 on either the Tel Aviv or foreign stock exchanges) in the first
half of 1998 dropped by 18 percent to 753 million dollars from 918
million during the same period of last year and by 30.2 percent
from 1.07 billion in the second half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's processed food exports plunged by 12.4
percent in dollar terms during the first half of 1998 compared
with the parallel half of 1997, the first time in seven years that
such a sharp drop has been posted.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Manufacturers Association said the reasons
for the decline include lower exports to Eastern Europe,
intensifying sectoral competition from other countries, and the
fact that the local manufacturers are focusing too much on the
domestic market.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A delegation from Shanghai, China has told the
Israeli government that it is prepared to construct a Tel Aviv
subway system, its coordinator, Linda Tse, told The Jerusalem Post
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The group, headed by a senior official in the Shanghai
Municipal Government, includes nine top executives from the city's
Urban Rail Transit Construction Co. and the deputy director for
business development at the Shanghai Alliance Investment Company.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and his senior
aides this week presented many of Israel's projects currently in
their planning stages to the team from Shanghai, viewed as one of
the most efficient and capable cities in terms of infrastructure
development.
</P>
<P>
The delegation's week-long visit follows Sharon's trip last
month to China, during which he recommended Chinese companies
consider investing in Israel.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Against Iraq to Remain in Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations met on Thursday to conduct the periodic review
of sanctions against Iraq, but no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the meeting of the Security
Council, Council President Danilo Turk said the sanctions review
showed that the necessary conditions for lifting the sanctions
against Iraq do not exist in accordance with Security Council
Resolution 687 of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Turk said the members of the Council reiterated that the
decision by Iraq to suspend its cooperation with the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic
Energy Agency is totally unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Turk said the members of the Council viewed with extreme
concern the continuing refusal by the Government of Iraq to
rescind its decision.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under UN sanctions since its invasion of kuwait
in 1990. Under Security Council's Resolution 687 which was adopted
in 1991, the sanctions against Iraq will not be lifted until it
has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
This is the 40th such review which is held every sixty days as
required by the Security Council Resolution of 687 of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA
after the disarmament talks between UNSCOM and Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz collapsed on August 3.

<HEADLINE> Index, Volume of Russian Stocks Dash to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian blue chips slid 3-6
percent in another slim day of trading Thursday while the
RTS-Interfax composite ruble index fell 5.09 percent to 22,87, a
record low.
</P>
<P>
Russian Trading System volume stood below 4.8 million dollars,
the lowest this year, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The RTS1-Interfax index, which does not include shares of
Gazprom, Russia's largest oil and gas company, was down 4.01
percent from Wednesday's close to 86.57.
</P>
<P>
Market watchers believe stock prices will continue to fall to
the end of the week as the market nervously waits for government
clarification on the restructuring of its ruble-denominated GKO
treasury bills into new Finance Ministry securities.
</P>
<P>
Without the GKO market, stock trading was virtually ground to a
halt, Dmitri Sitrotinin, of Alfa-Kapital Brok, said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian market can only function with the support of
foreign investors, and without them small speculators cannot break
the downward trend, Interfax quoted Sitrotinin as saying.
</P>
<P>
By closing on the RTS Thursday, Unified Energy Systems of
Russia was at 0.06/0.0585 dollar, down 6.3 percent in volume of
10.67 million shares; Lukoil was at 5.045/5.2 dollars, down 3
percent on 700,000 shares; Mosenergo was at 0.029/0.029 dollar,
down 2 percent with 3 million shares traded. Rostelecom dropped 6
percent to 0.9/0.95 dollar with 40,000 shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shares plunged Thursday, forcing trading to be
suspended twice in the afternoon. Gazprom closed at 0.93 rubles,
down 17.7 percent from Wednesday's close.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Police Hunt Man for Swindling Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Police in the Arusha
Region in north Tanzania are searching for a man who swindled a
total of 4,000 U.S. Dollars out of three foreign tourists earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Josiah Mwesiga, the Arusha Regional Police Commander, said
Thursday that Mutta had been notorious for cheating tourists,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Mwesiga said the latest victim was an Australian citizen Nilei
Brenape, who complained that on August 5 Mutta took away 3,400
U.S. Dollars from him and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
Mutta, who met Brenape in Mombasa of Kenya, had promised to
guide Brenape to visit Tanzania's Manyara Lake, Ngorongoro crater
and Mount Kilimanjaro. They concluded the deal but Mutta
disappeared when they arrived in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Mutta also cheated two Dutch tourists of about 370 U.S.
Dollars meant for visiting Ngorongoro but he vanished with the
money.
</P>
<P>
"Police are fed up with this shameful behavior of Mutta," he
said, adding that they are hunting him.
</P>
<P>
Mutta has more than 10 pending cases in courts of swindling
tourists but they failed to proceed because the complainants are
short of time in Tanzania after visiting scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
It has also been alleged that Mutta conspired with the court
judges and police in the past to cover up all the pending cases.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Daniel ole Njoolay, the Arusha Regional
Commissioner, told reporters that the government has laid
strategies in dealing with such kind of "flycatchers" who
swindled tourists.

ADDIS ABABA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's project to
combat rinderpest is a success and one which will serve as an
example in the fight against cross-border diseases, the Ethiopian
Ministry of Agricuture said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Haddera Gebru, Head of Animal and Fishery Resources
Development and Hygiene Technology Supervision Department of the
ministry, told local reporters that 55 million cattle were
inoculated in three rounds between 1989 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cattle in most part of the country have been inoculated
against the disease which has significant economic impact by
causing cattle catastrophe, she said.
</P>
<P>
Gebru said 7,762,350 Birr (1.1 million U.S. Dollars) is
allocated for the execution of the project in 1998/99 fiscal
year, and 77 percent of the money is obtained through foreign aid
while the remaining is allocated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Some 750,000 cattle in 20 frontier towns of southwestern
Ethiopia will be vaccinated in 1998/99, she added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia stands first in Africa and tenth in the world in its
livestock resource, which includes 33 million cattle. Hides and
skins export is the country's second largest export item next
only to coffee.

<HEADLINE> China Stands for Comprehensive Review of Iraqi Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- China sees a
comprehensive review of the Iraq issue as necessary and urges an
early resumption of dialogue between Iraq and U.N. agencies on
arms inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for the Security Council to have a
comprehensive review of the Iraqi Issue as proposed by the (U.N.)
Secretary-General (Kofi Annan)," said Sheng Guofang, Chinese
Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary for the council to give an objective
evaluation of the progress made in disarmament in Iraq, in line
with the stipulations in U.N. resolutions concerned, he told
reporters after the council met for a periodic review of sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sanctions, imposed since 1990 after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Special Commission for
disarmament in Iraq, or UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has dismantled
all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
A standoff emerged on August 5 between Iraq and UNSCOM after
Iraq decided to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM, charging that the
latter is serving U.S. interests to prolong sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Annan has asked the council to comprehensively review the whole
question by engaging Iraq more closely to find ways of resolving
the differences.
</P>
<P>
The council should talk with Iraq directly and the dialogue
between UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
on one hand, and Iraq on the other, should resume as soon as
possible, Sheng noted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Statement on Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The following is the
statement by President Bill Clinton on air strikes at sites in
Sudan and Afghanistan:
</P>
<P>
Today, I ordered our armed forces to strike at
terrorist-related facilities in Afghanistan and Sudan because of
the threat they present to our national security.
</P>
<P>
I have said many times that terrorism is one of the greatest
dangers we face in this new global era. We saw its twisted
mentality at work last week in the embassy bombings in Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam, which took the lives of innocent Americans and
Africans and injured thousands more.
</P>
<P>
Today, we have struck back.
</P>
<P>
The United States launched an attack this morning on one of the
most active terrorist bases in the world. It is located in
Afghanistan and operated by groups affiliated with Osama bin
Laden, a network not sponsored by any state but as dangerous as
any we face.
</P>
<P>
We also struck a chemical weapons-related facility in Sudan.
Our target was the terrorists' base of operation and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Our objective was to damage their capacity to strike at
Americans and other innocent people.
</P>
<P>
I ordered this action for four reasons.
</P>
<P>
First, because we have convincing evidence these groups played
the key role in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Second, because these groups have executed terrorist attacks
against Americans in the past.
</P>
<P>
Third, because we have compelling information that they were
planning additional terrorist attacks against our citizens and
others with the inevitable collateral casualties we saw so
tragically in Africa.
</P>
<P>
And fourth, because they are seeking to acquire chemical
weapons and other dangerous weapons.
</P>
<P>
Terrorists must have no doubt that in the face of their
threats, America will protect its citizens and will continue to
lead the world's fight for peace, freedom and security.
</P>
<P>
Now I am returning to Washington to be briefed by my national
security team on the latest information. I will provide you with a
more detailed statement later this afternoon from the White House.
</P>
<P>
Thank you very much.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Social Tolerance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Thursday called on the Turkish people to create an
environment of toleration in order to maintain national peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ground breaking ceremony of Istanbul
University's School of Theology, Demirel said that both the
secular system and freedom of religion are protected by the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
"There is no contradiction between being a secularist and
being a Muslim," he said.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that 99 percent of Turkey's population are
Muslims but the state is a secular one which has all the features
of modern democracies.
</P>
<P>
He noted that viewing secularism as an antithesis of freedom
of religion would only undermine the country's democratic basis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish president said that the discussions
concerning secularism and religion should be conducted properly so
as not to intensify the social divide.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's powerful military has been urging the government to
take tough measures against the religious radicals and remove
pro-Islamic politicians from their government posts.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, the coalition government headed by former Islamic
Welfare Party's leader Necmettin Erbakan was forced to step down
for the alleged attempt to weaken the country's secular system.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Welfare Party was banned by the
Constitutional Court because of the same reason.

<HEADLINE> Kohl's Rival Unveils Ruling Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder, chancellor
candidate of the Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party
(SPD) Thursday pledged to usher in a new era of modernity and
social justice in Germany in case of an election victory in next
month's national vote.
</P>
<P>
Riding over a consistent lead over German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in opinion polls, Schroeder Thursday presented a short-term
ruling program which he promised to implement within 100 days if
he could defeat Kohl's center-right ruling coalition in the
general elections on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of Schroeder's plan includes a tax reform and a new
"Alliance for Jobs" to combat Germany's high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
According to Schroeder, his tax reform plan would yield a 10
billion mark (5.6 billion U.S. dollar) annual tax cut with
Germany's top income tax rate being trimmed to 49 percent from 53
percent and the lowest rate to 21.9 percent from 25.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although less dramatic than the 30-billion-mark
(17-billion-dollar) tax cut plan proposed by Kohl's government,
the SPD said that their reform package was more feasible given
Germany's financial reality and would bring more social justice.
</P>
<P>
With unemployment standing at near post-war record highs,
Schroeder on Thursday also vowed to resurrect the "Alliance for
Jobs," an joint effort by trade unions, employers and the
government to reduce unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 initiative launched by Kohl's government fell apart
during its first year amid union opposition to a series of welfare
reform proposals by the government.
</P>
<P>
Under his 100-day ruling program, Schroeder did promise to
revoke some cost-saving social welfare and economic reforms
introduced by Kohl's government, including that concerning sick
pays and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Schroeder said that the SPD wanted to restore the
rights of employees.
</P>
<P>
Under his European policies, Schroeder said that he would push
for more European-wide efforts to combat unemployment after
Germany assumes the rotating European Union presidency in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
The SPD ruling program was unveiled as polls show that the
election race has tightened as campaigns enter the so-called "hot
phase" in the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
Although still lagging in opinion polls, Kohl's Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) party has managed to boost its support rate
to about 38 percent currently while Schroeder's SPD is at between
41 percent and 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Kohl has been German chancellor since 1982 and is running for
an unprecedented fifth term.

<HEADLINE> IOC Plans to Establish New Drug Testing Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has proposed to set up a new drug testing agency
to fight against doping in sport.
</P>
<P>
The new organization, the Olympic Movement Anti-doping Agency,
will be in charge of coordinating worldwide efforts to carry out
surprising out-of-competition tests during training, the IOC
executive board decided at a meeting Thursday at IOC headquarters
in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch
told reporters that he hoped the new agency would improve on the
current system by putting all out-of-competition testing under one
umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said that the IOC would propose the creation of an
Olympic movement anti-doping agency to a World Conference on
Doping in Sport scheduled next February in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
The agency will be funded by the billions of dollars that the
IOC receives from television rights for the Games. It will also be
responsible for introducing top-class drug-testing laboratories in
more countries.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the IOC also wanted to introduce a mobile
drug-testing laboratory to be used at major championships in
countries which did not possess IOC-accredited facilities.
</P>
<P>
The proposal still needs support of international sports
federations and national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said the IOC was confident of getting international
federations to agree to its new medical code at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Warns Against Contraband Cigarettes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The National Tobacco
Enterprise of Ethiopia warned Thursday that all cigarettes
intercepted while being smuggled into the country have been found
expired and hazardous for health.
</P>
<P>
Ayalew Abebe, representative of the trade department of the
national tobacco monopoly, told the Ethiopian News Agency that
the enterprise has recently burned 65,000 cartons of contraband
cigarettes after examinations proved that all were expired and
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
Ayalew explained that the cigarettes being smuggled into the
country are exposed to damages due to poor handling.
</P>
<P>
Any tobacco and tobacco products could be imported and
distributed only after they are certified by the National Tobacco
Enterprise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Examined imported cigarettes and tobacco products are marked
with the seal of the enterprise, he said, adding that those
tobacco without seal of the enterprise are unchecked and may be
dangerous for health.

<HEADLINE> Kiriyenko Pledges Transparency in Dealing with Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko on Thursday pledged total transparency in dealing with
foreign investors, the government information service said.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made during Kiriyenko's meeting with more than
50 foreign investors and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was part of the government's efforts to convince
foreign investors to stay in Russia in the face of an effective
ruble devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank will promptly respond to
investor's questions sent to an Internet site maintained by the
Interfax news agency (http://www.interfax-news.com), the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Topics discussed during the meeting included protection of
investors' rights and interests, the outlook for the central
bank's monetary policy in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told the representatives from such foreign investment
banks and companies as Deutsche Bank, Citibank, Chase Manhanttan,
JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch that that developments on the Russian
financial market had forced the government and the central bank to
make tough decisions to stabilize the situation.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the announcement Monday that raised the
ceiling of the ruble's exchange corridor from 6.3 rubles to the
dollar to 9.5 rubles to the dollar and a 90-day moratorium on debt
repayments to foreigners as well as converting ruble-denominated
GKO T-bill and OFZ federal loans into new securities.
</P>
<P>
Some fear that nonresident investors would be discriminated
against in terms of such conversions.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting was also attended by Russia's chief
negotiator with international lending agencies Anatoly Chubais,
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov, Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin and Boris Fyodorov, the newly appointed deputy prime
minister in charge of macroeconomics and state debts.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. not to Allow Sanctuary for Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Thursday that Washington sent a very clear
message by air-striking on a base in Afghanistan and on a plant in
Khartoum, Sudan, that the United States will not allow sanctuary
for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize these strikes will not eliminate the problem. But
our message is clear: There will be no sanctuary for terrorists
and no limit to our resolve to defend American citizens and our
interests... against these cowardly attacks," Cohen told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The strikes were taken place at 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT) at the
order of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I ordered this action... because we have convincing evidence
these groups played the key role in the embassy bombings in Kenya
and Tanzania," Clinton said at a hastily-called news conference
before cutting short his vacation to return to Washington. "Today
we have struck back."
</P>
<P>
"The United States launched an attack this morning on one of
the most active terrorist bases in the world. It is located in
Afghanistan and operated by groups affiliated with Osama bin
Laden," Clinton said, referring to the Saudi-born millionaire
suspected of involvement in the Agust 7 Africa bombings, which
killed more than 250 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded
over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
"We also struck a chemical weapons-related facility in Sudan,"
Clinton said. "Our target was the terrorists' base of operation
and infrastructure. Our objective was to damage their capacity to
strike at Americans and other innocent people."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would provide more information about the
attacks later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen indicated that there may be other operations "that might
be required."
</P>
<P>
Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
confirmed the strikes were made at 1:30 p.m. EDT
</P>
<P>
"At 1:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time, simultaneous military
strikes were carried out against known terrorist training
facilities in remote regions of Afghanistan and an industrial
facility in Khartoum, Sudan," Shelton told the news conference,
where Cohen made the warning.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Supports Russian Anti-Crisis Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 20 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
on Thursday expressed support for Russia's efforts in staving off
the financial crisis, the Russian presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Russian President Boris Yeltsin in an hour-long
telephone conversation that he was confident that Russia will be
able to overcome the current situation shortly, the press service
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discuss international and regional issues
such as Kosovo, stressing the need for joint efforts for a
peaceful solution to the conflicts in the breakaway region of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Yeltsin also called his Ukrainian
counterpart, Leonid Kuchma, the press service said.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as a frank and confidential conversation,
the two leaders exchanged views on the financial crisis on the
world and regional levels and pledged to work together to prevent
further worsening of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The phone calls were made three days after the Russian
government and the central bank raised the ceiling of the exchange
corridor of the ruble from 6.3 rubles to the U.S. dollar to 9.5
rubles to the dollar, which amounted to a devaluation of the
national currency.
</P>
<P>
While the weaker ruble would boost Russia's exports,
neighboring Ukraine would inevitably suffer as 32 percent its
exports were delivered to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Official Accuses Some African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Angola's ruling
People's Movement for the Liberation Angola (MPLA) Thursday
accused certain African countries of supporting the opposition
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Joao Marcelino Tchipingue, the first secretary of MPLA said
that UNITA still has some impact on several countries in the
region, with military bases in some countries for military
training and logistical supply, the Angola News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Tchipingue made the remarks at a meeting in Chibia City,
southern Angola's Huila Province.
</P>
<P>
This will not help the Angolan peace process, he noted, adding
what should be done now is to put pressure on UNITA to make it
comply fully with the Lusaka peace accord signed in november
1994.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Angola is now facing the worst crisis
in four years. UNITA has failed to hand over four major cities
under its control and even snatched back some areas from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The government has issued a warning that UNITA representatives
in the national unity and reconciliation government and national
assembly will have to leave if the former rebel movement fails to
de-militarize by the end of August and move its headquarters to
the capital Luanda.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
preparing to move its staff members out of Afghanistan for
security reasons, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is preparing to move U.N. staff from
Afghanistan, should they wish to do so, and that will be done on
an individual basis," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. employees have been told of a warning by the U.S.
embassy in Pakistan that all non-Moslem foreigners working in
Afghanistan should leave because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
Citing security reasons, Eckhard declined to disclose a
specific number of U.N. staff members in Afghanistan, saying there
were nearly "a couple of dozen" U.N. staff members in the Asian
nation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. statement came shortly before U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced he had ordered U.S. strikes there.
</P>
<P>
All nonessential travels by U.N. personnel inside Afghanistan
had been frozen in a bid to reduce the risk to the staff members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the United Nations continues to operate inside
Afghanistan," the spokesman said, adding that the world body "has
not received any threat."

<HEADLINE> Jordan's New Cabinet Sworn in Before Crown Prince </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amman, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new, 23-member cabinet
was sworn in here Thursday before Crown Prince Hassen, who was
deputizing for King Hussein, the official Petra news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Former Chief of Royal Court Fayez Tarawneh became prime
minister and defense minister, and 10 out of the 23 ministers had
served in the previous government headed by Abdul Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
Majali's government resigned Wednesday after being criticized
for negligence and mismanagement of the economy, whose growth rate
was actually less than 1 percent according to figures released by
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Fayez Rarawneh, 49, once served as ambassador to the United
States and minister of foreign affairs in Majali's government. He
was also one of the members of the Jordanian team that negotiated
the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Ilah Al Khatib, a liberal politician who was ambassador
to Qatar and Egypt, was appointed new foreign minister. The change
is believed to have no influence on the country's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent feature of the new cabinet is the inclusion
of a majority of technocrats.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who is in the U.S. for cancer treatment, wrote a
letter to the new prime minister saying he expects the new
government to fulfill the tasks its predecessor failed.
</P>
<P>
He listed the tasks as being transparent with the public,
pursuing precision of statistics figures, combating poverty and
tapping the potential of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The government's decisions should be "precise, fair and
objective and based on scientific facts, data and precise
statistics," the king said.
</P>
<P>
He said Jordan will continue supporting the Middle East peace
process and work with the Palestinians' legitimate leadership
until they regain their rights and establish their own state on
their national soil.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Tarawneh pledged to work for reform; enhance freedom,
democracy, justice and equality; tackle the problems of poverty
and unemployment; and provide all support for the armed forces to
defend the homeland.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Ends Second Grand Jury Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky finished her
second appearance before the grand jury probing a presidential
affair and alleged cover-up, her spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"She answered all questions truthfully and completely,"
spokeswoman Judy Smith said. "Ms. Lewinsky is now looking forward
to beginning the process of rebuilding her life."
</P>
<P>
Smith said Lewinsky expected the appearance to be her last
before the grand jury but "will continue of course as necessary to
fulfill her obligations to the Office of Independent Counsel."
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky entered a side entrance of the courthouse Thursday
morning, and left through the same door five hours later.
</P>
<P>
Her second appearance was used to test Clinton's account of
their relationship, including how she came to return gifts the
president gave her, as well as specifics of their sexual
encounters, news reports quoted sources familiar with the
investigation as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky testified she and Clinton agreed that she should hand
over to his secretary, Betty Currie, gifts he had given the former
intern, sources familiar with her account said. Mrs. Currie
retrieved the gifts after a subpoena in the sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton raised the possibility that Lewinsky would
be asked to reveal the gifts to Paula Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
Testimony about the gifts could be central to prosecutors'
efforts to build a case that Clinton attempted to obstruct
justice. Clinton was asked about the gifts during his testimony,
legal sources said, but they would not discuss his answer.
</P>
<P>
Several sources said Wednesday the DNA sample from Clinton went
to prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigators so it could be used in
an FBI analysis of a dress that Lewinsky said was stained from a
sexual encounter with the president, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, 25, turned the dress over to Starr's office three
weeks ago after she reached an agreement to testify in exchange
for immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday reaffirmed
her confidence in Clinton as the leader of the administration. "In
all my dealings with the president, he has been to me a person
dedicated to the issues of government," Reno said in response to a
reporter's question. But Reno declined to comment on the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, who is with the vacationing
president at Martha's Vineyard, Mass., Wednesday dismissed any
suggestion that Clinton should resign, saying the president was
"confident that he enjoys the trust of the American people."

<HEADLINE> Unabomber's Brother Awarded for Turning Him In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
gave a 1-million-dollar reward to David Kaczynski for turning in
his brother, Theodore, as the Unabomber, announced Justice
Department spokesman John Russell.
</P>
<P>
David Kaczynski has said he would use the money to ease the
grief of families victimized by his brother's bombs.
</P>
<P>
The FBI had tracked the Unabomber futilely for 18 years before
his capture in a remote, hermit's shack in Montana in April 1996.
Agents involved in the hunt said they might never have found the
reclusive former mathematics professor without the help provided
by David Kaczynski.
</P>
<P>
David Kaczynski approached the FBI through an attorney after he
read portions of the Unabomber's 35,000-word manifesto that
federal agents had prevailed upon The Washington Post to publish.
It reminded him of letters from his 55-year-old brother, who had
moved to Montana after quitting a job at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
Kaczynski's trial ended in a plea bargain last January. In
return for his guilty plea, the government, citing his apparent
mental illness, agreed not to seek the death penalty. He was given
four life sentences in May.
</P>
<P>
In 16 attacks between 1978 and 1995, the Unabomber killed three
men and injured 29 others.

<HEADLINE> Wrapping Bread Causes Controversy in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 20 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government's order to
wrap all bread products in paper packages is threatening to cause
a shortage of bread supply in this country.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the deadline set by the government on all bakeries
in the country to put bread in paper packages for hygienic
reasons, or they will fined or closed.
</P>
<P>
To inspect the implementation of the order, Agricultural
Minister Mustafa Tasar inspected a bakery in Ankara on Thursday
and wrapped bread personally after putting on gloves.
</P>
<P>
He said that bakeries and retail stores selling bread without
packages would be fined 100 million Turkish Liras (363
U.S. dollars) to 6 billion Turkish Liras (21,834 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tasar also reminded the local governments that they should
close bakeries that produce bread under unsanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
But people doubted if it is possible to wrap millions of loaves
of bread by hand in a short time as the bakeries and stores do
not have the necessary packaging machines.
</P>
<P>
About 7 million loaves of bread are being produced daily in
about 40,000 bakeries nationwide, and lots of bakeries which do
not have wrapping machines usually send their products to stores
unwrapped.
</P>
<P>
Other problems also emerged for those bakeries that have bought
new wrapping machines. Some of the packed bread products got
extremely soft and stuck to the nylon wrappers, because they were
wrapped immediately after production.
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems is that the newly baked products
have to be left out to cool for six hours before they can be
packed.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall with Renewed Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 20 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets dipped on
Thursday, weighed down by renewed concerns about the global
economy and with a poor Wall Street opening.
</P>
<P>
London shares fell in a lacklustre trading day, as the FTSE
index slipped 26.9 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,667.4, ending a
four day run on rises.
</P>
<P>
Traders remain concerned about the continuing financial
problems in Asia and Russia, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
"This market cannot keep going in a straight line," said one
sales trader. "Especially with all the negative factors from
overseas still in the background."
</P>
<P>
In addition, a poor start on Wall Street due to a series of
disappointing news from computer stocks, hindered the FTSE's
performance.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares maintained moderate losses for most
of day before the latest round of news of Russian financial
turmoil hit the blue-chip Dax index in the last two hours of
trading.
</P>
<P>
The 30-share Dax index ended the session down 108.19 points or
1.93 percent at 5,488.22. In electronic trade, which continues for
a half hour after floor trading, the Xetra Dax finished 115.17
points or 1.8 percent lower at 5,486.76.
</P>
<P>
The market had been trading some 55 points higher when a
Russian central bank deputy said some major banks could fail
within the next few days. The news sent Frankfurt and other
markets reeling.
</P>
<P>
German banks, which are heavily engaged in Russia were hit and
their shares extended an already weak performance. Deutsche Bank
ended at 130.90 marks, down 3.7 percent, and Dresdner Bank was at
89 marks, down 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks closed 0.93 percent down, as investors were as
well unsettled by a slip on Wall Street and new concerns about the
Russian economy moved in to take profits after the market's recent
rebound.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Cac 40 index closed down 38.23 points or 0.93
percent at 4,087.49. Volume was moderate around 8.9 billion
francs.
</P>
<P>
"People heard the news from Russia, saw the Dow slip again, and
got worried," said one broker. "There is a lot of concern out
there which we think is likely to prompt further losses tomorrow."

Thursday expressed strong support for the U.S. military air
strikes against alleged international terrorists in Afghanistan
and Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Entry to NATO Not to Be Regarded as Favor Made to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, August 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania's entry to NATO ought
not to be regarded as a favor made to it by the North Atlantic
Alliance as "we have something to offer," the national Rompres
news agency Thursday quoted Minister of National Defense Victor
Babiuc as saying.
</P>
<P>
Present Thursday at the National Political Management School
that opened courses in a Black Sea resort called Techirghiol, the
defense minister said that Romania had "a strategic position of
interest for NATO" and "it is a link that is still missing in the
alliance's southern flank."
</P>
<P>
If Romania is admitted to NATO, it could back, alongside
Poland, the statehood of Ukraine that tries to find its own
identity, said Victor Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, the economic aspect is also of interest, and it
is related to the use of the Caspian crude and natural gas
reserves and their transport to Europe. The biggest Black Sea
commercial port Constanta is in Romania with an airport built, and
Romania has railways, pipelines and refineries, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Romania was the first country that signed up for the Partnership
for Peace plan and according to specialists, the results of
cooperation of the Romanian military with NATO forces were
excellent, said Victor Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the program of interoperability with
NATO was implemented. It includes 44 criteria and all of them will
be met by the year 2001. The Romanian Army initiated in 1997 the
creation of a Rapid Reaction Force, that will be 5,000-6,000
strong by the year 2000, said the defense minister.
</P>
<P>
For three years, the army had at its head a civilian dignitary,
and the National Defense Ministry counted more and more civilians,
which is required by NATO from the candidate countries, added
Babiuc.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets With Ghana Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
today spoke highly of Sino-Ghanaian friendly relations and voiced
his appreciation of the Ghana government's adherence to the "one
China" policy.
</P>
<P>
Hu made the remarks during a meeting here today with a
delegation of Ghanaian women led by Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings,
the first lady and president of the 31st of December Women's
movement of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese government
would continue to reinforce and advance Sino-Ghanaian cooperative
ties, which enjoys broad prospects, said Hu, also a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current flood-control campaign in China, Hu
said that heavy floods rarely seen in history have taken place on
China's Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers this year. However,
millions of the Chinese soldiers and citizens, under the staunch
leadership of the CPC and the Chinese government, have so far
overcome one flood crest after another, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
The present flood-control situation remains very serious, Hu
said. "But we are resolved to fight through the flood and win the
final victory," he told Agyeman-Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Hu also expressed his thanks for donations from
Agyeman-Rawlings to China's flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
Agyeman-Rawlings told Hu that the Ghanaian people have profound
feelings toward their Chinese counterparts and the exchanges
between the women of the two countries have promoted bilateral
friendship.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Ghanaian first lady said that she has witnessed
during this visit the great changes that have taken place in China
and the enormous progress the Chinese women have scored.
