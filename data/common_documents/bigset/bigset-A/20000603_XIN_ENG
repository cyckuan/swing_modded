Special vigilance was observed at the airport for checking the

<P>
On Thursday the IA resumed its service between New Delhi and
Kathmandu after a five-month-long suspension of its flights to
Nepal following the hijacking of IC-814 to Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the IA formally announced resumption of its
daily flights from Delhi and five flights a week from Calcutta
from June 1 after India and Nepal entered into a memorandum of
understanding during the visit of Nepalese Foreign Minister Chakra
Prasad Bastola to Delhi earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement that followed prolonged negotiations
between the two countries, the Nepalese authorities have accepted
the demand of IA for installation of an additional X-ray machine
as well as a final check by Indian security personnel at Kathmandu
airport.

<P>
The flights were suspended on December 24 when the IC-814 was

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Back on fast Track of Sustainable Economic Growth: Hun Sen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
staged a vigorous investment promotion Friday by affirming to
Singapore business community that Cambodia is back on the fast
track of sustainable economic growth and time is ripe for them to
invest in his country.
</P>
<P>
"AS Cambodia is back on the fast track of sustainable economic
growth testified by encouraging achievements during the past year,
I am confident that it is the right time for the business
community and investors to make a thorough assessment of Cambodia'
s potential and opportunities and work out a long-term vision for
the country." Hun Sen said in his address at the dinner hosted in
his honor by the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Listing results achieved in 1999 by his government in
implementation of the "Triangle Strategy" put forward by himself,
Hun Sen said that his country's real GDP rose 4.3 percent in 1999
after plummeting to one percent in 1997 and 1998, the inflation
rate fell sharply to almost zero percent following a 12.6-percent
upsurge in 1998, the exchange rate was fairly stable ranging
around 3,800 riels per U.S. dollar and the international reserves
increased by eight percent covering 3.9 months of imports.
</P>
<P>
He also said that tourist arrivals are increasing exponentially
and exports grew rapidly thanks largely to the growing garment
industry which now employs over 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
He said that Cambodia is expected to experience GDP growth of 5.
5 percent in 2000 and six percent in the years afterwards with
inflation kept under the five percent benchmark and the exchange
rate standing stable around 3,800 riels to one U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that his government's most important agenda is
rapid alleviation of the poverty and accelerating economic
progress building on hard, newly gained peace, stability and unity
of territory and goals agreed upon at the national level.
</P>
<P>
On the objectives of his government's development strategies,
he said the thrust targets to achieve long-term sustainable
economic growth at an annual rate of 6-7 percent, equitable
distribution of the fruits of economic growth between the haves
and have-nots and between urban and rural areas as well as between
the two sexes, and sustainable management and utilization of the
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Noting that his country needs financial resources to expand
production and create employment as well as technology, knowledge
and know-how to improve capacity and productivity, the prime
minister said that his government regards the private sector as an
engine of growth and promised to guarantee to all investors a
favorable environment conducive to investment, especially peace,
security, political and macroeconomic stability, efficient legal
and institutional framework, transparency, accountability and
predictability.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen is in Singapore on a three-day official visit and he
has held talks with his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong, met
some other senior Singapore officials and toured Singapore port,
an estate of the Housing Development Board and an international
business park since his arrival on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Final-Status Negotiations Suspended for Three Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian-Israeli final status
negotiations have been suspended for three days so that both sides
would have the chance to consult with their leaders on the issues
concerned, according to Palestinian sources.
</P>
<P>
This came only two days after the two sides resumed
negotiations, interrupted by a upsurge of violence between
Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops, on Thursday at an
undisclosed venue.
</P>
<P>
The sources who preferred anonymity refused to reveal any
details about the talks.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Palestinian leadership late Friday,
Chairman of the Palestinian National Authority Yasser Arafat
emphasized the Palestinian negotiators will not budge an inch on
any of the fixed national rights.
</P>
<P>
He said he will not accept but full implementation of the signed
accords and the relevant international resolutions, particularly U.
N. Security Council resolution 242 which calls for a complete
Israeli withdrawal from all the occupied Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Secretary Madeleine Albright is scheduled to arrive
in the region on Monday to brief Arafat on the outcome of the
summit between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak in Lisbon, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
She also aims to give a new momentum to the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations until both sides reach this month a framework
agreement on the final-status issues including Jerusalem, borders,
settlements, water and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Arafat chaired Saturday night a meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and the
Palestinian National Council (PNC) to discuss the latest
developments.

<HEADLINE> Verification of Israeli Pullout Nears End: Lebanese FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minster Salim Hoss
said negotiations between the United Nations and Lebanon on
verifying Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon have almost
concluded, but some problems still remain, Oriental radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said the two sides have reached understanding on most
points while experts were still working on three border spots now
under Israeli control but over which Lebanon claims ownership.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country will not abandon any of its
territory.
</P>
<P>
U.N. special envoy Terje Roed-Larsen talked with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud here Friday night after his one-day visit to
Syria where he met with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, whose
country is the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen has in recent weeks been shuttling among Lebanon, Syria
and Israel on issues relating to the verification of Israel's May
24 withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local radios said the U.N. Security Council will hold meeting
next Tuesday after Larsen submits his report on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon on Saturday alluded not to link the controversial Shebaa
Farms to the U.N.'s verification of Israeli withdrawal after
Larsen's talks with Shareh, local paper said.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it seized the Shebaa Farms, located on the west side
of Mount Hermon on Lebanese-Syrian border, from Syria in the 1967
Middle East war and that the fate of the farms would be considered
in its peace talks with Damascus when they resume.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon claimed that Syria had bequeathed the 200-square
kilometer fertile farms to it.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria, whose influence in Lebanon is obvious, has
recently suggested that the Shebaa Farms may not be included in
Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Demarcation of Lebanese-Israeli borders was a key part in the U.
N. verification of the Israeli withdrawal. Only after verified will
U.N. peace-keepers move to the border region in south Lebanon
vacated by Israeli occupation troops.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Urges Ruling Coalition to Keep Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
said on Saturday that confidence and solidarity atmosphere should
be kept in the three-way coalition government as well as in the
Parliament, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remark as tension was brewing in Ankara once
again because of a parliamentary commission's decision to file the
ruling partner Motherland Party (ANAP) leader Mesut Yilmaz to the
Supreme Court over allegations of graft in selling a state-owned
plot.
</P>
<P>
Since three deputies of another ruling partner Nationalist
Movement Party (MHP) joined the opposition deputies in the
commission to make the decision against Yilmaz, the two junior
partners within the coalition soured their relations.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz, who was accused of abusing his power during his tenure
as the prime minister of Turkey, was reportedly trying hard to
clear his name of all allegations so that he can join the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coalition rests on confidence between the
partners, adding that the MHP deputies who voted against him at the
commission were acting alone, not representing the decision of
their party.
</P>
<P>
He warned, however, that if one partner of the coalition do not
have confidence in each other, it should leave the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has tried his best to maintain the coalition in unity and
avoid another government crisis which has been seen in last several
months. "The 57th government has made successes in a short period
of time since it took office last May. Its stability has served
Turkish interests greatly and will continue to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition has gone through the failure of a constitutional
amendment to extend former President Suleyman Demirel's term in
office and the success of electing Ahmet Sezer as the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that "most of the public and friendly countries
appreciated our government at present. The main reason is the
confidence and solidarity atmosphere between the coalition
partners."
</P>
<P>
He hoped the coalition, which was composed of his Democratic
Left Party, ANAP and MHP, to keep their reciprocal confidence both
in the government and the parliament.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denies Life of Puppet PM Threatened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Saturday denied press
reports on its threat against the life of Alaa Hussein, captive
head of the short-lived Kuwaiti puppet regime established by Iraq
after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
"The statements Alaa Hussein made to the London-based Arabic
daily Al Sharq Al Awsat are utterly baseless," said Colonel Hussein
Al-Abdessalam, director of rehabilitation institutes at Kuwait's
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A Kuwaiti court recently upheld the death sentence on Alaa
Hussein, who returned to Kuwait from Norway last January to appeal
the death sentence issued in 1991 on charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
Alaa Hussein, who has been kept behind bars since his return,
has again appealed against the death sentence.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Al Sharq Al Awsat published Saturday, Alaa
Hussein said his prison director warned that "I am under threat of
gunshot within the prison."
</P>
<P>
But Al-Abdessalam said special security measures are applied to
all those sentenced to death in order to safeguard their lives and
safety.
</P>
<P>
He said the prison department had dedicated Alaa Hussein a
solitary confinement until his legal procedures is completed.

<HEADLINE> IDB Could Reject Peru 400 Million Dollar Loan: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Interamerican Development Bank (
IDB) could reject a Peruvian request for over 400 million U.S.
dollars in loans because of the political crisis it is undergoing,
economist Humberto Campodonico told the press Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The specialist said that this economic package is part of the
loans pending evaluation by the IDB executive officials and
programmed for disbursement this year.
</P>
<P>
Campodonico said that if the IDB does not approve these loans
for a total of more than 400 million dollars, the government of
President Alberto Fujimori, who was reelected on May 28 for a
third mandate, would be facing a serious problem of public works
financing for his new presidential period.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the IDB loans for road infrastructure do not
arrive, the creation of jobs and the entitlement of land for
agriculture would also be restricted.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government is expecting the resolution to be
adopted in the next days by the Organization of American States
and the U.S. government, to have access to credits by
international financial organizations, among them the IDB.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Labor Organization Calls for Strike Against Petrol Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC)
Saturday Called upon its members and other Nigerian workers to
begin a "seat at home" strike from Thursday June 8, if the federal
government did not rescind the increase petrol price.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of NLC' s central working
committee meeting held in Lagos, the economic capital of the West
African nation, said that "the decision (of the price hike) was
most insensitive, inconsiderate and punitive to the citizens of
this country, especially the workers and masses."
</P>
<P>
The largest labor organization said it had no option than act,
as it had warned earlier. It recalled its past statement that
"should government unilaterally increase petroleum products, labor
will resist with all the powers at its disposal."
</P>
<P>
Nigerian government on last Thursday rose the country's petrol
price by 50 percent to 30 naira from 20 (100 naira equals about
one U. S. dollar) per liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision had met with mixed reactions in the Africa's
largest oil producing country. People in the business sector
generally welcomed the move despite the costs added to their
operation, saying it is inevitable to reduce the large amount of
money spent on subsidizing for a low petrol price.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects 3 Percent Growth in 2000: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan will achieve a 3-percent
economic growth in 2000, significant for the country plagued by a
decade-old recession, thanks to the economic reforms adopted by the
government, Minister of Finance Michel Marto said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state-run Petra news agency, Marto said
the government has won support for most of its reform packages from
the parliament, which he said was crucial for economic growth and
development of the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was also holding talks with the
International Monetary Fund and other major international lenders
on its reforms and the rescheduling its foreign debts, which
currently stood at a record 7.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government headed by Prime Minister Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh has
taken economic development as its top priority since it was
appointed by King Abdullah Bin Hussein some 15 months ago.
</P>
<P>
It has taken drastic measures to reform the ailing economy,
privatizing key but non-profitable state enterprises, allowing for
greater participation in economy by the private sector and foreign
investors and streamlining bureaucratic procedures of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
High on the government agenda was to eliminate poverty and check
unemployment, which official figures put at 14 percent as against
26 percent by independent estimates.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one third of the country's 4.5 million population are
living under the poverty line, or 100 dollars a month, according to
official surveys.
</P>
<P>
However, the kingdom registered a 1.5-percent economic growth in
1999, the first sign of recovery of its economy which has remained
sluggish since the 1990 Gulf Crisis triggered by the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf Crisis, Jordan was isolated by Arab countries, its
most important markets, due to its sympathy with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs Start Discussion on Key Regional Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states later Saturday resumed their 75th
meeting designed to discuss some key issues of common concern at
regional level.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi issue, GCC-Iranian ties and the Qatari-Bahraini border
dispute top the agenda of the meeting, which opened in the western
Saudi city of Jeddah earlier in the day, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the inaugural session he chaired, Saudi Foreign
Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal indicated that the GCC states have
not changed their policy towards Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Faisal said the GCC policy towards Iraq is "based on the
necessity that Baghdad abides by the United Nations resolutions
relevant to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said the Arab states, especially the GCC states --
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates -- have always been keen on employing efforts needed to
protect Iraq's unity and independence and on easing the suffering
of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the Bahraini-Qatari border dispute, Faisal voiced
the GCC states' concern about this issue.
</P>
<P>
But he said the GCC is "reassured about the wisdom of the two
countries' leaderships and their keenness on keeping the row away
from whatever is detrimental to GCC solidarity."
</P>
<P>
Both Qatar and Bahrain are claiming sovereignty over several
small but potentially oil-and-gas-rich Gulf islands, which are now
controlled by Manama.
</P>
<P>
On the GCC-Iranian ties, the Saudi foreign minister renewed
calls to Tehran to positively respond to the drive towards strong
ties based on mutual trust and respect for each other's rights.
</P>
<P>
Faisal urged Iran to cooperate with the efforts of a tripartite
GCC committee in charge of mapping out a mechanism for direct talks
between the UAE and Iran to solve their long-standing dispute over
the sovereignty of Gulf islands -- Abu Musa and the Greater and
Lesser Tunbs -- which are now under Tehran's control.
</P>
<P>
Faisal also touched upon the Middle East peace process following
the Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon late last month.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated Lebanon on the liberation of its land from 22
years of Israeli occupation, which he said would not have been
achieved without the Lebanese resistance.
</P>
<P>
At the same time he blamed the stalemate of the Israeli-Syrian
and Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's intransigent policy,
calling on fellow GCC states to intensify efforts to help push
forward the peace process in the Middle East region.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Gov't to Alleviate Fuel Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Acting Transport and
Energy Minister Simon Moyo Saturday said the government is making
every effort to ensure the constant availability of fuel which
has been in short supply since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Moyo told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the government was
facing a lot of hitches in its efforts to procure fuel supplies,
but was doing everything possible to improve the situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest shortage, which has seen queues reappearing
at service stations, were being caused by a shortage of foreign
currency, as well as problems associated with logistics in
relation to the procurement and delivery of fuel.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Britain of trying to interfere with ships
destined for Beira Port in Mozambique ferrying fuel for Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This interference has taken different forms including the
persuasion of suppliers to double the fuel prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that some ships were failing to berth at Beira to
mysterious circumstances such as missing equipment needed to
facilitate docking.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe continued to receive fuel from the Independent
 Petroleum Group of Kuwait through Beira. The country also
continued to receive supplies from SASOL, ZIMALZAM and ENGEN on
the South African route through Beitbridge by road and rail.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls For Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia calls for lifting the U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 and hopes to expand its
cooperation with Iraq, the visiting Malaysian Foreign Minister
Hamed Al-Bar said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Bar made the remark during his Saturday's meeting with Iraqi
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Al-Bar called on the U.N. Security Council to "
take serious and decisive efforts" to end the decade-old sanctions
on Iraq, as they represent "a flagrant violation of human rights,"
he was quoted by the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
As to the two no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq imposed
by the U.S. and Britain after the 1991 Gulf War, Al-Bar said they
are "illegal and unjustifiable."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and British warplanes have been enforcing the no-fly
zones, which are not covered by any U.N. resolution and thus not
recognized by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister meanwhile expressed his country's
keenness to develop relations, especially trade relations with
Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Aziz appreciated Malaysian government's stance of
solidarity with Iraq, saying that Iraq cherishes its friendly ties
with Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Aziz reiterated Iraq's rejection of the U.N. resolution 1284, as
it does not respond to Iraq's "legitimate demands" and will not
lead to the lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister on Saturday also met Iraqi Oil Minister
Amir Muhammad Rashid and Minister of Industry and Minerals Adnan
Abdal-Majid Ahmad, and discussed with them ways to promote the
bilateral cooperation, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Friday to attend meetings of the Joint Iraqi-
Malaysian Trade And Economic Committee. The last round of meetings
were held in Baghdad in 1989.

<HEADLINE> German FM in Cairo on Regional Issues, Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer arrived in Cairo Saturday afternoon for talks on Middle
East issues, especially the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, with
his Egyptian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Amr Moussa and Fischer will tackle the latest
developments of the Middle East peace process in light of Israel's
withdrawal from south Lebanon, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Fischer will discuss ways to boost the role played by
both Egypt and the European Union (EU) in helping push forward the
peace talks on all tracks, the official news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending its 22-year occupation of a border strip. Syria and Israel
have yet to resume talks on the return of the Golan Heights that
Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War. The
Palestinians and Israel are negotiating for a final peace accord,
with little progress.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel
in 1979, is a key mediator between the Arab countries and Israel.
The 15-nation EU, including Germany, wants to play a major part in
helping seek peaceful settlement of the half-century Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Fischer will also deal with cooperation between the
EU members and Mediterranean countries within the framework of the
Barcelona process, the news agency added.
</P>
<P>
The EU and 12 Mediterranean countries launched the Barcelona
process in 1995 to forge close cooperation in politics, economy,
social issues and security.
</P>
<P>
Also high on the agenda of the talks between the two officials
is bilateral ties. Egypt and Germany maintain close political and
economic relationship. Germany is Egypt's largest trading partner
among the EU members and the second largest aid donor after the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Fourth World Conference on Women (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
convened four world conferences on women in the past quarter of a
century which have been instrumental in elevating the cause of
gender equality to the very center of the global agenda and have
united the international community behind a set of common
objectives with an effective plan of action for the advancement of
women everywhere, in all spheres of public and private life.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth World Conference on Women, which was held in
September 1995 in Beijing, China, is regarded as a new chapter in
the struggle for gender equality. It brought about a new
international commitment to the goals of gender equality,
development and peace for all women and moved the global agenda
for the advancement of women into the twenty-first century.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental transformation that took place at the Beijing
Conference was the recognition of the need to shift the focus from
women to the concept of gender, recognizing that the entire
structure of society, and all relations between men and women
within it, had to be re-evaluated. This change represented a
strong reaffirmation that women's rights were human rights and
that gender equality was an issue of universal concern, benefiting
all.
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Beijing Conference was that it sparked a
renewed global commitment to the empowerment of women everywhere
and drew unprecedented international attention. The Conference
unanimously adopted the Beijing Declaration and Platform for
Action, that was in essence an agenda for women's empowerment and
stands as a milestone for the advancement of women in the twenty-
first century.
</P>
<P>
The Platform for Action specified twelve critical areas of
concern considered to represent the main obstacles to women's
advancement, which required concrete action by Governments and
civil society: women and poverty; education and training of women;
women and health; violence against women; women and armed conflict;
women and the economy; women in power and decision-making;
institutional mechanisms for the advancement of women; human
rights of women; women and the media; women and the environment;
and the girl child.
</P>
<P>
By adopting the Beijing Platform for Action, Governments
committed themselves to the effective inclusion of a gender
dimension throughout all their institutions, policies, planning
and decision-making.
</P>
<P>
In endorsing the Platform for Action, the United Nations
General Assembly called upon all States, the U.N. system and other
international organizations, as well as nongovernmental
organizations (NGO) and the private sectors to take action to
implement its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Within Member States, national machineries that had been
established to promote the status of women were assigned a new
function as the central policy-coordinating unit to mainstream a
gender perspective throughout all institutions and programs.
</P>
<P>
Within the United Nations system, the Secretary-General
designated a senior official to serve as his Special Adviser on
Gender Issues, whose role was to ensure system-wide implementation
of the gender perspective in all aspects of the work of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up to the Beijing Conference, the United Nations
General Assembly will convene a special session from June 5-9 for
the five-year review of the Beijing Platform for Action. The
special session will focus on examples of good practices, positive
actions, lessons learned, obstacles and key challenges remaining.
It will consider further actions for initiatives for achieving
gender equality in the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Women At United Nations  (by Xie Meihua) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- As a renewed effort to
achieve the goal of full gender equality, the United Nations has
set it as the highest priority to achieving gender balance at all
levels with the Organization since the Fourth World Conference on
Women in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To this end, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has initiated
policies to ensure the full implementation of the Strategic Plan
of Action for the Improvement of the Status of Women in the
Secretariat (1995-2000), introduced in 1994. These policies call
for determined managerial commitment and action, including
specific short-term targets and effective monitoring, in order to
achieve the goal set by the General Assembly of 50/50 gender
equality by the year 2000. Although the target has not yet been
reached, great strides have been made to make this goal a reality.
</P>
<P>
The renewed emphasis on achieving gender balance has paved the
way for the appointment of an unprecedented number of women to
senior positions in the United Nations. The secretary-general
appointed a woman, Louise Frechette of Canada, as deputy secretary-
general, the Secretariat's second highest position.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s, women assumed in growing numbers top
leadership positions of several Unites Nations programs and
agencies. They include Carol Bellamy, executive director of the
United Nations Children's Fund; Catherine Bertine, executive
director of the World Food Program; Gro Harlem Brundtland,
director-general of the World Health Organization; Sadako Ogata,
United Nations high commissioner for refugees; Mary Robinson,
United Nations high commissioner for human rights; and Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the United Nations Population Fund.
</P>
<P>
Women are also appointed to other top "cabinet positions"
within the United Nations Secretariat. Currently, Angela King
serves as assistant secretary-general and special adviser on
gender issues and the advancement of women; Rafiah Salim is
assistant secretary-general for human resources management; and
Guillian Sorensen serves as assistant secretary-general for
external relations.
</P>
<P>
And as recently as May 1, 2000, the secretary-general decided
to appoint Danuta Hubner of Poland as executive secretary of the
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. She is the first
women ever to hold the position of executive secretary of a United
Nations regional commission.
</P>
<P>
In addition, three of the other four U.N. regional commissions
have women as deputy secretaries of the Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia, the Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the pacific, and the Economic and Social Commission
for Africa respectively.
</P>
<P>
With the surge in appointments of women to policy-making and
leadership positions, the United Nations has achieved a standard
that most of its Member States have yet to attain.
</P>
<P>
The number of women in senior and policy-making positions within
the United Nations Secretariat has increased significantly. Women
now constitute 24.5 percent of those holding positions at the
director level or above. Overall, women accounted for 38.9 percent
of all professional and higher level staff as of March 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the progress in recent years, the United
Nations still clearly falls short of the goal set by the General
Assembly for full gender balance at all levels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
While the Strategic Plan of Action has generated a significant
increase in the number of women appointed to senior level posts,
it has not had the same positive effect with regard to women's
overall representation at the professional level, which continues
to rise at the rather slow rate of 1.2 percent annually. At the
current rate, the goal will not be reached before the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
The efforts made by the United Nations have changed the face
of the Organization and have been an integral part of the ongoing
efforts to address the existing gender imbalance that goes against
the founding principles of the Organization.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President in Moscow for Summit With Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived
here Saturday for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin
that is expected to be dominated by arms control.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival, Clinton went to the Kremlin for
supper and jazz with Putin, their first meeting since Putin took
office early last Month.
</P>
<P>
Putin was hosting an informal dinner for a "narrow circle"' of
guests in his private apartment in the Kremlin, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clinton flew in from Germany on the penultimate leg of a week-
long tour of Europe. He is scheduled to leave for Ukraine Monday
at the end of his three-day working visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will meet Sunday for a day of summit talks that
are likely to be dominated by arms control, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
Another three meetings between Putin and Clinton are planned
this year, the Interfax news agency reported. The summits will
take place at the G-8 meeting in Okinawa, Japan, in July, at the
Millennium Assembly in New York in September and at the Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation informal leaders meeting at the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Moscow and Washington warmed up recently, but
major differences remain over such issues as missile defense and
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russia is strongly opposed to U.S. attempts to develop a
missile defense system that violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missiles treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, on the eve of Clinton's arrival, Putin suggested to
Washington that a joint missile defense system be created.
</P>
<P>
Besides arms control, the two sides will also discuss such
issues as international terrorism, economic cooperation and Russia
's bid to join the World Trade Organization, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.

<HEADLINE> French Navy Ships on Alert for Possible Mission in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Two French navy transport ships have
been put on alert for a possible mission of dispatching troops to
Lebanon for an expanded United Nations peacekeeping mission,
reported Agence France-Presse (AFP) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two navy barges specialized in launching landing operation,
"Foudre" and "L'Orage," cut short their participation in a NATO
maneuver on the Greek coast and have returned to Toulon, a major
navy base in southern France, AFP quoted unidentified officers at
the office of the French armed forces' chief of staff in Paris as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The move is a "measure of precaution" and does not indicate an
impending departure of more French troops for Lebanon, said the
same sources.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said Wednesday that
France has not made any decision on sending more troops to Lebanon
because the Lebanese government has not yet promised to deploy
government troops to control the border area with Israel.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested the
expansion of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
from 4,500 to 7,900 after Israel pulled out its troops from
southern Lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
France has 250 troops in the UNIFIL, which was deployed by the
U.N. in Lebanon in 1978.

well go beyond the United States.

On Friday, Clinton received the Charlemagne Prize in the German
town of Aachen for his contributions to European unity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Expert Advocates Closer Turko-Chinese Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish foreign policy expert has
in an article called on Turkish entrepreneurs to be more active in
doing business with China.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel Soylemez, veteran diplomat and co-chairman of the Foreign
Policy Institute, said that both China and Turkey are among the big
emerging markets with great economic development potential.
</P>
<P>
The article was carried by the English-language Turkish Daily
News, which devoted a full page to it on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting World Bank statistics, Soylemez said that investment in
infrastructure projects in China is expected to exceed 700 billion
U.S. dollars up to 2004 and beyond. "The construction of the Three
Gorges Dam, expected to cost 24.6 billion dollars and scheduled to
be completed in 2009, is one example among many others," he added.
</P>
<P>
He asked "Why should private Turkish construction companies not
be involved in the infrastructure projects in China?" noting that
Turkish construction firms have completed projects worth nearly 60
billion dollars in the Middle East and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"There are only five small Turkish companies in China involved
in industrial and agricultural production. Their investment is a
mere 16 million dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "up to now, foreign companies have been determined to
be in the Chinese market whatever the cost is," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit to Turkey in April, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin invited Turkish entrepreneurs to participate in the
gigantic development scheme of Western China currently underway.
</P>
<P>
Soylemez said tourism is another sphere of closer cooperation
between the two countries, adding that Turkish Airlines (THY),
which runs a route between Turkey and China, expected that Chinese
overseas tourists will take an increased interest in Turkey in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
Soylemez stated in the article that China is one of the largest
trade economies in the world, and with China's prospected accession
into the World Trade Organization, "its importance is ever
increasing."

<HEADLINE> 39 Stand Trial for Involvement in Riot in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-nine people went on trial
Saturday for a spillover riot in southern Egypt last January, prior
to a main trial for those charged with killing 20 Christians and
one Muslim in the town of Kosheh in Suhag Governorate.
</P>
<P>
The 39 people are charged with armed robbery, destruction of
public property, illegal gatherings and illegal possesion of
weapons during the riot in Dar al-Salam, which left five people
injured.
</P>
<P>
The trial opened at the criminal court in Suhag, capital of the
governorate, which is 400 kilometers south of Cairo, according to
the Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The riot, in which Coptic Christian businesses were burned and
ransacked, erupted hours after 21 people were killed in the
neighboring town of Kosheh, all but one of them Copts, on the
nights of January 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-six people who are implicated in the Kosheh massacre,
including 38 charged with murder, are to stand trial on Sunday in
the same Suhag court.
</P>
<P>
As the rest of the world was celebrating the turn of the
millennium, trouble broke out on December 31 in the mainly
Christian town of Kosheh, sparked by a financial quarrel between a
Muslim and a Coptic merchant over a piece of cloth.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one people were killed, 44 others injured in the Kosheh
riot which spread to Dar al-Salam on the back of rumors that Copts
working at Kosheh water plant had poisoned the water supply to kill
Muslims.

by Goddio discovered the treasures in two years of exploration and
excavation, during which they found the remains of the ancient
Greek town of Herakleum, where the Greek God Hercules was
worshiped, Goddio said.
</P>
<P>
The finds included statues, sphinxes and columns from ancient
Egypt, some dating to the 26th dynasty (seventh century BC) and the
30th dynasty (fourth century BC), he added. Coins from the
Byzantine and Islamic eras were also found.
</P>
<P>
He termed the discovery as a key step in helping unravel the
ancient Egyptian civilization drowned in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Herakleum is the second city which was found deep in the
Mediterranean water after Menouthis was discovered in 1934. They
were among six cities which were built in the Greek era (332 BC to
305 BC) and sank into the sea in a major earthquake in ancient
times.

<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 11 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) light buses and
five electric light buses will take part in the six-month trial
starting operation on June 5, the World Environment Day.
</P>
<P>
The light buses will run on eight routes covering roads with
different conditions.
</P>
<P>
Electric light buses emit no pollutants during operation while
LPG light buses emit only a negligible amount of particles and 50
per cent less nitrogen dioxide compared with diesel light buses,
said a spokesman for the Hong Kong Environmental Protection
Department.
</P>
<P>
The trial will collect local operational data of LPG light
buses and electric light buses and see whether these vehicles can
meet the local commercial operating conditions.
</P>
<P>
If the trial is successful, the government will work out a
scheme to introduce these clean alternatives to phase out diesel
light buses, said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Sends More Troops to Embattled Jaffna  Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has sent another 4,000
soldiers to defend the northern Jaffna peninsula where some 30,000
troops have been battling separatist Tamil Tiger rebels, a senior
government official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Defense General Anuruddha Ratwatte said the
reinforcements were already on their way to Jaffna via the north-
eastern port of Trincomalee.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very critical period, a very decisive moment,"
Ratwatte said in a phone-in program over state radio.
</P>
<P>
He said the military situation in Jaffna was still critical,
but with an improvement in troop morale, reinforcements and new
weapons, they were able to defend Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, fighting
for a separate state for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and
east parts since 1983, mounted a ferocious offensive in recent
weeks in a bid to retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
With recent spectacular military gains, the LTTE rebels began
pushing towards Jaffna, raising concern for the safety of 30,000
government soldiers and half a million civilians in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Ratwatte said the military had stopped retreating and
had begun a counter-offensive against the LTTE, as the political
leadership was determined to defend Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
He said a large number of deserters were rejoining as the
military was gaining the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Ratwatte said after a 12-day trip to Jaffna
a shake-up of Sri Lanka's field commanders and new weapons boosted
morale and reversed the "withdrawal syndrome" of troops defending
Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Forces Retake Strategic Position in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone
have retaken a strategic road junction after battling with rebels
of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
The RUF fighters on Friday fired rocket-propelled grenades at
an Indian battalion of some 400 troops, but inflicted no
casualties, reports reaching here Saturday from Freetown quoted
U.N. spokesman David Wimhurst as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. soldiers "responded with heavy machine gun fire and
have reoccupied Rogberi -- which is a very important position for
us -- and they have dug in defensively," Wimhurst said.
</P>
<P>
"Our presence there will certainly stabilize the area", he
added.
</P>
<P>
U.N. troops withdrew from Rogberi early last month after the
RUF took hundreds of U.N. hostages and advanced towards the
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Rogberi Junction lies some 18 kilometers west of the town of
Lunsar on the road to the rebel controlled diamond-mining areas in
the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The pro-government forces withdrew on Wednesday from Lunsar
after eight- hour fighting with the rebels. Following their first
major setback, they, backed by the U.N. forces, launched a
counter-offensive.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Launches Attack on Assab Front: Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopia forces launched an
all-out attack on the new Assab front at 3:30 am Saturday,
Eritrean Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement reaching here Saturday morning said that intense
fighting was continuing.
</P>
<P>
It said "the Eritrean frontline at Assab is a new frontline set
at 37 kilometers west of the Red Sea port city and the original
frontline was at Burrie, 71 kilometers from the port city."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea redeployed to this new position is response to the
express appeal of Abdelaziz Bouteflike, chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Algerian President, the
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea completed redeployment to the new frontline last Sunday
which was verified by the diplomatic community in Eritrea and the
international press which visited the area on May 30," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia's offensive on the Assab front deep into Eritrean
sovereign territory demonstrates, once again, that the war it has
launched has nothing to do with a border conflict," the statement
said, adding "this is purely a war of invasion."
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government called upon the international community
and the OAU and its partners to condemn Ethiopia's war of invasion
and the offensive that it had launched on the Assab front.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea Friday also accused Ethiopia of carrying out a bombing
raid on the city water depot in Assab on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia launched a massive offensive along the common border
three weeks ago, advancing deep inside Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of Africa countries are now involved in peace
talks being brokered by the OAU in Algeria.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staffers Held Hostage in Georgia, One Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A group of U.N. military observers
missing since Thursday has been confirmed as being kidnapped in
Georgia's breakaway Abkhazia region, the Interfax news agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
One of the observers has been released, Interfax said, citing
Veselin Kostov, political secretary of the U.N. military
observers' mission in the former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The released hostage was identified as Ismet-Zade, an ethnic
Abkhaz with the Yellow Trust mine disposal organization.
</P>
<P>
He said all three remaining hostages, including a female
interpreter, are alive.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified abductors said they would get in touch with
authorities to put their demands, said Kostov.
</P>
<P>
Ethic unrest in the Abkhazia region escalated into armed
conflict in 1992. In September 1993, separatist forces captured
Sokhumi, the regional capital.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 7,000 people died in the conflict before a cease-
fire agreement was reached in May 1994 under Russian auspices. A
peacekeeping force of 2,500 troops of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) was sent to patrol the borders of the
region.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994, the Abkhazian legislature declared the
republic sovereign. In 1996, CIS leaders agreed to impose economic
sanctions against Abkhazia until it willingly returns to Georgia.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Donald Tsang, Financial Secretary
of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, reiterated Saturday
the five-year IT education strategy aimed to boost the development
of information technology in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"In 1998, we set out a five-year IT education strategy, and so
far we have earmarked 3.2 billion HKD (410 million USD) for
capital expenditure and 590 million HKD (75.6 million USD) for
recurrent expenditure to implement the initiatives in stages,"
said Tsang at the prize presentation ceremony of the Web Design
Competition.
</P>
<P>
The target of the strategy is to, within five years, make all
Hong Kong school children master the general application of IT and
be equipped to become life-long learners with inquiring and
creative minds, according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He said IT is the blueprint of Hong Kong's future and the
driving force for its economic growth and expansion.
</P>
<P>
"It is important therefore that we nurture a technically savvy
workforce to safeguard our economic future," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the prize-presentation ceremony, a total of 43 young people,
their mentors and their schools were awarded prizes.
</P>
<P>
The 11 winning web-pages were selected from 375 entries
submitted by 1,653 youngsters and 217 mentors.
</P>
<P>
The Web Design competition was jointly organized by the
Business and Services Promotion Unit of the Financial Secretary's
Office and South China Morning Post between last December and this
March to enhance public understanding of Hong Kong's service
economy and promote the use of IT skills and language
proficiencies among local young people.

</P>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Avian Paleontologist Zhou Zhonghe
today received a gift from one of his American colleagues -- a
blue Indian token of "Dream Catch".
</P>
<P>
Indian legends say that the feathered ornament will help its
owner to catch all his dreams.
</P>
<P>
As China's first curator of bird fossil, Zhou is trying to
unravel the mysteries of the relationship between dinosaursand
birds and the origin of flight.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old scientist has also been named as one of China's
100 most outstanding academic leaders in the 21st century chosen
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the state's top
scientific research organ.
</P>
<P>
Together with colleagues at the CAS Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), Zhou found a huge
reserve of Mesozoic bird fossils in 1990 near Chaoyang, northeast
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's discovery of fossilized creatures and missing links in
the evolution of birds has been highly praised by his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the young scientist has combined his own dream with
the research of primitive birds.
</P>
<P>
During his studies at the University of Kansas in the United
States, Zhou shared differences of opinion with his teacher
regarding the relationship between dinosaurs and birds. "I don't
like any personal attack, but neither do I like agreeing on
opinions without solid scientific evidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou spends at least three months a year on fieldwork in the
surrounding areas of Jehol Biota in Liaoning province.

</P>
<P>
The authoritative scientific journals "Nature' and "Science"
published four articles co-authored by Zhou, showing the latest
discovery of Jehol Biota, which has been widely regarded as
competing with Solenhofen in Germany where Archaeopteryx fossils
were unearthed.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the avian paleontologist was invited to give a keynote
speech at an international meeting of the origins and evolution of
birds at Yale University, an important center for paleontology.
</P>
<P>
He was also chosen by the United States National Geographic
Society as among the world's most prestigious scientists.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Miman, CAS academic and chairwoman of the organizing
committee of the Fifth International Meeting of the Society of
Avian Paleontology and Evolution and the Symposium on Jehol Biota,
values Zhou as "a extremely promising paleontologist and a rising
star."
</P>
<P>
When delivering a speech to the international meeting in
Beijing, Zhou expounded his hypothesis that Caudipteryx, a kind of
small dinosaur living some 120 million years ago, could perch on
trees and glide through the air among the trees.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the find is further evidence supporting the
theory that birds originated from dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining his doctoral degree at University of Kansas,
Zhou came back to work in CAS institute.
</P>
<P>
"I favor the research atmosphere at home," he said, "and I will
never feel lonely here. I'm sure that I can catch all my dreams
in China," Zhou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- World paleontologists who are
attending an international academic meeting here said that the
recent stunning discoveries made by Chinese scientists make China
one of the major centers of paleontological research.
</P>
<P>
Honoring the achievements of the Chinese scientists, the
Society of Avian Paleontology and Evolution granted the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) the privilege to host the society's
fifth international meeting and the symposium on Jehol Biota.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years, the authoritative scientific journals "
Nature" and "Science" published 14 articles written by Chinese
experts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, fossils of "feathered" dinosaurs such as the
Sinosauropteryx, the Peipiaosaurus and the Sinornithosaurus have
been discovered in western part of Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
As a Mesozoic site, Jehol Biota has fossil remains of mammals,
frogs, lizards and the earliest angiosperm.
</P>
<P>
"Jehol Biota not only records Mesozoic history, but also
symbolizes the cradle for Neozoic creatures," said Wang Yuanqing,
deputy chief of the CAS Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and
Paleoanthropology (IVPP).
</P>
<P>
Scholars in the west regard Jehol Biota as another Solenhofen,
a German geological base which embodies Archaeopteryx fossils.
</P>
<P>
"So far as category, quantity and complete fossils, Jehol
greatly exceeds Solenhofen," said Wang, CAS professor who led the
scientific research team in Liaoning.

Constant volcanic eruptions some 100 million years ago resulted
in the fossils remaining in good condition.
</P>
<P>
Scientists could also obtain fossilized skin structures and
other soft tissues which are extremely valuable for estimating
physiological behavior of creatures and the environment, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Jehol Biota has been listed as a key state project with an
investment of nearly 20 million yuan (2.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We divided the whole project into eight subjects to thoroughly
study the origins, dissemination, extinction of this primitive
creatures," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The articles concerning Jehol Biota occupied one third of 32
papers on basic natural studies published by the CAS in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring areas of Jehol Biota have attracted fossil
smugglers from around the globe. Many Mesozoic fossils have been
smuggled out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have called on all major organizations in
the world to ban any trading of fossil and protect limited
resources.

members include all influential avian paleontologists from around
the globe.
</P>
<P>
Cecile Mourer-Chauvire from France was selected as secretary-
general of SAPE in 1984. She was responsible for examining
members' qualification and contacting members.
</P>
<P>
Except for the secretary-general, the organization of SAPE has
not been very clearly defined. The selection of the first
executive council is thus among the some of the urgent tasks to be
addressed at the fifth meeting here hosted by IVPP.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Campbell from the United States has been chosen as
president of SAPE council. Vice president, secretary-general, and
members-at-large from different continents have also been selected.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South China from Hong Kong SAR
scored an upset here on Saturday by stunning powerhouse Yugoslavia
's national team 4-2 in a soccer friendly.
</P>
<P>
The local hosts unleashed a string of pressure on the visitors'
defense, especially in the first half, and made sound use of their
attempts.
</P>
<P>
Four minutes into the game, forward Zeljko Gavrilovic of
Yugoslavia opened the account for the Hong Kong club by rubbing a
pass from Lee Kim Wo, and added one more 21 minutes later by
rushing into the box after catching a long pass.
</P>
<P>
As the hosts kept attacking, Lee Kim Wo delivered a delicate
pass to captain Cheng Siu Chung, who left-footed the ball into the
net for a comfortable 3-0 margin.
</P>
<P>
To prevent its first line-ups from injury for the up-coming
European Championship a week later, Yugoslavia substituted seven
players and striker Mateja Kezman broke his team's deadlock by
heading home in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the hosts were in high spirit and defender Lee Wai Tik
slammed home outside the box three minutes later, dampening any
winning hope for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Although it netted again through a free kick in the 90th minute,
Yugoslavia still suffered its first defeat in its Asian tour after
a 2-0 over China one week ago, and two goalless ties against South
Korea.

Foreign Trade Academy, told Xinhua that China is in the midst of a
dramatic shift in its use of foreign investment, adding that
agriculture will become a promising target for foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural industry currently receives only two percent
of the foreign capital flowing into China.
</P>
<P>
Ma believed that a further open agro-market and appropriate
policies will make agriculture a key sector for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
He said that as China's entry into the World Trade Organization
(WTO) approaches, the country must make a strategic change in the
focus of foreign businesses and ways of attracting foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should encourage international
corporations to purchase or merge Chinese enterprises by
initiating a series of reform, such as establishing stock and
property rights trading markets, mapping out new laws and
regulations, and redistributing the State assets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the contractual foreign capital approved
by the Chinese government in 1999 sank by 20.9 percent to some 41.
2 billion U.S. dollars. The foreign capital actually flowing into
China dropped by 11.37 percent to 40.398 billion U.S. dollars in
the same year.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that China will see more foreign capital when it
diversifies modes of absorbing foreign funds.

<HEADLINE> General Zhang Xueliang's 100th Birthday Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A number of activities were held
today in Shenyang, capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province,
to celebrate the 100th birthday of General Zhang Xueliang who now
lives in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Born on June 3, 1901 on a horse-drawn carriage in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, General Zhang Xueliang is famous for
his part in the Xi'an Incident in which he and General Yang
Hucheng arrested Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the Kuomintang (KMT),
on December 12, 1936. The incident was eventually settled
peacefully with the efforts of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang was imprisoned by Chiang soon after the incident,
and spent decades under house arrest in Taiwan under the KMT while
General Yang was tortured to death in a KMT prison in September
1949.
</P>
<P>
A museum based on the former residence of the 100-year-old
general in this northeast Chinese city attracted a steady stream
of visitors.
</P>
<P>
Many took pictures with General Zhang's portrait carved out of
a black marble by Chifeng Stone Arts and Crafts Company of Inner
Mongolia. The black marble portrait was specially made to mark the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
On display were some 300 pictures and reference materials as
well as more than 100 paintings and calligraphy featuring General
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
A forum was also held by historians and specialists recalling
the general's deeds and his concerns about the reunification of
the motherland.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Police Invasion of Senate President's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian police have forced into
the residence of the Senate President Chuba Okadigbo in the
capital Abuja following the long-running face-off between the
executive and legislative arms of the government, newspapers here
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the police surrounded Okadigbo's home
Friday, but failed to press him to hand out his power.
</P>
<P>
The surprising drama seemed to be one of the peaks of a long-
standing row between President Olusegun Obasanjo and the senate
president.
</P>
<P>
"I have to be dead before you get the mace," Okadigbo was
quoted  as saying in Abuja after the event.
</P>
<P>
But, President Obasanjo has denied any involvement in the
police invasion of the residence of Okadigbo, saying that the
immunity granted the leaders of the National Assembly by the
constitution cannot be questioned.
</P>
<P>
Okadigbo, who is the third most powerful politician in Nigeria
after the president and vice president, said the police withdrew
from his Abuja home after he refused to hand over the mace, which
symbolizes the authority of Nigeria's upper house of the senate.
</P>
<P>
The police action followed a decision on Wednesday by Okadigbo
to adjourn the Senate until July.
</P>
<P>
This prompted some senators and members of the government to
call for his removal.
</P>
<P>
"They told me they had come to collect the mace and that they
were acting on orders from the Inspector General of Police,"
Okadigbo explained.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has repeatedly criticized the senate for
being responsible for the constant delays in passing vital bills,
such as the anti-corruption bill or the 2000 federal budget into
laws.
</P>
<P>
The senators on the other hand accuse President Obasanjo of
acting unilaterally in issues that require the approval of the
senate.
</P>
<P>
The tussle between the executive and the legislature came to a
head on May 29, when Okadigbo and other senators boycotted
celebrations marking the first anniversary of the new civilian
government after 15 years of military rule.
</P>
<P>
The day was declared a public holiday that was celebrated as
Democracy Day, but the senate leader said President Obasanjo did
not have the right to declare the day a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has been making appeals to Nigerians
recently, calling on them to put pressure on their lawmakers in
order to speed up the government's reform of state institutions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government of Nigeria has granted pardon to a
former speaker of the Lower House of the Senate, Ibrahim Salisu
Buhari, who was convicted last year of perjury and forgery,
according to reports of Nigerian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government said on Thursday the presidential pardon to
Buhari was decided in Abuja at a meeting of the Council of State
which includes governors of all Nigeria's states.
</P>
<P>
Presidential pardons were also announced for 14 other people,
including four journalists and two human rights activists
convicted of involvement in a failed 1995 coup plot.

<HEADLINE> Manila Remains Hopeful of Basilan Hostages Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Saturday that it can still ensure the safe release of the eight
remaining hostages held by the extremist Abu Sayyaf in Basilan.
</P>
<P>
Robert Aventajado, chairman of the presidential flagship
projects committee, said in a radio interview here that the
government will do what it can to secure the hostages' freedom.
</P>
<P>
"There is still hope. I intend to deal honestly with the
hostage takers," said Aventajado, the chief government negotiator
tasked to secure the safe release of 21 hostages, mostly
foreigners, being held by the Abu Sayyaf in the southern province
of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said he is now verifying whether the Basilan
hostages are in the hands of an Abu Sayyaf faction that offered to
turn over the hostages to him. The hostage takers in Basilan
reportedly have sent feelers that they want to turn over their
captives to Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
Citing reports reaching his office, Aventajado said the Abu
Sayyaf is still holding eight hostages in Basilan, including two
teachers, five students, and the son of a soldier who was killed
in a clash with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The students and teachers were among scores of hostages taken
by the Abu Sayyaf on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Government troops started rescue operations on April 22,
resulting in the safe recovery of 17 hostages. The Abu Sayyaf
killed six of the hostages, including a priest.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado said the turnover of the remaining hostages was to
take place earlier this week, but it did not push through after
this was leaked in the media.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating the government's no-ransom policy, Aventajado ruled
out any payment for the release of the Basilan hostages.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Allows Internet Merchant Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- In a landmark decision, State
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has authorized all banks of the country to
open Internet Merchant Accounts which shall enable online business
transactions.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, this decision was made at a
meeting of SBP Governor Ishrat Hussain with federal Science and
Technology Minister Atta ur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
At present around 3,000 applications are pending with Pakistani
banks for internet merchant accounts and this facility will allow
local exporters to tap the global market through the net.
</P>
<P>
So far Pakistani exporters have been paying heavy discounts on
internet-based transactions as the payments made for Pakistani
goods and services through credit cards are held outside the
country.
</P>
<P>
In another decision, SBP has approved an expedited shipment
plan for orders received through the websites.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a single internet order with a value of up to
500 dollars will be allowed without the formality of filing in an
E-form and would be treated as a courier dispatch.
</P>
<P>
This would reduce the custom clearance time and the customs
department is being asked to give same day priority clearance to
such internet export orders, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is lagging behind in net-based trade and banking
activity and other Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-
Customer (B2C) forms of E-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Only a small number of Pakistani companies have entered the B2C
arena and even fewer have developed websites and booked orders on
the internet.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Burundi Agree to Curb Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Burundi have
agreed to exchange information to crack down smuggling through the
Lake Tanganyika and other illegal entry points, local newspapers
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a memorandum of understanding signed here on
Thursday, customs departments of the two countries will carry out
joint patrols on the Lake Tanganyika and inform each other of ways
that smugglers use to transport goods.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, signed by Burundian Director for Customs and
Excise Pierre Claver Gahungu and Tanzanian Commissioner of Customs
and Excise Department George Lauwo, identifies smuggled high duty
transit goods as oil, cigarettes, textiles, electronics, sugar,
garments, wines, beer and spirits.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to shipment of high duty transit goods to Burundi, the
customs administration in Burundi should confirm to its
counterpart in Tanzania the list of importers. The arrival of the
goods at intended destinations should also be confirmed," the
memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum said that the customs administration in Burundi
should furnish its Tanzanian counterpart orders of fuel made
through letters of credit.
</P>
<P>
"To make the transit corridor competitive, the customs
administration in Tanzania should waive the transit bond security.
Briefcase customs agents should not be allowed to handle transit
cargo," the memorandum said.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring states also intended to curb illicit drug
trafficking and enforce existing customs laws.
</P>
<P>
Burundian authorities would be required to submit a list of
customs agents authorized to handle cargo destined for Burundi.
And designate entry points of its transit goods through Tanzania
should also be identified.
</P>
<P>
To curb dumping and smuggling of transit petroleum products in
Tanzania, the two departments have agreed that Burundi Customs
Department will furnish the Tanzania Revenue Authority a list of
all oil marketing companies in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Burundi Defense Forces have
released eight Tanzanian fishermen and one from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo who were abducted on the Lake Tanganyika
last Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Chief of Defense Forces General Robert Mboma Friday
told a local newspaper, The Guardian, that the fishermen were
released following his communication with the Bujumbura Defense
Forces top administration.
</P>
<P>
Mboma said that he has directed his subordinates in western
Kigoma Region to double check whether the remaining three
fishermen are not Tanzanians whom the Burundian authorities
identified as Burundian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, General Mboma said the Burundian army was
holding hostage 12 Tanzanian fishermen because it suspected they
were rebels from the National Council for Defence of
Democracy-Forces for Defence of Democracy (CNDD-FDD).

<HEADLINE> Africa Accounts for One Percent of World's GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Africa accounts for barely 1
percent of global gross domestic product (GDP) and only about 2
percent of world trade, according to a book "Can Africa Claim the
21st Century".
</P>
<P>
The book, launched in Kenya's capital Nairobi Friday, says that
Africa's share of global manufactured exports is almost zero and
over the past 30 years Africa has lost market share in global
trade, even in traditional primary goods.
</P>
<P>
The book is a joint product of the World Bank, the African
Development Bank and the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa,
among others.
</P>
<P>
If Africa had maintained its share of world trade from the late
1960s, its exports and income would be some 70 billion U.S.
dollars today, the book says.
</P>
<P>
It says African economies have already begun to diversify and
make themselves more attractive for private sector investments,
adding that the challenge is to sustain the momentum of
diversification in some cases and to jump-start it in others.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch, Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti
said that Africa should stay on the reform path if it is to emerge
from poverty.

<HEADLINE> Asian Games Champion Wang Yinhang Wins Men's 50km Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Asian Games champion Wang Yinhang
won the men's 50 kilometers event and qualified for the Sydney
Olympic Games at the Chinese National Walking Championships here
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old, who jumped to fame by winning his speciality
event in three hours 59 minutes 26 seconds in Bangkok's steaming
heat in 1998, clocked 3:53:10 to win a precious Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
"I should have had a better time, but in this Olympic
qualifying tournament, winning the title is the most important
thing," said the beaming Wang.
</P>
<P>
The victory looked much more comfortable than that in Bangkok
two years ago, when he collapsed after crossing the finish line.
He walked around, kept smiling and talking frequently to the media.
</P>
<P>
"I'm in a superb form," he said. "My time could have been
around 3:50:00 if my coach had not let me slow down in the first
five kilometers."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yongjian finished second in 3:54:13 and Wang's training
partner Yu Guohui third in 3:55:20.
</P>
<P>
But it will be very difficult for the Chinese walkers to finish
top eight in the coming Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese walkers never had good performance in the 50km event
in the Olympic Games and the World Championships," Wang said. "I
hope to enter the top eight in Sydney."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Coming Nigeria's Petroleum Price Rise Evokes Mixed Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Song Li
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government's decision to
raise the price of petroleum by 50 percent to 30 naira per liter
has met with mixed reactions in Africa's largest oil producing
country.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the news announced by the state-owned Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Thursday, motorists in
Lagos, the largest city in the country, rushed to local petroleum
filling stations to buy petroleum at the original price of 20
naira (one U.S. dollar equivalent to 100 naira) per liter, which
had remained unchanged since December 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, which was approved by President
Olusegun Obasanjo, a liter of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) now goes
up for 30 naira and may see further rising-ups in the future.
</P>
<P>
People in the business sector generally welcomed the move
despite the costs added to their operation.
</P>
<P>
"This is an achievement in a democratic government. It is
commendable. What military governments were afraid to do, a
democratic government has been able to do it," said Abba Gana,
president of the Major Marketers Association of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He said price increase is the only option to avoid sinking huge
amounts of money into subsidizing fuel products imported into the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to NNPC group manager Gaius Obaseki, the corporation
spent 19. 4 billion naira (194 million U.S. dollars) in
maintaining low petroleum product price only in the first three
months of this year, and could spend even more in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The latest increases notwithstanding, the corporation would
still not be able to recover its production cost, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, local sources told Xinhua that the decision instantly
led to an increase of over 100 percent in transport fares in many
parts of the country and invited violent criticisms from the
Nigeria Labor Congress, which even threatened a resistance to the
hike.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Committee of the House of Representatives also
"regretted" the decision, saying it would further lower the life
quality of the country's huge population living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
For the poor, the price hike seems a rather unpopular policy at
the time being, especially when the country's poor has yet to see
the economic benefits promised by the first civil administration
after more than a decade of military misrule.
</P>
<P>
"The newly adopted 5,500 naira (55 dollars) minimum wage (up
from a former 3,000 naira), which we had just finished cheering
for, is largely put on sales due to the price hike," a Lagos
resident complained in an interview.
</P>
<P>
His words further illustrated the dilemma the Obasanjo
administration is involved in: to raise the living standard of the
people and to cure the ailing economy at the same time -- but the
problem is that the two are often at odds.
</P>
<P>
Since its inauguration last May, the Obasanjo administration
has repeatedly vowed to deregulate the petroleum industry with a
final aim to allow marketers to set the prices to a level which
will make their operation profitable.
</P>
<P>
The wide-spread non-profitability in the country's economy,
which might be tolerated when the country was rich in the 1970s
and early 1980s, seemed to have run into a dead end after the
mid-1980s when the country's income dwindled largely due to the
mismanagement of corruptive military leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Obasanjo administration needs to free large sums of money
from subsidization to materialize its campaign promises: to free
the economy from total reliance upon the oil sector, achieve
universal education and mend dilapidating infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government also wants to use the price hike to
fight ramping smuggling of the comparable cheap petroleum products
from the country to its neighbors and avoid heavy losses for the
country.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Loan to Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved a financial
package of 230 million U.S. dollars for a 15-year term to help
implement the 360-megawatt Haripur Power Project, The Bangladesh
Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank's
lending affiliate for the private sector, approved debt financing
of 54.1 million dollars for the power project and exposure for 115
million dollars of interest rate swaps as well as a 60.9-million-
dollar partial risk guarantee by the International Development
Association(IDA), the World Bank's concessionary window.
</P>
<P>
Both the IFC and the IDA had played a key role in catalyzing
the important commercial financial package for a term of 15 years,
the first ever long-term financing of its kind for Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Vivek Talvadkar of the IFC said the Haripur project would
encourage development of further private infrastructure projects
in Bangladesh,promote reforms and enable the government to
conserve limited public resources for other priorities like
education and health care.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of the 360-MW gas-fired combined-cycle power plant
into the system in June next year will help alleviate Bangladesh's
energy crunch. The total project cost is estimated at 183 million
dollars to be financed through a combination of equity and debt.
</P>
<P>
The plant is consistent with the World Bank's strategy in the
power sector for promoting reform and private-sector investment to
improve efficiency, quality and accessibility of electricity
services.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian rising star Taufik
Hidayat has vowed to retain the Indonesia Open badminton
championship title that he won last year in Bali.
</P>
<P>
This year's tournament will be held at Senayan indoor stadium
in Jakarta from July 19 to 23.
</P>
<P>
"As a defending champion, I want to maintain my domination here.
But I will feel terribly sorry if China does not take part in this
tournament. China has been absent for three years and I think the
tournament is not complete without the Chinese shuttlers. It's not
like the All England or Thomas Cup, which are attended by teams
from all over the globe," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Taufik said he wished he could meet world top
ranking player Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"I have played Peter Gade many times, but I could only beat him
in the Singapore Open last August. I'm still expecting to fight
him even though I've lost to him in most of our meetings," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Reggie Miller paced the Indiana
Pacers into the NBA Finals for the first time ever with a barrage
of Knicks-killing 3-pointers, beating New York Knicks 93-80 at
home in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
Miller scored 34 points including five 3-pointers with four in
a span of six and half a minutes late in the game, leading the
Pacers to win the best-of-seven series 4-2.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers will take on the winners between Portland Trail
Blazers and the Los Angeles Lakers after the Lakers lost their
away game 103-93 for a 3-3 tie in the Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
Miller started his shooting spree with a 3-pointer late in the
third quarter to send the game into the fourth tied at 62.
</P>
<P>
With 6:08 left, Miller made another three 3-pointers to enable
the Pacers to regain its seven-point margin, and added eight more
points on free throws the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth time in seven years that the Pacers had an
opportunity to get to the finals with just one victory after lost
twice to the Knicks in 1994, once each to Orlando in 1995 and
Chicago in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Smith scored 26 points and Bonzi Wells had 20 with 14 in
the fourth quarter as the Trail Blazers took the lead halfway
through the first quarter and never looked back again to savor
their first home victory in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
While Kobe Bryant scored 33 points for Los Angeles, his Lakers
teammates failed to stand up dominantly with big center Shaquille
O'Neal in particular.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, averaging 29.2 points in the playoffs, made only 17
points and 11 rebounds, and was only 7-for-17 from the field and 3-
for-10 at the line.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers established their 11-point lead in the first
period and were never seriously challenged since then as O'Neal
made only eight points in the first half and missed his first six
free throws.
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers can become the seventh team in the NBA
history to come back from a 3-1 deficit to win a series, and the
first to do it in the West finals.
</P>
<P>
After the series tied 3-3, the deciding Game 7 will be played
in Los Angeles, where the Blazers have won two in a row.
</P>
<P>
Scottie Pippen scored a series-low nine points and was just 1-
for-6 from the field, but the deep Blazers had more than enough
offense elsewhere with five players in double figures, including
Rasheed Wallace with 18, Damon Stoudamire 14 and Arvydas Sabonis
10 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Glen Rice and Brian Shaw scored 12 apiece for Los Angeles.

DHAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh ended its seventh Asia Cup
Cricket campaign on Friday with the worst defeat in cricket's one-
day international history when Pakistan brushed aside the home
side by 233 runs to take sweet revenge of its World Cup loss, the
Independent newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fourth match of the Asia Cup saw Bangladesh hitting the new
low in the history of one-day cricket, and it was also Bangladesh'
s lowest ever total, 87 runs against Pakistan's 320 runs, in its
40 one-day international cricket appearances.
</P>
<P>
"We played our worst game. The bowlers were below par and then
the batting itself was horrible," Bangladesh captain Bulbul said.
</P>
<P>
Former world champions Pakistan has never won the very
tournament, and the victory will keep it on course to change
history.
</P>
<P>
"Every player had in mind what happened during the World Cup
and everybody was very serious about this match," said Pakistan
captain Moin Khan.
</P>
<P>
In the last World Cup Cricket in Northampton, Bangladesh
surprisingly defeated mammoth Pakistan by 62 runs.
</P>

Pakistan will meet arch rivals India today in a crucial match.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Badminton Open Attracts Over 12 Delegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 12 countries are expected
to take part in the 19th Sanyo Indonesia Open badminton
championship scheduled to be held here from July 19 to 23.
</P>
<P>
The countries included Denmark, Sweden, Britain, Wales, France
and Germany.
</P>
<P>
According to Leo Chandra Wiranata, secretary general of the
country's badminton association (PBSI), the event is likely to
lure most of the world class shuttlers as the annual championship
is one of the last three five-star events to be staged before
September's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The other two are the Malaysian Open and Singapore Open.
</P>
<P>
"If shuttlers want to have good seedings at the Olympics, then
it is likely that they will turn up in Jakarta to improve their
world ratings," Leo was quoted by the Indonesian Observer Saturday
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In last year's campaign, which took place in Bali, Indonesia
hardly faced any significant challenges from its respective
opponents as the home team clinched four trophies out of the five
categories contested. The women's double category was the only
class Indonesia failed to win.
</P>
<P>
The home side will face a much harder task this time around in
retaining supremacy in the event.
</P>
<P>
Leo hoped that China could compete here as the organizer had
offered to subsidize the team's accommodation.
</P>
<P>
"China used to promise to come here but at the last moment it
always withdrew for various reasons. Any result in the Indonesia
Open and Malaysia Open can affect the seedings in the Olympic
Games. If China misses this tournament, it will suffer in the
seedings," he said.
</P>
<P>
China and South Korea have been absent from the Indonesia Open
for three consecutive years due to security concerns.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Ceramics Industry
authorities and a Chinese company signed an agreement here Friday
on building a cement plant project in Kyaukse, central Mandalay
Division of the country.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony of the agreement between the state-run
Myanmar Ceramics Industry (MCI) of the Ministry of Industry-1 and
the China National Constructional and Agricultural Import and
Export Corporation (CAMC) was attended by Myanmar Minister of
Industry-1 U Aung Thaung and Economical and Commercial Counselor
of the Chinese Embassy Jin Honggen.
</P>
<P>
Representing their respective parties, Managing Director of MCI
U Than Shwe and Chairman of the CAMC Ren Honbin signed the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The plant, whose capacity is to be 500 tons a day, will have
machinery and technology worth 16.5 million U.S. dollars. And it
will be built within 22 months.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar produced a total of 338,007 tons of cement in 1999, a
drop of 7.38 percent compared with 1998.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has sped up the pace of
infrastructural construction of roads, bridges and dams, resulting
in a shortage of cement day by day.
</P>
<P>
To meet the rising demand for cement, the Myanmar government
has been trying to build more cement plants.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid is planning to hold talks with Australian Prime Minister
John Howard in Tokyo next week, Antara news agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Wahid said Friday in Palu, Central Sulawesi Province,
that he planned to meet with Howard on the sidelines of the
funeral of former Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi in Tokyo
next Thursday, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said one of his cabinet ministers had suggested that he
should not visit Australia yet but "I did not agree with the idea.
"
</P>
<P>
"If we wish for stability, Indonesia must have good relations
with Australia," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If there are differences between the two countries,
we should show Australia that we are a more civilian nation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Indonesian Foreign Minister Alwi Shihab said President
Wahid is going to pay an official visit to Australia some time
next in June.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Mulls Over Capital Control System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
studying the possibility of imposing capital control to arrest the
falling rupiah, the country currency, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, Indonesia's foreign exchange regime is so
liberal that we need to make some necessary adjustments," local
leading newspapers Saturday quoted Trade and Industry Minister
Luhut Pandjaitan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The risk of applying capital control would be less than letting
the currency fluctuate freely like it is now, the minister said
Friday on the sidelines of a seminar when commenting on a
statement made by Horst Koehler, new managing director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), earlier in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Koehler had said capital control was not a taboo.
</P>
<P>
Pandjaitan said the government's main objective in controlling
the flow of currencies is to stabilize the rupiah and prevent the
currency from being used for speculative trading.
</P>
<P>
Amid heightened talks of the possibility that Indonesia would
impose currency control, the rupiah gained ground Friday while
stock prices fell another 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange dealers said speculation that the government
would impose currency control helped boost the rupiah to close
higher at 8,385 to the U.S. dollar from 8,630 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange hit another one-year low Friday,
ending down by 2.2 percent, or 9.87 points at 444.44 due to
worries over currency control.
</P>
<P>
However, Bank Indonesia (central bank) Governor Sjahril Sabirin
expressed opposition to "all-out" capital controls, but said he
would consider some measures to control the flow of foreign
exchange in and out of the country and ensure stability in the
currency's value.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops and
Tamil rebels exchanged mortar fire Friday in the northern Jaffna
Peninsula,the official Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted military sources as saying Tamil rebels
ferociously fired mortars at army defenses in the Chavakachcheri
area of the peninsula and government troops retaliated.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 Tamil rebels were killed by army patrols at four
different locations around the Chavakachcheri Friday, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has eased on the Jaffna Peninsula after a few weeks'
fierce battles. The Tamil rebels, who have been fighting for a
separate Tamil state in the north and east of the country since
1983, are trying to recapture the peninsula, their former
stronghold which they lost to the government troops in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, around 10,000 civilians in parts of Batticaloa
district, who were forcibly evacuated by the rebels a few days ago,
have begun returning to their homes, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels forced the civilians out of their homes in order to
attack the troops' Vavunathivu camp close to Batticaloa town, the
report said, adding that however, the rebels failed to achieve
their aim as the troops stood their ground courageously despite
mortar fire.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Buy Warships from South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy chief said the
country plans to buy three personnel carrier ships from South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
"For the time being we will only buy one but we may need three
in the near future," Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Achmad Sutjipto
said while observing an exercise by trainers in South Malang, East
Java, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sutjipto said he is dissatisfied with warships of the Landing
Ship Tank (LST) type in the navy's possession because their
specifications are not good enough for combat-ready troops.
</P>
<P>
"Our soldiers are now transported with old LST ships. Because
of the ships' inadequate features, they easily get tired by just
traveling in them. Therefore, we will replace them with more
comfortable and quicker ships," he was quoted by the Antara News
Agency Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sutjipto said the government welcomes the navy's idea to
replace the LSTs and the navy is now waiting for the required
budgetary allocation.
</P>
<P>
The navy chief disclosed that the United States has renewed an
offer of cooperation in a joint naval war game between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States froze military ties with Indonesia eight
months ago after hundreds of people were killed in East Timor
after the area voted for independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"America made the offer and we accepted it. The joint exercise
is scheduled for July," Sutjipto said.
</P>
<P>
In the joint exercise the U.S. Navy will send units from the
Seventh Fleet and its Marine Corps in the Pacific while Indonesia
will dispatch commando units from the Maritime Fleet and units of
the Marine Corps. During the joint exercise the two sides will
conduct a comparative study of each other's powers and potentials
to produce a reliable amphibious force for combat.
</P>
<P>
"The naval personnel to be involved in the joint exercise may
amount to one battalion," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, has attracted an increasing number
of overseas investors to its agricultural sector over the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that overseas investors have established
a total of 613 agricultural ventures in this metropolis, with
combined contractual overseas capital of more than one billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
These overseas-funded businesses are mainly engaged in areas
such as farm produce processing, livestock husbandry, horticulture,
and growing of vegetables and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Yixing, deputy-director of the Shanghai Municipal
Agriculture Commission, said that overseas investors may find a
lot of opportunities in Shanghai's agricultural sector because the
city, with a population of about 13 million, boasts a huge market
and improved business environment.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan, Shanghai has a great demand for agricultural
products but produces only 50 percent of required pork products,
80 percent of eggs and smaller amounts of beef and mutton.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas in Shanghai have stepped up efforts to attract
investments from other parts of the world in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Work on 12 agricultural development zones, each covering an
area of more than 10 sq km, began last year in the suburbs.

HEFEI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, a major

</P>
<P>
One of the first Chinese provinces to use WB funds, Anhui has
received a total of 636 million U.S. dollars of loans from the
bank since 1982.
</P>
<P>
The capital has mainly been spent on agriculture, forestry,
water conservancy, health, education and environmental protection

</P>
<P>
One major project, which involved 117 million U.S. dollars of
WB loans, was carried out in the northern part of the province, to
improve 320,000 hectares of low-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
Another project, an irrigation and drainage pumping station in
the Chaohu Lake valley, helped protect local people from a severe
flood in 1991.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial government said that WB loans
have made up for a shortage of funding in infrastructure in Anhui.

Tobacco-related deaths, loss of laborers and medical
expenditure have led to heavy social and economic costs to China,
the world's biggest tobacco producer and consumer.
</P>
<P>
Smoking was responsible for 514,000 deaths, while causing the
loss of 1.14 million laborers and bringing about 22.9 billion yuan
(2.7 billion U.S. dollars) in direct medical fees in 1998.

<HEADLINE> FIFA President Scraps Plans for More World Cups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has
scrapped his plan to hold the World Cup every two years.
</P>
<P>
Blatter had been considering the controversial proposal only to
meet widespread opposition and therefore declared: "I have put the
idea into a safe and I have lost the combination to that safe. Let
it stay there in peace."
</P>
<P>
Blatter was speaking in Malta where he was taking part in the
country's centenary celebrations of their football association,
which include Saturday's friendly international against England.
</P>
<P>
That has given the England side the perfect opportunity to act
as ambassadors for the campaign to host the 2006 World Cup,
especially as Malta's Joseph Mifsud is one of the FIFA executive
committee members who will decide on the winning bid next month.
</P>
<P>
It was little surprise, even though goalkeeper Richard Wright
is due to make his debut, to see that England's two most famous
players- David Beckham and Michael Owen - were paraded before the
media in an apparent goodwill gesture to the Maltese.
</P>
<P>
Mifsud, whom England have been attempting to woo in competition
with Germany, was not committing himself on where his support was
likely to lie, although he did reveal that the technical reports
on the merits of each country's bid would be a major factor.
</P>
<P>
Blatter has seen the draft copy of those reports and while he
too was giving little away, the England campaign team will at
least welcome the fact that he is not pursuing his known support
for an African host country with unqualified vigour.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said: "When I started my campaign to become FIFA
president I said that we should give the World Cup to Africa, but
I have always said that would only be when and if an African
candidate fulfilled all the technical, security and infrastructure
requirements. That is a very important addition to what I have
said in the past."
</P>
<P>
Blatter, who vigorously opposed the concept of fences being
reintroduced for games with a high security risk - as they were
for the UEFA Cup final - meanwhile confirmed that FIFA would
pursue their plan to implement a coordinated international fixture
calendar.
</P>
<P>
This would set various dates aside for international games to
help ease the growing tension between clubs and national sides,
but it would not prevent the English season continuing to run from
August to May.
</P>
<P>
Another agenda item at FIFA's summer congress meeting in Zurich
is scheduled to be the thorny issue of possible restrictions on
the number of overseas players appearing in club football.
</P>
<P>
Blatter is determined to press ahead with a proposal to ensure
a minimum of six home-grown players in each club's starting line-
up,although it is clear that European law on freedom of trade is
almost certain to block this taking place.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the examples of Chelsea and Barcelona, he is evidently
seeking backing from within the game to see if there is a way of
football agreeing to self-regulation - however infeasible that may
seem.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said: "We have opened dialogue with the European Union
in order to try to minimize the effects of the Bosman ruling,
although we can't change the court's ruling."
</P>
<P>
"We have no weapons to stop the free circulation of European
citizens but we have to protect the national identity of clubs. It
is not good for national football teams if a lot of teams have a
majority of players not eligible for them.
</P>
<P>
"It is a case of politics in small steps. The football family
has to take its responsibilities seriously and have a motion at
the congress to show that it a restriction is the will of the
whole family of football and not just a few people."

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Seal 15 Million Pounds Hasselbaink Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd
Hasselbaink has completed a move back to the English Premiership
after Chelsea finally clinched a 15 million pounds deal with
Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Hasselbaink, who was surprisingly left out of Holland's Euro
2000 squad, has agreed personal terms.
</P>
<P>
The move makes the Dutchman the Blues' record signing, topping
the 10 million pounds they paid for Chris Sutton last summer.
</P>
<P>
The fee also matches the British transfer record paid by
Newcastle for Alan Shearer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hasselbaink said: "It's a very big move and I feel happy with
it.When I heard Chelsea were interested I was very pleased and
hoped the deal would go through."
</P>
<P>
"I enjoyed my time in English football and I am happy to be
back at a great club like Chelsea, who are very ambitious," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Keegan's Challenge for In-form Barmby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- England soccer team manager Kevin
Keegan has thrown down the gauntlet to Nick Barmby and challenged
him to stake a claim for a place in his Euro 2000 starting line-up.
</P>
<P>
Barmby will start his first international for nearly four years
when he plays in England's final warm-up match against Malta in
Valletta on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Everton midfielder has been allocated the left-sided role
in a 4-4-2 system and Keegan insisted that position was still up
for grabs ahead of the Euro opener with Portugal on June 12 in
Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
It is a remarkable and rapid rise for Barmby with Keegan
admitting that he was not even in his plans for the summer a few
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But Barmby came from the back of the queue to oust Peter
Beardsley from the Euro '96 squad after scoring twice against
China.
</P>
<P>
He also had the distinction of scoring the first goal of Glenn
Hoddle's reign in a World Cup qualifier in Moldova in September
1996.
</P>
<P>
But that was his last England appearance until the former
Tottenham player made a huge impression on Keegan with his
performance in the final third of Wednesday's win over the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Now another impressive performance on Saturday, against
admittedly less quality opposition, could seal his spot in what
remains the problem area for Keegan.
</P>
<P>
It also suggests that Keegan remains to be convinced that Steve
McManaman is the answer to his prayers in the left-sided berth -
which is where he will have to be accommodated if not given a free
role as against Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I think Nick Barmby thoroughly deserves his
chance. If you had asked me a month ago, I don't think I would
have thought that would be possible. I have said to him to give me
90 minutes against Malta in the same vein as the 30 when he was on
the pitch against the Ukraine - and I think the 4-4-2 system will
suit him."
</P>
<P>
"He really expressed himself well the other night and when he
came on he picked up the pace of the game from the first second.
He looked like he was a player on a mission. Nick Barmby came
through to make the squad for Euro 96 - but he's in the squad now
and what all the players are thinking about is making the side for
the first game against Portugal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Third choice keeper Richard Wright will cap a memorable week by
winning his first cap to follow on from helping Ipswich reach the
Premiership, via their play-off final victory over Barnsley on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sunderland striker Kevin Phillips will also get his first start
for seven months - just three days after fearing he would not make
the final 22.
</P>
<P>
Phillips was last in the first X1 on his home ground at the
Stadium Of Light for the friendly international with Belgium.
Chelsea skipper Dennis Wise will get another chance to stake a
claim for a central midfield role after playing on the left
against Brazil last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said he would make several changes during the game but
he insisted: "I will not make a farce of it. There are things I
would like to look at but the real message is 'let's keep up the
good work'."

<HEADLINE> Tyson Visa Challenge Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A judge in Scotland has rejected an
attempt to overturn the decision to allow boxer Mike Tyson into
the UK for a bout in Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
The Glasgow Rape Crisis Center sought a judicial review of the
issue of a visa to Tyson, a convicted rapist, by Home Secretary,
Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
But after hearing from both sides at the Court of Session in
Edinburgh, the judge, Lord Clarke, supported Straw's decision.
</P>
<P>
The judge said he would outline his decision in more detail at
a later date.
</P>
<P>
Promoter, Frank Warren, said he was delighted with the outcome
but "had sympathy for the causes the pressure groups support".
</P>
<P>
He added: "They must realise there are better ways of achieving
their goals than using Mike Tyson as a punchbag."
</P>
<P>
The hearing was the latest episode in the controversy over the
boxer being allowed into Britain for the bout with American Lou
Savarese at Hampden Park on June 24.
</P>
<P>
Women's groups and many MSPs and MPs have opposed the decision
to allow the boxer a visa for the second time, after his last
leave to enter the UK was described by Straw as a "one-off".
</P>
<P>
At least 40,000 tickets have already been sold for the bout,
which is expected to attract a total of 60,000 people.

<HEADLINE> 70,000 Cubans Demand Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 70,000 people demanded
Saturday the return of raft boy Elian Gonzalez to Cuba during an
open forum held in the Banes in the east of the island.
</P>
<P>
The mass concentration was attended by Cuban Defense Minister
Raul Castro, the commanders of the Revolutionary Armed Frorces
Juan Almeida, Guillermo Garcia and Ramiro Valdes, as well as other
leaders of the government and of the Communist Youth.
</P>
<P>
The speakers at the open forum condemned the U.S. Cuban
Adjustment Law that legalizes the status of Cuban emigrants who
arrive in U.S. territory, the Torricelli Law and the Helms-Burton
law that hardens the U.S. embargo against the island.
</P>
<P>
They concurred in their rejection of "Yankee imperialism" that
wants "to grab Cuba," and repeated their demand that Elian return
to his country immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Court of Appeals decided Thursday that Elian has no
right to a hearing to request political asylum, but granted the
suitors 14 days to file an appeal.
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Elian cannot return to Cuba before that term.
</P>
<P>
The raft boy is now in Washington with his father, his
stepmother, and his baby brother.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Argentina, Chile Oppose Sanctions Against Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso, his Argentine counterpart, Fernando de la Rua,
and Chilean President Ricardo Lagos decided to adopt a common
position of acceptance of the result of the Peruvian elections in
the Organization of American States (OAS) General Assembly that
starts Sunday in Windsor, Canada.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports Saturday said that the decision was taken
by the presidents Friday in Berlin, where they were attending a
meeting of 14 heads of state on the so-called "Third Way."
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian president said after a dinner with his Argentine
and Chilean counterparts that the three countries concur that no
retaliation should be exerted against Peru.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that what occurred in Peru was not a coup, but a
legitimate election. "It was the Peruvian people who decided," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Cardoso, the three leaders underscored during the
dinner that they do not want to interfere in the internal affairs
of other countries, although they consider that there is a general
need of affirming democracy in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The United States was unsuccessful in its attempt to have
sanctions against Peru approved in the OAS Permanent Council
special meeting held Wednesday in Washington because of the strong
opposition of Brazil.
</P>

The United States will probably present again during the next
OAS yearly General Assembly a proposal to impose sanction upon
Peru under the pretext of defending democracy in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The local press reports said that the stance of Paraguay,
Uruguay, and Ecuador is similar to that of Brazil, which
recognizes the Peruvian electoral process and affirms that the
election was made according to internal legislation.

<HEADLINE> British Queen Meets Charles' Lover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II met her
son Prince Charles' long-time companion Camilla Parker Bowles
formally for the first time at a party this week, the BBC reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at a 60th birthday party for King
Constantine, the former king of Greece, at the prince's home at
Highgrove in Gloucestershire.
</P>
<P>
Charles, Camilla and the Queen were believed to have sat at the
same table and so ended a much-publicized stand-off since the
prince divorced his wife, the late Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Parker Bowles has been a dark figure on the Royal scene
since Diana blamed her friendship with the prince for the failure
of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
The Queen was reported to have refused even to acknowledge
Camilla's existence.
</P>
<P>
But the monarch's decision to now accept an invitation to an
event which she knew Mrs. Parker Bowles would be attending is seen
as a deliberate step forward in relations, the BBC said.
</P>
<P>
But after Diana's death there has been a slow charm offensive
to gradually introduce Mrs. Parker Bowles to the suspicious
British public.
</P>
<P>
Charles, heir to the British throne, has trodden a delicate
public relations path since his marriage to Princess Diana ended
in 1996 with admissions of adultery on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Diana's death the following year in a Paris car crash -- and
the gradual emergence into the limelight of his longtime lover
Camilla, who is also divorced -- has had to be delicately handled.
</P>
<P>
They went public in January last year which was followed by
holidays together and joint appearances at charity dinners and
performances.

<HEADLINE> Uruguay's GDP Up 0.4 Pct in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew only 0.4 percent in the first quarter compared to the
same period of 1999, according to data published Saturday by the
Economy Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Uruguayan economy production data confirm that the 1999
recession has been surmounted, but reveal that the recovery
symptoms are not very noticeable.
</P>
<P>
The levels of activity in agriculture and construction
continued depressed, they recovered slightly in commerce and
industry, and transports and the growth was a little more evident
in transports and communications services.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan Economy Ministry said that official estimates
show that the GDP will advance from 2 percent to 2.5 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
The only sectors of the economy that had a clear recovery
during the first quarter were electricity, gas, water, transports,
and communications.
</P>
<P>
Industry and trade linking to tourism also recovered during the
first quarter, although at a slower pace.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Pull More Troops From N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain will withdraw about 500
soldiers from Northern Ireland due to improving security, thus
reducing its troop levels in Northern Ireland to their lowest
point since 1970.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's police head Ronnie Flanagan announced
Saturday that a battalion of troops based in middle Northern
Ireland are to return to England as part of an overall
demilitarization program. The soldiers will return home in two
weeks' time when their current six-month tour of Northern Ireland
ends.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal will take the number of soldiers stationed in
Northern Ireland to below 13,500.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said the further reduction in troop levels was "
appropriate" even though there was still a security threat from
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
The decision to start scaling down the British Army presence in
Northern Ireland was taken following the IRA's offer to put its
arms "beyond use" on May 6.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of further troop reductions followed the start
of work to dismantle two army observation posts in the Roman
Catholic areas of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary work to dismantle army bases in Cookstown in County
Tyrone and at Cloghogue in south Armagh has also begun.
</P>
<P>
The scaling down of the army presence in Northern Ireland has
come as a result of a security assessment which indicated a
reduced threat from terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The British government has said it hopes to take "substantial
measures" to normalize security arrangements by June 2001, the new
deadline by which both London and Dublin aim to secure full
implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Condemns London Bridge Bombers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein's chief negotiator Martin
McGuinness Saturday warned dissident republicans not to start
attacking the British mainland following the Hammersmith Bridge
bombing.
</P>
<P>
The education minister in Northern Ireland's newly reinstated
power-sharing executive also condemned the bombers who damaged the
west London bridge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No one has admitted responsibility for the attack but there
were fears that dissident republicans opposed to the Northern
Ireland peace process may have been involved.
</P>
<P>
The high-explosive device damaged the bridge but did not cause
any injuries.
</P>
<P>
McGuinness said all nationalists and republicans should respect
the wishes of the people to abide by the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was "totally and absolutely opposed" to the bombing,
he said, adding that "the overwhelming majority of nationalists
and republicans support the Sinn Fein leadership's efforts,
support the efforts of the SDLP and the Irish government."
</P>
<P>
Police investigating the blast were still trying to trace two
taxi drivers in the hope they may have clues which could lead to
the bombers.
</P>
<P>
Security in London has been stepped up as police confirmed the
sophisticated device contained between 1kg and 2kg of high
explosives and was fully detonated.
</P>
<P>
The police have urged members of the public to be vigilant and
have not ruled out the possibility that the attack was carried out
by dissident republicans.
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard said its officers were investigating a claim made
to a media outlet in Belfast that the blast was the work of the
dissident republican Continuity IRA.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said dissident
republicans trying to destabilize the peace process could have
been behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
If dissident republicans were involved, then this would be the
first time they have launched an attack in mainland Britain.

<HEADLINE> OAS Cannot Apply Sanctions to Peru: Analyst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of American States (
OAS) has no faculties to deny the elections or to apply economic
sanctions to Peru, political analyst Enrique Bernales said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The specialist's statements were made on the eve of the OAS
General Assembly to be held Sunday in Canada, where the American
foreign ministers will discuss the Peruvian political crisis
unleashed after the second-round election held Sunday, May 28.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Foreign Minister Fernando de Trazegnies will face
during the OAS meeting the accusations of electoral fraud that the
Peruvian political opposition is presenting before the
international community.
</P>
<P>
"The worst sanction the multilateral organization can impose is
to suspend the membership to a country that had interrupted with
violence the juridical and democratic principles in the region,"
said Bernal.
</P>
<P>
Bernal explained that Article 9 of the OAS Charter establishes
the suspension of a member country when a nation interrupts the
democratic continuity and the juridical principles of the
interamerican organization.
</P>
<P>
This process is very long and exhausts all the possibilities
before applying the maximum punishment, as it happened with Cuba,
whose government was excluded from participating in the OAS by a
resolution of the Eighth Consultation Meeting of the Foreign
Ministers in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The analyst said that in the Peruvian case, the OAS must soften
the two sectors in conflict so they can sit down to negotiate a
solution and establish a commitment of governability for the
country.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Not to Withdraw from Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will redeploy its
troops to May 6, 1998 positions only when international
peacekeeping force set foot at the high grounds in Eritrea now
under the control of Ethiopian army, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia will not allow its victory at the warfront to be
affected by the ongoing proximity talks in Algiers, Algeria,
Meles told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said although Ethiopia does not have any intention to annex
the Eritrean sovereign territories, it will not withdraw its
forces without reliable security guarantee from the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has proposed the Algiers proximity talks organizers
that Eritrea sign an agreement that it would not again initiate a
war against Ethiopia, and the high grounds that will be evacuated
by Ethiopian troops be controlled by international peacekeeping
forces, Meles said.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea, that has been
going on since Tuesday, is under the auspices of Chairman of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
If the international community cannot deploy a peacekeeping
force on those grounds due to financial and manpower constraints,
Ethiopia is ready to shoulder the responsibility of ensuring
peace in the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the restoration of the status quo
ante, which has been the core element of the OAU Framework
Agreement and the Modalities, is irrelevant currently as it has
been successfully accomplished militarily.
</P>
<P>
Those points of the peace documents that deal with border
demarcation and other related issues should review in accordance
with the existing situation on the ground, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Electoral Authorities Elected in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Legislative
Commission (CLN) or minicongress of Venezuela elected Saturday the
new members of the National Electoral Council (CNE) prior to the
upcoming general elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new CNE direction will substitute for the one that resigned
after the suspension of the elections scheduled for May 28, and in
which the presidency, 23 department governorships and 335
municipality mayoralties will be elected.
</P>
<P>
The persons appointed title holders and stand-ins for the top
electoral organization came from among 23 candidates proposed by
political parties' representatives, the business sector, and
independent organizations.
</P>
<P>
CLN President Luis Miquilena said that the persons elected to
the CNE will assume their posts next Monday and will decide the
new date for the elections.
</P>
<P>
The representative of the non-government organization "We Want
Elections," Elias Santana, said that technical, professional
aspects prevailed in the selection over and above any other aspect.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the Venezuelan elections agreed on last May
25 by technical breakdowns unleashed a strong internal controversy
in the country that forced the CNE board to resigned on May 30.
</P>
<P>
Under the rewritten constitution approved in a December
referendum, Venezuelans were due to vote on May 28 for a president
-- with incumbent President Hugo Chavez and his challenger
Francisco Arias as candidates -- a new National Assembly, state
governors, mayors, councilors, parish and regional legislative
councils.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Inflation Up 0.5 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian inflation index rose 0.
5 percent in May because of rises in the transport, health,
housing, and communications sectors, the National Statistics
Administrative Department (DANE) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
DANE Director Rene Verswyvel said that the variation recorded
last month "cannot be explained by pressure in food at a
difference with previous months and against the general perception.
"
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, Verswyvel said that the rises in transport,
housing, and communications are 80 percent of the total inflation
increase.
</P>
<P>
Inflation accumulated from January 1 to May 31 is seven percent,
0.75 percent more than the rate in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, annual inflation amounts to 10 percent against 9.98
percent for the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Verswyvel said that a drop in the family basket cost is
expected in the next months, after the first five months of the
year, when the cost of living registers the biggest rises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Delegation Visits Santiago de Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Congressmen Black Caucus
delegation which arrived in Havana Wednesday went to Santiago de
Cuba Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-member delegation is headed by Democrat House
Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, and includes
Democrats Bennie Gordon of Mississippi, Gregory Meeks of New York,
as well as lawmakers' assistants, journalists and community
leaders.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, who oversee the reality of the island, are
accompanied by Pastors for Peace solidarity movement leader Lucius
Walker and Helen Bernstein, a member of that organization.
</P>
<P>
The Radio National Newscast said that the visitors laid a
wreath on the grave of the Santa Ifigenia cemetery in Santiago de
Cuba, where national hero Jose Marti is buried.
</P>
<P>
Clyburn told the local press that the United States Congress
will start next week the discussions on the changes or lifting of
the embargo to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The delegates support the lifting of the embargo to the sale of
U.S. medicines and food to the island, in order to lay foundations
for the complete cessation of the embargo in a not very far future,
said Clyburn.
</P>
<P>
He added that the members of the visiting group are very
interested in the trips of exchange between Cuba and the United
States "because we are well aware of the similarities of our
history and our past."
</P>
<P>
The mission has met during its visit to the island with Cuban
Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon, Foreign Minister Felipe
Perez Roque, Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez,
and Culture Minister Abel Prieto.
</P>
<P>
The presence in Havana of the U.S. Congress Black Caucus
members happened at the time of the visit of Senator Blanche
Lincoln and Representative Marion Berry, members of the Democrat
caucus for Arkansas, who led a delegation of agriculture
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Craigh Johnstone, U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice chairman, was
also this week in the island promoting the strengthening of
bilateral cooperation established in 1999 between that
organization and the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. business interests are pushing Congress to dismantle or
substantially weaken the embargo erected by U.S. President John F.
Kennedy in 1962 and to lift the remaining restrictions on American
food and medicines sales, said analysts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives will vote later this month
on a provision in an agricultural bill to license U.S. sales of
food and medicine to Cuba as long as they aren't subsidized by U.S.
taxpayers.

LIMA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.3 degrees on
the Richter scale alarmed the population of Chimbote, a city

<P>
The press release of the IGP said that the seism did not cause

The IGP said that the epicenter of the tremor, which occurred
at 11:20 local time, was 32 kilometers west of Chimbote and was
also felt south of the Ancash department.
</P>
<P>
It said that the occurrence of light quakes is common and that
they occur in Chimbote and Casma with some regularity because
those zones are on the Oceanica and Nazca tectonic plates, which
present a geography in continuous state of change.

SANTIAGO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Over one meter deep snow remains
accumulated in the mountain range sectors of the Chilean Second
Region (Antofagasta), cutting the mountain passages of Jama and
Sico.
</P>
<P>
The Regional Emergency Office said Saturday that several
vehicles were trapped in the sector in the last hours.
</P>
<P>
The same situation occurs on the Argentine side, where a bus
that was going to Chile had a mechanical breakdown caused by the
snow. Low temperatures have affected the Antofagasta City
residents.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather caused a fatal victim and 713 persons were
affected in the south.
</P>
<P>
The cold and snow affect the southern zone of the country,
between the Eighth and the Eleventh Regions. A state of alert is
maintained in the Ninth Region (La Araucania) because of the
strong wind and rain that have not abated during the last hours,
and that continue causing havoc, especially in Temuco.
</P>
<P>
Seventy kilometers per hour squalls have been recorded in
Temuco Saturday morning, while the rains have created pools that
impede the normal movement of vehicles and pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
One of the most affected sectors is that of Padre Las Casas,
where Carabinero (uniformed police) agents have had to rescue
people stranded by the storm.
</P>
<P>
The Emergency National Office (ONEMI) said that the situations
of urgency are being cared for by the respective municipalities
and by the Regional Emergency Directions. The ONEMI sent to the
zone a mobile center of emergency operations and technical
personnel to support the evaluation and operative coordination.
