<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Air Force Helicopters Crash in Nevada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Air Force
helicopters with 12 people on board crashed early Friday during a
training mission over Nevada.
</P>
<P>
The HH60G Pave Hawk helicopters from the Nellis Air Force Base
were on a night training missing when they crashed at about 4 a.m.
EDT, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the helicopters was found about an hour later,
but the fate of the people on board was unknown.
</P>
<P>
Major Byron James, an Air Force spokesman at the Pentagon, said
the two helicopters apparently collided.
</P>
<P>
A team of search and rescue and emergency forces from the Air
Force, Bureau of Land Management and Department of Energy were
working with local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force owns only 10 of the Pave Hawk helicopters of the
type that crashed Friday. They normally carry a crew of four
people -- two pilots, a flight engineer and a gunner.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters, built by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp, are part of
the 66th Rescue Squadron, the largest rescue squadron in the Air
Force.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Build Network of Coastal Expressways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 4 (Xinhua) -- India is planning to build a
massive network of coastal expressways linking all major ports in
the country and the national capital, a cabinet minister said here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Union Surface Transport Minister Thambi Durai told a press
conference that his ministry has already submitted a note to the
cabinet for its approval of the plan to facilitate faster movement
of container traffic.
</P>
<P>
Durai said the existing highways are inadequate to take care of
rapidly increasing container traffic in the country, adding that
the proposed expressways would be on the lines of the first-ever
six-lane expressway being constructed between Numbai and Pune in
the western state of Maharashtra.
</P>
<P>
Total cost of the entire project is estimated at 200 billion
rupees (about 5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Durai did not give any time-frame for the completion
of the project.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Ahern for Pivotal Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday lauded Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern for his important
role in bringing peace and prosperity to the island.
</P>
<P>
"The world owes you a debt of gratitude," Clinton said at a
reception of government, union, business and farming
representatives at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say to all of you, you can be very proud of his
leadership -- as well as your own overwhelming vote for peace a
few months ago," said the American president who is in Dublin for
a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
In a referendum in May, 95 percent of the Irish voters endorsed
the Northern Ireland peace agreement thrashed out a month ago,
which agrees to relinquish Dublin's constitutionally enshrined
claim on the six counties of Northern Ireland in return for more
involvement in their administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the peace deal would not have been signed in April
without Ahern, who had to take time out of the final week of the
talks to bury his mother.
</P>
<P>
"He led a campaign sometimes under great personal duress. His
pleas for peace began early in his service.... He has been
terrifically effective in working with Prime Minister Blair and
all the parties in both communities," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing I can say to you today is I hope you
will continue to be a model for the world in responsible
citizenship," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Dublin, Clinton held talks with the Irish
prime minister. He will visit the European center of U.S. computer
company Gateway 2000 on the outskirts of Dublin later in the day.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday Clinton will visit the western city of Limerick and
then head back to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President: Solve Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy on Friday urged leaders of major parties to
find a way out of the current political crisis through
consultation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to them, Bagabandy said that the Great Hural (the
Mongolian parliament) has sacked the government for 42 days, and a
new prime minister is yet to be found, an embarrassing situation
that should not go on.
</P>
<P>
The leaders include President of the Mongolian National
Democratic Party Tsakhiya Elbegdorj, Chairman of the Mongolian
Social Democratic Party Radnaasumberel Gonchigdorj and President
of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party N. Enhbayar.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy said the crisis looms large over Mongolia's political
and economic life.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the interim government has almost stopped
functioning since nobody listens to it.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the president said, voters have lost
confidence in the Great Hural and the government.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, economic hardships are deepening with social
unrest on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural on Wednesday rejected the nomination of
R. Amarjargal, acting minister of external affairs, as prime
minister, saying that no minister of the former government should
become new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Under fire for a bank merger, Mongolia's three-month old
coalition government led by Elbegdorj was dismissed on July 24
after losing a vote of confidence in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the coalition repeatedly nominated Davaadorj
Ganbold, chairman of the Standing Committee of Economic Policy of
the Great Hural, who was turned down by the president five times.
</P>
<P>
In response to the situation, the minority Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party made a statement recently, saying that the
unicameral Great Hural should be dissolved if it fails to appoint
a prime minister in the near future.

<P>
BUCHAREST, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The seventh edition of the
International Furniture Fair opened at the Romexpo Exhibition
Center here Friday, bringing together as many as 340 firms from 19
countries.
</P>
<P>
The one-week fair, appraised as the fifth in size after
Cologne, Milan, Brussels and Paris, counts 22 pavilions, covering
a floor space of 25,560 square meters. Wood products, paper,
cardboard, packages and forestry exploitation equipment are also
among the exhibits.
</P>

making. Twenty-eight percent of its territory is covered by
forests. More than 100,000 workers and experts work in this
industry which means 4.76 percent of the total manpower. The
volume of exports was 450 million U.S. dollars in 1997 which is 7
percent of the total Romanian exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A body calling itself
the Unemployed Masses of South Africa (UMSA) Friday denied
responsibility for the deaths of three foreigners on a train near
Pretoria Thursday,
</P>
<P>
UMSA Vice-President Daniel Mohlatlole said he did not see any
of the organization's members beating anybody, as witnesses
claimed, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The three, two from Senegal and one from Mozambique, were
killed trying to flee from an angry mob accusing them of stealing
jobs from South Africans.
</P>
<P>
One man was apparently thrown from the train and was run over
by an oncoming train. The other two were electrocuted by overhead
wires when they climbed on the roof, trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
Police said UMSA members, who earlier in the day took part in
a protest march in Pretoria, were on the train.
</P>
<P>
Mohlatlole said two UMSA members tried to sjambok a foreigner
before getting on the train, but were ordered to stop by the
body's president, Godfrey Debeila.
</P>
<P>
"Godfrey told the two members they would be arrested if they
hit the man, and they then left it," Mohlatlole said.
</P>
<P>
He said UMSA members sat in about four carriages on the train.
"After a while we all joined our singing comrades in one
carriage, and this must be when the foreigners got scared and
tried to escape."
</P>
<P>
He said the chanting scared the foreigners away, and they were
responsible for their own deaths.
</P>
<P>
UMSA members were returning home from a march in Pretoria to
the Labor and Home Affairs Departments, where they demanded
illegal aliens be banned from the country because they were to
blame for the high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Police said no witnesses to the three deaths had come forward,
and no arrests were made.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Reiterates Not to Devalue RMB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 4 (Xinhua) -- China is committed to not
devaluing its currency Renminbi in a hope to stablize the Asian
economy, Deng Nan, Chinese vice minister of science and
technology, said at a seminar here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar focused on 21st century-oriented international
cooperation strategies, Deng said China's insisting on not
devaluing its currency is to lessen Asia's financial crisis and
stabilize the economy, thus contribute directly to the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the Asian financial crisis, what is the most
important is to unite all countries in efforts to help crisis-hit
countries and prevent the crisis from spreading, she said.
</P>
<P>
Every nation, while benefiting from the positive effect of the
economic globalization, should also made substantial contribution
to the elimination of its negative effect, Deng said.
</P>
<P>
Calling China the last front line to fend off the crisis, Deng
said China will take a series of more active measures to lessen
the impact of possible currency devaluation by its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Deng also introduced the economic progress made by China in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Saying China has been active in international cooperation, she
called for more economic and scientific cooperation between China
and its foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
The "Today and Tomorrow Outlook for Cooperate Strategies"
seminar, held in the northern city Como, is scheduled to end
September 6.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Proclaims Victory Over Floods (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today declared that the two-month flood control effort has
achieved decisive victory and urged the country to shift its
priorities to reconstruction and attaining this year's growth
target.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China and chairman of the Central Military
Commission, made the remarks in Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, the
second stop of his ongoing fact-finding tour which started on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said soldiers and local residents have battled courageously
and worked tenaciously to hold back raging flood waters over the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said they have protected the safety of levees, major
cities along the rivers and main railway lines, and have saved an
untold number of lives. "We have successfully waged a 'People's
War' in advance of the new century," said the president.
</P>
<P>
The monumental success will have far-reaching significance in
terms of helping maintain social stability required by reform,
opening-up and modernization construction.
</P>
<P>
"The effort has once again clearly revealed the cohesiveness
and tenacity of forces of the Communist Party of China, the
superiority of socialism and the reliability of our army," said
Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out continued efforts will be required to achieve
ultimate triumph over the flooding. He said that flood waters are
gradually receding and stressed that disaster regions should shift
their efforts to relief work and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be providing for the basic daily needs of flood
victims, preventing the spread of diseases and maintaining
security in disaster areas, said Jiang, adding that a nationwide
campaign to build and repair water conservation projects must be
organized immediately.

The president called on the entire nation to assist flood
victims in efforts to resume farming production and construct new
homes. However, he urged people in disaster areas to practice
self-reliance in the reconstruction effort.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed confidence in prospects for fulfilling this
year's economic growth target and noted that disaster relief
efforts and reconstruction will stimulate domestic demand and
promote growth.
</P>
<P>
He said great importance should be attached to building a
comprehensive water conservancy network which will be crucial for
controlling floods in years to come.
</P>
<P>
Jiang visited a number of evacuation centers, temporary
medical stations and makeshift schools.
</P>
<P>
When Jiang arrived at Yueliangwan Street in the West District
of Jiujiang City, a street that had experienced the heaviest flood
waters about a month ago, local people poured out to greet the
president. Jiang talked with them, inquiring about their life and
work.
</P>
<P>
Braving rain and wind, Jiang also visited the Guodongyu Levee
in Yongxiu County, where a People's Liberation Army unit is
stationed to combat the floods and protect the dykes. Jiang
extended warm regards to the soldiers and officers there and
entered some tents to chat with armymen.
</P>
<P>
Some officials from central Party and government departments
accompanied Jiang on the tour.

<HEADLINE> BP to Transfer Retail Business in Belgium to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- British Petroleum (BP)
has agreed to transfer its retail business in Belgium to Kuwait
Petroleum Corporation (KPC), the official Kuwait news agency Kuna
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The transfer, which involves 157 BP service stations and
relevant staff, will take effect on October 1, 1998, Kuna cited a
KPC statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
As of October 1, the newly acquired service stations will be
gradually rebranded in colors of Q8, brand name of KPC's global
service stations, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
All staff who have their main activities related to the BP
retail service in Belgium will transfer to KPC and continue their
activities for Q8.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the KPC will have 320 Q8 service stations
and 20 international diesel service truck stations in Belgium,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
While not giving the reason of the BP transfer, the statement
said other BP businesses in Belgium will largely be unaffected.
</P>
<P>
The KPC statement said the acquisition represents an excellent
complement to KPC's activities and will strengthen and enhance the
competitive position of the state-owned conglomerate, adding the
transfer represents one more step in the development of KPC's
activities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The KPC bought a number of companies in the 1980s to build a
marketing outlet for Kuwaiti hydrocarbons in key European
countries. It also formed joint ventures in a number of European
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Petroleum International (KPI), a subsidiary of KPC,
operates over 5,000 service stations in ten countries in Western
Europe, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Xenophobia Growing Among S. Africans: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Resentment toward
foreigners among South Africans could spark a violent attacks
against illegal aliens, experts warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three foreigners, two from Senegal and one from Mozambique,
were killed on a train near Pretoria Thursday afternoon after a
mob accused them of stealing jobs from South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were electrocuted by overhead wires when
they tried to escape by climbing on the roof of the train. The
third was thrown out of a window and was run over by an oncoming
train.
</P>
<P>
Wrath toward illegal aliens was growing, and was especially
strong among black South Africans, South African Press
Association quoted a political scientist, Theo Bekker, as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to develop into a bloody battle if something is
not done," said Bekker of Pretoria University.
</P>
<P>
Steven Friedman, director of Center for Policy Studies, said:
"The scary part is the danger that a pattern will start
developing."
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Thursday's incident was not the first of
its kind. More such assaults could be expected if intolerance
toward foreigners was not addressed.
</P>
<P>
Friedman said recent studies revealed a strong resentment
toward aliens, especially in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, there has been a heavy groundswell of
anti-foreigner sentiment among whites as well as blacks."
</P>
<P>
This claimed the lives of at least 20 foreigners in Cape Town
last year, some of them dying in incidents on passenger trains,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that it was impossible to stop the flow of illegal
aliens, Friedman and Bekker said the government and politicians
should try to instill greater tolerance toward foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Friedman said there was nothing rational about hating all
illegal immigrants. The perception that they robbed South
Africans of jobs was not necessarily true. Many foreigners were
self-employed, and others were prepared to work for wages
unacceptable to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Politicians had a duty to point out these realities, Friedman
said.
</P>
<P>
Bekker said South Africa simply did not have the resources to
stop all unwelcome immigrants entering the country.
</P>
<P>
The solution was economic development in neighboring countries
to produce job opportunities for those seeking a haven in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Until such time, the message from the government should be
that foreigners should be treated with leniency. If that doesn't
happen I see serious trouble coming," Bekker said.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan PM Sentenced to Life Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) Friday sentenced Rwandan
former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda life imprisonment for
genocide and crimes against humanity despite his co-operation
given to the United Nations court.
</P>
<P>
This is the first sentence delivered by the court, and the
first ever sentence for genocide by an international court.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence the ICTR can impose is life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the defense counsel, Michael Ingliss from St.
Lucia, prayed for leniency, suggesting a two-year jail term would
be enough in the light of Kambanda's voluntary confession and
assistance he had given to prosecution and the court.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda, 43, admitted his command responsibility as Head of
Government, his participation in decisions to commit massacres of
Tutsis, and his active participation in the use of the media to
mobilize and incite massacre of civilian Tutsis, including using
the incendiary phrases which was subsequently repeatedly
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The court accepted his plea and found him guilty on all the
counts of his indictment.
</P>
<P>
The chamber said that "the aggravating circumstances
surrounding the crimes committed by Jean Kambanda negate the
mitigating circumstances, especially since Jean Kambanda occupied
a high ministerial post at the time he committed the said
crimes."
</P>
<P>
Kambanda, married with two children, holds a diploma of
engineer. During May of 1989 and April of 1994, he worked in the
Union des Banques Populaires du Rwanda and rose to the director.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda was Vice President of the Mouvement Democratique
Republicain (MDR) and member of its political bureau. On April 9,
1994, he became Prime Minister of the Interim Government in
Rwanda, following the plane crash that killed President Juvenal
Habyarimana on April 6.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were brutally massacred in just three months in the middle of
that year.

<HEADLINE> Chernobyl Children Face Thyroid Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Young people exposed to
radioactive iodine released during the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear
disaster may be much more susceptible to have thyroid diseases,
scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Writing in The Lancet medical journal, Dr Furio Pacini from the
University of Pisa, Italy, said that young people exposed to the
disaster 12 years ago were found to have developed antibodies
against the thyroid gland.
</P>
<P>
Antibodies fight infection, but sometimes they can attack the
body when the immune system is fooled into thinking that infection
has set in.
</P>
<P>
Although the new study found no evidence of thyroid dysfunction
in the young men and women, whose blood was tested six-eight years
after the disaster, researchers suggested that they may later
develop autoimmune thyroid diseases.
</P>
<P>
The antibodies may attack the thyroid gland controlling the
body's metabolism, and this may lead to a condition known as
hypothyroidism, which causes low metabolic rate, weight gain and
drowsiness in sufferers.
</P>
<P>
In their study, Dr Furio Pacini and colleagues from Italy and
Belarus carried out tests on the thyroids of young people from the
village heavily contaminated with radioactive fallout, and from a
second village which received negligible contamination.
</P>
<P>
The investigation showed no significant differences in thyroid
function between the two groups, but found that youngsters from
the contaminated village were five times more likely to have
developed anti-thyroid gland antibodies.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of future development of hypothyroidism in the
people of Belarus exposed to fallout should be considered," the
researchers concluded.

<HEADLINE> West Nile Fever Has Spread to Europe, Doctors Warn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- West Nile fever, an infection
which is carried by mosquitoes and is common in Africa, Asia and
the Middle East, has entered Europe, doctors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An epidemic of the disease, which can cause meningitis and
inflammation of the brain known as encephalitis, has been
identified in Romania, Dr Ted Tsai and colleagues from the United
States and Romania reported in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, doctors in two infectious disease hospitals in
the Romanian capital Bucharest noticed a rise in the number of
central nervous system disorders.
</P>
<P>
By September, they were able to confirm that the patients had
been infected with West Nile fever.
</P>
<P>
After further test of bloods and spinal fluid samples, a total
of 393 patients were confirmed as having the infection in addition
to meningitis and encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which also causes fever, rash, severe aches, eye
irritation and lymph-node involvement, is believed to have been
carried to Europe by migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the West Nile fever virus is normally transmitted by
a special kind of mosquito, birds from Africa may have carried the
virus to Europe and passed it on to mosquitos there.
</P>
<P>
Apartment blocks in urban areas, particularly those which had
experienced flooding, were heavily infested and provide a good
breeding ground for the mosquito.
</P>
<P>
"In some areas of Europe, urban conditions are suitable for the
introduction and amplification of West Nile virus, with the risk
of future epidemics," the researchers warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Tunisian-Asian trade volume
went up to 1,148 million U.S. dollars in 1997 from 900 million
dollars in 1996, a 27.5 percent increase, according to statistics
of the Tunisian Ministry of Trade revealed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although this accounts for only 7 percent of Tunisia's total
foreign trade, the percentage is growing, said the statistics.
</P>
<P>
The major trade partners of Tunisia among the Asian countries
are Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, China, Turkey, Malaysia, Japan and
India.
</P>
<P>
The Tunisian exports to the Asian markets accounted for 5.8
percent of its total exports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit, however, increased to 320 million dollars in
1997, compared with 278 million in 1996. The increase is
attributed to the rise of Tunisia's trade deficit with Japan,
which accounts for two thirds of the total trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Among the major exports of Tunisia to the Asian countries are
phosphate and its derivatives, textiles, the products of
mechanical industry and electrical appliances. It imports
processing and elementary materials, foodstuffs such as tea, oil
and plastic materials.

<HEADLINE> Operation Helps More Somalis Regain Eyesight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 4 (Xinhua) -- About 350 Somalis
suffering from eye diseases have received treatment in an
eyesight restoring operation which concluded Friday in the
central town of Beletuein, 300 Km north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohamed Dhaqaneh Elmi, the chairman of the local
NGO's consortium in the town, four doctors from Kenya have made
medical consultation in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the activity which lasted for four days, the doctors
have managed to restore the eyesight for 240 people, mainly the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
Elmi who contacted the journalists via VHF radio in Mogadishu
said 220 people were offered free inter-ocular lenses and
medicine.
</P>
<P>
Those who got treatment from the Kenyan doctors have mainly
suffered from cataract. There had also been eight patients who
suffered from glaucoma, and six other people who only needed
minor operations.
</P>
<P>
The operation which took place in the main hospital of the
town run by the Italian NGO known as COSV has also attracted many
people from the surrounding districts, regions and villages.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time that the doctors from Kenya arrive in
the central town of Beletuein for conducting similar operations.
</P>
<P>
More than 266 people regained their eyesight in March this
year, while another 294 people have benefited from the operation
in June last year.
</P>
<P>
The central town of Bekletuein is one of the most peaceful
areas of the country at the moment where an Islamic court in
collaboration with the local authorities and the business
community of the town is operating to secure the stability.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
lodged a strong protest with the Ethiopian authorities against
their accusations that some 30 U.N. staff members working in the
country had engaged in espionage activities, U.N. spokesman said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 30 U.N. staff members, of Eritrean and Ethiopian origin,
have been declared "persona non grata" and given them one month,
starting on August 7, to leave the country, Fred Eckhard,
spokesman for the U.N. secretary-general, said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian authorities accused these U.N. workers, all of
whom had been working at the U.N. complex in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa, of espionage activities which Ethiopia "deemed
incompatible with the national security interest of the country,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has sent a strong protest to the Ethiopian
authorities, reminding them that "U.N. staff members enjoy
privileges and immunities and are independent officials
responsible for the U.N. secretary-general only," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. also firmly stated that blanket and unsubstantiated
accusations are not acceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. legal office is pursuing the matter with the Ethiopian
authorities while these U.N. workers and their families have been
relocated for their safety, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Reports Erratic Arrivals of Foodstuffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The "oil-for-food "
program is now delivering significant quantities of foodstuffs in
Iraq, but erratic arrivals of foodstuffs have unfortunately
continued, a U.N. official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Benon V. Sevan, executive director of the Iraq program, told
the United Nations Security Council that the erratic arrivals of
foodstuffs are caused by late submissions of applicants,
inadequate commercial and financial communications as well as poor
performance by some suppliers on making timely deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Sevan noted the enhanced distribution plan, while increasing
the caloric value of the food basket, is unlikely to lead to any
marked improvement in the quality of foodstuffs distributed and
this would require greater funding at the expense of other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The situation with the medical sector is complex and far from
satisfactory, and the rate of distribution to end users in the
north is low, at just 20 percent, the executive director said,
adding that in the center and south of the country, only 16
percent has reached end users.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The Security Council adopted a resolution in 1995 which
allowed Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every six
months to buy humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The council adopted another resolution early this year which
allowed Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil every
six months to ease the further deteriorating humanitarian
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions against Iraq will not be lifted until it is
certified that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction in accordance with relevant U.N. resolutions.

<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone, Foday Sankoh,
Friday appeared in court in capital Freetown and was charged with
treason, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who had been involved in a military coup against the
elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah last year, was sent back to
Sierra Leone in July after spending more than a year under house
arrest in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 16 civilians including five journalists were
sentenced to death in Sierra Leone on charges of treason for
their role in the military coup.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah resumed office last March from exile in
Guinea after the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG defeated
the military junta led by Major Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
At present, many soldiers of the rebel RUF are still fighting
a guerrilla war in the bush of the tiny west African country, and
some observers fear the trial of the rebel leader may harden
their resolve to continue their fighting.

MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A Russian agency has confirmed
that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea successfully
launched its first national artificial earth satellite Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Service for the Monitoring of Space Objects said
the satellite was launched from the Musudan ground, at 40.8
degrees of northern latitude and 129.7 degrees of eastern
longitude, the Itar-Tass reported.

<P>
According to a representative of the service, the satellite was
put on the orbit with a minimum distance from the Earth surface of
218.82 kilometers, a maximum distance from the Earth surface of
6,978.2 kilometers and a period of rotation of 165 minutes 06
seconds, a high-elliptic orbit.
</P>
<P>
He said the launch of the satellite to an orbit with such
parameters was, presumably, by a powerful rocket-booster, whose
tactic-technical parameters were not inferior to characteristics
of an inter-continental missile, Tass reported.

ANKARA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said Friday that to defend Iraq's territorial
integrity is of great significance for peace and stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the statement to the press following a meeting
with visiting Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Massoud
Barzani, reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Considering the regional balances, we think that the
territorial integrity of Iraq is vital. We don't want permanent
damage to be inflicted on the territorial integrity and unity of
Iraq," Ecevit said, adding that Barzani also shares this view.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also attached importance to a series of Ankara-sponsored
peace talks between the KDP and rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) led by Celal Talabani.
</P>
<P>
The KDP and PUK have been fighting for the control of northern
Iraq since Baghdad lost effective control of the region after the

Barzani is expected to fly on Saturday to Washington where he
will meet Talabani on the current situation in northern Iraq under
the auspices of the U.S. administration.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Announces to Cut Off Ties with Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday to cut financial ties to Myanmar, claiming it would not
give the government any assistance since it had failed to make
repayments on past loans.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said effective from September 2, this year, the
Bank has placed all credits to the Union of Myanmar in non-accrual
status. This means the country will not be able to borrow money
from the World Bank until it clears its arrears, estimated at 14
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This action was in accordance with the Bank's established
policy of placing all its loans and credits to, or guaranteed by,
a country in non-accrual status if payment on any loan or credit
is overdue by more than six months, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
At the date of this action, credits from the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessional
lending arm, to Myanmar totaled 719.92 million dollars equivalent
as of July 31, this year, with total arrears of 14.02 million
dollars equivalent as of September 2, according to the Bank's
announcement. But no loans have been made since July 1987.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's decision will make it more difficult and
expensive for Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to borrow money
from other lenders, because it sends a signal to private banks and
financial markets that the government was in default to one of the
world's lenders of last resort.

U.S. officials have said the DPRK test fired a two-stage Taepo
Dong 1 ballistic missile on Monday. But the DPRK Korean Central
News Agency said the launch was of a three-stage, domestically
developed rocket that sent a satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
The satellited went into orbit at 0311 GMT on Monday, four
minutes 53 seconds after its launch from the DPRK territory, the
Korean Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intelligence official said that there was a Taepo Dong
1 launched, and Washington could not rule out whether the
ballistic missile put a satellite in orbit.
</P>
<P>
He said agencies throughout the U.S. intelligence community
were reviewing data gathered at the time of the launch to try to
confirm or knock down the DPRK news agancy's report.
</P>
<P>
A Pentagon official still insisted that the DPRK launched a
Taepo Dong missile. Asked how it could be sure, he said: "We
monitor the (Korean) peninsula very closely."
</P>
<P>
The United States expressed concern at the launch earlier this
week, and said it would raise the issue at bilateral talks in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Japan withdrew an offer of talks on establishing diplomatic
relations with the DPRK and ruled out further food aid to the
country after the launch.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has accused the
United States and Japan of making a "fuss" over the launch.
</P>
<P>
"Some people... are making a fuss, ignorant of this valuable
success of science and technology," the DPRK Foreign Ministry said
in a statement. "They suspected it to be a ballistic missile
launching test, expressed some 'apprehensions' and described it as
a 'serious event.'"

<HEADLINE> Air Canada to Layoff Workers Late Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada is set to lay off
about half of its employees after midnight Friday as there is no
end in sight to a strike by its pilots.
</P>
<P>
The Montreal-based airline is reported to have issued some
layoff notices. The letter said the airline "is forced to take
many difficult steps to minimize the financial impact of the
shutdown."
</P>
<P>
About 11,000 of its 23,000 employees are expected to be laid
off. The first workers to be affected will be flight attendants
and ground crews.
</P>
<P>
The pilots' strike began just before midnight on Tuesday after
talks on wage increases failed between the airline and its 2,100
pilots.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada has cancelled flights at least through Sunday night.
Even if the pilots were to go back to work Friday, it would take
four or five days before services return to normal.
</P>
<P>
Though both sides say they are willing to talk, no such
meetings have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The airline is estimated to lose about 13 million dollars (8.5
million U.S. dollars) in revenue a day during the strike.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Higher but of Best Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets ended a
turbulent week with a minor comeback despite a shaky start on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
The European shares started the day optimistically but the
gains were pared back by the end of the day as the Dow slipped
into negative territory.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index remained positive for the most of the
day, jumping up 76.2 points at one time. By close, however, the
FTSE was up 48.3 points at 5167.0.
</P>
<P>
An edgy opening in New York followed heavy losses in the
previous session. Tokyo's Nikkei index also finished heavily down
overnight after the collapse of Toa Steel, the biggest failure of
a manufacturer in the country since World War II.
</P>
<P>
However in Hong Kong the Hang Seng was up 135.59 at 7,454.18 in
late trading, lending some momentum to London.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German stocks advanced but gave up most of their
initial gains, too, after a tepid open on Wall Street and traders
said the rebound was technical.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax closed 1.41 percent higher
at 4,864.97 points, while the floor traded DAX advanced 0.17
percent to 4,820.25.
</P>
<P>
Volume was low ahead of a bank-holiday weekend in the United
States which would see markets there closed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There's no news coming out of Russia at the moment and we had
a pretty good sell off over the last few days," one Frankfurt
trader was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid of taking a big position when something
could happen over the long weekend. That's going to keep a lot of
speculators out of the market," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's failure to break out of its funk in opening trade
let the air out of a rally in German shares that took the Dax as
high as 4,953.49 points. By the German close, the Dow was hardly
changed at 7,681.45 points.
</P>
<P>
But German shares were bolstered by overnight comments from
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer, who in remarks to journalists
late Thursday, said interest rate cuts were not the answer to
world market tensions and that economic growth was not a problem
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
He also said the Russian financial crisis would not lead to a
crisis among German banks, which have more exposure to Russia than
many of their European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the bourse chalked up a gain as the Cac 40 index
finished the day and week at 3,690.75 points, up 1.21 percent from
the Thursday close.

LUANDA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese company, Jiangsu
International Cooperation Company, signed a housing contract
worth 11 million U.S. Dollars with Angola here Friday.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Baiao added that the signing of the housing contract has
special significance before Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos visits China, and will surely contribute to the
cooperation between the two countries in other fields.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Has Right to Determine Own Destiny: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban people have
the right to determine their own destiny and sanctions against
them are anathema, South African President Nelson Mandela said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Democratic South Africa is proud to be amongst the majority
of nations who affirm the right to the Cuban people to determine
their own destiny, " Mandela said at a banquet in honor of Cuban
President Fidel Castro in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions which seek to punish them for having decided to do
so are anathema to the international order to which we aspire,"
said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
He was obviously referring to the economic sanctions imposed
against Cuba by the United States since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela thanked the Cuban people for their
support during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
"If today all South Africans enjoy the rights of democracy, if
they are able at last to address the grinding poverty of a system
that denied them even the most basic amenities of life, it is
also because of Cuba's selfless support for the struggle to free
all of South Africa's people and the countries of our region from
the inhumane and destructive system of apartheid."
</P>
<P>
As a sign of gratitude, Castro was awarded with South Africa's
highest civilian honor for foreigners, the Order of Good Hope.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, now chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM),
called on Cuba to work together with South Africa on the
empowerment of poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
"The achievement of our shared goals depends ultimately on our
success, in concert with others, in placing the interests and
needs of developing countries at the top of the world agenda, and
in promoting a reform of international systems and institutions
in conformity with democratic principles."
</P>
<P>
Castro, who attended the NAM summit in Durban, began his
two-day state visit to South Africa Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was given a full-ceremonial welcome by Mandela Friday
morning in Cape Town and described by Mandela as "one of my
greatest friends."
</P>
<P>
Later, Castro addressed a joint sitting of parliament and
visited Robben Island where Mandela had been jailed in the trying
time.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone to Arrange Repatriation of Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
is making arrangements to repatriate some 800 rebels in western
Liberia and bring them home to participate in the country's
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here quoted Sierra Leonean Deputy Defense
Minister Hinga Norman as saying Friday that "we have been
informed of their presence and an arrangement is being made by
government and my ministry to bring them back."
</P>
<P>
According to Norman, rebel soldiers have told authorities in
western Liberia that they were tired of fighting and wanted to go
home.
</P>
<P>
This is a good intention which should be encouraged, the
minister noted, adding that they should be given a chance to
participate in the government's demobilization, disarmament and
rehabilitation program.
</P>
<P>
Following the collapse of a military junta last February, many
rebel soldiers have continued their fighting in some parts of the
tiny west African country with rear bases allegedly being in
Liberia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a large number of child combatants who
have defected from the junta in western Liberia have also
expressed their desire to return to Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Warn of Rising Crime in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Two senior Russian officials on
Friday warned of rising crimes in the wake of the country's
worsening financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of the Federal Security Service Vladimir Putin
and Acting Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin gave the warning at
a meeting of the Federation Council, or upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Putin attributed the mounting crimes to slump production, high
unemployment, rising social tension and the huge gap between the
haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
Putin also expressed alarm over the huge number of
organizations that seek protection by resorting to guard services.
</P>
<P>
Stepashin, the interior chief, said Russia faces a new outburst
of crimes in the face of the financial crisis, but his ministry
lacks money to operate effectively.
</P>
<P>
"The state has to pay a high price for the poor police," he
warned, noting that money allocated to the ministry was barely
enough to pay salaries.

turmoil in world financial markets poses a risk to continued U.S.
economic growth and signaled the Fed might cut interest rates in
response.
</P>

</P>
<P>
The New York Times:

on a new government, buying more time for political negotiations
as the country's economic crisis worsened.
</P>
<P>
-- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said its
purpose of launching a multistage rocket on Monday was to carry a
satellite into orbit, not to test a missile.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton returned to a rainy Dublin for a low-key
visit, the first trip since his warm reception there in 1995,
when prospects were taking root for a lasting peace.

<HEADLINE> American Jones Shares Million Dollars IAAF Jackpot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- American Marion Jones won her
100 meters title here on Saturday, becoming one of three athletes
to share the one million dollars IAAF jackpot at stake.
</P>
<P>
The American beat her slow start to clock in 10.83 seconds,
beating runner-up Sevatheda Fynes by more than a quarter-second.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Jones a third of the 1 million Golden League
jackpot, in addition to 200,000 dollars for the women's overall
Grand Prix title and 50,000 for the race win.
</P>
<P>
Jones got another 50,000 for taking the long jump with a top
leap of 7.13 meters.
</P>
<P>
So far, Jones has won all 35 events she entered in 1998, which
includes 60- and 200-meter races.
</P>
<P>
Jones split the jackpot, a bonus for athletes who win their
events at all six Golden League meets plus the GP Finals, with
Hicham El Guerrouj and Haile Gebrselassie, who also stayed
unbeaten for the year with dominating wins.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Morocco's El Guerrouj ran alone for the final lap of
the 1,500 meters in clocking 3 minutes and 32.03 seconds, and
Gebrselassie also had little trouble in capturing the 3,000
meters in a relatively slow 7:50.00.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Moscow Grand Prix, the only other person in
contention for the big prize was Bryan Bronson, but the American
finished in a miserable sixth in the 400 hurdles which was won by
world champion Stephane Diagana of France.

<P>
With the win, Guerrouj picked up no less than a third of the

The other two candidates for the bonus were Marion Jones of
the United States in the women's 100 meters and Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia in the 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
The one million dollars jackpot is for athletes who win their
event at all six Golden League meets plus the Grand Prix Final.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Moscow Grand Prix, the only other person in
contention for the big prize was Byan Bronson, but the American
finished only sixth in the 400 hurdles which was won by France's
world champion Stephane Diagana in 48.30 seconds.

<HEADLINE> Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini will arrive here Tuesday for talks on the Mideast
peace process and the Egypt-European Union partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dini will pay a two-day visit, during which he is expected to
discuss with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa ways of reviving
the Mideast peace process, Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister for
European Affairs Fathi el Shazli told Egypt's Middle East News Agency
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israelis have been
stalled since March 1997 after Israel began construction of a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem. The talks are currently
stuck over the overdue Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between Syria and Lebanon, on the one hand,
and Israel, on the other, came to a standstill in early 1996 due
to disputes over the future of the Golan Heights Israel captured
from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
European Union members, including Italy, are keen on helping
advancing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Dini will also touch on other regional issues in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will review the progress made in the efforts
to reach the long-expected Egypt-European Union partnership
agreement, he added.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation and coordination agreement between the foreign
ministries of the two countries is expected to be concluded at the
end of Dini's visit, Shazli said.

<HEADLINE> Kim Jong Il Elected NDC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Kim Jong Il, general
secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, was re-elected the
chairman of the National Defense Commission (NDC) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 56, also the supreme commander of the Korean People's
Army, was re-elected at the first session of the 10th Supreme
People's Assembly (SPA) which began in the Mansudae Assembly Hall
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
"It was declared at the session that he was elected NDC
chairman by the will and desire of all the people and servicemen
of the country," the Korean Central News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"He has conducted energetic revolutionary activities for
decades to carry forward the revolutionary cause of the great
leader kim il sung," said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that his election clearly demonstrated the will
and resolution of all the members of the Worker's Party, other
working people and servicemen of Korea to "smash all the
challenges and anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists and
reactionaries, turn the country into a powerful socialist state
and exalt the dignity and honor of Juche Korea in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
Under the DPRK's constitution, the NDC is the highest military
supervisory body of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kim Jong Il was first appointed the NDC chairman for a
five-year term in April 1993 after his father, Kim Il Sung,
vacated the position.
</P>
<P>
At the first session of the 10th SPA, Jo Myong Rok was elected
the NDC's first vice-chairman while Kim Il Chol and Ri Yong Mu
were elected the vice chairmen of the commission.
</P>
<P>
The session also elected six members of the commission -- Kim
Yong Chun, Yon Hyong Muk, Ri Ul Sol, Paek Hak Rim, Jon Pyong Ho,
Kim Chol Man.
</P>
<P>
Choe Thae Bok was elected the SPA chairman of the SPA while
Jang Chol and Ryo Won Gu were elected the vice chairmen of the

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Wins Moscow GP Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia
clocked in a relative slow timing of 7:50.00, but was enough to
win the 3,000 meters to guarantee a share of the one million
dollars jackpot at the IAAF Grand Prix finals here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In his discipline, Gebrselassie had little trouble to capture
the title at the Luzhniki Olympic Stadium as his closest rival
Luke Kipkosgei finished in 7:50.87.
</P>
<P>
So far, Gebrselassie has had 20 straight outdoor wins with two
world records set in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters within a
two-week span in June.
</P>
<P>
Early, Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, won the 1,500 meters in
three minutes 32.03 seconds, becoming the first athlete to
guarantee a share of the one million dollars bonus.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Gebrselassie and Guerrouj, the other only candidate
who can claim a share of the IAAF Grand Prix jackpot was American
Marion Jones who was to compete in the women's 100-meters later
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The jackpot is for athletes who win their events at all six
Golden League meets plus the Grand Prix Final.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the Moscow Grand Prix, the only other person in
contention for the big prize was Bryan Bronson, but the American
was beaten to the sixth place in the 400 hurdles by world
champion France's Stephane Diagana.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Paddlers to Clean-Sweep Chinese Grand Prix Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier top seed and world number 3 Wang Nan overcame a fierce
surge from seventh seed Sun Jin to win the women's singles title
in an all-Chinese final.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles trophy went to Chinese tandem Ma Lin and Qin
Zhijian, who beat compatriots Wang Liqin and Yan Sen 21-16, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
For the non-Chinese players, the only hope to stop the hosts
from a cleansweep lies in the women's doubles event, which has
five non-Chinese pairs in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
Top seed Kong Linghui, who won the Australian Grand Prix last
week , suffered a surprise exit in the quarterfinals to rising
star Ma Lin 21-15, 18-21, 21-19, 15-21, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
In the other men's singles matches, Olympic champion Liu
Guoliang demolished C. Legout of France 21-11, 21-16, 21-19. Wang
Liqin trounced K. Kreanga of Greece 21-12, 21-14, 21-8, and Yan
Sen anchored the cleansweep by edging out W. Schlager of Austria
21-13, 21-16, 15-21. 19-21. 21-11.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who plays a left-handed topspin game in the handshake
grip, overpowered Sun in the first two sets 21-12, 21-12. But the
18-year-old Sun, who had beat Wang in the Japanese Grand Prix
early this year, fought back to level the score at 8-8 in the t
hird.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Wang, world silver medallist and World Cup
winner, used her stunning speed and spin to go ahead 20-17 for
three match points, only to be denied by Sun with powerful
forehand attacks.
</P>
<P>
But Wang, who won the Chinese Grand Prix in 1995, grasped the
last chance when Sun took advantage at 21-20, putting it 21-all
before winning two points in a row for the title.
</P>
<P>
"I have been under tough pressure before the match beacuse Sun
beat me this year in Japan," Wang said. "I'm very happy to win
the Chinese Grand Prix for the second time."
</P>
<P>
The victory earned her 8,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Wu Na, who dropped to Wang in the semifinals
earlier, finished joint third with fellow Chinese Zhang Hui, a
loser at the hands of Sun.
</P>
<P>
The men's doubles final was also an all-Chinese affair, with
Ma Lin and Qin Zhijian defeating Wang Liqin and Yan Sen 21-16,
21-15 to take the trophy.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Liu Guoliang who paired with former Olympic
champion and world NO.3 Kong Linghui shared the third place with
Feng Zhe and Zhang Yong.

<HEADLINE> China Declares War Against Family Violence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese, who used to regard
wife-beating as something common and normal, are becoming
increasingly concerned about family violence and trying every
means to curb it, an official with the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ding Lu, deputy director of the Women's Rights and Interests
Department of the ACWF, said that only a dozen years ago many
Chinese thought problems like husbands beating their wives were
"purely family business" that shouldn't be interfered with either
by the government or the law.
</P>
<P>
"They refused to call it a 'social problem,' and held that
mediation efforts of kind neighbors or community officials would
be enough to solve it," she added.
</P>
<P>
In today's China, however, more and more people are talking
about and openly condemning family violence, while local
governments and judicial organs are taking active steps toward
punishment, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
"This indicates that Chinese society is becoming more civilized
and progressive," she said, citing the example of central China's
Hunan Province, where special regulations against family violence
were formulated after a man threw his wife from a tall building.
</P>
<P>
Because of the regulations, she said, a county-level leading
official was ousted from his post for the ill-treatment of his
wife.

<TEXT>
<P>
In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, hot lines and
emergency aid centers have been opened for victims of family
violence, who also receive support from the local news media.
</P>
<P>
However, Ding conceded that in recent years reports of family
violence have constantly increased despite social efforts.
</P>
<P>
A main reason lies in the lingering feudal concept of women's
inferiority to men, which has been deeply rooted in the minds of
many male Chinese, including quite a few urban intellectuals and
officials, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she said, Chinese society and the economy are in a
changing and transitional period, and many families have lost
their peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
For example, she said, family violence is apparently on the
rise in the homes of workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises, especially when the wives also have lost their jobs.
</P>
<P>
There are also many cases of family violence resulting from
extra-marital affairs, which is a relatively new source of
violence for Chinese families, she added.
</P>
<P>
Many people across the country are now urging the state
legislature to formulate a special law against family violence,
said Ding.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Support Irish Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Saturday his country would never turn away from the Irish
people.
</P>
<P>
He promised that "America will be there every step of the way"
to the path of peace," according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
"The demons of the past are losing their power to divide you,"
Clinton said to thousands of people in Ireland's western town of
Limerick after he was honored by nine Irish universities for
trying to end three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This peace is yours, yours and no one else's. All the leaders
in the world, all the speeches in the world would not have
amounted to a hill of beans if you had not gone out and voted
Yes," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"This is you at your best. Do not let them break your will,"
said Clinton, who on Thursday toured Northern Ireland to offer
words of resolve and encouragement in Belfast, Omagh and Armagh.
</P>
<P>
But he also cautioned that the "enemies of peace" would try to
take away the hopeful future.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will wind up his three-day visit to Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic and head back to Washington later Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Host Pan-African Conference on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A Pan-African conference on how
indigenous and tropical forest dwellers of sub-Saharan Africa
could be protected from the hazards of modern development will be
held in Ghanaian capital Accra on September 7 to 12.
</P>
<P>
A Pan-African News Agency report from Accra said the
conference is being organized by the London-based International
Alliance of Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forests
(IAITPTF) in collaboration with the Green Earth Organization of
Ghana and other multilateral bodies.
</P>
<P>
Seventy private and public sector environmental experts and
journalists from the sub-region would attend the conference under
the theme of "Indigenous People, Forest Dependent Communities and
Biodiversity," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will seek to harmonize indigenous culture and
industrial activity, forest preservation and industrialization,
ethnic and foreign religions, it added.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Ilenre, Secretary-General of IAITPTF, told journalists
in Accra that the conference is meant to provide African
non-governmental organizations with a single document "to serve
as a reference point in our international negotiations on issues
concerning our indigenous people."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the activities of timber merchants, miners,
ivory tusk hunters and industrialists in Africa are carried out
without supervision because most African do not have definite
policies regarding preservation and the interest of indigenous
people.
</P>
<P>
"Most African countries are yet to adopt definite policies on
forest preservation and indigenous people's interest though they
feel deeply concerned about issues affecting indigenous people
and poverty alleviation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will seek to revive African indigenous cultures
and other ethnic rules mean to protect the forest and its
dwellers, which have been relegated to the background as
primitive, he added.

<HEADLINE> Victoria Falls Talks to Focus on Ceasefire: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe said Saturday that Monday's peace summit on the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) will focus on spearheading a
ceasefire and the withdrawal of allied forces from the country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in the Zimbabwean resort town of Victoria Falls
was proposed by Mugabe during the 12th Non-Aligned Movement
summit in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting a delegation of DRC doctors, Mugabe
said the achievement of peace in the Congo would facilitate the
withdrawal of allied (Zimbabwean, Angolan and Namibian) forces.
</P>
<P>
"When we met in Durban, we agreed that the objective of peace
was paramount," Zimbabwe News Agency quoted Mugabe as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there was no need to continue the war in Congo
because forces from both sides no longer wanted to continue
fighting.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces were sent in to help DRC President Laurent
Kabila, who accused Uganda and Rwanda of invading his country by
backing rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean government officials said they were still not sure
if Kabila would be present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the DRC say the rebel leaders and the
Kabila government still had to decide whether they would
participate in the Victoria Falls meeting.
</P>
<P>
Angola and Namibia have been invited to the Victoria Falls.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Hosts Seminar on Investment in South Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Participants at a regional
seminar here on Saturday called for solid political leadership in
South Asian countries to help the region face the challenges and
take advantage of the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
They also called for necessary reform measures in key sectors
of these countries and removing all bureaucrat barriers at the
one-day seminar on "Investment in South Asia," organized by the
Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries and
attended by ministers, former ministers, chamber leaders,
businessmen and leading economists.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the seminar, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina proposed
an Asian energy grid to energize economic activities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
All the South Asian countries should enact substantive and
meaningful changes in their investment and import and export trade
laws, considering the ongoing globalization process, she said.
</P>
<P>
Terming investment the most crucial factor that promotes
growth, she said, "We need a big push in level of investment to
accelerate growth in Bangladesh."
</P>
<P>
She invited foreign investors to invest in Bangladesh to
utilize the country's huge natural and human resources as well as
its vast market here, as the government has relaxed various
restrictions earlier imposed on foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Listing available potentialities for South Asia's rapid growth,
the prime minister said if enormous market, huge untapped natural
resources and human resources were harnessed properly, it would be
easy to convert this region into one of the most prosperous in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Describing globalization both as a challenge and as an
opportunity, Commerce and Industries Minister Tofail Ahmed urged
all countries of the region to integrate their economies with the
globalization process in the interest of the people of South Asia.
</P>
<P>
There should be an in-built confidence among countries of South
Asia, as "we all should try together to benefit ourselves from the
on-going globalization process through ensuring our access to the
world market," he pointed out.

ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
said Saturday that there was a "strong possibility" that Iranian
diplomats reportedly taken hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan
had been killed.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here Saturday afternoon from Kabul quoted
Taliban spokesman Wakil Ahmed Mutawakkil as saying, "the
possibility of their being killed is strong."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Taliban will come up with an answer on
the fate of the 10 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the
Iranian News Agency, known as IRNA.
</P>
<P>
A commission made up of the Taliban militia, Iran and Pakistan
is to investigate the matter under an agreement reached this week.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians remained missing since the Taliban militia stormed
the northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif, the stronghold of the
anti-Taliban Northern Alliance on August 8. The Iranian consulate
in the city was reported to be raided.
</P>
<P>
Iran insists that the 10 diplomats and one IRNA correspondent
are being held by the Taliban in Kandahar. However, the
allegations have repeatedly been denied by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban spokesman said that "within the next week, we will
try to find the bodies of the dead diplomats."

<HEADLINE> 370 Eritreans Leave Ethiopia for Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The office of Ethiopian
government spokesman announced Saturday that a total of 370
Eritreans will be leaving for home Saturday to rejoin family
members who have been deported for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Saturday, the office said the 370
Eritreans are being accompanied by the International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
"When individuals are asked to leave the country, their
families are encouraged to join them and the 370 who are leaving
today have chosen to do so," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government, emanating from its right and
responsibility to guarantee the safety and security of its
citizens, has taken measures to deport "certain categories of
Eritreans" for national security reasons after thorough
investigation of each case, it added.
</P>
<P>
The deportees include Eritreans who were gathering
information, those who were involved in acts of spying against
the security, defense and economic interests of Ethiopia, those
who were organizing and running a covert Eritrean People's
Liberation Front (EPLF) party structure and those donating or
soliciting funds to help the Eritrean regime in its war of
aggression against Ethiopia, according to the office.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian government carries out these deportations in
full observance of international human rights laws and standards
and follows the appropriate due process," the office said, adding
that "the government deports only when it has concrete evidence
that a person has committed acts which fall into one of the above
categories."
</P>
<P>
Eritrea says up to 17,000 of its nationals have been expelled
from Ethiopia since a border dispute between the two countries
erupted in May. But Ethiopia says those deported for security
reasons were only around 4,000.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Condemns Assault on Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami condemned Saturday hardliners' assault on two senior
government officials, calling on the relevant authorities to
seriously deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was reacting in a statement to the Friday attacks by a
group of hardliners on Vice President for Development and Social
Affairs Abdollah Nouri and Minister of Culture and Islamic
Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani attending funeral ceremony for 700
soldiers killed in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.
</P>
<P>
"I call on the information and interior ministries to take
necessary measures to deal with such willful acts and ugly
violence and behavior and the elements attacking Mr. Nouri and
Mr. Mohajerani," Khatami said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the authorities should show little tolerance to "the
ugly acts of a few who adamantly oppose institutionalization of
laws in the society and prevalence of freedom and justice, and the
lawbreakers who for being ignorant or having certain motives only
understand language of force."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president also called on the judiciary to cooperate
with the relevant authorities to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's State Expediency Council, the powerful
arbitrary and advisory body, also condemned Saturday the assault
and called on relevant authorities to pursue the case and
prosecute those responsible for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Nouri and Mohajerani are key figures of the government of
moderate Khatami and main advocates for Khatami's policies on
social freedom and reforms. They have been at odds with the
hardliners who oppose Khatami's policies.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was ousted as Interior Minister by the conservative
Majlis in June in an impeachment motion and Mohajerani, also
government spokesman, has been sharply criticized by the
conservatives for his efforts to push press freedom.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Control Official Cautions Against Laxity as Waters Recede </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the State
Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has again cautioned
against possible laxity in vigilance as floodwaters recede and
stressed there should be no "trusting to luck."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, the official said the two-month
battle against floods has entered the final stage. The primary
task now is to ensure against levee breaches or collapses during
the retreat of floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
Levees in many sections along the Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua
rivers have been weakened by long exposure to water and that
people working on the levees are also weary.
</P>
<P>
"With the coming of autumn winds, the risk of dike slides and
collapse is higher," the official said. "In serious cases, they
can cause levee breaches."
</P>
<P>
He cited many such cases in the last 40 years to illustrate the
danger. The most recent happened in 1996 in Yueyang City in Hunan
Province where the retreating water brought down a section of
dike, causing heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn from historical lessons and avoid making the
same errors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should not drop vigilance and leave things to
chance. Instead, we should have a proper assessment of the flood
situation, continue 24-hour patrolling on the levees and check on,
and reinforce, danger spots to ensure ultimate success," he
added.

Wang, who plays a left-handed topspin game in the handshake
grip, overpowered Sun in the first two sets 21-12, 21-12. But the
18-year-old Sun, who had beat Wang in the Japanese Grand Prix
early this year, fought back to level the score at 8-8 in the
third.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Wang, world silver medallist and World Cup
winner, used her stunning speed and spin to go ahead 20-17 for
three match points, only to be denied by Sun with powerful
forehand attacks.
</P>
<P>
But Wang , who won the Chinese Grand Prix in 1995, grasped the
last chance when Sun took advantage at 21-20, putting it 21-all
before winning two points in a row for the title.
</P>
<P>
"I have been under tough pressure before the match beacuse Sun
beat me this year in Japan," Wang said. "I'm very happy to win
the Chinese Grand Prix for the second time."
</P>
<P>
The victory earned her 8,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sixth seed Wu Na, who dropped to Wang in the semifinals
earlier, finished joint third with fellow Chinese Zhang Hui, a
loser at the hands of Sun.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Leader Seeks Emergency Parliament Sitting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian opposition
leader Lim Kit Siang Saturday called for an emergency sitting of
Parliament to discuss the dismissal of Anwar Ibrahim as deputy
prime minister and finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Lim, who is Democratic Action Party Secretary-General, also
sought a meeting with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to discuss
what he described as a "crisis" following Anwar's firing.
</P>
<P>
Lim also called for the setting up of a royal commission of
inquiry to investigate the allegations made against Anwar.
</P>
<P>
"It should also investigate equally serious allegation by Anwar
that instruments of government have been manipulated in a
political conspiracy to topple him," Lim was quoted by Malaysia's
national news agency Bernama as telling reporters after meeting
Anwar at the latter's house here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Lim said, "It is not a matter concerning a personality. It is a
matter concerning the nation with far-reaching political economic
and social implications. I'm not here to defend Anwar."
</P>
<P>
Anwar was sacked as deputy prime minister and finance minister
of the country on Wednesday without official reasons given.
</P>
<P>
However, there are serious allegations of sexual impropriety
and other possible crimes against him as mentioned in the book "50
Dalil Mengapa Anwar tidak Boleh Jadi PM" (50 Reasons Why Anwar
Cannot Become PM).
</P>
<P>
Anwar denied the allegations and said he was the victim of a
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
Anwar was also expelled from the ruling United Malays National
Organization (UMNO) by the UMNO Supreme Council early Friday.

<HEADLINE> Delegates to Women's Congress Object to "Periodic Employment" (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Periodic employment of women
will violate the legal principle that men and women have equal
rights to work and degrade women's social and family status,
according to some delegates to the Eighth National Congress of
Chinese Women.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) has discouraged the
central government from making any policies on periodic employment
in the current social stage, said Ding Lu, deputy-director of the
Department of Women's Rights and Interests of ACWF.
</P>
<P>
Under "periodic employment," women would stop working for a
period of time after their marriage or delivery and then be
allowed to begin work several years later when their babies have
grown up, Ding explained, adding that it is groundless to say that
this kind of employment system will help relieve the competition
for jobs and reduce under-employment.
</P>
<P>
She said the large population of women employees is not the
major cause for the increasing number of under-employed and
laid-off people. The problem has been brought on by social and
economic reforms during the transitional period, she said.
</P>
<P>
Staying away from work for a long period of time will cause
financial difficulties for a considerable number of families and
can weaken the competitiveness of both skilled female laborers and
intellectual workers, and make it difficult for them to find a job
when they want to resume work.

<TEXT>
<P>
The suspended working period would also mean fewer
opportunities for promotion for females, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
Some elderly delegates, who have engaged in women's work for
many years, said they have been striving to liberate women from
being confined to household work, and to obtain better political
and economic status by involving them in social life. But periodic
employment might bring women back to their families and, in turn,
lower their status in society and the family.
</P>
<P>
The government should not impose periodic employment on women
just because they have an indispensable role in reproduction, said
Professor Tan Lin, an expert in female population from Nankai
University in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Both men and women should take the responsibility for raising
children and doing household work, Tan said. The reality in China
has also proved that many families with newborn babies can find a
way to enable young mothers to work.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls among women conducted by the ACWF show that the
majority of women do not like the idea of periodic employment, Tan
said.
</P>
<P>
The government should respect women's own wills in employment
and should not issue any policies to regulate them, Ding
said. Women in some well-off families may choose periodic
employment, while in many ordinary families the loss of a woman's
job could lead to financial problems.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Shanghai decided long ago not to
issue a policy on "periodic employment," said Li Li, an official
with the city's women's federation.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons is that surveys conducted by the federation
found most of the local women would not accept the policy when
told that, under the periodic employment system, they would have
to find new jobs after staying away from work for a comparatively
long period of time.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Province Bans Forest Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- An area of 4.6 million
hectares of primitive forest in the western part of southwest
China's Sichuan Province will be protected from lumbering because
of forest-logging ban issued earlier this month, according to
today's Overseas Edition of "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
The region, a fountainhead of tributes to the Yangtze River,
China's largest, includes 57 counties and 3.7 million hectares of
shrubbery.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
more than 70 lumber mills here have provided 120 million cubic
meters of commercial timber for the country and contributed two
billion yuan to the state in taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, environmentalists say that over-logging has diminished
the coverage of primitive forest, resulting in serious
desertification of grassland and soil erosion on the upper reaches
of the Yangtze. The area that has experienced soil erosion has
expanded from 60,000 square kilometers in the 1950s to 110,000
today.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking forest area has posed a threat to the life of
rare wildlife such as the giant panda and also to the gigantic
Three Gorges water conservation project. Silt brought to the Three
Gorges by the Chuanjiang River alone amounts to 600 million tons a
year.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan has implemented the ban, which is a part of China's
largest forest-conservation program from now into the next
century. The ban includes protection of forest resources in
Heilongjiang, Jilin and Sichuan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the province will shut down local timber
exchanges, use electricity and coal as substitutes for wood fuel
and allow consumption of fuel forest only for rural living.
</P>
<P>
Among 45,600 lumberjacks employed by the forest industry here,
24,700 will turn into forest-tenders and 13,400 tree-planters. The
rest will shift to other businesses.
</P>
<P>
As lumberjacks turn into tree planters, an area of 1.08 million
hectares of forest is expected in the area by 2010, an increase in
the local forest coverage from the current 19.4 percent to 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
The project will also substantially treat the soil erosion
problem in the Yangtze River Basin.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Still in Deadlock on Forming Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The term of the current
parliament and government of Cambodia will both expire on
September 24, but the three major parties remain in deadlock on
forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
A three-day meeting aimed to boost political reconciliation in
Cambodia opened in Siem Reap Saturday, but failed to yield any
concrete results when the first-day session ended.
</P>
<P>
King Norodom Sihanouk, who hosted the meeting, has been calling
on the three major political parties to make some compromise.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three main political parties --
Cambodian People's Party (CPP), Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party
(SRP) as well as the National Election Committee and the
Constitutional Council participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, the three top party leaders,
did not attend the meeting as the King hoped.
</P>
<P>
None of the three parties were ready to make concession at the
first-day session.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won 64 of the 122 Assembly seats in the July 26 general
elections, but failed to obtain the two-thirds majority required
to form the new government on its own.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has invited Funcinpec and the SRP, which won 43 and 15
seats respectively in the election, to form a coalition
government, but were declined by the two parties, which rejected
as untrue the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and SRP alleged that there were irregularities in the
election and demanded recounting and re-polling in some area.
</P>
<P>
The King has released a message stating the three purposes of
the Siem Reap meeting as restoring order and peace in Phnom Penh,
making it possible to convene the first National Assembly session
and making it functioning normally, and forming the new government.
</P>
<P>
But the King was pessimistic about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I wish," the King said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The parties have deep conflicts with each other and have not
yet agreed to make any concessions or compromises." he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Strengthens Currency Board System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), Hong Kong's de facto central bank, Saturday
announced a package of seven technical measures to strengthen the
currency board system.
</P>
<P>
In its first measure, the HKMA provides a clear undertaking to
all licensed banks in Hong Kong to convert Hong Kong dollars in
their clearing accounts into U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange
rate of 7.75 to one.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Yam, chief executive of the HKMA, said at a press
conference here Saturday: "This explicit convertibility
undertaking is a clear demonstration of the government's
commitment to the linked exchange rate system."
</P>
<P>
He explained that 7.75 was chosen "because it is the current
intervention rate of the HKMA". Under the currency board
arrangements, every 7.8 HK dollars issued is 100 percent backed by
one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Before he unveiled the new initiatives, Yam reiterated two
preconditions, saying: "First, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is firmly committed to the maintenance
of the linked exchange rate system and the adherence to the
discipline of the currency board arrangements under the system."
</P>
<P>
"Second, there will be no foreign exchange controls in the
HKSAR," he said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the HKMA will, starting from September 7,
introduce a discount window arrangement to replace the present
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), a mechanism introduced in
1992 to facilitate interbank liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The specific measures involved are to lift the restriction on
repeated borrowing of banks for provision of overnight Hong Kong
dollar liquidity, to remove the LAF bid rate, and to shift the LAF
offer rate into the base rate of the discount window.
</P>
<P>
Yam said: "The discount rate will be determined from time to
time by the HKMA, which will ensure that interest rates are
adequately responsive to capital flows, and on the other hand,
ensure that excessive volatility of interest rate is dampened."
</P>
<P>
As from September 7, the HKMA will announce each day before the
market opens in Hong Kong the base rate applicable for the day, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA will also introduce a schedule of discount rates for
licensed banks that make access to the discount window with the
Exchange Fund paper in hand. In another measure, the HKMA made it
clear that no new issues of paper other than Exchange Fund paper
will be accepted at the discount window.
</P>
<P>
To make sure that all new Exchange Fund paper will be fully
backed by foreign currency reserves, the HKMA committed that new
Exchange Fund paper will only be issued when there is an inflow of
funds.
</P>
<P>
"The package of seven measures is introduced to purify the
currency board arrangements, and make them less susceptible to
manipulation by speculators in the interbank market," said Yam.
</P>
<P>
He added that the HKMA will enhance the transparency of the
currency board operations by disclosing related materials
frequently.

<HEADLINE> Highest August Mean Temperature Recorded in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- August 1998 was surely among
 the hottest Augusts in the memory of Hong Kong people, with the
mean temperature of the month reaching 29.5 degrees Celsius,
leveling the record made in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Observatory said Saturday that under the
continual influence of a ridge of high pressure during most parts
of August, there were long periods of sunshine and the total
rainfall of the month was below normal.
</P>
<P>
The maximum temperatures at the observatory were higher than
33.0 degrees Celsius on four consecutive days in early August,
which is "rather rare in recent years," said the observatory.
</P>
<P>
The mean temperature from January to August this year, at 24.0
degrees Celsius, also hit a record high since the observatory
started weather recording over a century ago. The previous record
was 23.8 degrees Celsius during the same period in 1966 and 1973.
</P>
<P>
According to historical data, out of the ten hottest months of
August, five coincided with the occurrence of El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino episode which has brought disruption to the global
weather since early last year has weakened significantly. It is
expected that the weather in Hong Kong will return gradually to
near normal conditions, according to local weathermen.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Suara Pembaruan evening daily quoted PSSI spokesperson
Tondo Widodo as saying "the fine is too much and PSSI could not
afford to pay it especially in a crisis situation like now. we
will ask for a dispensation."
</P>
<P>
The fine, approved by the ASEAN Football Federation, was
imposed by the Vietnam Football Federation(VFF) tournament
committee following a Tiger Cup final group match between
Thailand and Indonesia on Monday in Ho Chi Minh City, when
neither team played to win to avoid playing host Vietnam in the
semi-finals in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
An intentional own goal in the dying seconds by Indonesia gave
Thailand a 3-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
Widodo added that PSSI would ask to pay the fine in
installments if a dispensation was not granted.
</P>
<P>
PSSI managed to pay the fine in installments when they were
fined last year for 50,000 dollars after riots erupted during a
final football match for the 19th Southeast Asian Games here.
</P>
<P>
Pembaruan said if its team wins third place, it will win prize
money of 30,000 dollars, leaving it with 10,000 dollars to pay.
</P>
<P>
Because of the scandle, Thailand's soccer coach Thirachai
Wutthitham submitted his resignation amid a public outcry for
Thailand's perrformance.

pull its national soccer team out of the Asian Games in Bangkok

<HEADLINE> India to Test-fire Longer-range Agni Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- India has decided to
test-fire its new longer-range version of the intermediate range
ballistic missile Agni in the coming weeks, Defence Minister
George Fernandes said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Test firing of Agni-II is inevitable...It will be done soon
but no date had been finalized," Fernandes told the Press Trust
of India (PTI).
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times daily reported Saturday that the decision
to conduct the missile test had been taken following the fourth
round of talks between India and the United States last month in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted high-placed Defense Ministry sources as saying
the political decision to go ahead with the tests had been taken
in the light of the perception of the Indian government led by the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that the international fallout from
its nuclear tests in May has been contained and diplomatically
managed.
</P>
<P>
The Indian defense establishment feels that Washington has only
opposed the deployment of missiles and not per se New Delhi's
missile development program.
</P>
<P>
Fernandes said that the new versions of the missile would use
state-of-the-art technologies developed indigenously.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to give details about the missile's
various dimensions and parameters.
</P>
<P>
Indian media reported Saturday that the missile would be
test-fired over a range of 1,400 kilometers, an advance of nearly
700 kilometers over the previous versions.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the delivery system on the anvil is reported to have
the potential to strike targets more than 2,500 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with PTI, Fernandes admitted that India had
begun developing Sagarika, a missile which can be launched from a
ship or a submarine.
</P>
<P>
The Indian defense minister informed the Consultative Committee
under his ministry of the government approval of the longer-ranged
Agni, which use the same state-of-the-art re-entry technology of
the earlier tested intermediate range ballistic missile

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The world's major rice producing
states will convene in Cairo on Monday to discuss ways of boosting
rice production and promoting global cooperation in this field.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from 61 major rice producing countries will attend
the three-day 19th session of the International Rice Commission
(IRC) under the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO), said a news release faxed to Xinhua by FAO's Near
East Regional Office Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The release said the participants would mainly tackle the
challenges and opportunities in sustainable rice production and
post-production, global technology innovation and cooperation in
rice production.
</P>
<P>
Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the
world. Over 50 percent of the world's population depend upon rice
for about 80 percent of their food needs, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the global output of rice is produced and
consumed in developing countries, it added.
</P>
<P>
The FAO estimated that the 1997 world paddy rice production
hit a record 572 million tonnes, a rise of 2 million tonnes from
the previous record in 1996.
</P>
<P>
It said the global rice trade in 1997 dropped to 18.4 million
tonnes, 1.2 million tonnes less than that in 1996 and 2.5 million
tonnes less than the 1995's record level.
</P>
<P>
The IRC was set up at the fourth FAO Conference in 1948 against
the backdrop of an imminent worldwide food shortage. It was aimed
at promoting cooperative actions by member countries in matters
relating to the production, conservation, distribution, and
consumption of rice.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A total of 396 candidates have
registered for the election of Iran's Experts Assembly which
determines the country's supreme leader, local daily Zan (Women)
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The battle for the control of the powerful body between the
moderate and conservative camps is expected to intensify as the
elections date, set on October 23, is nearing.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the formation of the Experts Assembly
in 1983, nine women registered for the election.
</P>
<P>
President Mohammad Khatami, a leading figure in the left-wing
Society of Combatant Clergymen (SCC), has said he has no intention
to run for the election.
</P>
<P>
But the majority of the SCC, the largest political gathering of
the left wing, have registered for the elections, showing the
group's "great interest" in running for the Experts Assembly which
has been so far dominated by the hardline conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Zan quoted the elections chief and Deputy Interior Minister
Mostafa Tajzadeh as saying that the conservative Guardians Council
would start to review the qualifications of the candidates for the
election.
</P>
<P>
Under the constitution, candidates for the Experts Assembly
should have qualified knowledge of Islamic jurisprudence as well
as exact conception and interpretation of the Islamic laws.
</P>
<P>
During the past months, leftwing groups accused the Guardians
Council of rejecting moderate candidates in the past elections and
called for revoking the council's right to review the candidates'
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The left wing expressed great concern that the Guardians
Council may once again reject moderate candidates as part of its
efforts to consolidate the conservatives' hold on the Experts
Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Water Levels Recede at Yangtze, Songhua Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- As the water level of the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River continue to recede,
and navigation has resumed in river sections to the east of Hankou
of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a release of the State Flood Control and Drought
Relief Headquarters, the water levels at major Hydrometric
Stations on the Yangtze, and the Dongting and Poyang lakes
continued to drop today, though many are still higher than the
warning mark.
</P>
<P>
However, the water level at Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu
Province, rose to 9.6 meters, owing to the impact of the changing
astronomical tidal conditions, the Headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in the northeast, the water level of the Songhua
River also continued to subside.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Headquarters still calls for continued
anti-flood vigilance so as to guard against any possible hazard
during water-subsiding period.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban have
denied the accusations they massacred civilians in the northern
Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif during last month's offensive
against the opposition Northern Alliance, the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to an APP report, there were allegations leveled by
the Amnesty International on the Taliban militia that they killed
thousands of women, children and aged men.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a Taliban spokesman as saying that only armed
opponents were killed during the fighting last month.
</P>
<P>
He said the Amnesty International had fallen prey to the
reports of the opponents.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia captured Mazar-i-Sharif, the stronghold of
the Northern Alliance, early last month. The spokesman said Islam
has forbidden the killing of civilians.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Come to No Remedy for Spreading Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The talks between U.S.
and Japanese finance ministers ended Friday night in San Francisco
without coming to any fresh idea to deal with the jittery global
markets, said reports from San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Japanese Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa met for about one and a half hour before
holding separate news briefings in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Both admitted that they had essentially spent the discussion
repeating the previous positions held by the respective side.
</P>
<P>
Japan has pledged that it will implement a program of tax cuts
and increased government spending and will push the Japanese
parliament to enact bills to deal with massive bad loans weighing
down the banking system.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States thinks these measures are not quick
and strong enough, given the importance of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the revival of Japan's economy is key to put
the global economy back on a sound footing, but he heard no new
proposals from Japan during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held at a time when global financial markets
just ended a turbulent week, mainly as a result of the chain
impact produced by the Asian Crisis, which erupted in July, 1997,
and the recent collapse of the Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial, a main indicator for the world
financial situation, finished 41.97 lower to 7,640.25 on
Friday, losing 411.43 points for the past five sessions.
</P>
<P>
The Dow is now about 1,700 points, or about 18 percent, below
the July 17 record of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
After the briefings, Rubin and Miyazawa were joined for dinner
by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of California-Berkeley earlier
Friday, Greenspan said that the U.S. economy may be hurt by
international market turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"It is just not credible that the United States can remain an
oasis of prosperity unaffected by a world that is experiencing
greatly increased stress," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his first comment on recent tumbling stock prices, Greenspan
said that the U.S. central bank now saw a balance of risks facing
the country's economy between deflationary pressure from
international crisis, and domestic inflation.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Irina Spirlea beat Serena
Williams to advance into the fourth round of the U.S. Open here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ninth-seeded Spirlea took the first set 6-3, but lost the
second one 6-0. Neither set produced any intensity.
</P>
<P>
In the third and decisive set, especially in the last two
games, Spirlea took advantage of her powerful serve to wrap up
the match 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Spirlea screamed after the final point and hit a ball high
into the stands.
</P>
<P>
Serena Williams was quite disappointed by the defeat:"I didn't
play that well. She had a lot of big serves i was not able to
return."
</P>
<P>
Spirlea's victory kept up the pattern of favorites advancing
easily in the U.S. Open. Until now, only two seeded women and
three seeded men have been eliminated.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Two key figures within Iran's
moderate government were assaulted Friday by "groups of
unidentified people", the official IRNA news agency reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vice President for Development and Social Affairs Abdollah
Nouri and Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance Ataollah
Mohajerani were attacked while attending a funeral ceremony for
700 Iranian soldiers fallen in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers chanted slogans against Nouri, the former
Interior Minister, who was impeached by the hardline Majlis
(Parliament) in June, and assaulted him and his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was taken to a safe place and then carried away in an
ambulance about 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another group of people attacked Mohajerani while
he was talking to people attending the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani's bodyguards were also attacked, but they did not hit
back, the report said. And several people who tried to intervene
were also beaten up by the attackers.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani decided to stay on at first, but he was taken by
security officials to a nearby building and driven away.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Nouri told the IRNA that he had no
complaints against any particular individuals or groups.
</P>
<P>
He also extended his apology to those who were harmed in
defending him.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohajerani refused to answer a question put by the
IRNA on whom may be behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
Despite the assaults, both Nouri and Mohajerani were in good
condition Friday night, the IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Security authorities are investigating the incident to try to
find out who were behind the attacks, it added.

<HEADLINE> China's 1st Anti-Flood Law Effective in Flood Fighting (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 5 (Xinhua) -- A coal-laden vessel was help
up by flood-control officials from Jiujiang during its voyage on
the Yangtze River on August 7, the day floodwaters teared open a
60 meter-long breach on the levee.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Law on Flood Control, the anti-flood headquarters
has been empowered to use anything possible within reach for the
anti-flood purpose under the state of emergency," said one of
the officials, upon noticing that the captain's reluctance.
</P>
<P>
The captain was asured that all his losses will be compensated
by the government under the law.
</P>
<P>
Today, one month after the vessel was used to fill up the
breach, locals hailed it as a "Meritorious Vessel" and proposed
that it be exhibited in the present position for ever as a witness
for the anti-flooding battles in this city of east China's Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
Of course, Chinese law-makers are no prophets. When they passed
the Flood Control Law last fall, they were by no mean to forecast
that the seasonal floods in 1998 would be the worst flooding after
1954. The law came into force on January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Province became the first to benefit from the law by
declaring a state of emergency among all flood-stricken areas this
summer. When the provincial flood-control headquarters ordered the
city government of Fengcheng to provide flood-fighters with
sandbags immediately, Fengcheng did it without any delay.
</P>
<P>
"We might have parleyed for a good price in the past," says a
Fengcheng official, "but we dared not to do so this time, only
because of the enactment of the law."
</P>
<P>
Anhui, Jiangsu and Hubei provinces along the Yangtze, and a
number of cities in China's northernmost Helongjiang Province,
also declared a state of emergency.

<P>
A series of diversion programs were prepared or carried out in
different places during flood crests. And No one was killed in all
these well and meticulously planned diversions, including the one
in defense of the Daqing Oilfield, the largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, local officials at all levels were made
responsible for a certain section of major river embankments and
lake levees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local governments in flooded areas had torn down a
large number of illegally-built makeshifts or simple houses that
might come in flooding way. "With the law in force, the clear-ups
have become much easier this year," said a local official in
Jiangxi.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1, Anhui Provincial authorities imposed traffic
control on navigation over the local section of the Yangtze so to
keep off waves caused by cruising boats against the dykes and
embankments. And all the crews in 600 vessels have observed the
order over the past five weeks,.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, who took over as chairmanship of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress in Spring this year,
has been among the most arduous advocates of the law.
</P>
<P>
In his phone-calls to leaders of localities, the top lawmaker
made frequent reference to the law, urging localities to implement
it in real earnest during the course of flood fighting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many local officials have reportedly been brought to
justice for violation of the law. In Yueyang City, Hunan Province,
53 officials were disciplined for malfeasance; whereas in
Nanchang, the provincial capital of Jiangxi, three officials were
detained for dereliction of duty in patroling along the dikes.

<HEADLINE> Congress Ready to Form Alternative Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- India's opposition Congress
party said it was ready to form an alternative government in the
event of the fall of the government led by the Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP), local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day conclave of senior Congress leaders Friday
in Panchmari, a hill resort in central Madhya Pradesh, Congress
President Sonia Gandhi said: "If and when the need arises, our
party will fulfill its constitutional obligation without
hesitation and provide stability and progress."
</P>
<P>
Sonia mounted a scathing attack on the BJP-led government for
its "all-round failure", saying that the economy was stagnant,
inflation was on the rise, investment was at an all-time low and
foreign policy was in tatters as the ruling coalition partners
remained embroiled in squabbles.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of repeated
offers of support to Congress by several non-BJP parties including
Rashtriya Loktantrik Morcha and the Communist Party of India
(Marxism) in taking the initiative to pull down the government led
by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and form an alternative one on the basis
of a common minimum program.
</P>
<P>
Sonia said the constituents of the coalition were engaged in an
internecine war bringing to the fore contradictions among them day
after day, as the allies of the BJP spoke in different voices on
various national and international issues.
</P>
<P>
In her 45-minute speech, the Congress president said her party
had never opposed for the sake of opposition but only highlighted
the "failures and follies" of the BJP-led government and would
continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
In what is seen here as her most important address in recent
years, Sonia Gandhi set the tone for new political alignments by
stressing that Congress could take the lead in allying with the
left against the BJP block.
</P>
<P>
"We must take up the ideological crusade against the communal
forces from whatever source it arises," she told the Congress
leaders.
</P>
<P>
She said economic reforms in the country should be free from
dogma and be flexible so that they benefit all sections of the
society, adding that economic policy should be multi-dimensional
to meet the needs of the people at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The Congress president attacked the "confused and unclear"
foreign policy of the Vajpayee government towards China and
Pakistan, adding that it made no effort to mend ties with India's
traditional allies who opposed its nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
"Peace with our neighbors is an essential prerequisite. But in
a matter of a few weeks, the present coalition government
destroyed what the Congress had painstakingly achieved over a
ten-year period to normalize our relations with China," said Sonia
Gandhi.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament to Discuss DRC, Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will meet his parliamentary caucus Sunday over the
deepening crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and
the controversial suspension of privatization process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, usually monthly routine, was arranged after
Museveni called from Durban, South Africa where he was attending
the Non-Aligned Movement summit.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, who returned from the summit Friday, is expected to
discuss the volatile situation in the DRC and Uganda's position
on the matter, a report of the New Nation said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians told the newspaper that the suspension
by the Parliament of the privatization process will also be high
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The recent fiasco of the Banyamulenge rebel campaign in the
southwest of the DRC and the diplomatic isolation of Uganda and
Rwanda who are alleged to be backing them, threaten to box
Kampala in a cold corner.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, Museveni made it clear that Uganda opposes
allied intervention in the DRC conflict because it cannot address
the political issues and cannot solve the problem once and for
all.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Ugandan parliamentarians let out a loud cry
for suspension of the privatization process due to the rampant
corruption in it.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said some senior officials demanded huge sums of
kickback in the purchase of parastatals.
</P>
<P>
However, the state minister for finance in charge of
privatization Matthew Rukikaire is reported to have slapped the
legislature in the face when he declared that he would cooperate
with a probe of the process but would defy parliament and press
ahead with the privatization.

past one and a half months, the official RSS news agency said
Saturday.

</P>
<P>
It noted that though vaccine against the disease is available
now, Nepal has not been able to arrange for such vaccination
because of its high cost.
</P>
<P>
However, vaccination will be arranged in the future for
children who are more prone to the disease, it added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seeks U.N. Help on Locating Missing Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has urged the United
Nations to send a fact-finding team to Afghanistan to find out the
fate of the missing Iranian diplomats, the official news agency
IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi issued the demand at an
urgent meeting Friday with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan Annan
in Durban of South Africa, where they were attending the
Non-aligned Movement summit.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held amid reports that 11 Iranian diplomats,
reportedly captured by the Afghan Taliban militia in Mazari Sharif
in northern Afghanistan last month, may have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi told Annan that the reports of the killing were
extremely alarming, stressing that the Afghan Taliban militia
bears full responsibility for the safety of Iranian diplomats,
journalist and all other Iranian nationals.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Annan, Kharrazi said the U.N. chief
promised to work closely with Iran to make arrangements for the
immediate dispatch of the team.
</P>
<P>
Annan also assured Kharrazi that the U.N. would do everything
possible to prevent further crisis and defuse tension in
Afghanistan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that the Taliban kidnapped 11 Iranian diplomats,
an IRNA reporter and 35 truck drivers on August 8 when the
militia took over Mazari Sharif, the main stronghold of
Iran-backed anti-Taliban Northern Alliance led by the ousted
President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban repeatedly denied knowing the whereabouts
of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA reporter and only admitted
the captivity of the truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
Some reports from Afghanistan said that the Iranian diplomats
and journalist were killed when the Taliban forces occupied
the Iranian consulate in Mazari Sharif on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses were quoted as saying that their bodies were left
in the consulate for two days before being buried in a mass grave
at the Sultan Razieh girls school.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials insisted that the group of Iranians
are still alive and kept by the Taliban in Qandahar, Taliban's
headquarters in southern Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Attracts More Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The unique folklore culture,
Yellow River scenery, ruins of the mysterious Kingdom of Western
Xia regime (1038-1227) have made Ningxia, home to Chinese muslims,
a popular tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region of the Hui ethnic group played host to
half a million Chinese and overseas tourists in the first half of
this year, a year-on-year increase of 11.61 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite all its charm, the region was a late comer China's
tourism industry, and began to receive the first group of overseas
tourists in 1982. The regional tourism bureau was set up four
years later.
</P>
<P>
However, Ningxia's travel industry has made leaps and bounds in
recent years, and the region has opened a number of tourism zones
covering some scenic sites of great interest and is offering six
"golden routes" to both domestic and overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Ningxia received more than 4,200 tourists from
overseas and 1.57 million domestic visitors, as against 1,950
overseas arrivals and 500,000 domestic visits in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A French girl, now studying in Zhejiang University in east
China, said after a trip to Ningxia that she used to take Ningxia
for America's west but she unexpectedly came across water scenery
and vivid landscapes as beautiful as greeneries in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Tourism experts expected that with the continued improvement of
transportation facilities in China's western regions, more and
more tourists will flock to Ningxia.

Nunn beat Glenn Thomas with a unanimous decision in a 10-round
cruiserweight all-American fight Friday night in Miami, the
United States.
</P>

him winning 100-90. Nunn improved his record to 53-4.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Vice President to Pay Landmark Visit to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Iranian First Vice President
Hassan Habibi is to pay a landmark visit to Iraq later this month
to sign "a significant agreement" with his Iraqi counterpart Taha
Yassin Ramadan, the Tehran Times reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The draft of the agreement has already been prepared by
experts of the two countries who met recently in Baghdad," the
daily quoted an informed source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said the two countries have agreed on the
implementation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 that
ended the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war (1980-88).
</P>
<P>
The resolution covered issues of the exchange of prisoners of
war, sharing water on the Arvand Rud, exchanging visits of the
nationals in both countries, ensuring border security to prevent
smuggling and fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iraq also agreed that the Iranian outlawed Mujaheddin Khalq
Organization (MKO) would be "thrown out" from the country, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, Tehran's main armed opposition group based in Iraq,
has launched a series of attacks on Iranian interests inside and
outside Iran. Last month, two MKO members assassinated former
head of the country's Prison Organization Assadollah Lajevardi in
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The group, declared illegal by Iranian authorities in 1981, is
still one of the main hurdles for Tehran and Baghdad to normalize
their relations 10 years after the end of the Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that the two sides agreed to share
the water on Arvand Rud according to the Algiers Accord
signed in 1975 in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will provide official guarantees for the
safety and security of visitors of both sides and will also do all
to maintain peace on their borders to prevent any infiltration of
terrorists or smugglers.

OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Investigators are continuing
their search for the two flight data recorders from Swissair
Flight 111 which could be crucial in explaining the plane's
devastating crash off Canada.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the tragic crash of Swissair Flight 111, there
has been no clear word about the cause or any sign of the black
box recorders.
</P>
<P>
Canadian investigators Friday listened to tapes of
conversations between the crew and air traffic controllers in
Moncton, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
However, according to investigators, the pilots spoke calmly,
and though they said they had an emergency, they never sent out
the traditional call of "Mayday".
</P>
<P>
The investigators appeared to be leaning toward pilot error or
mechanical failure as causes of the crash, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
All 229 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. Efforts
have now been shifted from the rescue operation to search and
salvage.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Canadian navy submarine was called in to help find
the recorders using sonar and listening devices.
</P>
<P>
The two recorders can emit locator signals for 30 days.

Funcinpec and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) as well as the National
Election Committee (NEC) and the Constitutional Council took part
in the three-day meeting which ends on September 7.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, Second Prime Minister and vice-president of the CPP,
and Chea Sim, chairman of the CPP and president of the National
Assembly, did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen cancelled plans to attend because Prince Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy, presidents of the two opposition parties, were not
taking part.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, the King stated its three aims: to restore
order and peace in Phnom Penh; to make it possible to convene the
first National Assembly session and make it function normally; and
to form new government.
</P>
<P>
But the King had no confidence to the results of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have much hope that the three-day meeting will have
the positive result that I wish," he wrote in a message Friday.
"The parties had deep conflicts with each other and have not yet
agreed to make any concessions or compromises."
</P>
<P>
The weekend talks are expected to focus on the complaints and
appeals process that the opposition says favored the CPP.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec was represented by party Secretary-General Tol Lah,
Uk Vithun and Pok Than. Ranariddh was in Bangkok. While the SRP
sent Ou Bunlong, a legal adviser and other two party members to
attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The CPP won a majority seats of the National Assembly in the
July 26 election, but failed to win two-thirds of the seats needed
to form a new government by itself.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP insisted that their demands for
ballot-recounts, revotes in some areas, ballot reconciliation and
the use of an earlier seat formula more favorable to them, be met
before they will discuss forming a coalition government with the
CPP.

<HEADLINE> IMF Package Not Working, Say Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) package has not succeeded in pulling Thailand out of
its economic doldrums, a seminar concluded here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Since Thailand's economy has not yet recovered despite spending
a year under the IMF reforms, the IMF package is a wrong solution,
said financiers and academics attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
The IMF had made a mistake in exposing Thailand to
international market movements, National Finance Plc senior
executive Chartichai Palasuk said at the seminar entitled "Does
the IMF Have Good Intentions Towards Thailand?"
</P>
<P>
The IMF came to Thailand's rescue with a
17.2-billion-U.S.-dollar package after the baht depreciation
plunged the country into a financial crisis. But the IMF aid would
not materialize unless Thailand carried out IMF-proposed drastic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Chartichai, who had previously been employed by the IMF, said
the biggest IMF mistake was that it underestimated the problem of
capital flight. Because of massive capital flight, Thailand needs
26.1 billion dollars in capital inflow over the next 10 months or
so to overcome the present tight liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, he said, also made wrong predictions that foreign
lenders would cease calling back short-term loans to Thailand and
become more confident that the country would pay them back.
However, when the Bank of Thailand's swap obligation was
disclosed, the loans got called back to a greater extent than
before.
</P>
<P>
The IMF worked out its measures in negligence of the fact that
foreign investors were concerned that Thailand's financial
institutions remained unviable, thus putting Thailand in an
unfavorable position, Chartichai said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is still suffering from capital flight as foreign
creditors keep calling back loans, he added.
</P>
<P>
The solution set at the IMF's suggestion is to create a dollar
income through net export, long-term overseas borrowings and
selling of the country's assets. But some experts pointed out that
all these would be hard to come true as they depend on
international market conditions, which are very volatile.
</P>
<P>
The negative economic growth of Thailand for this year would
be seven to eight percent, worse than what the IMF previously
predicted, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
They noted that while the crisis was attacking the real sector
and labor market, the IMF still focused on solving the problems of
financial institutions, even though they represented only 10
percent of the country's fiscal woes.

<HEADLINE> 13 Die, 100 Missing in Boat Capsize in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people died and a
hundred others were missing in a ferry boat capsize in a river of
Bangladesh Friday afternoon, media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The mechanized ferry boat carrying over-capacity passengers
sank at about 5:00 p.m. in Shaniazan river, a tributary of the
turbulent Teesta river running through northwest part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
As rescue operation continued, villagers and also officials
feared many of those missing might have been drowned in the river.
</P>
<P>
There were at least 125 passengers in the boat that was
overturned by strong currents coming from upstream across the
border, and only the boatman and two others could avert the
tragedy by swimming ashore, a witness said.
</P>
<P>
Divers of the fire service from three local districts have been
called out for a massive rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The death toll might be higher, as search for the rest of the
passengers continued, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Local administration, backed by villagers and the Bangladeshi
troops from the No.27 Battalion, continued rescue operation since
the boat capsized.

<HEADLINE> Thai Liquidity Easing: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT) has
revealed that the liquidity crunch is easing owing to lower
withdrawals at financial institutions and lower short-term
interest rates in the repurchase market.
</P>
<P>
Since August last year to September this year, Thai commercial
bank deposits had risen by eight percent, "a satisfactory level
given the present economic conditions," BOT Governor Chatumongol
Sonakul said in remarks published Saturday by the Nation
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The central bank Friday auctioned bonds worth 17.5 billion baht
(410 million U.S. dollars) at a lower yield compared to the level
last week.
</P>
<P>
The one-year government bonds had been auctioned at a yield of
11.9 percent, compared to previous bonds at 12.5 percent. The rate
has been steadily declining from 14.25 percent on June 22.
</P>
<P>
This is the 11th in a weekly series of issues totaling 500
billion baht (12.5 billion dollars) to replenish BOT's rescue fund
for financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Since the rates are aimed at setting benchmarks for banks the
declining level is likely to pull down lending rates.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the 11th issue had been over-subscribed
by 2.72 times, with bids in the range of 11.5 to 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said that at present, government bonds held by
financial institutions account for 15 to 16 percent of the gross
national product (GNP).

<HEADLINE> More State-Owned Cinemas to Be Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nine more state-owned cinemas
in various cities of Myanmar will be fully privatized for
continuous business operation as part of the country's
privatization scheme, according to the Privatization Commission
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The cinemas to be sold through competitive bidding include
those in Yangon, Bago, Myaungmya, Maubin, Mandalay, Pyin Oo Lwin
and Amarapura.
</P>
<P>
The cinemas also include those nationalized during the time of
the Revolutionary Council, the former government in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, over 145 state-run cinemas in various
states and divisions have been designated to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a 30-ton state-owned rice mill in Thanatpin, Bago
division, will also be sold to local entrepreneurs, according to
the Saturday's official paper the New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than two dozen state-owned saw mills in the
country have been reportedly privatized.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar announced privatization of 51 state-owned
economic enterprises (SEEs) in the first phase in January 1995,
the privatization process has been under way in various forms
including auctioning and leasing out the SEEs or establishing
joint ventures with local and foreign entrepreneurs.

<HEADLINE> Most Thai Army Vehicles Made Idle Due to Fuel Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The economic recession took
its toll in Thai army as about 25,000 or 80 percent of army
vehicles have been made idle with tyres and batteries removed
because the army's fuel budget has been cut by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cost-cutting measures ordered by the army chief, General
Chettha Thanajaro, have left only 20 percent of all army vehicles
in operation, the Bangkok Post newspaper said Saturday, quoting an
army source.
</P>
<P>
The army has 22 divisions, 62 regiments, 248 battalions and 744
companies.
</P>
<P>
Army officers, who used to get 200 liters of gasoline a month
for their position cars, now have to pay for fuel and repairs from
their own pockets, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have also turned to pooled vans to reduce the
expenses of using their own vehicles, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides the fuel budget cut, General Chettha has also ordered
all army units to use water and electricity sparingly.
</P>
<P>
The units have to pay for themselves any water and power use
beyond permitted hours.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of their air-conditioners have been left
unused, the source said.

<P>
OTTAWA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Investigators are continuing
their search for the two flight data recorders from Swissair
Flight 111 which could be crucial in explaining the plane's
devastating crash off Canada.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the tragic crash of Swissair Flight 111, there
has been no clear word about the cause or any sign of the black
box recorders.
</P>
<P>
Canadian investigators Friday listened to tapes of
conversations between the crew and air traffic controllers in
Moncton, New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
However, according to investigators, the pilots spoke calmly,
and though they said they had an emergency, they never sent out
the traditional call of "Mayday".
</P>
<P>
The investigators appeared to be leaning toward pilot error or
mechanical failure as causes of the crash, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
All 229 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. Efforts
have now been shifted from the rescue operation to search and
salvage.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a Canadian navy submarine was called in to help find
the recorders using sonar and listening devices.
</P>
<P>
The two recorders can emit locator signals for 30 days.

<HEADLINE> 8th Int'l Gem, Jewelry Exhibition Opens in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 5 (Xinhua) -- the 8th International Gem and
Jewelry Exhibition was opened for a four-day run here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Export Development Board (SLEDB) and the National
Gem and Jewelry Authority are co-sponsoring the exhibition whose
objectives are to attract a vast international market, organizers
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition provides a showcase to the world proclaiming Sri
Lankan finest resources and creativity in the field of gems and
jewelry, they added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Trade, Commerce and Food Minister T. Wickramratna
and more than 100 local and foreign buyers including those from
Australia, Thailand, Tanzania, Japan and China's Hong Kong
attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A maximum of 65 booths of Sri Lanka's famous precious gem
stones with a few booths from abroad display goods at the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka was referred to as an "island of gem", and historical
evidence showed the gems were an important product of trade during
early times.
</P>
<P>
Many of the largest sapphires in museum collections around the
world were discovered from the gravel of Sri Lanka. With the
discovery of the 850 carats Blue Sapphire last month, Sri Lanka is
still the number one producer of good blue sapphires, said A.
Ellawala, chairman of the National Gem and Jewelry Authority.

<HEADLINE> Central America, Caribbean Barred From Rio Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central American and
Caribbean countries will not be admitted into the Group of Rio
(GR) because of opposition from Peru, Paraguay, Brazil and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The opposition of the most prominent members of this regional
organization to the inclusion of Central America and the Caribbean
is based on the fact that the Group of Rio is only a mechanism of
consultation and discussion.
</P>
<P>
One of the concerns of the South American countries is that the
inclusion of more nations in the group could cause the breaking-up
of the Organization of American States (OAS), which is said by
some of its member countries to be passive in solving the problems
of the hemisphere, and totally dependent on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said the addition of new
members could make it lose the essence of representativeness and
coordination with which it was created.
</P>
<P>
"This mechanism of consultation must not become a Latin America
and the Caribbean summit, because there are already mechanisms for
that," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazil had lost almost
15.7 billion U.S.dollars from its international reserves by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's international reserves dropped more than 10 billion
dollars in August, from 72 billion to 60 billion dollars, because
of the international financial crisis, the Brazilian press said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's international reserves amounted to almost 58 billion
dollars recently, compared to 62 billion dollars in October, 1997,
when Asia's economic crisis appeared.
</P>
<P>
The "Folha de Sao Paulo" newspaper said 1.724 billion reals
(1.473 billion dollars) in hard currency exited the Sao Paulo
Stock Exchange in August, the largest amount to go.
</P>
<P>
A report from the stock exchange, Friday, said foreigners
bought 2.33 billion reals (2.72 billion dollars), and sold 4.053
billion reals (4.74 billion dollars) in stocks in the

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's
international reserves dropped to 8.8 billion U.S. dollars at the
end of August from 10.3 billion dollars in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Del Villar, executive board member of the Bank of the
Republic, said the central bank had to spend some of its reserves
to avoid the drastic devaluation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall, the amount of hard currency was enough to
defend the new exchange band, modified on Wednesday to permit a
bigger devaluation of the peso, which could hit 23 percent this
year, Villar said.
</P>
<P>
The 8.8 billion dollars in reserves "gives us a big capability
to defend the new exchange band" in case the pressures against the
peso intensified, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Bank of the Republic had "other monetary
instruments" to prevent the peso from devaluing beyond what had
been foreseen in the band within which the Colombian currency
floats.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Insists on Antibiotics Ban, Despite EU Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will continue to ban
the use of antibiotics in animal food, a practice that is allowed
in the rest of the European Union (EU), despite the EU requirement
for it to act in accordance with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics are used in farm animal food to induce growth,
while recent study indicates that bacteria in animals may develop
resistance to antibiotics, which in turn affects humans.
</P>
<P>
Sweden banned the use of antibiotics in 1986. When it joined
the EU in 1995, the country was given an exemption from the law
which allows the use of antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The exemption is due to expire on this December 31.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Minister of Agriculture Annika Ahnberg has demanded a
meeting with the EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler in an
effort to extend the exemption.
</P>
<P>
The minister was optimistic, but stressed that if the verdict
was not in Sweden's favor it will put up a fight.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Economy to Register a 5 Percent Increase in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean economy is
growing this year at a real rate of five percent, announced
Chilean President Eduardo Frei on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to the Chamber of Commerce, Industry and
Agriculture of Panama during a two-day official visit before
taking part in the 12th Summit of the Rio Group.
</P>
<P>
Chile was in its fifth year with a single digit inflation, with
a rate that could be 4.5 percent this year, if the trend was
maintained, said Frei.
</P>
<P>
The economic stability had solid roots in 13 consecutive years
of budget surplus and a high level of national savings. The rate
of investment in fixed capital was 33 percent of the gross
domestic product in 1997, added Frei.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of foreign investment increased from 1.32
billion dollars in 1990 to 5.04 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We joined the Mercosur (the Southern Common Market) countries
in 1996, last year we signed the first free trade agreement with
Canada, and this year we expanded our agreement with Mexico," he
said. "We are ready to start a free trade agreement with the
European Union, within a general agreement we signed in 1996."
</P>
<P>
Frei ended his visit to Panama this afternoon and will take
part in the 12th the Rio Group Summit opening tonight at the
National Theater here.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Plans For Expanding Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang will
continue to tap its tourism resources and increase its presence in
the Asian market despite the financial turmoil that has greatly
harmed local economy.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau targeted Japan, Hong
Kong and Taiwan as three priorities for the second half of this
year and 1999 in its tourism promotion plan.
</P>
<P>
Regular promotions in South Korea and Southeast Asian countries
will remain as usual.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of Asian tourists dropped 16.3 percent in
the first half of this year, they still account for 64.6 percent
of the total number of overseas tourists visiting the province, as
statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
The decrease of Asian tourists was also partially attributed to
the relatively poor services offered by travel agencies, backward
transportation and lack of adequate products aimed at tourism in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Besides improving these conditions, the Asian financial turmoil
has forced tourism agencies to step up their promotions in order
to face severe challenges from their overseas counterparts, said
the bureau official.
</P>
<P>
Xu Peng, a marketing official from the provincial tourism
bureau, said the province is to allocate special funds starting
next year to build up the image of Zhejiang's tourism industry
abroad.

Movement for the Liberation of Angola. He asked the United Nations
to take action to prevent the situation in Angola from worsening.
</P>
<P>
Also under discussion were the Bosnian issue, NATO's eastern
expansion and the next NATO summit, Gama said.

Experts estimate that the enlarged investment in traffic
infrastructure can contribute by 0.9 percent to the economic

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Floodwaters in China's major
swollen rivers have begun to subside, but people's enthusiasm in
helping the disaster victims is still on the rise, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Day by day, trucks,laden with disaster relief materials have
been shuttling from downtown Jingzhou to surrounding
flood-affected counties and districts.
</P>
<P>
Within the city, a new donation drive is being launched
encouraging municipal government officials and staffs to donate 50
to 100 percent of their August salaries.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is forcing them to do this--they are doing it on their
own accord," Zhang Xiuping, an official with Jingzhou local
government was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu Keyi, the city's Party secretary, initiated the donation
campaign after visiting the flood-ravaged regions.
</P>
<P>
Flooding had killed 133 people and destroyed 10 million
hectares of cultivated fields in areas around Jingzhou, Hubei
Province, by August 31.
</P>
<P>
The flood had also inundated 500,000 homes and led to the
relocation of 750,000 people, causing 14.88 billion yuan (1.79
billion US dollars) in losses to the city.
</P>
<P>
The first round of donations of money and materials by staffs

BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Nine of the foreign banks in
the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) have officially applied
for the right to run local currency business activities, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Their applications were submitted to the Shenzhen Branch of the
People's Bank of China (PBOC) in south China's Guangdong Province
for approval.
</P>
<P>
On August 11, PBOC, China's central bank, announced that
Shenzhen would be the second city in China to open its Renminbi
business to foreign banks after Shanghai, where nine overseas
banks were granted licenses at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decision is viewed as a positive step in improving the
domestic banking sector. Also, foreign enterprises will benefit
from the news since by running Yuan business, foreign banks will
be able to offer more convenient services, said Zhou Bo, director
of the strategic development department of the Shenzhen branch of
the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
It would help curb underground market activities and improve
the investment environment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also anticipated a new round of competition among banks in
the long run which would prompt domestic banks to increase the
number and quality of their services, thus enlarging the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, which hosted the first foreign bank in China, boasts
53 foreign financial institutions including 25 foreign bank
branches.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, total assets of foreign financial
institutions in the city amounted to 6.2 billion U.S. dollars,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 5 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-flood measures,
particularly those reinforced in recent years, have helped prevent
flood damage estimated at 710 billion yuan (85.5 billion US
dollars), today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
These measures include levees built along the flood-prone
rivers, large reservoirs situated near the rivers, large-scale
drainage of water-logged fields, and the hard work of professional
emergency squads, the daily quoted the Ministry of Water Resources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Current official statistics show that damage, particularly that
caused by the severe flooding along the Yangtze River and the
Songhua River in the northeast China so far amounts to some 167
billion yuan (20 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, water conservancy projects and other flood-control
efforts have prevented vast areas of land, incorporating more than
200 cities, from being inundated, water officials were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This summer, levees along the middle stretches of the Yangtze
from the cities of Shishou to Hukou have ensured the safety of
more than 60 million people, 3.3 million hectares of farmland and
numerous key cities and industrial towns such Wuhan, Jiujiang and
Yueyang, as well as preventing major damage to the Beijing-Kowloon
and Beijing-Guangzhou railways.
</P>
<P>

the Yangtze prevented 300 billion yuan (36.1 billion US dollars)
of damage.

expected to last for between three and eight months depending on
the region.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the expected high rainfall could be the La Nina
weather phenomenon, Diharto said.
</P>
<P>
La Nina features colder-than-normal ocean temperatures in the
Pacific and sometimes follows the drought-inducing El Nino weather
pattern. El Nino is the opposite to La Nina and involves the
warming of the eastern Pacific.
</P>
<P>
La Nina is expected to bring heavy rains to Southeast Asia but
drought to parts of South America this year.
</P>
<P>
Diharto said he hoped the relevant government agencies would
begin to draft contingency plans for severe weather immediately.
</P>
<P>
He also warned of flash floods, recalling that Jakarta was hit
by floods attributed to La Nina in the first two months of 1996
that claimed the lives of 32 people.

<P>
BELGRADE, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic called on the Serbian government and ethnic Albanian
political parties on Thursday to resume talks on the future of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic was speaking after meeting Russian First Deputy
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay
Afanasievsky in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told them that Yugoslavia will take all possible
measures to ensure the safety of people who left their homes
during the conflict and guarantee their return.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia was willing to cooperate with the International Red
Cross and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees in providing humanitarian aid to the Kosovo people, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministers agreed that peace in the region would be
more attainable if the international community stopped exerting
pressure on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They also maintained that the conflict could only be solved by
political means and that terrorist activities that threatened
lives must be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The three praised the joint statement which Milosevic and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed in July as the most
important contribution to peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Serbian authorities and the ethnic Albanians
had agreed to a procedural breakthrough, opening the way for
substantive peace talks and a possible end to the conflict which
has claimed many lives and displaced thousands of people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Establish National Reconciliation Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
establish a National Reconciliation Team to head off the rising
threat of disintegration and separatism in the country, national
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of the team to forge national integration is very
important nowadays, as the society is being threatened by
separatism and disintegration," Minister of Justice Muladi told
reporters after a meeting between President B.J. Habibie and a
delegation from the National Commission on Human Rights here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The team, comprised of Cabinet ministers, human rights
activists and other public figures, was expected to united all of
the nation's forces, encourage people to turn past adverse
experiences into bitter but valuable lessons for a better future
and bridge gaps between conflicting parties in the society, Muladi
said.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Indonesia have flared as the country's descent into
poverty worsens. Thousands of ethnic Chinese have fled the country
after being targeted in fierce rioting in recent months.
Separatist protests have also mounted in some provinces since
former president Soeharto resigned on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Muladi told reporters that the discussion focused on the human
rights situation in the country and the effort to find the best
way to create a harmonious civil society.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita pointed out the
importance of national reconciliation in creating a conducive
atmosphere for the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Muladi said he would take part in the reconciliation team along
with Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto and several members of
the National Commission on Human Rights, including its deputy
chairman Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
Marzuki said national reconciliation was needed because the
country's unity was endangered if people's relationships were
marked by suspicion and the government was continually distrusted.

<HEADLINE> China Has Approved Over 314,000 Foreign-Funded Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The newspaper, sponsored by the State Statistics Bureau, noted
that these projects have a combined contractual foreign investment
of 545.366 billion U.S. dollars, of which 242.321 billion
U.S. dollars have already been invested.
</P>
<P>
The last five years have witnessed the fastest growth of
foreign investment in China, and foreign investment is playing an
ever more vital role in the growth of the Chinese economy, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1993, China has for five consecutive years remained the
second largest recipient of foreign funds, after the United
States," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment accounted for 14.79 percent of China's total
investment on fixed assets expansion at the end of last year,
while the ratio was a mere 4.2 percent in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded firms now employ 18 million local people, about
10 percent of the country's non-farming population.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment now covers almost all fields of the
Chinese economy, with infrastructure, energy, raw materials,
communications and high-tech projects taking a more prominent
position over the years.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 200 of the world's top 500 firms have
invested in China, a majority of these are involved in the
machinery, electronics and infrastructural sectors.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Room Rates Rise 10 Percent in Greater Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The average cost of a
hotel room in Greater Los Angeles increased nearly 10 percent
during the first half of the year, according to statistics
released by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The average room rate climbed to 108.41 US. dollars a night,
about 9.44 U.S. dollars more per room than compared with the first
six months of 1997, the Los Angeles Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau
(LACVB) said.
</P>
<P>
Although economic turmoil in Asia has slowed tourism from the Far
East, particularly from Japan and South Korea, the bureau said,
business and convention travel to the region remained high.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of 1998, the Los Angeles Convention
Center was booked about 70 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
The LACVB predicted that hotel room rates will continue to
climb as area hoteliers attempt to set their prices closer to
rates in other major cities, such as New York, which has an
average nightly room rate of 201.54 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The market here has been undervalued for a long time," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy rates, currently between 75 percent to 80 percent,
probably won't rise because the regional hotel market has hit its
"effective capacity" -- an industry standard that predicts how
many bookings a hotel can hope for in a given market, the report
pointed out.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central Jakarta District
Court Friday sentenced three foreigners to between 6 and 14 years
in prison for trafficking and possessing a total of 6.6 kilograms
of heroin in different sessions, the Jakarta Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three defendants were Colling Nyi Bongo from Malawi, and
Nigerians Emeka Simon Eloka and Christian Chukwu.
</P>
<P>
Colling, a former Malawian policeman, was sentenced to 14 years
in jail and was fined 5 million rupiah (500 U.S. dollars) for
trafficking 3.7 kilograms of heroin in November last year.
</P>
<P>
Colling provided information during his interrogation which led
police to arrest Emeka and Christian, who were staying in a rented
room in Central Jakarta. Police confiscated 2.9 kilograms of
heroin from the two Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced Emeka and Christian to 9 years and 6 years
in jail respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have successfully cracked down on another
illegal drug ecstasy factory Friday, the second bust in a week.
</P>
<P>
Two men were arrested and materials used to make the drug
confiscated, according to the Indonesian Observer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The raw materials confiscated are enough to produce 800,000
ecstasy pills worth up to 16 billion rupiah (1.6 million U.S.
dollars) if sold at the minimum price of 20,000 rupiah each,
Commander of the National Detective and Crime Directorate Maj.
Gen. Da's Bachtiar said.

<HEADLINE> Denmark Has the Highest Taxes in the World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Denmark has the highest
taxes in the world, showed the latest statistics released by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The ranking is based upon 1996 tax revenues. Denmark topped in
1996 the high-tax-league with a tax of 52.2 percent, closely
followed by Sweden, with 52.0 percent. But preliminary figures
showed that in 1997 Swedish taxes amounted to 53,3 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
According to Unibank in Copenhagen, the Danish government
expects statistics to show that total taxes were lower, not
higher, in 1997. That means that Sweden may already have the
highest taxes.
</P>
<P>
Total taxes, defined as total tax revenues as a percentage of
GDP at market prices, increased in most OECD countries in 1996. On
average, taxes comprised 37.7 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Production of Glass Utensils Growing in Shanxi Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 5 (Xinhua) -- The production of glass
utensils has developed rapidly in Qixian County in north China's
Shanxi Province in recent years.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest production center for glass utensils, Qixian
County has reached approximately 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars) of annual output value. About 95 percent of the products
are exported to more than 50 countries and regions such as the
United States, Canada, France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Qixian has a long history of glass utensil making, dating from
the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) about 600 years ago. Glass utensils
produced here were used as tribute to emperors.
</P>
<P>
The county now has 35 enterprises involved in glass utensil
production with a work force of 8,500 and annual export earnings
of 95 million yuan (11.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Development of glass utensil production has also brought
profits to other sectors such as packaging and transportation.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Turning Air Raid Shelters Into Shopping Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is exploiting its
web-like underground air raid shelters commercially, turning the
formerly dark and damp tunnels into noisy and busy business and
recreation centers.
</P>
<P>
Yang Sen, director of the city's civil defense office, said the
city has converted 1.5 million square meters of underground air
raid shelters into "underground streets," where locals and
tourists can find refuge from the summer heat, do business, and
have fun.
</P>
<P>
At the "underground city" at the People's Square in central
Shanghai, over 100 supermarkets, shops, bars, ballrooms,
barbershops and other businesses are operating. Tunnels further
below the city have become parking spaces capable of holding 600
cars.
</P>
<P>
Yang went on to say that Shanghai will continue to explore the
former defense tunnels to create additional living space for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
The city is building its first underground tunnel across the
Huangpu River, which crosses the city, and the tunnel will be
ready for use next year, he added.

<HEADLINE> Lazio Offers 1.5m Pounds for Owen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian giants Lazio are
prepared to gamble 1.5 million pounds (about 2.5 million U.S.
dollars) just to secure an option on Michael Owen, who shot a
wonder goal at the World Cup in France this summer.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Friday, the Lazio are offering
the cash knowing they will lose it if Owen stays. But if English
Premier club Liverpool do decide at any stage to part with Owen,
Lazio would be guaranteed first place in the queue.
</P>
<P>
But Owen is unlikely to be going anywhere soon, having just
signed to the Merseysiders for another five years.
</P>
<P>
It is the latest development in a frenzy of interest -
dubbed"Owen-mania" - that has surrounded the 18-year-old prodigy
since his electrifying performance in the 1998 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> Possible Huge Quake Threatens New Zealand South Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 5 (Xinhua) -- South Island of New Zealand
faces an earthquake of magnitude 8 on the Richter scale within the
 next few decades, a Wellington-based newspaper Saturday quoted an
influential panel of scientists as saying.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes only days after scientists predicted an
equally big earthquake in Wellington.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion reported that 20 scientists from New Zealand and
other countries emerged Friday from two days of talks in
Wellington to pool their research, including study on the dates of
rock falls and forest disturbances along the west coast of South
Island.
</P>
<P>
Kelvin Berryman of the Institute of Geological and Nuclear
Sciences of New Zealand was quoted as saying: "They do tend to
come in clusters. Whether this Alpine Fault earthquake is part of
the next cluster, we don't know."
</P>
<P>
"We're not talking next week. We're talking a longer time
frame, but with catastrophic results," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the scientists, the predicted massive earthquake
is overdue on the Alpine Fault, running from Hokitika to
Murchison.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the Alpine Fault has ruptured four
 times in the past 1,000 years, with each rupture producing an
earthquake of about magnitude 8. Approximate dates of the four
ruptures wee 1100, 1450, 1620 and 1717.
</P>
<P>
Berryman said that South Islanders could expect buildings to
sink, tilt or topple, and the earth to liquefy or slide away.
</P>
<P>
The scientists did not want to be "doomsayers". But it was
important to warn local and national authorities, "so they can
prepare to manage and mitigate the disaster", he said.
</P>
<P>
After the prediction of a strong Wellington earthquake was made
public Tuesday, the local TV station organized a discussion on
the topic of "Are you prepared when an earthquake hits" to raise
public awareness of the danger.

<HEADLINE> Camdesus Says Latin American Economies on Right Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The Latin American
economies are "on right track" and could finally resist the
current world-wide financial crisis, Michael Camdesus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters following a two-day meeting of top
financial officials from 11 Western Hemisphere countries, Camdesus
said that he was "encouraged" by the atmosphere of the meeting,
which was convened amid financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"I was personally very impressed by the sense of realism but at
the same time the sense of purpose and the sense of togetherness
these ministers and governors were demonstrating in this
occasion," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"These are difficult times and times when, well, the temptation
is strong to get it alone," he said, adding that nobody tries to
"to escape from the constraints or to go to any kind of ostrich
policy."
</P>
<P>
Echoing sentiments expressed by several of the ministers,
Camdesus said financial markets "do not differentiate properly
among good (economic) players and those who are less convincing."
</P>
<P>
"The medium and long term outlook for Latin America in our
judgment remains strong," said Camdesus.
</P>
<P>
Camdesus said the IMF and its sister financial institutions
were prepared to strengthen and broaden their support for Latin
American countries and would consult closely in advance of their
annual meetings early next month on the best ways to do this.
</P>
<P>
Camdesus also said that even though the IMF's coffers have
been depleted by billion dollar rescue packages for Asia and
Russia the organization still had sufficient funds to carry out
its programs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the U.S. Senate's approval of 18 billion U.S.
dollars in new funding for the IMF, he said he was hopeful the
House will follow the Senate because by doing this the U.S. would
strengthen itself against market uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the turmoil in Russia and Asia, stock markets
across Latin America and the U.S. are going down while the
currencies of some Latin American countries started to devalue.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts feared that the turmoil will result in a
crisis in the U.S. and then a recession around the globe.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the two-day meeting at the IMF headquarters was
to discuss the global financial turmoil and current prospects,
their impact on the Western Hemisphere, and the strategies of the
countries in the region to adapt to the more difficult external
environment.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody was coming here to ask for money... not because they
could believe that we wouldn't have enough to face the problem but
because they do believe that they have already done the right
things, that they are on the right track," Camdesus said.
</P>
<P>
In a communique after the first day of their meeting, the
officials said they will pursue "continued macroeconomic
stability" and implement "sound fiscal policies" in order to gain
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The will also maintain their current exchange rate policies and
regimes, open capital markets while continue and deepen their
structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that "the external environment had
deteriorated further in recent weeks, especially reflecting market
reactions to the crisis in Russia."
</P>
<P>
The officials agreed on the importance of strategies to better
manage risks associated with the volatility of international
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
"They called upon the international financial institutions to
continue to look at possible ways to respond to such volatility
and to report back on possible strategic and mechanisms," said the
communique.

<HEADLINE> Economic Decline Pace Slowing in Asian Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The pace of economic decline
in most Asian countries is slowing, particularly in South Korea
and Thailand, according to an analysis released Friday by the U.S.
Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
"When several economic indicators, such as imports, exports,
industrial activity, employment, GDP, retail sales, and non-wage
incomes, are considered together, the situation in Asia looks
better than one might think," says Gail D. Fosler, senior vice
president and chief economist of the Conference Board in the
latest issue of StraightTalk, her monthly newsletter prepared
exclusively for Board associates.
</P>
<P>
Most Asian countries, with the possible exception of Indonesia,
are using relatively favorable budget balances to continue public
work spending, an important fiscal countercylical measure.
</P>
<P>
The Board report says that the strength of the U.S. domestic
market should also help these countries as they increase their
exports to the U.S. for the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The report came as many economists in the United States and
other western nations predicted that the Asian countries hit
severely by the financial storm since last July would not recover
in a short period of time.

<HEADLINE> 12 Killed in Two US Military Helicopters Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Two United States Air Force
helicopters crashed early Friday during a training exercise in
Nevada, killing all 12 people on board, the service said.
</P>
<P>
The two HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters from Nellis Air Force Base
crashed about 1 a.m. PDT (0800 GMT). The wreckage was found about
an hour later.
</P>
<P>
Base officials said that it was most likely the helicopters
collided before they crashed. But there was also possible the
helicopters both crashed into the rugged mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
The crash site is 40 kilometers north of Indian Springs, a
remote auxiliary airfield on the base about 72 kilometers
northwest of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Built by Sikorsky Aircraft, the HH-60G helicopters normally
carry a crew of four people, two pilots, a flight engineer and a
gunner. But some, including the two that crashed, also carry two
rescue crew members.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has 99 HH-60G helicopters in use at 12 bases in
the United States and abroad. The Nellis helicopters were part of
the 66th Rescue Squadron, the Air Force's largest rescue squadron.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has 21 major aviation accidents, causing at least
one death or 1 million U.S. dollars damage, so far this fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
In the same period last year, the Air Force had 25 major
accidents and by the end of last fiscal year, the service
experienced 29 major crashes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Killing of Aliens Sparks Jitters in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Shang Xuqian)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 4 (Xinhua) -- The killing of three
foreigners, two from Senegal and one from Mozambique, on a train
near Pretoria Thursday has caused anxiety in South Africa as
growing xenophobia is feared.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and social groups Friday denounced the
incident in which the aliens were killed after a mob accused them
of stealing jobs from South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Two of the victims were electrocuted by overhead wires when
they tried to escape by climbing on the roof of the train. The
third was thrown out of a window and was run over by an oncoming
train.
</P>
<P>
The killing signaled rising xenophobia and detracted from the
real issues behind unemployment, human rights organizations,
academics and religious leaders said in a joint statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
The incident "bears testimony to the increasingly dangerous
manifestations of xenophobia in the country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said a recent Human Rights Watch report had
documented how rising xenophobia in South Africa was further
marginalizing and endangering the already vulnerable group of
non-citizens legally staying in the country, including refugees.
</P>
<P>
A Cape Town group working with refugees had found a sharp
increase in violent attacks against refugees.
</P>
<P>
The group had reported the deaths of 33 foreigners so far this
year in attacks motivated solely by anti-foreigner sentiments.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) condemned the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC condemns in the strongest possible terms the
abominable killing of our fellow Africans by people who do not
attach any value to human life," it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This cruel killing of foreigners will create a wrong
perception that the South African people do not welcome
foreigners in this country, and may also undermine the efforts of
our government on the African renaissance."
</P>
<P>
"Our country does not have discriminatory policies against
foreigners. In fact, many foreigners are already contributing to
the reconstruction and development of our country, and we should
encourage them to continue to do so."
</P>
<P>
The South African Communist Party (SACP) said in a statement
that it was diversionary and xenophobic to blame unemployment on
the influx of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
"To unleash popular frustrations against the poor of other
countries is a dangerous and diversionary ploy," it said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment was the most serious crisis affecting society,
the SACP said, but is was not caused by the influx of poor
working people from neighboring countries or elsewhere in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The present turmoil in the Great Lakes region of Africa
should remind us of how dangerous xenophobic mobilization can
be," it warned.
</P>
<P>
Solutions to unemployment would instead come from focusing on
sustainable and coherent industrial policies, the SACP said.
</P>
<P>
Two political experts warned Friday that resentment toward
foreigners among South Africans could spark a pattern of violent
attacks against illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
Wrath toward illegal aliens was growing, and was especially
strong among black South Africans, South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted a political scientist, Theo Bekker, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is going to develop into a bloody battle if something is
not done," said Bekker of Pretoria University.
</P>
<P>
Steven Friedman, director of Center for Policy Studies, said:
"The scary part is the danger that a pattern will start
developing."
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Thursday's incident was not the first of
its kind. More such assaults could be expected if intolerance
toward foreigners was not addressed.
</P>
<P>
Friedman said recent studies revealed a strong resentment
toward aliens, especially in Gauteng and Western Cape provinces.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing that it was impossible to stop the flow of illegal
aliens, Friedman and Bekker said that the government and
politicians should try to instill greater tolerance toward
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Friedman said there was nothing rational about hating all
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The perception that they robbed South Africans of jobs was not
necessarily true, he said, adding that many foreigners were
self-employed, and others were prepared to work for wages
unacceptable to South Africans.
</P>
<P>
Bekker said South Africa simply does not have the resources to
stop all unwelcome immigrants entering the country.
</P>
<P>
"It will eventually cost more to keep them away than providing
them with a livelihood," he said.
</P>
<P>
The solution is the economic development in neighboring
countries to produce job opportunities for those seeking a haven
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Until such time, the message from the government should be
that foreigners should be treated with leniency. If that doesn't
happen I see serious trouble coming," Bekker said.
</P>
<P>
A body calling itself the Unemployed Masses of South Africa
(UMSA) Friday denied that its members were responsible for the
deaths of the three aliens.
</P>
<P>
Police said UMSA members, who earlier on Thursday took part in
a protest march in Pretoria, were on the train.
</P>
<P>
So far, no arrests have been made owing to the fact that no
witnesses had come forward.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressional Leaders to Meet on Plan on Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 4 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Newt Gingrich,
Democratic leader Dick Gephardt and other top leaders of the U.S.
House of Representatives will meet next week to review plans for
receiving an expected report on President Bill Clinton from
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich agreed to the meeting in a phone conversation with
Gephardt, The Associated Press quoted unidentified officials as
saying.
</P>
<P>
There is no indication yet Starr has notified Congress that one
is ready for delivery, the AP said.
</P>
<P>
Gephardt's spokesman, Eric Smith, quoted the Missouri Democrat
as saying, "If this process must begin, it is among the most
serious responsibilities Congress will undertake and it must be
conducted in a truly bipartisan manner."
</P>
<P>
A Republican leadership aide, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that in the phone conversation, Gingrich "made
clear that he hoped the process would remain bipartisan. He hoped
the members would not prejudge until they have reviewed all the
evidence and that he had tremendous confidence in the ability of
Henry Hyde to lead this process," The AP reported.
</P>
<P>
Hyde is the Illinois Republican who chairs the Judiciary
Committee, which would have jurisdiction over any report Starr
submits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Senator Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat, said Clinton
deserves a formal "public rebuke" over his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and a second lawmaker
suggesting presidential "public restitution" to make amends.
</P>
<P>
"It is hard to ignore the impact of the misconduct the
president has admitted to on our children, our culture and our
national character," Lieberman said Thursday in a speech on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
"Such behavior is not just inappropriate, it is immoral,"
Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is on a visit in Dublin, Ireland, was quoted by
news reports as saying on Friday, "I can't disagree with anyone
else who wants to be critical of what I've already acknowledged is
inappropriate."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "There's nothing that he (Lieberman) or anyone
else could say in a personally critical way that I don't imagine I
would disagree with since I have already said it myself, to
myself, and I'm very sorry about it but there's nothing else I can
say."
</P>
<P>
Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat, raised the subject of
Clinton's relation with Lewinsky in a speech before the Veterans
of Foreign Wars in San Antonio and later in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"The more important word to me is restitution," she was quoted
by AP as saying. "The emphasis should be on the young people, and
how he as a father of a daughter and father of the nation can
exact some good of the situation."
</P>
<P>
Simply resigning would not do it, she added. "We need something
else -- he doesn't have to resign, or he could resign and then do
it."
</P>
<P>
The party's leaders, Gephardt in the House and Senator Tom
Daschle, have criticized the president's behavior but said they
want to see what Starr reports before rendering further judgment.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman said Thursday, the president had "compromised his
moral authority," damaged his credibility and complicated the
efforts of parents seeking to instill "values of honesty" in their
own children.
</P>
<P>
Some sort of "public rebuke" is called for, he said, possibly
through a resolution or censure or reprimand by Congress.
</P>
<P>
But any such action is premature before a Starr report is
issued and before the White House has a chance to respond to it,
he said.
