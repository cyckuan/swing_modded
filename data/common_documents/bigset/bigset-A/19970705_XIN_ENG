<HEADLINE> Iran Warns of U.S.-Israelis Plots in Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran today warned Muslim countries
of a "new plot of Zionism by the United States and Israel" in
their latest joint maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Major General Mohsen Rezaee, commander-in-chief of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), said that "the joint military
maneuvers by the U.S., Israel and Turkey in the Mediterranean Sea
and cooperation between the Turkish army and the Israeli regime
inside Iraqi were part of an elaborate plot against Muslim
states."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iranian official news agency IRNA, the
Iranian general also noted that that Washington's long-term plan
was to bring out Israel from world isolation.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the U.S. and the Israelis were currently
experimenting on a "marine belt" covering Israel, Jordan, Turkey
and Iraq, and intended to isolate Lebanon and Syria from the
world of Islam so that the area falls an easy prey to them."
</P>
<P>
"Their next designs are on Iraq and Jordan and later on Egypt
and other Muslim states," the general cautioned.
</P>
<P>
He said the Turkish army has unfortunately stepped into the
trap set by the U.S. and the Israeli regime.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Israel and Turkey in
February, 1996 has caused fears in Middle East countries that
Turkey was aligning itself with the Jewish state against Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Rezaee finally called for cooperation and solidarity among
Muslim countries to prevent any future threat posed by the plot of
Zionism, warning "if such a threat is not defused and removed,
Iran and regional states would sustain severe damage."

<P>
YAOUNDE, Cameroon, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Henri Depireux, coach of

<HEADLINE> Many Van Goghs May Be Fakes, Newspaper Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- An art review in the London-based
Art Newspaper said today that at least 45 paintings and drawings
attributed to Vincent Van Gogh may be fakes.
</P>
<P>
The review said its claims were based on work by Jan Hulsker, a
leading specialist whose new edition of his catalogue of the Dutch
master's entire works came out last year, and on the opinions of
other renowned scholars.
</P>
<P>
According to Hulsker, one of the alleged fakes is "Sunflowers",
bought by Yasuda Fire &AMP; Marine Insurance in 1987 for 24.75 million
pounds (41.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other alleged fakes are "Dr Gachet" in the Musee D'Orsay in
Paris, and "L'Arlesienne" in New York's Metropolitan Museum, two
of Van Gogh's best-known works.
</P>
<P>
Hulsker told the review that he questioned a total of 45 works
and had "very strong doubts about the authenticity of many more
works."
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, the review said, was that Van Gogh failed
to sell his works before his death in 1890, so there were no
contemporary sale records to help authenticate them.
</P>
<P>
The review said a survey it carried out showed different
experts are now questioning more than 100 works by Van Gogh,
although there is hardly any agreement between the scholars.
</P>
<P>
"Sunflowers" is questioned by Ben Landais, a Frenchman living
in the Netherlands, because of its links to a dealer alleged to
have handled fake Van Gogh works.
</P>
<P>
But not everyone has been convinced by the new allegations.
David Lee, editor of the London-based Art Review Magazine, said:
"Stories of Van Gogh fakes have been coming out for years."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the suspoect dealer, Lee said:"I find that very
hard to believe because at the time...it wasn't in his interest to
fake paintings by Van Gogh because they weren't actually worth
anything."

<HEADLINE> France Denounces Angolans, Rwandans for Arming Congolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France has denounced Angola's UNITA
former rebel forces and Rwandans for supporting respectively the
two warring sides of the Congo Republic, and warned that the
fighting in Brazzaville could have a domino effect on neighboring
states.
</P>
<P>
French State Secretary for Cooperation Charles Josselin told
the Defense Commission of the French National Assembly Thursday,
"Protagonists of the Congo crisis continue to arm themselves
heavily."
</P>
<P>
"President (Pascal) Lissouba and former President (Denis
Sassou) N'Guesso rely on their allies: the first on UNITA, and the
second on the forces of the east in Rwanda," said Josselin in a
speech made public today.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the worry that the conflict would "extend to
neighboring countries and all the region could collapse like a
paper castle."
</P>
<P>
"On June 29, an Antonov plane delivered two combat helicopters
in the form of components which will be assembled by Ukrainian
mercenaries.... There exist many stray soldiers in Africa who can
offer their service at small costs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France could offer logistic support to an
inter-African intervention force in the Congo Republic. He
expressed the hope that the United Nations Security Council will
support the sending of a 1,000-strong international force to
Brazzaville to keep open the international airport there.

<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government will now
move faster with the privatisation of other state-owned
enterprises following the successful flotation of Dairibord
Zimbabwe Limited (DZL), a cabinet minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Cephas Msipa, minister of state responsible for indigenisation

He said the government would now be looking into the cotton
company of Zimbabwe's privatisation in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Previously a parastatal organisation known an Dairy Marketing
Board, DZL was first commercialised in 1994 with the government
becoming the sole shareholder.
</P>
<P>
Msipa noted there were a number of companies currently under
consideration for privatisation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "government policy is to either commercialise or
privatise as many state-owned companies as possible."
</P>
<P>
The DZL offer to the general public was 10 times
oversubscribed, a record in Zimbabwe.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy said today that Mongolia will continue carrying out its
policy of opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia would also maintain the continuity of its foreign
policy and the policy of a multi-pillar economic structure, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On the issues of the Mongolian-Chinese and Mongolian-Russian
relations, he said developing comprehensive cooperative ties and
good neighborly relations with China and Russia was the top
priority of Mongolian foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia would develop all-round and mutual-beneficially
cooperative partnership with the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy was speaking at a press conference, the first since
being elected and sworn into office on June 20.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian president urged China and Russia to give
preferential tariffs to Mongolian products as Mongolia abolishes
trade tariffs. It would help enlarge bilateral cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
On domestic economy, Bagabandy said he would cooperate with the
Mongolian government and State Great Hural to deepen economic
reforms, to curb inflation and to revive of the national industry
of Mongolia.

privatization should be carried out fairly on a basis of
strengthening state supervision, although he backed speedy
privatization.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Calls for More German Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin called on German businesses today to put more
investment into his country and expand trade with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, who started a three-day visit to Germany
Thursday, met German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Friday in Berlin at
a symposium, organized by the Alfred Herrhausen Foundation of
Germany, which discussed Russia's economic and political future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the symposium, the prime minister said he saw great
potential for a major increase in German investment in Russia. He
noted that of the total of 16 billion marks (nine billion
U.S. dollars) foreign direct investment in his country, only a
modest one billion (570 million dollars) were from Germany.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the symposium, he said Russia had
made great efforts to improve the economic circumstances for
foreign investors and would continue such efforts in future.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also stressed the need to expand trade between the
two countries. The 27 billion marks (15 billion dollars) trade
volume between Russia and Germany last year still lagged far
behind the 46 billion marks (26 billion dollars) achieved by the
former Soviet Union with Germany, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Chernomyrdin also voiced scepticism over the planned
enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into
eastern Europe. He cautioned against the possible inclusion of the
three Baltic states into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the symposium, Kohl stressed the importance of
promoting intensive cooperation and friendship with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The German-Russian relations today are better than ever before
in the history," he said. "Germany and Russia see each other as
partners who have drawn necessary lessons from the bitter capitals
of our history."

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Names Two Advisors for Direct Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government has appointed
two advisors to accompany President Glafcos Clerides at the
UN-brokered direct talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots
scheduled for next week near New York.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said at his daily
press briefing today that Pantelis Kouros, under-secretary to the
Preside, and Alecos Markides, the Republic's attorney general,
will be with the president at the negotiating table on July 9-13.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said political party leaders will be outside the
meeting room for immediate consultations with the president.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will be also accompanied
by two advisors, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiations between President Clerides and
Denktash would not be confined to investigating positions of the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
The face-to-face talks between leaders of the two communities
on the east Mediterranean island are designed to bring an end to their
decade-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will open the talks on July 9
and his special representative for Cyprus Diego Cordovez will
conduct the first round of negotiations. The other two rounds of
negotiations are also expected this summer, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from 12 countries will be in the wings of the direct
talks, including representatives from the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said their presence "will decisively contribute to
achieving progress" and offers a "window of hope" for a solution
to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
However, Christofides said the Cyprus government does not
expect the Cyprus problem to be solved this year. "We expect to
achieve progress and cover ground so that in 1998 we can conclude
what we are beginning this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' presidential election will be held in February
1998. The election campaign, which all political parties will be
involved, is expected to start in September this year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of the northern third of the island, in the wake
of a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Implements CITES Recommendations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government said
today it will soon draft legislation to enforce stringent
measures to control trade in ivory and its products according to
the specifications of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>
<P>
Tapera Chimuti, senior ecologist at the department of parks
and wildlife management, said the new legislation would require
all ivory dealers and manufacturers to buy the ivory stocks from
no other source than the department.
</P>
<P>
Dealers, retailers and manufacturers would be required to make
a declaration of stock and trade every month to ensure that all
their dealings were accounted for, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"They will be required to make returns on what ivory they have
purchased and processed, as well as where they have sold it,"
said Chimuti, adding every tusk in stock would also need to be
accounted for from time to time.
</P>
<P>
The department, he said, would conduct random checks to verify
the stocks declaration and culprits who flouted the regulations
would have their licences withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Dealers are not allowed to sell carved ivory to foreigners for
a maximum of 500 US Dollars without an export permit, which could
only be obtained from the government.
</P>
<P>
The CITES conference held in Harare in June agreed to a
proposal by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to have restricted
trade in ivory and its products.
</P>
<P>
The ban on international trade in ivory and its products was
enforced in 1989 in an effort to control poaching which had
resulted in the near extinction of the species.
</P>
<P>
However, the three south African countries complained that
their elephant population had grown to levels where the habitant
could no longer sustain it.

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A re-run of legislative elections
in three Camerounian constituencies will take place on August 3,
1997, local radio reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was declared on Thursday according to a decree signed by
Camerounian President Paul Biya.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- World production is now forecast 1
million higher at 579 million tons compared with 582 million tons
in 1996/97, according to an announcement by the International
Grains Council today.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts have been raised for Kazakhstan, Uzberkistan, India
and the United States. The aggregate increase offsets a reduction
for Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for world trade is up by 1 million to 94 million
tons, and also 1 million more than the revised total for last
year.
</P>
<P>
The increase is concentrated in North Africa, with higher
figures for imports into Egypt and Morocco. Projected exports from
Canada have been lowered to reflect the smaller production
estimate.
</P>
<P>
Hungary is expected to export some 1.5 million tons, but
shipments from Romania could fall slightly below earlier
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
World consumption is forecast at 582 million tons, 5 million
more than in 1996/97. Food use may increase by 8 million tons to
434 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Feed use is currently forecast at 92 million tons, but could be
less if market prices of oilseeds fall relative to cereals.
</P>
<P>
World wheat stocks may decline by 3 million tons to 97 million
at the end of 1997/98, but combined stocks in the five major
exporting countries are forecast to increase, as rises in the
United States and the EC offset falls in Australia and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Poses No Threat to Turkey: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus, with only 650,000 Greek
Cypriots, poses no threat to Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots,
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides said here today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The written statement by Clerides is in response to Turkish
Deputy Prime Minisiter Bulent Ecevit's comment on Thursday about
Turkey's role in Cyprus and efforts to settle the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ecevit's statement that Cyprus is a danger to the
security of both the Turkish Cypriots and Turkey constitutes the
height of absurdity," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that it is the "imperative need" for Cyprus
to build the most effective defenses against the 40,000 Turkish
troops, stationed on the island "in contravention of every
principle of international law and the resolutions" of the
U.N. General Assembly and Security Council, which call for the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides explained that the naval and air bases under
construction in Cyprus will offer Greece, one of the three
guarantor powers, facilities "enabling her to be ready to
implement her publicly and repeatedly declared policy that any
Turkish expansionist move on Cyprus constitutes a casus belli."
</P>
<P>
Greece is one of the three guarantors of Cyprus' independence
under a 1960 treaty on the establishment of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his 1993 proposal for the demilitarization of
Cyprus and the establishment of an international force with a
mandate from the UN Security Council, the President said that
"Turkey rejected this positive proposal and now claims that her
security is being threatened by Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
An international force, the statement added, "could intervene
whenever one community, through illegal actions, endangers the
security of the other or violates agreements."
</P>
<P>
President Clerides reiterated his readiness to go to New York
for direct talks with the Turkish Cypriot side with goodwill and
pledged to "make every effort to find a solution to the Cyprus
problem."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took control
the northern third in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> More Foreign Tourists Flock to US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A record of 46.3 million foreign
tourists visited the United States last year, the New York Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The international travelers who visited the United States last
year spent 84 billion U.S. dollars and supported about a million
full-time jobs, according to the Commerce Department's Tourism
Industries Office.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that now a growing number of cities, which would
seem to be unlikely tourist destinations, are making all kinds of
efforts to attract foreign tourist dollars. Many midsized cities
are establishing themselves as centers for business services and
entertainment for the surrounding region.
</P>
<P>
Domestic travel expenditures by United States residents grew a
respectable 77 percent in the decade from 1986 to 1996 to 383
billion U.S. dollars, according to the Travel Industry of America.
</P>
<P>
Weekend travel accounts for 52 percent of all domestic travel,
according to the Travel Data Center of the Commerce Department, up
10 percentage points from 1986. Americans rarely have time to
visit more than a single city on one trip.
</P>
<P>
But in the same period, foreign tourists' total travel
expenditures in the United States more than tripled.
</P>
<P>
Wherever those tourist billions land, they create jobs, help
pay for schools and libraries, and help keep taxes on local
residents down, according to experts.

<HEADLINE> Mcdonnell Douglas-Boeing Merger Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The proposed 14 billion U.S.
dollar acquisition of the Mcdonnell Douglas Corporation by the
Boeing Company was approved Thursday by the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), according to a report of the New York Times
today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, four of the five commission members said
that the acquisition would "not substantially lessen competition
or tend to create a monopoly in either defense or commercial
aircraft market."
</P>
<P>
The FTC approval removes an important hurdle to completion of
the deal. The commission's final decision was based on evidence
that Mcdonnell Douglas "no longer constitutes a meaningful
competitive force in the commercial aircraft market." And the
merger did not threaten competition in military contracts, the
commission members said.
</P>
<P>
The merger would eliminate one of three competitors, leaving
only Boeing and the European Consortium, Airbus Industrie. The
European Union's commission, which has criticized the merger as
anticompetitive, declined to comment on the FTC approval. EU
officials are scheduled to meet today to discuss the merger.

NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan government official today
called for the establishment of an African banking forum in order
to enhance common professional standards in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary of Kenya's Finance Ministry, Semeon
Lespima, was speaking at the closing session of the First
Commonwealth African Banking Policy Seminar held in the port city

</P>
<P>
Kenya News Agency today quoted him as saying that such a forum

According to the three-day seminar, the privatization and

private sector.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan official stressed the importance of the private
sector in developing banking standards and professional ethics by

<P>
The forum should be set up to promote excellence in the
banking sector for the benefit of shareholders, customers and the
country as a whole, he noted.

Lespima pointed out that African banking forum should address
itself to African banking issues within the socio-economic

today expressed his satisfaction with his first visit to Russia
and described it as "a success," the Itar-Tass news agency

relations, as well as on many international issues and further
development of the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States."
</P>

<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France will not take "hostage"
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in its dispute with the
United States over who should join NATO in the first wave, said
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for France to officially announce that
it will not block the three former Warsaw Pact members from
joining NATO, although it will stick to its requirement that
Romania and Slovenia be admitted in the first wave or soon after
that.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists that only Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic can join NATO in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
France, supported by eight other NATO members, have lobbied for
the candidatures of Romania and Slovenia as well.
</P>
<P>
A unanimous resolution is needed at the NATO Madrid summit to
be held on July 8-9 for inviting Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac will represent France at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is about the first wave of expansion but we hope that one
cares about Romania and Slovenia from right now, under a form
which remains to be negotiated and determined," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Germany has also expressed its support for Romania's
candidature for NATO, although it did not specify when Romania
should join the trans-Atlantic military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The French presidential spokeswoman said that President Chirac
will explain at the Madrid summit why the admission of Romania and
Slovenia will benefit NATO by "reinforcing its geographic
cohesion."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France will continue pushing for the
reform of NATO to seek a bigger European role in its command
hierarchy after the trans-Atlantic military alliance holds it
summit in Madrid next Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said today
that the conditions presented by France 18 months ago for its
return to the military structure of NATO have not been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Madrid summit is "an important step, but no
more than a step, on the way of adapting to the consequences of
the new strategic context in Europe."
</P>
<P>
France has been negotiating with the United States on the
reform of NATO commanding structure, especially the replacement of
an American admiral by a European general at the Naples-based NATO
Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
The United States has categorically rejected the proposal,
citing the presence of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean
which is under the flag of the South Command.
</P>
<P>
France does not oppose the maintenance of U.S. military
presence in Europe and considers the trans-Atlantic military tie
as an essential foundation for the security of Europe. But Paris
insists that a new sharing of power between American and Europeans
is necessary.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to pursue the rebalance (of power)," said the
presidential spokeswoman. "France is ready. The process of
adaptation of the alliance has not ended. Madrid is not the point
of outcome of the reform."
</P>
<P>
The late President Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of the
NATO military structure in 1966.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic activity in this Eastern
Mediterranean island state in 1997 is expected to show a slight
improvement, provided tourism is given a boost, Central Bank
Governor Afxentis Afxentiou said here today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the bank's 1996 Annual Report at a press conference
here, Afxentiou said the country's gross national product can
increase by 2.5 percent this year, compared with 1.9 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
He attributed last year's low growth rate to weak domestic demand
and a drop in tourism. However, he said, tourism performance made
a good turn in May this year with tourist arrivals up by 5 percent
and the trend is expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' economy relies heavily on the tourism sector, which
can bring about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in foreign currency
earnings from over 2 million tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
Afxentiou said inflation rate this year is expected to be
around 3.3 percent, showing no significant change compared with
the 1995 figure. The unemployment rate, and fiscal deficit
as a percentage of GDP, are estimated at around 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The governor said Cyprus government has taken every necessary
measure to curb inflation and unemployment rate.

were currently being multiplied.
</P>
<P>
He said that apart from ensuring higher yield, the new seeds
are also resistant to some of the common cotton diseases.
</P>
<P>
After touring the cotton seeds multiplication center and
research center in Kipinyaga district, Mutahi said that the new
seeds were being multiplied in 516 acres of land and were
expected to yield 12,000 tons of seeds to be distributed to
farmers for planting.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new seeds would facilitate the Kenyan
government's efforts to revive cotton production of the country.

<HEADLINE> France Bound to Reshape Its Africa Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- France has for the first time
suggested that it would consider withdrawing its 8,000 troops from
the eight African countries, all of them former French colonies,
and replace them with a different way of security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But Paris has also expressed worry over its displacement by the
United States in the black continent, which is becoming
strategically important because of its rich oil reserve in the
Guinea Gulf.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing at the Foreign Affairs Commission of the
National Assembly Thursday, French State Secretary for Cooperation
Charles Josselin said that "all the defense agreements" signed
between France and African countries will be reexamined.
</P>
<P>
"The question of the presence of French militarymen on the
African soil is posed," he said in his report made public today.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin came after France was taken by surprise in a series of wars
and conflicts in former Zaire, the Congo Republic and the Central
African Republic, all of them considered traditional zones of
influence of France.
</P>
<P>
However, the state secretary also suggested that European
countries back France in maintaining its influence in Africa to
counter-balance the growing presence of the United States there.
</P>
<P>
"France should be able to count on the aid of its European
partners because alone, it cannot face up (to the United States),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reason for the United States to begin to be
interested in Africa is both political and economic, and that the
Americans are playing a role with "several more or less visible
hands" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Josselin said that France should draw the "consequences of its
sad adventures" in former Zaire, and its impotence to stop
fighting in the Congo Republic and the Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that France support the teaching of the French
language in English-speaking African countries, develop economic
and cultural ties with them, and provide easier visa service for
the "elites" of African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States is gaining ground in Africa quickly, partly
because of the strong force of American universities which provide
studying programs for African students, and because it is easier
to travel to and stay in the United States than in France, he
said.

<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Shares on Europe's major stock
markets mixed today, with London and Paris ending lower and
Frankfurt continuing to go up.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of blue-chip stocks ended a three-day
winning streak as the prospect of an interest rate rise next week
helped drag the market lower after initially scoring a record
high.
</P>
<P>
Ending a budget week of extreme market volatility, the FTSE-100
closed at 4,812.8, down 18.9 points. There was a rise of 172.5
from last week.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, shares kept up their record-setting pace,
climbing nearly 1.5 percent due to strong overnight Wall Street
gains and a German insurance industry merger that fuelled fresh
demand for domestic shares. The DAX-30 index closed at 3,942.53,
up 55.14 points, for a rise of 147.12 on the week.

<P>
French shares finished fractionally lower after a quiet session

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges N.Ireland Protestants to Be Reasonable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- British troops took up positions
around the town of Portadown in Northern Ireland today to guard
against possible clashes on the eve of a disputed march scheduled
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said she had
not decided yet whether to ban the parade to be staged by the
pro-British Protestants as tensions rose across the divided
province.
</P>
<P>
The Roman Catholics, who wish to win independence of Northern
Ireland from Britain and merge with the Irish Republic, are
strongly against such parades. Last year's Protestant marches led
to bloody clashes and wide-spread disorder for a few days.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Belfast, Mowlam called on the
Protestants to "listen to the voice of reason" in a thinly-veiled
reference to proposals by its leader, Grand Master Robert
Saulters, to re-route a parade which last year sparked the worst
civil violence in Northern Ireland in decades.
</P>
<P>
"Many in the Orange Order have shown some flexibility. For the
good of everyone and for the sake of peace in the next few weeks,
I urge those in the Portadown Orange to listen to those voices of
reason," Mowlam said.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing,
said in a statement today that the British government had a
responsibility to Roman Catholics who were opposed to the parade.
</P>
<P>
"Host communities, which find particular marches objectionable,
have the right to withhold their consent and to have their rights
respected," he said, adding the British government "has a
responsibility to uphold those rights."
</P>
<P>
The banned Protestant Loyalist Volunteer Force has threatened
to kill Catholics if the march is stopped.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Remain Foreign Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is not going to
follow its neighboring South Africa's example of liberalizing foreign
exchange control, Namibia's Central Bank Governor Tom Alweendo
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian authorities have decided not to pursue the same
route as South Africa,"after having carefully considered the
implications of such measures for Nambia in the current
Macro-economic context," Alweendo told a press conference in
Windhoek.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's recent announcement of approving
foreign currency accounts for private individuals resident, has
promoted a spate of enquires as to when similar changes might be
implemented in Nambia.
</P>
<P>
Alweendo said Nambia remained committed to the progressive
relaxation of foreign exchange controls as shown by its recent
accession to the International Monetary Fund regulations.
</P>
<P>
"However, the sequence of events with regard to exchange control
liberalization should be followed with caution and with due
consideration of the economic conditions prevailing at any given
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that permitting individuals to open foreign
currency accounts in the present macro-economic environment might
exert undue pressure on the country's balance of payments.

<HEADLINE> US President on Success of New Welfare law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
today that more than a million people have left public assistance
rolls since last August when he signed the new welfare law.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, President Clinton said that
welfare caseloads fell by 3.1 million people between January 1993
when he took office and April of this year.
</P>
<P>
In April, there were 11 million American people on welfare, the
lowest share of the U.S. population since 1970.
</P>
<P>
The new welfare law that Clinton signed last August imposed a
lifetime limit of five years for receiving welfare benefits and
turned control of federal cash assistance and food stamps over to
the states. The law ended the nation's 60-year-old system of
unlimited, direct assistance to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said 1.2 million people left welfare rolls between August
of last year and April.
</P>
<P>
He urged states to use the savings from reduced welfare
caseloads to help those who have left welfare for work with
expenses such as transportation, child care or job training costs.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Pins Hope of Economic Take-Off on New Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred kilometers of roadbeds
and more than 90 bridges have been completed so far for the
westward extension of the Southern Xinjiang Railway -- one of the
key projects of the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
Construction is scheduled to be completed by 1999, one year
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Linking the city of Korla, an important petroleum base in
southern Xinjiang, with Kashgar, an old town located on the
ancient Silk Road, the extension is 976 km long and connects with
the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, an artery of the Chinese rail
system.
</P>
<P>
The section of the railway now under construction lies near the
snow-covered Tianshan Mountains and around the Taklamakan Desert,
the second-largest shifting sand desert in the world.
</P>
<P>
Abul'ahat Abdurixit, chairman of the regional government of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, says the central goverment has
allocated 5.9 billion yuan for the extension, which is designed to
benefit the minority nationalities that live in the region.
</P>
<P>
Southern Xinjiang covers about 1.1 million sq km and has a
population of 7.3 million people of various ethnic groups. Eighty
percent of them are living on the productive land of the Tarim
Basin.
</P>
<P>
In the past, millions of tons of local farm products spoiled
because they could not be transported to other areas. Currently,
there are over 20 impoverished counties able to meet the food
quality standards set by the central government. Backward
communications and transportation systems are the major factors
restricting the economic development of southern Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Research shows that there are five ringlike mineral belts in
the Tarim Basin, such as petroleum-gas, sylvite, coal, metals,
building materials and jade. The reserves of petroleum-gas amount
to 19.1 billion tons, with the petroleum reserve accounting for
about a quarter of the country's total and its gas reserve one
seventh of the total.
</P>
<P>
Nine oil-gas fields have been verified, with 440 million tons
of reserves and a yearly production capacity of four million
tons. It is estimated that the proven oil gas reserves will be 1.5
billion tons by 2000, while the output will increase to eight
million tons per year. The 1.5 million tons of oil produced in the
Tarim Basin will be transported mainly by train.
</P>
<P>
South Xinjiang has a thousand-plus km border contiguous to
India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kirghizstan. Border
trade has become more and more active since the four land-ports
were opened, with the trade volume increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Xinjiang Railway, which connects the Kirghizstan
Railway, runs parallel to the Northern Xinjiang Railway. It will
be an important section of the Second Eurasian Continental Bridge,
and will help to turn southern Xinjiang into a distribution center
of imports and exports in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Based on the resource advantages in southern Xinjiang, the
state and the regional government of Xinjiang have decided that
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan the area will be made a
production base of 15 kinds of new commodities, including
petroleum, petrochemical products, cotton, fruit, textiles,
non-ferrous metals and sugar.
</P>
<P>
A resource-based economic development belt will be formed
around the Tarim Basin as a result of the new railway, which is
expected to handle more than six million tons of goods by the end
of this century. Experts say that the annual cost of railway
transportation will be one billion yuan less than highway
hauling.

launched its new-generation of data base system "Oracle 8" in Beijing
and 65 other cities worldwide. The company expects the move to
largely increase the chances for the network computer to go into
wide application and shake the dominance of the PC in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
This advanced data system will enter China's market later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China's fledging computer industry will be
challenged by the shift in the focus of the world's computer industry to a
new generation of computer products.
</P>
<P>
The only option for the Chinese computer industry is to expand
technology cooperation and exchange with foreign companies, and
keep up with the high-tech development trend.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China's Science and Technology Commission
declared its cooperation with Hewlett-Packard, the second largest
computer maker in the U.S. to set up a 16-million-yuan joint research
and development center for new software products.
</P>
<P>
On a computer technology market basically dominated by foreign
PC manufacturers, China's computer companies have revealed their
increasing competitive spirit since the start of this year. To
date, most Chinese PC makers have adopted the large-capacity
"Pentium MMX" processor launched earlier this year by Intel, the
global leader of chip supply.
</P>
<P>
Also, the "PCTV," a new technological standard combining both
the technological advantages of PC and television, was
introduced by the Qingdao-based Hisense Group on the domestic
market last month.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts point out that foreign PC firms will continue
trying to expand their market in China in spite of tough
competition.
</P>
<P>
The analysts predict that based on the principle of "exchanging
market for technology," the Chinese government will encourage
foreign PC makers to transfer technology in order to get their
market share in bid to improve the technological benchmark of the
country's computer industry.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Blame Israel for Worsened Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official today
blamed Israel for the continuous deterioration of the situation in
the West Bank and sought international sanctions on the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat's top
advisor Nabil Abu-Rdainah, in a radio interview with Cairo-based
Voice of Arabs, described the situation in the West Bank town of
Hebron as "explosive."
</P>
<P>
"Israeli practices provoking religious feelings of the
Palestinians, pursuing building works in Jabal Abu Ghneim (in East
Jerusalem) settlement and freezing the peace talks are behind the
present unrest in occupied lands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have erupted across the occupied territories since
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed in March when Israel
began building the Jabal Abu Ghneim settlement. But the recent
distribution of anti-Muslim hate fliers in the West Bank town of
Hebron triggered off stronger protest and violence.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians were wounded in the week-long clashes
with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which were
incited by the insulting anti-Islamic posters.
</P>
<P>
Abu-Rdainah expressed the hope that the UN General Assembly
will take some decision to curb the tension as it resumes its
emergency meeting in mid-July as requested by the Arab group.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the UN will adopt a new mechanism under which
sanctions would be imposed on Israel," he added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Starts 1997 National Courtesy Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore started this year's
National Courtesy Campaign today with the focus on the young and
the elderly and special attention to the spontaneous reciprocal
gestures of courtesy between the two groups.
</P>
<P>
Launching the 1997 National Courtesy Campaign, Teo Chee Hean,
Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defense, said that
in addition to making public facilities dirty, being
inconsiderate, discourteous behavior manifests itself in various
other forms, sometimes with a Singapore flavor.
</P>
<P>
"Examples are the rush for free textbooks and when able-bodied
motorists park their car in lots reserved for the disabled," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry of education conducted a survey recently
in the country's educational institutions to obtain baseline
indices on students' feelings and perceptions about the nation.
Results of the survey showed that of the more than 80,000 students
surveyed at every level, 70 percent of them identified
"inconsiderate people" as one of the top three dislikes.
</P>
<P>
The other dislikes the students identified are dirty public
toilets, and stressful life, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on all Singaporeans to be more considerate
and courteous to others. "Life in our garden city will be all the
more pleasant if we take heed of the campaign's slogan to 'Try a
little Kindness'," he said, adding that cartoons and humor will be
used in TV commercials and other campaign material to reach out to
the young as well as the elderly.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam Nujoma has
called for better economic ties with Zambia during his current
visit in the south African country.
</P>
<P>
At the state banquet given by Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba on Friday evening in Ndola, northern Zambia, Nujoma said,
Zambia is Namibia's fourth largest trading partner in the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), with bilateral
trade volume amounting to approximately nine million Namibian
rand (about two million US Dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian President said, the current sound bilateral ties
is a necessary condition for the advancement of cultural and
socio-economic ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma also expressed hope for much higher trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of cross-border trade in southern Africa, he
noted, is an identified objective of SADC and a catalyst of
fostering regional integration and strengthening the region's
economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba called on Zambian and Namibian businessmen
to explore fully the markets in both countries in order to
strengthen the trade.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba reiterated his country's desire to strengthen
partnership with other SADC members, and members of the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa as well as other regional
groupings.
</P>
<P>
Economic integration is necessary for the development of the
region, the Zambian President said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma arrived in Ndola on Friday for a two-day visit to
Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Former Rebel Leader to Initiate Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today authorized Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) to initiate contact with the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) to get the stalled peace talks between
Manila and the MILF back on track.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released here, Ramos issued the
authorization as he urged Misuari, who also chairs the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD), to assure
an active role in the peace efforts in the southern Philippines,
especially in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Following the president's instruction, Misuari, leader of the
former rebel Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), today attended
a meeting in Manila to coordinate the government's peace efforts
in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Renato de Villa, Chief Government Negotiator
Fortunato Abat and head of the Presidential Management Staff (PMS)
Alexander Aguirre also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Acting on the president's instruction, Defense Secretary de
Villa ordered commanders of government forces in Central Mindanao
to extend their full cooperation to Misuari in the quest for peace
in the area.
</P>
<P>
De Villa also directed the troops in the field to hold on to
their present positions "without prejudice to their right to self
defense if attacked or harassed by armed groups, as well as to
take actions only to protect the population and uphold law and
order."
</P>
<P>
After a month-long fighting between government and MILF troops,
the rebel group suspended low-level peace talks with the
government last week.
</P>
<P>
A fierce fighting between the two sides erupted again today in
Central Mindanao. Seven rebels and three civilians were killed
while five government soldiers and 10 civilians were wounded in
today's fighting.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF led by Misuari signed a peace accord with the
government last September to end a 30-year old civil war in
Mindanao, but the MILF rejected the peace agreement and continued
its fighting for independence of Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's PM Welcomes Progress in Kuwaiti-Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdel-Salem Majali has stressed that he welcomed an amicable
atmosphere prevailing over the Kuwaiti-Jordanian ties which were
soured during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told local Arabic Daily Al-Seyassahin in an
exclusive interview published here today that "a firmly atmosphere
prevailed over the (telephone) talks between the Kuwaiti and
Jordanian foreign ministers."
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh had telephone
conversatins with Kuwait's acting Premier and Foreign Minister
Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah on June 22 to discuss the issues
on speeding up the restoration of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers discussed an expected visit by Al-Sabah
to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Majali said a special program for the visit, which is expected
in two weeks, would be prepared.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has been inching toward renewing its ties with Jordan
that were frozen after the government accused Amman of supporting
Iraq during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has a charge d'affaires in Amman, but there is no
Jordanian mission in Kuwait now.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the Kuwaiti diplomatic mission in Jordan, Majali
said the issue "is moving on the right track."
</P>
<P>
But he did not say whether Jordan has a timetable to re-open
the Jordanian embassy in Kuwait which remains closed until now.
</P>
<P>
On the economic level, Majali said that "we agreed with the
Kuwaiti side to resume flights by the national carriers between
Jordan and Kuwait." Flights were halted after the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti National Assembly has endorsed the government policy of
reconciling relations with Arab countries which supported Iraq
during the Gulf War in 1991.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- France today appealed to the
supporters of the rival factions of Cambodia for "an immediate
stop to violence", and asked them to "show restraint and a sense
of responsibility in this dangerous situation."
</P>
<P>
The French embassy in Phnom Penh had instructed French
expatriates on security matters and was in contact with Paris now,
said the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out this morning between the supporters of the
two co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Hun Sen, which forced the closure of the Phnom Penh international
airport.
</P>
<P>
A curfew has been imposed in the Cambodian capital for an
undetermined period, while shootings and explosions echoed on the
periphery of Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has accused Ranariddh of illegally massing troops
around Phnom Penh, and of "treason" by negotiating with the Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said, during the mission of French
and Japanese envoys sent to Cambodia by the G-8 Denver summit,
that the Cambodian government had reassured the international
community that Cambodia would go ahead in its electoral process in
a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
"Such assurances were reiterated" in the informal political
meeting between Cambodia and the 20 member countries of World Bank
donor institutions held on June 30 in Paris, said the foreign
ministry.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian Foreign Minister Ung Huot confirmed at the meeting

<HEADLINE> Albania Suffers Plague of Locusts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian Agriculture and Food
Ministry official said today 25 of the 26 regions in the country
have been hit by plagues of locusts in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Irfan Tarelli, director of the Plants Protection Bureau of the
Agriculture and Food Ministry, said that Durres, Korca and four
other regions had suffered most from the locusts.
</P>
<P>
He said the Albanian government has called for a national
campaign against the locusts and allocated 38.4 million leks
(about 240,000 US dollars) to buy insecticides to kill the pests.
</P>
<P>
Albania has suffered from locusts three years in succession and
several years' efforts were needed to eradicate locusts in the
country, Tarelli said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Albania's grain harvests could barely meet the
need of the population, partly because of frequent natural
disasters.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province to Double Grain Output in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest China
plans to double its 10 billion kg of grain output in the next 15
years in a move to become self-sufficient in grain supply and
contribute to a balanced grain supply in the central and western
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five counties and cities in northern Shaanxi will be
responsible for realizing the target, as they have abundant land
resources and favorable climatic conditions, said Shi Zhicheng,
director of the provincial agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
The area has reported an average grain increase of eight
percent since 1990, two percentage points higher than the
province's average, and its total grain averages 51.3 kg per
person.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale farmland improvement, wide-spread application of
agro-techniques, improved water conservancy facilities, and
multichannel input into agriculture, as well as vast stretches of
arable wasteland will work to Shaanxi's advantage.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study group has developed ways to turn dry fields
into irrigated land that is suitable for machine operation, and
come up with ideas to increase the contributions from science and
technology to agricultural production, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Confrontation Imminent in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Confrontation between Kenyan riot
police and Opposition supporters are imminent on Saba Saba (July
7) day as the Kenyan government outlawed the rallies planned
countrywide on Monday by opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Planned 49 rallies designed to press for constitutional
reforms before the coming General Election have drawn mixed
reactions in the east African country with some people supporting
it while others condemning the move.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer said Friday that so long as the
rallies are not held in conformity with the law, it is illegal
and the police will break it up.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the rallies to be held next Monday, Ndolo Ayah,
National Chairman of the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU), termed them "a plan by the Opposition to disrupt normal
business and endanger lives of innocent citizens."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the real purpose of those rally organizers
disguising themselves as pro-reform activists is to disrupt the
forthcoming General Election.
</P>
<P>
The Saba Saba rallies will climax recent violent actions
including the aborted rally on May 31 and the disruption of
budget speech on June 19 by opposition parliament members.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Friday, John Nyamu, Chairman of the
Kenya Christian, Hindu and Moslem Youth Network, said that the
purpose of the intended rallies is to spark off an orgy of
looting of shops and disrupting of normal business in an effort
to cripple the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Mutava Musyimi, Secretary-General of the National Council of
Churches of Kenya (NCCK), said recently that those pushing for
constitutional reforms had lost direction and were now embracing
anarchy in their bid to force changes in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a round table consultative workshop held some days
ago, Thomas Hamer, Country Director of the Frederick Elbert
Foundation based in Nairobi, pointed out that most industrialized
Western countries had decided to support the Kenyan government
since it was considered the most stable compared to others in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "unlike in 1992 when these countries supported
the Opposition, most Western industrialized nations are now more
interested in upholding their investments in Kenya than pushing
for reforms."
</P>
<P>
Political tension is rising in the east African country as
Kenyans brace themselves for confrontation on Saba Saba day.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that violent confrontation is not the
solution of the differences between the ruling party and the
Opposition but dialogue is the only way out.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Becoming East China Port City's Biggest Investor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has become the
biggest investor and most important trade partner for Lianyungang,
a port city of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, Lianyungang has so far approved the
establishment of 673 Hong Kong financed projects, accounting for
45.7 percent of the city's overseas-backed ventures. The contracts
involving 480 million U.S. dollars of funding, which make up 29.7
percent of the city's overseas investment totals.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Hong Kong-backed enterprises in the city are
engaged in industrial manufacturing and in real estate. Many of
these firms have been successful: Earnings from exports in 1996
stood at 33.92 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong-funded enterprises contributed 30 million yuan in
taxes to the city last year and turned in 16 million yuan in taxes
from January to May of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is also an important trade partner for
Lianyungang. Over the past years, shipments of commodities from
this port city to Hong Kong amounted to 52.36 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Major items sent from Lianyungang to Hong Kong include cereals
and edible oil, foodstuffs, feed, clothes, plastics and raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
The increase of investment from Hong Kong and the expanding
trade between the two areas are largely attributed to the fact
that Lianyungang benefits greatly from being the easternmost
departure point of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.

PHNOM PENH, July 5 (Xinhua)-- Sporadic fighting broke out here
today between forces loyal to the nation's co-prime ministers,
killing at least four people and injuring dozens of others.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gulf Financial Reserves Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 5 (Xinhua)-- The financial reserves of the six
Gulf Arab states declined by around 1 billion U.S. dollars in the
year to the end of March despite a sharp increase in their oil
income, a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) reserves stood at around
26.98 billion at the end of March, down from 27.87 billion at end
March 1996, Gulf News quoted a bank report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fall was maily due to a sharp drop in Saudi Arabia's
reserves although the world's dominant oil power earned more than
8 billion U.S. dollars in extra revenue in 1996 because of an oil
price rise of nearly three dollars a barrel, the Bahrain-based
Arab Banking Corp said in its monthly bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Though the reserves of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait,
Bahrain and Oman rose nearly 1.2 billion dollars, the reserves of
Saudi Arabia and Qatar dropped nearly 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi reserves dived by more than 1 billion to around 8.9
billion from 10.47 billion in the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report gave no reason for the decline but bankers
attributed it to withdrawals by Riyadh to pay arrears to local
farmers and contractors.
</P>
<P>
The payments stood at some 5.86 billion U.S. dollars which
combined with overspending in other sectors to maintain the
kingdom's budget deficit in 1996 despite a sharp growth in its oil
income.
</P>
<P>
Such overspending pushed Saudi Arabia's actual expenditure to
nearly 51.8 billion U.S. dollars compared with a projected budget
of 40 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nigerian Economy Improves, Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has achieved an overall
macroeconomic stability with rising foreign exchange reserves,
stable exchange rate and declining inflation, Finance Minister
Anthony Ani said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the country's foreign reserves have
risen from 6.3 billion U.S. dollars in May to more than seven
billion.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign exchange income mainly comes from oil
export, which stood at 745.9 million barrels in 1996 at an
average price of 21.21 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said, foreign exchange rate in the
country has remained stable with only a brief period of
turbulence earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Ani did not give concrete figure for the exchange rate, but
local market movement shows it has changed from some 75 naira to
the dollar at the beginning of this year to the current 87 naira.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Nigeria has fixed the rate at one dollar
to 85 naira for banks appointed to engage in foreign exchange
trading at the swap market.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's dual exchange rate policy, government
deals, oil trade for instance, are settled at a rate of one
dollar to 22 naira.
</P>
<P>
However, this policy has been criticized by international
organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund, while some Nigerian traders describe it as discouraging.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the overall macroeconomic stability "available for all
to see", Ani said inflation rate had also remained low while real
interest rate had, after a long spell, become positive.
</P>
<P>
He did not give any figure to show the current inflation rate,
but data provided by the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS)
indicated a steady downward movement in the first four months
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to FOS, a government agency that collates, processes
and distributes statistical data for the country, the inflation
rate, after a drastic dive from 76 percent in 1995 to 28 percent
in 1996, dropped further to 26 percent, 24.4 percent, 22.4
percent and 21.4 percent in the first four months this year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the improvement, observers noted the trend of
declining inflation rate may suffer a setback as consumer prices
started to rise since March.
</P>
<P>
The repeated fuel scarcity since early this year has slowed
down economic activities nationwide, adding weight to the
government in curbing the already increasing prices, particularly
those of food items.
</P>
<P>
At present there is no sign of immediate rehabilitation of the
country's four refineries, which have been either operating under
half capacity or close to production shut-down.
</P>
<P>
Even when refining facilities were in good condition, some
analysts pointed out that the market price of petrol which is
almost the same as the cost would be discouraging to refineries.
</P>
<P>
The fact that increasing prices of food items for about 100
million people in the leading oil producing country doubled with
constant shortage in fuel supply has cast shadow on the

<HEADLINE> Air Corridor Promotes Sino-Russian Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A non-governmental air corridor for
trade, extending from Beijing to Tianjin and ending in Moscow, has
taken shape, recording an average 20-some flights per day and
sending over 800 tons of goods to the Commonwealth of Independent
States. The corridor turns out an annual trade volume of four
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The air corridor appeared on the heels of the rising success of
the 504-meter Yabaolu Street, often referred to as the "Russian
Market," located on the outskirts of the 80 foreign embassies in
east Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The bustling market has attracted the attention of a large
number of foreign businessmen. The number of Russian businessmen
leaped from 1,200 in 1989, when the market was set up. In 1992
alone, over 60,000 of them visited the fair, all by air instead of
by train as in the past.
</P>
<P>
They buy goods from the Beijing market and put them on planes
in Tianjin. On average, there are 142 flights a week, moving 5,680
tons of goods. A big trader had a charter plane, which makes 120
flights a month. Apart from 16 countries of Commonwealth of
Independent States, business people also come from Poland,
Hungary, Republic of Korea and countries in Southeast Asia and the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"I've been here scores of times, because goods here are of fine
quality and business here is lucrative for me," said a Russian
businesswoman, who flew to Beijing, made a purchase, and returned
home three days later.
</P>
<P>
"It's like visiting relatives," she said.

humiliation and erected a monument in China's great cause of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's smooth handover and the HKSAR government's
smooth operation, there is a scene of stability and prosperity
here, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all members of the HKFTU should support the
HKSAR government and do a good job in putting into practice the
great concept of "one country, two systems" and building the
HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue Unabated in West Bank, Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Several fire bombs were thrown at
the Israeli border policemen at the Jewish settlements in Hebron
Friday night, but no injuries or damages were reported, according
to the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The incident concluded a day's clashes between stone-throwing
Palestinian teenagers and heavily armed Israeli troops in the
largely Palestinian self-rule city.
</P>
<P>
A total of 30 Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets and
gas grenades. One was in critical condition after being hit in
the head by a rubber bullet.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, Friday afternoon, more than 30,000 Palestinians took
part in a Hamas-organized anti-Israel rally. They burnt an effigy
of an Orthodox Jew and called for a revenge for leaflets
distributed last weekend in Hebron by a Jewish woman, depicting
Prophet Muhammed as a pig.
</P>
<P>
After the rally, thousands of furious demonstrators tried to
march to the Joseph's Tomb which is under Israeli control. But
the Israeli army had closed off the site and Palestinian police
managed to prevent the marchers from approaching the Jewish holy
place.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a confrontation took place in Morag, south Gaza
Strip, as Palestinian demonstrators blocked Jewish settlers from
entering or leaving the settlement. Palestinian police removed the
protesters after Israeli army threatened to intervene if the
Palestinian side refused to take action.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians were wounded in the week-long clashes
with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which
were triggered off by the insulting anti-Islamic posters.

<HEADLINE> UNFICYP Concerns Over Minefields in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Force in Cyprus
(UNFICYP) has expressed concern over the number of mines in
the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone separating the island.
</P>
<P>
According to an article in the latest issue of the U.N.
force's magazine, The Blue Beret, UNFICYP estimates that there
may be up to 17,000 mines in the U.N.-controlled no-man's
land.
</P>
<P>
UNFICYP Spokesman Waldemar Rokoszewski was quoted as saying
that although the force has been "very vigilant" on taking
precautionary measures to protect the population at large, UNFICYP
has come across "new situations" on occasion during patrols in
the buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Since the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974, three
UNFICYP soldiers have been killed by mines, while several U.N.
personnel and civilians have been wounded.
</P>
<P>
"Land mines have recently come into sharp focus at the
United Nations and the Secretary-General has raised concern over
the issue. We want to remind people of the number of
minefields in Cyprus," Rokoszewski said.
</P>
<P>
Identified minefields in the buffer zone are marked by a
triangular red warning sign with the world "mines" written in
Greek, English and Turkish.
</P>
<P>
The minefields vary in size from single rows of mines to
areas covering several square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP Spokesman said the mine issue will constitute
another item which the U.N. will take up in indirect talks
with the Greek Cypriot National Guard and Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
Rokoszewski noted that the issue will be raised separately
from the ongoing indirect military dialog between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The indirect military dialog mediated by the U.N., began in
the second half of last year in a bid to reduce tensions along the
buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The dialog dealt with the U.N.-proposed package of measures
including unmanning of the areas where the two sides are at
close proximity with each other, the prohibition of loaded
weapons along the cease-fire lines and the code of conduct for
the military along the cease-fire lines.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and
the Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Protests Against Britain's Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria Foreign Minister Chief Tom
Ikimi yesterday summoned British high commissioner to Nigeria,
Graham Burton to Abuja to protest the increasing hostility of the
British Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said the Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha was
displeased over the campaign of hostility against Nigeria being
orchestrated by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, according
to Daily Times.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister observed that since assuming
office, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has been making
statements that undermine Nigeria's relations with Britain and
the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was specially angry with Cook's statement that Nigeria
should not be allowed to return to the Commonwealth because it
had made no progress on human rights and democracy since it was
suspended in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Not only so. The British also spearheaded the resolution
against Nigeria at the recent meeting of the United Nations
Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The British also led the campaign for the maintenance of
sanctions against Nigeria at the last European Union meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi expressed the surprise that the British has chosen to
ignore the great efforts and achievement made by the Nigerian
government in fighting against corruption, institutionalizing
transparency and accountability in the management of the economy
and many other fields.
</P>
<P>
Whereas democracy is concerned, Ikimi said that Nigeria, after
more than 100 years of British rule, was foisted with the West
style of democracy which is out of tune with the Nigerian complex
realities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister demanded understanding, fairness and
mutual respect from the British government and stressed that
Nigeria should be encouraged in her legitimate efforts to evolve
democratic institutions that take account of her social-cultural
and historical experiences.

<HEADLINE> Nothing to be achieved in Upcoming Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish newly-appointed deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that nothing can be achieved
by exerting pressure on northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas in
the forthcoming U.N.-led direct Cyprus talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who was Turkish prime minister when Cyprus was
divided in 1974, made the remarks in an exclusive interview
published by the Turkish Daily News today.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, also close friend of Denktas, said: " They could
not force Denktas to accept something he disagreed with. On
the other hand, Turkey has come to the point of declaring
that it places importance on this matter because Cyprus has
become essential to the security of Turkey."
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, Denktas will never bow to pressures. The real
counterpart on the issue of security is now Turkey. The West
must understand this ", said he.
</P>
<P>
Denktas and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides held two
informal meetings in Nicosia in October 1994 under the U.N.
auspices, which ended in deadlock. They have not met ever
since.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister pointed out that northern Cyprus
has become a key element in its national security, saying that
the latest developments on the divided island of Cyprus had
greatly affected Turkey's security.
</P>
<P>
He added that the massive armament efforts of the Cypriot
administration and the deal between Cyprus and Russia for the
sale and deployment of S-300 missiles on the island constituted
a direct threat for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit stressed that if the European Union (EU) admits
Cyprus as a member, Turkey would establish an "autonomous
relationship" with northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops landed on Cyprus in 1974 and took control of
the northern third of the island in the wake of an pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Over 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in northern Cyprus
to protect the security of the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side unilaterally declared a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in November
1983, which was recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> IGAD Member States Urged to Pay up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) Executive Secretary Tekeste Chebray has urged
member states to pay their annual contributions on the eve of the
IGAD summit to be held here next week.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea is the only IGAD member which has so far paid its 1997
contribution, said Chebray at the on-going 16th session of the
IGAD Committee of Experts, a preparation for the summit and the
IGAD Council of Ministers meeting.
</P>
<P>
IGAD was set up in 1986 by six eastern and north-eastern
African countries -- Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan
and Uganda. Each member state is required to pay 2.2 million
Shillings (about 40,000 U.S. Dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The organization could not implement its programs effectively
unless its members pay the arrears, Chebray said at a press
conference Friday, urging the members to find ways of generating
financial resources.
</P>
<P>
"This is among the major challenges" facing IGAD, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Four member states out of the six that are part of the
organization have outstanding debts accruing from the past
years," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that IGAD's western donors have been slow
in releasing funds to the organization for its various projects.
</P>
<P>
He asked the IGAD member countries to double their efforts in
implementing programs aimed at increasing food security in the
region by eliminating economic oppression.
</P>
<P>
The only way Africa could become self-sufficient in food is by
encouraging cooperation between neighboring countries in all
spheres, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our programs are, therefore, designed to ensure that as we
provide food for today, there will be enough left for tomorrow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
IGAD is also actively involved in projects aimed at improving
trade among the member states through the construction of
infrastructure like roads and telecommunication network with a
view to facilitating movement of products, he said.
</P>
<P>
IGAD has decided to build a Railway Information System between
Uganda's capital Kampala and Nairobi and is considering to help
improve infrastructure in Ethiopia, Sudan and Eritrea, he
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled IGAD summit, to be hosted by IGAD Chairman and
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, was reportedly to be focused on
the crisis in southern Sudan and on Sudan's relations with
neighboring Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A peace talk was held in Eldoret, western Kenya, between
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Sudanese President Hassan
el Bashir in May to iron out their long-standing differences.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the peace talks, the two
presidents requested Moi to convene a IGAD summit to pursue the
course of peace in southern Sudan and in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In southern Sudan, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
led by John Garang has fought since 1983 for greater autonomy of
the Christian south from the Moslem north.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Bans Import of Pork Sausage From Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda begins banning import of
pork sausage from Kenya as from today, for "likely confusion over
beef and pork sausages", according to the local daily, the New
Vision.
</P>
<P>
P. M. Ociba, the Commissioner for Veterinary Services,
informed on July 2 Your Choice Ltd., the Ugandan distributor of
Farmers Choice products to stop import of pork sausage.
</P>
<P>
The official said that import of pork sausage from Kenya can
be resumed until the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries has decided on appropriate tests to distinguish between
the two kinds of sausages.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has banned import of beef sausage from Kenya last
December under the shadow of mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
an overwhelming share of Uganda sausage market belongs to
Farmers Choice as there is no large scale production of beef
sausage in Uganda. But Imperial Gourmet, a new sausage factory,
will produce this month, the newspaper added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia on Alert Against Dengue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Xinhua) -- As the rainy reason at its
peak in July and August creates an ideal breeding environment for
the aedes mosquitoes and the number of dengue cases is increasing,
Malaysia is on alert against the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The government launched on July 2 a three-month large-scale
campaign nationwide to prevent the breeding of aedes mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
All vector control units at airports and ports nationwide have
been alerted to ensure that no dengue infected passenger or cargo
enters Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
An efficient quarantine system is necessary as a backup measure
to the government campaign, Kuala Lumpur City Hall (KLCH) Vector
Control Unit Adviser Director Sallehuddin Sulaiman said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no point in destroying aedes mosquitoes in Malaysia
if the dengue virus was brought into the country from other
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has been urged to use the satellite's global
positioning navigational system to quickly identify dengue
breeding areas.
</P>
<P>
The KLCH is also studying the possibility of using a helicopter
to fog suspected aedes breeding areas in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
According to KLCH Deputy Health Director Zainol Ariffin
Pawanchee, the use of the helicopter might be more effective
because fogging could be carried out on a much wider scale in a
shorter time and aerial fogging is not a health hazard because the
amount of chemical used is at a safe level and it causes no side
effect to humans.
</P>
<P>
By using the helicopter, fogging work could be carried out on a
continuous basis to ensure that the aedes mosquito larvae is
totally wiped out, Zainol said.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, the number of dengue cases
nationwide increased by 127 percent to 8,598 up to June 23 this
year compared with 3,790 cases for the whole of last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of fatal cases during the same period rose to 22
compared with 14 deaths last year.
</P>
<P>
In view of the increasing number of dengue cases, Malaysian
Housing and Local Government Minister Ting Chew Peh today also
urged all the state governments to cooperate in preventing the
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said that among the areas which should be inspected for
aedes breeding grounds are construction sites, residential housing
areas, abandoned housing projects, unoccupied houses, factories
and also road dividers.
</P>
<P>
The John state government in southern Malaysia has already
directed all schools in the state to revive the "mutual
cooperation" project to ensure that areas around schools are kept
clean and free of aedes mosquito breeding grounds following the
increase in dengue fever cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ting also asked for media exposure to create greater public
awareness about the danger of allowing aedes to breed to help
prevent the spread of dengue fever.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President to Visit Georgia on Mediation Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
is expected to pay a two-day official visit to Georgia at the
invitation of his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News reported today that Demirel will fly
to Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on July 14 under the request
Shevardnadze to mediate between Abkhazia, an autonomous republic
seeking independence, and central government of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Georgia is now offering Abkhazia a federal state status with a
large degree of local authority. However, Abkhazia rejected the
solution and declared independence.
</P>
<P>
Following the independence of Georgia from the former Soviet
Union in 1991, the government of Tbilisi wanted to abolish the
autonomy of Abkhazia, thus triggering off armed conflicts between
the two sides in 1992. The on-and-off conflicts drove about
300,000 Georgians to flee into internal exile over the past years.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said Friday that the two
presidents will also exchange views on the regional and
international issues and discuss the possibilities of the further
development of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Albania Convenes Urgent Cabinet Meeting on Fatal Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Albania's interim government, headed
by Socialist Prime Minister Bashkim Fino, convened an urgent
cabinet meeting Friday evening to discuss a fatal shooting between
police and supporters of a son of former Albanian king.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's press office said in a statement today
that the armed rallies organized by Leka, son of deposed King Zog,
on Thursday at the central Skanderbeg square and outside the
building housing the Central Electoral Commission in central
Tirana were illegal.
</P>
<P>
The statement said these armed rallies had not only led to
bloodshed, but also caused serious consequences to Albania's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
The interim government called on all political parties and all
Albanians to abide by law and maintain the country's political
stability and social order.
</P>
<P>
The fatal shooting of Thursday, in which one man was killed and
two were injured, occurred as self-proclaimed king Leka, dressed
in battle fatigues and sporting two pistols on his belt,
approached the building housing the Central Electoral Commission
after marching with some 500 supporters from the central
Skanderbeg square.
</P>
<P>
Leka, who returned to Albania in April after spending nearly
his entire life in exile in South Africa, has been going about
drumming up support for the restoration of monarchy.

<HEADLINE> India's Janata Dal Splits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Janata Dal, the main constituent
party of India's ruling United Front, officially split today after
Bihar State Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav's supporters formed
a new party, Rashtriya Janata Dal.
</P>
<P>
Laloo Prasad was elected president of the new party at a
convention of his supporters here today. He boycotted the Janata
Dal presidential election on Thursday, alleging that a conspiracy
was hatched by some leaders of that party to malign him. He was
allegedly involved in a multi-crore fodder scam and the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is going to prosecute him soon.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the Bihar chief minister began gathering here
this morning to formalize the split. Laloo Prasad decided to go
ahead with the convention last night after last-minute efforts by
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who is also a Janata Dal
member, to find a solution failed. Gujral was reported to have had
two hours of closed-door talks with Laloo Prasad.
</P>
<P>
The split of Janata Dal came in the wake of a month-long ego
battle between the Bihar chief minister and the party's working
president, Sharad Yadav, his challenger in the party presidential
election, which Laloo Prasad and his supporters boycotted on the
ground that the voters list was "fake and fraudulent." In Bihar's
Patna polling center, only 33 of the 146 national council members
voted, reflecting Laloo Prasad's control over the electoral
college.

MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia today launched a cargo ship
from Baikonur space complex in Kazakhstan with equipment, food and
spare parts for the Mir space station, which was slightly damaged
in a collision on June 25.
</P>
<P>
The space craft, the Progress M-35, lifted off at 0411 GMT and
was expected to dock with the Mir on Monday at 0559 GMT, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Besides fuels, scientific equipment, food and some personal
kits, the craft will also bring cables and a new door seal for the
two Russian cosmonauts and one U.S. astronaut to restore power
supplies, which was severely restricted since a collision between
Mir and another Progress craft last month.
</P>
<P>
The collision has been believed to be one of the worst
accidents since the Mir station began to operate. A small hole was
punched in the side of the Mir's Spektr module.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mir station remained safe as the crew had closed
the door with the module after the collision occurred.

<HEADLINE> HK Students to Study More Chinese History, Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Joseph W P Wong, secretary for
education and manpower of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), said here today that local students should study
more Chinese history and culture so as to acquaint themselves
better still with their motherland.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a press briefing titled "The Future
Direction of Education in Hong Kong" at the HK Convention and
Exhibition Center earlier today.
</P>
<P>
This is the first press briefing on the development of
education given by the HKSAR government since the founding of the
SAR on July 1.
</P>
<P>
At a grand celebration for the founding of the HKSAR on
Tuesday, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said that the SAR
government would draw up an all-round plan to improve the quality
of education, and would put in sufficient resources to achieve
this goal.
</P>
<P>
Wong told reporters that his department has mapped out eight
major policies for the improvement of Hong Kong's basic education.
One of these policies, he added, is to increase students'
knowledge on the Chinese culture and history through civic
education.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country with a history of 5,000 years, and we would
like our students to know their motherland in a very comprehensive
manner, that is to say, they should know not only China's recent
political and economic development, but its 5,000-year old history
and culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the SAR government will introduce any major
changes to the existing textbooks, Wong noted, the HKSAR
government neither produces nor censors any textbooks, and that
all textbooks in Hong Kong are produced by private publishers.
</P>
<P>
"However, the government keeps to only one principle, namely,
all textbooks, especially history textbooks, must provide
objective and comprehensive facts for the students, and shall
reflect the recent political and economic changes," he said,
citing some minor changes to the former textbooks as "normal" and
"necessary".
</P>
<P>
The main objective of Hong Kong's education, he acknowledged,
is to enable the students to know facts and differing points of
view on these facts, and to think independently to draw their own
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his confidence in the prospects of Hong
Kong's education, since "the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR has
vested the power in the SAR government to formulate educational
policies on its own, and guarantee the autonomy and academic
freedom of local schools as well."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Crack Down on Smuggled Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Commerce Minister
Mohammad Ishaq Dar vowed today to launch a major crackdown on
smuggled goods to protect the economy from the disastrous impact
of smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"The smuggled goods including vehicles and motorbikes will be
confiscated and auctioned," Dar said without disclosing when the
campaign will be launched.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Forum of Economic Writers (FEW), Dar discussed
the government's efforts to take on the daunting challenge of
freeing the trapped economy.
</P>
<P>
While replying to a question regarding checking the existence
of fake goods in the market, Dar said anti-smuggling measures are
being intensified to halt their inflow.
</P>
<P>
Besides planning a crackdown on smuggled goods, Dar said, the
vigilance on borders will be increased through the deployment of
rangers and other concerned personnel.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the improvement of the country's engineering base
for producing quality goods to discourage the inflow of fake
items.
</P>
<P>
The commerce minister disclosed that the government will
announce its trade policy by July 15, fixing a target of 10
billion U.S. dollars for exports for 1997-98 and hoped that the
target will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government has fixed a target of 15 percent growth
in exports for the next fiscal year while imports are projected to
increase by 5 percent. During the previous fiscal year, exports
totaled 8.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken all steps to address the root causes
of a decline in exports and large-scale manufacturing, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to removing impediments to exports, he noted that
high tariffs have already been removed, duty on the import of
export-oriented capital equipment reduced to 10 percent, income
tax on exports earnings lessened and charges for utility services
frozen ever since the present government came to office.

ISLAMABAD, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran are to hold
ministerial-level talks in the southern port city of Karachi next

<P>
The Pak-Iran trade committee will try to resolve trade and
other related issues including the smuggling of arms and
ammunition, according to official sources today.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling through the common border area into Pakistan is the
main source of arms supply for terrorists in this country, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Iran will have their own respective priorities in
the talks although they are both interested in trade and
cross-border matters.
</P>
<P>
Iran wants to establish air links between the towns along the
common border area while Pakistan is expected to take up the
issues of smuggling of flour and grain out of and arms and
ammunition into the country.
</P>
<P>
Smuggling into Pakistan via the Iran-Afghanistan common border
is causing a big problem for the country as major consignments of
ammunition come through this route, one official source said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan's deficit in trade with Iran will
be another bitter issue to be taken up during the meeting.

Dollars) caused during an opposition rally calling for
constitutional reforms. The rally was later broken up by the
police.
</P>
<P>
Among the sued are 23 opposition parliamental members, three
lawyers, a clergyman and four political activists.
</P>
<P>
The top leaders of the country's major four opposition parties
-- Ford Kenya, Ford Asili, Democratic Party and the National
Development Party of Kenya -- all with ambition to run for the
presidential seat in the forthcoming general elections, have been
sued.
</P>
<P>
The companies charged in their complaint that members of the
public who appeared for the unlawful assembly had bad intentions
and were motivated by the defendants to cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
The 31 sued people and their followers had not applied for a
licence for the rally which had led to looting, theft and damage
to the companies' properties, the companies averred.
</P>
<P>
The loss they suffered was a direct result of the defendants'
conduct and lack of respect for the rule of law, the firms
claimed.
</P>
<P>
The firms claiming compensation are mainly shops dealing in
clothes, electrical, optics and uniform.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Groups Call to Consolidate Internal Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean conglomerates are
pushing ahead in full gear to improve their structure in wake of
the bankruptcies of cash-strapped groups, including Hanbo Group
and Sammi Group.
</P>
<P>
The efforts by conglomerates to improve their financial
structure are also prompted by the government-initiated structure
reform plan, which primarily calls for the improvement of
conglomerates' financial structure.
</P>
<P>
Some leading conglomerates, including Samsung, Hyundai, LG and
Daewoo, are focusing on how to reduce borrowing, boost sales,
increase profitability, cut costs and increase capital.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Group, which plans to focus investments on automobile,
information and telecommunications and other future-oriented
projects for the second-half performance, will step up export
drives in those sectors that have gained advantage from Japanese
currency's appreciation, including semiconductors, shipbuilding,
telecommunications equipment and machinery.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Group decided to improve its financial structure
through recapitalization, issuance of bonds in foreign markets,
reduction of costs and improvement of profitability.
</P>
<P>
Money raised by issuing bonds abroad will be funneled into
projects launched by the group's core business, including Hyundai
Motors.
</P>
<P>
Investments will be increased for projects with high
profitability while marginal projects that fall to generate
economies of scale will be transformed into small businesses
aligned with the group.
</P>
<P>
Led by growing signs of business recovery, including the upturn
of export, Hyundai plans to raise sale projections for this year
to 90 billion U.S. dollars from 88 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
LG Group plans to focus the allocation of its operating
resources on high-growth projects, including personal
communications services, other telecommunication and multimedia
sectors and electric power plant projects. The PCs project will
become the group's top priority for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Group decided to scale down short-term debts from
non-banking organizations, and to restrict purchase of real estate
that is not required for business operation. Daewoo intends to peg
its borrowing to last year's level and to cut manufacturing and
marketing costs by about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its export drive will be focused on the electronics and
automobile sectors. Daewoo had upwardly adjusted its export
performance projection for this year to 16 billion dollars, up 900
million dollars from the original projection.

<P>
COLOMBO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Police and the Armed Forces have
tightened security in Sri Lanka's capital in a bid to prevent
possible Tamil suicide squad attacks, police sources here said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, three new members of the Tamil

The squad is believed to be sheltered in Colombo with the
intention of carrying out bomb blasts in the city. Three police
squads have been deployed within the city to trace them, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police authorities in the city have rounded up a number of
suspected suicide bombers of the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) over the last several days.

LTTE rebels who have been fighting for a separate state, are
facing a severe setback as a result of the Jaya Sikuru (Certain
Victory) operation by government troops in the north of the
country and are therefore believed to be planning disruptions in
other places in the country.

<P>
MANILA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between government troops
and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels in Central
Mindanao, which broke out early this morning, has intensified,
sending many civilians fleeing to safer ground.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Central Mindanao said that hostilities started
this morning in Bulit, Maguindanao Province, has virtually spilled
over to the adjacent province of Cotabato and one child was killed
in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
A fierce encounter between the two forces is going on along the
Cotabato-Davao Highway in Pagangan, Cotabato, aside from the
fighting in Bulit, Maguindanao, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some 400 MILF rebels are now holed up in Pagangan,
where government forces are trying to push back the guerrillas
from reinforcing their comrades in Bulit.
</P>
<P>
The simultaneous hostilities in Maguindanao and Cotabato is
perceived by many as planned attacks by the rebels to retake Camp
Rajamudah in Pikit that was overran last week by government
forces.
</P>
<P>
There have been no confirmed reports yet of casualties from
both sides. But a number of evacuees were injured in the on-going
siege.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said MILF rebels strafed a service vehicle and
took hostage an undetermined number of its passengers in Pagangan.
</P>
<P>
The MILF warned in a statement today that war may escalate in
the whole Mindanao anytime if government forces continue their
offensives against MILF members in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Government forces accused MILF members of kidnapping residents
in Central Mindanao and began their offensives against the rebels
a month ago. Over 150 rebels have been killed in the past weeks.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of crude
palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, it opened on a bearish note this
week, hit by lower export figures by cargo surveyor SGS (M)
Private Ltd., which put June export at 611,368 tons against
672,805 tons in May, leading to bouts of liquidation.
</P>
<P>
Shortcovering activities the next day limited losses but
traders were wary of taking fresh positions due to a lack of new
support factors.
</P>
<P>
Continued liquidation and tight range trading put pressure on
the market again on Thursday before last-minute pre-weekend
covering activities emerged on Friday to enable prices to close
off the week's lows.
</P>
<P>
July South ended the week 2.5 ringgit (about 1 U.S. dollar)
lower at 1,207.5 ringgit (about 483 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
Next week, CPO physicals are expected to trade sideways as the
focus shifts to crop forecaster Ivan Wong whose report is due most
probably on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Throughout this week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM)
continued its see-saw ways but in range trading of less than five
points.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM price ended the week three sen higher at 13.72 ringgit
(about 5.488 U.S. dollars) per kg from 13.69 ringgit (about 5.476
U.S. dollars) per kg at the last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The market drifted to a new 27-month low of 13.67 ringgit
(about 5.468 dollars) per kilogram on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was slightly higher at 590 tons against 524 tons last
week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM may stage a slight technical rebound next week with
many dealers anticipating an upward technical adjustment to
correct the current oversold position.
</P>
<P>
Buying support on the KLTM as a result was expected to build
up, inspired by the strong recovery on the London Metal Exchange
(LME), the dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, August RSS One ended
sharply lower at 243 sen (about 97.2 U.S. cents) per kilogram from
last week's close at 263.5 sen (about 105.4 U.S. cents) per
kilogram while SMR 20 dropped 8 sen to 237.5 sen (about 95 U.S.
cents) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for July 3 was at 186.82 Malaysia/Singapore
cents (sen) per kilogram against 197.97 cents (sen) on June 26.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average settled at 192.43 cents (sen)
versus 201.58 cents (sen) per kilogram previously.
</P>
<P>
Prices are expected to hover within the current levels next
week with a downward bias amid Thailand's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
Dealers, however, were hopeful that conditions would stabilize
despite the Thai baht crisis which has been the focus of concern
among regional markets.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Ruling Party Contenders Begin Nomination Rallies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Starting today, seven presidential
contenders of South Korea's ruling party began to bid for party
nomination in nationwide in joint speech sessions.
</P>
<P>
The rallies began in Suwon, Kyonggi Province today and will be
held in 12 major cities before the ruling New Korea Party (NKP)
holds its national convention on July 21.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that a South Korean political party holds
joint sessions across the country to help convention voters hear
views from multiple presidential contenders before the election.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls indicate former NKP chairman and former Prime
Minister Lee Hoi-chang is leading the pack, but does not yet cover
half of the voters.
</P>
<P>
Kyonggi Province Governor Rhee In-je is a distant second,
followed by Representative Kim Deog-ryong and Lee Han-dong, former
Prime Minister Lee Soo-sung, veteran politician Park Chan-jong and
former Seoul Mayor Choe Byung-yul, political sources said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a split due to the nomination, the seven
presidential contenders promised that they will accept the
election results, not bolt out of the party and support the
selected to win the forthcoming presidential election in December.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam today repromised that he will not favor
any contender in the nomination race, with the most clear and
direct expression of his neutrality.
</P>
<P>
"I will not side with anyone," Kim said.
</P>
<P>
To win the votes of convention delegates, the seven candidates
have charted strategies that will differentiate themselves from
their rivals.

<P>
BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost province,
Hainan, saw more than half of its commercial houses built since

The paper quotes a survey as saying that 71 percent of the
province's residential houses, 47 percent of its villas and deluxe
apartments and 24.19 percent of the office rooms are unsold.
</P>

By the end of last year, the paper said, China has 70 million
sq m of commercial houses unsold and 75 percent of them are for
residential purposes.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Worsens in Southern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in southern
Chittagong and Cox's Bazar District has worsened due to incessant
rainfall during the last few days, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Road communication between Cox's Bazar and Chittagong may snap
any time as the highway between them was threatened by the erosion
of the Bagkhali River.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sea level in Cox's Bazar continued to rise
causing breach in the coastal embankment. It is reported that
about 12,000 people have been affected by the flood, which has hit
vast low-lying areas in four counties under the district of Cox's
Bazar.
</P>
<P>
In Chittagong District, more than 50,000 people are already
marooned in the flood water and the standing crops over 40,000
acres of land are submerged afresh.
</P>
<P>
The continuous rainfall in the last few days has put the
district at the threshold of flood while the meteorological office
forecast more rainfall in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rain has been a fresh crippling blow to the
people who lost their hearths and homes in a May 19 disastrous
cyclone. The rainfall accentuated their plight as the homeless
people are yet to build up their houses.

<HEADLINE> Indian Paper Condemns US Nuclear Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- India's bigger circulation
English newspaper "the Hindustan Times" in its editorial entitled
"CTBT for all but US" today condemned the United States for its
nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
"It is disappointing, but hardly surprising, that the world's
strongest nation should celebrate its independence day by
violating both human rights and the spirit of a disarmament
agreement which it had itself thrust upon a trusting international
community," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
"By conducting the first of a series of so-called +subcritical+
nuclear tests last Wednesday, the US has brazenly violated its own
commitment to the controversial comprehensive test ban treaty
(CTBT) which Washington had spearheaded so vociferously at the
recent Conference on Disarmament in Vienna,", it said.
</P>
<P>
"And the US has also betrayed its dubious record on human
rights when it broke up peaceful protest rallies held by anti-
nuclear groups at the Nevada test site where the experiment, code
named "rebound", triggered off a device, probably a prototype
warhead, containing weapons-grade plutonium," it further said.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Union Reaffirms Support for Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The largest teachers union in
the United States reaffirmed its support for affirmative action on
Friday in the face of congressional and legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
Delegates at the National Education Association's annual
assembly in Atlanta, Georgia, agreed by verbal vote to urge local
unions to endorse the preferential hiring of women and minorities
in education to cure past discrimination or ensure diversity among
employees, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Local unions will still be free to take their own positions.
</P>
<P>
Bob Chase, President of the National Education Association said
the recommendations from a special committee on affirmative action
give a sharper focus to the union's stance.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that affirmative action plans cause racial
division, while supporters insisted racial, ethnic and gender
barriers remain in a country whose ethnic mix is changing.
</P>
<P>
Congressional Republicans are pushing legislation that would
remove race and gender criteria from federal employment,
contracting and other programs.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court recently agreed to hear arguments on whether
it was unlawful for the Piscataway School Board in New Jersey to
lay off a white teacher in order to protect an equally qualified
black teacher who had been hired the same day.
</P>
<P>
The appeal court in the case said employers cannot favor
minorities simply to keep racial diversity in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations say affirmative action should be used, "in
certain cases," to choose between qualified job applicants. But
they say layoffs for budget reasons should not be used to increase
the percentage of ethnic minority or female employees.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Education Department said that only 13 percent of
America's estimated 2.6 million teachers belonged to minorities,
while a third of public school students were.

<HEADLINE> US Spending Billions on Nuclear-weapons: Iyengar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A noted Indian nuclear specialist
P.K. Iyengar has said that the United States while pushing
non-proliferation is spending billions of US dollars on more
effective but smaller nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Observer of Business and
Politics, which was published here today, Dr. Iyengar, who is
India's former chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, said that the
United States is spending as much as 3.8 billion US dollars a year
under the stockpile stewardship program (SSP) to develop new
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"If one looks deeper one finds that the new US program
envisages progress in almost every field of activity towards more
sophisticated weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
Quoting from the official publications of the US Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory, which develops nuclear weapons, Dr. Iyengar
said that the US is heavily investing in low power detonators that
could form the core of new fusion devices (hydrogen bomb is a
fusion device). It is also working on low energy implosion physics
and high energy-density physics which together should help in
creating devices like a super efficient neutron bomb that will
have very little radioactive fall-out but could kill all life
form.

<HEADLINE> "History Through Chinese Stamps Exhibition Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 5 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 precious Chinese
stamps from the China National Postage Stamp Museum are expected
to be displayed in an exhibition at the Sha Tin Town Hall from
Sunday to August 5.
</P>
<P>
Co-organized by the Provisional Regional Council and the China
National Postage Stamp Exhibition to mark Hong Kong's return to
China, the "History through Chinese Stamps" Exhibition aims at
enhancing public understanding of the history of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the exhibition, Lau
Wong-fat, chairman of the Provisional Regional Council, said that
stamps not only reflect the history of postal services at
different stages, but also serve as a miniature of politics,
economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
As the exhibition coincided with Hong Kong's return to China,
he noted, it bears a far-reaching implication and possesses both
educational and appreciation value."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition presents the earliest Chinese stamps which were
issued in two phases in the late Qing Dynasty, which was the Trial
Postage Service conducted by the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs
(1879-1896) and the National Postage Service (1897-1911).
</P>
<P>
Two other sets of stamps issued during this period were the
Small Dragon set of 1885 and the Empress Dowager Cixi's 60th
Birthday Stamps of 1894. The latter was the first set of Chinese
commemorate stamps.
</P>
<P>
In 1910, the Qing government established a postal service in
Tibet and in the following year, a set of Coiling Dragon Stamps
bearing Chinese, English and Tibetan scripts printed in London
were issued for use in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition also presents commemorative stamps issued in the
period of 1949-1967, which all bear inscription Zhongguo Renmin
Youzheng (Chinese People's Postage Service). Stamps issued between
October 1949 and March 1955 have face values of the old Renminbi
(RMB) currency, and those issued after March 1955 have face values
of the new RMB.
</P>
<P>
There are also stamps of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China which came into
being on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The set of six commemorative stamps was issued on July 1, 1997
to mark Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
A set of 16 definitive stamps which issued in January 1997 and
can be used both before and after the establishment of the HKSAR
were also on the show.
</P>
<P>
The 16 denominations in a contiguous arrangement give a
panoramic view of the northern side of Hong Kong Island, with the
13 smaller-denomination stamps depicting the scene at sun set and
the three larger-denomination stamps depicting nocturnal views.

BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Investment applications submitted
to the Board of Investment (BOI) of Thailand plummeted during the
first six months this year in both volume and value, compared to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 506 projects worth 296 billion baht (11.38 billion US

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Ready to Cut Next Year's Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will cut the
next fiscal year's budget to offset the revenue shorfall caused by
the baht floatation, which began on Wednesday, Deputy Finance
Minister Chaturon Chaisaeng said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The flotation is likely to dent government earnings, prompting
a readjustment of the 982 billion baht (about 35 billion US
dollar) budget for fiscal year 1998, which starts on October 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment will be carried out after the baht stabilizes,
a process expected to take a couple of weeks, when the government
will have a clearer picture of its earnings.
</P>
<P>
The central bank of Thailand believes that the value of the
baht will not drop by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Under the new 'managed floatation' of the baht, the central
bank will step in if the market is deemed too volatile for the
baht.

<HEADLINE> Baht's Depreciation Not Magical Cure: Leading Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the Thai Bankers'
Association, Olarn Chaipravat, said that he disagreed that the
depreciation of the baht represented a magical cure for the
country's economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the next 10 months policy makers would have
to deal with the vicious cycle of the baht's depreciation,
resulted from the currency's floatation, which began on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Olarn, a leading economist and president of Siam Commercial
Bank, said he expected the baht to settle at 27.5 to the US dollar
over the next six months, equivalent to an overall depreciation of
10 percent and causing annual inflation to increase to more than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the central bank set its 1997 inflation
target at 4.5 percent. With the float of the baht and its
subsequent depreciation, authorities now expect inflation to
increase to about 6 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on Friday, Olarn said what was needed
instead were more steps aimed at tackling the underlying problems
and structure of the country's economy, with a long-term solution
dependent on boosting productivity and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said the 24.6 percent jump over the past three days in the
stock market did not represent any positive factor over the long
term, he said, adding that the buying of shares has been spurred
mainly by foreign investors expecting a drop in the baht.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation this year will only worsen unless the
government restrained wages.
</P>
<P>
He said that although floating the baht should lead to
increased capital inflow, boosting liquidity and lowering
interbank rates in the money market, retail lending rates must be
kept high if inflation is to be restrained.

<HEADLINE> Fast Food for Elephants Created in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai researchers have created
ready-made food for elephants.
</P>
<P>
The food, produced from starch of maize, sugarcane, soybean and
mung bean, is said to contain nutrients necessary for jumbos.
</P>
<P>
The food has been successfully tested in the past three months
and elephants seemed to favor it for its sugarcane smell, said
Assistant Professor Poonprsert Piya-anan of the Kasetsart
University.
</P>
<P>
The research had been prompted by migration of elephants and
their mahouts from the provinces to Bangkok to make a living. But
elephants often suffer from starvation in big cities.
</P>
<P>
The elephants' fast food is compressed into the shape and size
of bananas.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will improve the food for wild elephants during
the dry season when natural food is scarce.

Chinese president at Beijing's mass rally to celebrate Hong Kong's
return.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang said that the modern history of China
makes clear the truth that the Chinese nation must rise in
struggle and work hard to make the country strong if it is to
change the historical fate of being bullied and oppressed due to
poverty and backwardness; that it must have the leadership of an
advanced political Party and the guidance of a scientific theory
if it is to realize national liberation and prosperity and
strength of the country; and that it must break away with the
state of being closed and must open up the country to the rest of
the world if it is to catch up with the progress of the times and
the development trend of the world..
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chile-Canada Trade Agreement Goes into Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The free trade agreement signed by
Chile and Canada, and ratified Wednesday in a special session of
the Chilean Senate, came into force today.
</P>
<P>
Acting Foreign Relations Minister Mariano Fernandez said the
wide-ranging nature of the deal heralded a new relationship that
he would have believed almost impossible to achieve with a member
of the Group of Seven industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
From today, more than 92 percent of Chile's exports will enter
Canada free of customs tariffs. The exports cover ceramics,
copper goods, fruit, wine, fish meal, salmon and other products in
the fishing sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, all Chilean products sold to Canada will be
exempt from customs duties payments no later than the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
Correspondingly, 70 percent of Canadian products will enter
Chile without being subject to tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which covers three aspects -- commerce, labor
and environmental protection, should have been implemented
on June 1, but Chilean Foreign Relations Ministry requested a
30-day postponement for the accord to be discussed by the Senate.

when Smith missed his three-pointer.

Earlier Yugoslavia had beaten Lithuania 75-60 and Greece came
from behind to defeat Poland 72-62, also lining up a semi-final
clash.
</P>
<P>
Friday's winners to reach the semi-finals also guaranteed
qualification for next summer's world championship, with a place
also available for the fifth-placed team.

<P>
However, the victory of Greece, already automatically qualified
as host country, has created an extra place for the country
finishing sixth.

quarter-finals -- Poland and Lithuania, Spain and Turkey -- have
acquired a special significance, as the winner will also book
places in the competition.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Meets Pioline in Men's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras of
the United States and non-seeded French player Cedric Pioline
entered the Wimbledon men's singles final after beating their
opponents on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Three times Wimbledon Champion Sampras has moved closer to his
fourth Wimbledon trophy, trouncing the Australian doubles
specialist Todd Woodbridge in straight sets 6-2, 6-1, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
"I played one of the greatest players who was playing great,"
said Woodbridge, who moved into the men's semi-final after beating
world number two Michael Chang and other strong contenders. "The
way he served the second ball was what set him apart from other
players."
</P>
<P>
Sampras expressed his satisfaction with his performances at
Friday's semi-final, saying "I'm playing very solid. I've been
getting better each match."
</P>
<P>
In the other men's singles semi-final, 1991 Wimbledon Champion
Michael Stich of Germany and Pioline, ranked 44 in the world, put
up an inspiring five-set battle, in which Stich finally lost 7:6,
2:6, 1:6, 7:5, 4:6.
</P>
<P>
Stich, who has announced he is to retire from the tennis arena
this September, was obviously disappointed at his final Wimbledon
match, but he paid tribute to his opponent by saying "I've played
Cedric many times but I've never seen him play so well."
</P>
<P>
On the coming final clash with the almost unbeatable tennis
giant Sampras, Pioline said: "I'm tired of this man
(Sampras). He's beaten me so many times."
</P>
<P>
But the confident finalist said: "In the U.S. Open final I lost
in straight sets but maybe it's my turn this time. If I keep
playing like this, who knows?"
</P>
<P>
The men's final between Sampras and Pioline is to be held on
Sunday afternoon. World number one Martina Hingis and Jana Nonotna
will fight for the Wimbledon women's trophy Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Canada-Chile Free Trade
Agreement will enter into force on July 5, following its approval
by the Chilean Senate, Canadian International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi said today.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreement was formally signed in Chile on
December 5, 1996. Legislation to put the agreement into force in
Canada was approved on April 25.
</P>
<P>
The pact provides immediate duty-free access for 75 percent of
Canadian exports and the elimination of Chile's 11-percent import
duty on almost all remaining industrial and resource-based goods
over five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Canada and Chile will also eliminate
anti-dumping duties within a maximum of six years.
</P>
<P>
"This is a significant agreement for both nations, and gives
Canadian companies privileged access to a dynamic South American
market," Marchi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"It will not only create jobs in both countries, but is an
important first step to even closer trade relations with other
strong economies in South America," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian-IMF Deal Blocked by Currency Design </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The one remaining issue blocking
an agreement between Bosnia and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is concerned with the design of the country's new currency,
an IMF statement said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian parties have agreed on issuing a provisional common
currency called "Convertal Marka", but disputed on the design of
the money which will be used in both entities of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement quoted Scott Brown, head of IMF mission here, as
saying that he was hopeful that the dispute could be resolved in
the weekend in time for a much-delayed international conference to
raise reconstruction funds for Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Washington and its allies have set the IMF agreement and a
package of economic laws recently passed by the Bosnian parliament
as pre-conditions that Bosnia must meet for convening the donors'
conference which, postponed three times, is now scheduled for the
middle of this month.

<HEADLINE> New York Airport Workers Arrested for Stealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Seven security and baggage workers
at la Guardia Airport, New York, are charged with stealing drug
profits, according to a report of the New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
The workers--six of whom were arrested Thursday, and one who is
scheduled to turn herself in today--devised a sophisticated
scheme in which they targeted passengers they thought likely to be
couriers hired to take drug profits back to Colombia and other
countries. The workers usually allowed the couriers to board
planes with their suitcases in exchange for bribes that they then
divided.
</P>
<P>
Their scheme was discovered by Port Authority officers and
Federal drug agents in May this year, when they stole 280,000 U.S.
dollars from a bag belonging to two men from Colombia. The men,
indignant that the suitcase was empty when it arrived in Miami,
returned to La Guardia to demand their money from airport workers.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimated the seven suspects had stolen
hundreds of thousands of dollars from cash-stuffed suitcases that
drug traffickers carried through the American Airlines terminal in
the last two years. The suspects were charged with theft and
interstate travel in aid of racketeering and face up to 15 years
in prison.
