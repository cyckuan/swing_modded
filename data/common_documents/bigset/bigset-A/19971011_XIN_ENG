<HEADLINE> US to Harvest 9.31 Bln Bushels of Corn in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States is likely
to harvest some 9.31 billion bushels of corn this year, the
third-largest crop in history, the U.S. Agriculture Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest corn projection in October is 44 million bushels
higher than last month's forecast and 18 million bushels more than
the 1996 crop. This year's crop, if realized, will trail only the
1992 and 1994 corn harvests in size. One bushel of corn is
equivalent to 25.42 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The corn harvest was just beginning, with 15 percent of the
crop in as of October 5. Per-acre yields were expected to average
about 125.8 bushels per acre, down 1.3 bushels from 1996.
</P>
<P>
The department also projected that the soybean crop was
estimated at 2.72 billion bushels, down slightly from last month's
forecast but still 14 percent higher than the 1996 crop and still
an all-time record. One bushel of soybean is about 27.216
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Soybean yield on the 69.8 million planted acres was projected
at 39 bushels per acre, about 1.4 bushels more than last year.
</P>
<P>
Production of cotton was estimated at 18.4 million bales, down
3 percent from 1996 but still the fourth-largest crop in history.
Cotton yield was expected to average about 658 pounds per acre, a
drop of 49 pounds from last year. One bale of cotton is equal to
480 pounds.

<HEADLINE> Canadian FM Congratulates ICBL on Winning Nobel Peace Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy today congratulated the International
Campaign to Ban Land Mines (ICBL) and its coordinator Jody
Williams on the winning of the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted at the Nobel Committee's choice and offer my
sincerest congratulations to Ms. William and all members of the
ICBL, including its Canadian member, Mines Action Canada,"
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
The ICBL has mobilized and empowered millions of citizens
worldwide with unprecedented speed and effectiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the campaign has become a highly articulate moral and
diplomatic force with the field of international disarmament, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The ICBL has been in operation since 1992 and represents more
than 1,000 non-governmental organizations in over 60 countries.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1996, Canada has worked closely with the group to
help build a coalition of states and non-governmental
organizations that has resulted in an anti-personnel mines ban
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 countries are expected to come here and sign the
treaty in early December.

<HEADLINE> US Wholesale Prices Up Sharply in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. inflation at the
wholesale level increased by a sharp 0.5 percent in September, the
fastest pace this year, the U.S. Labor Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that the gain in its Producer Price Index
(PPI), which measures cost pressures before they reach the
consumer, resulted mainly from big gains in the cost of energy,
new cars and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
The gain, which followed a rise of 0.3 percent in August, was
more than double what investors had been expected.
</P>
<P>
The increase in U.S. wholesale prices last month reflected a
1.5 percent jump in energy prices, the biggest monthly gain since
December.
</P>
<P>
Food prices were up by a small 0.1 percent and reflected price
declines for beef, pork and poultry.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4 percent jump in new car prices was the biggest since
October 1994.
</P>
<P>
But even excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the
so-called core rate of inflation was up 0.4 percent, the worst
showing since November 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices in the U.S. so far this year are still falling
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent because the August and September
gains followed declines of seven straight months, something that
had never occurred since the U.S. government first began measuring
wholesale inflation in 1947.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Alan Greenspan warned this
week that the economy's rapid growth and heavy demand for workers
were unsustainable and inflation continued to be the greatest
threat to ending the current recovery.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that Greenspan's comments represented a change
from his generally optimistic summertime assessment of the current
U.S. economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the U.S. Fed is poised to start
tightening credit further in the coming months. The Fed has left
interest rates unchanged since a small upward nudge in March,

<HEADLINE> France, Germany, Russia to Hold Annual Tripartite Summit </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin announced today in Strasbourg,
France, that they will hold a summit with German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl once a year.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted Chirac as saying that a regular
tripartite summit meeting of France, Germany and Russia will make
up "an important force in Europe and notably a necessary element
for the deepening of peace."
</P>
<P>
Chirac half joked by suggesting the first such summit be held
in Sverdlovsk, now re-named Yekaterinburg in the Ural region of
Russia, which is Yeltsin's hometown.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Yeltsin were attending a meeting of the heads of
state or government of the European Council in the eastern French
city of Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Russia last month, Chirac suggested a
privileged partnership between Russia and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Not Permit Illegally Employ Mozambicans: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government today
warned coffee and tea growers in the eastern highlands that they
risked prosecution should they continue to illegally employ
Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister for Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare
Florence Chitauro said that hundreds of Mozambicans are being
illegally employed as tea and coffee pluckers along Zimbabwe's
eastern border area.
</P>
<P>
''My ministry has not issued any
permit to any farmer to employ foreigners nor did the Home
Affairs Ministry. So i am saying it is illegal for the farmers to
employ a Mozambican without permit,'' Chitauro said.
</P>
<P>
She said illegal employment of foreigners meant that both
farmers and workers contributed nothing to the National Social
Security Scheme.
</P>
<P>
''Our foreign recruitment policy is very clear on this. we
only recruit foreigners in fields where locals do not have the
expertise,'' the minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Top Court Rules in Favor of Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada's advocates for the
disabled were elated with a landmark Supreme Court ruling that
will help remove barriers impeding their full participation in
society.
</P>
<P>
The top court ruled Thursday that the British Columbia
provincial government's refusal to provide sign-language
interpreters violates the constitutional rights of the deaf to
equal benefit of the law guaranteed by the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms.
</P>
<P>
Governments are required by the charter to take reasonable
"positive steps" to ensure that disadvantaged groups are able to
benefit equally from services offered to the general public, the
court said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
They must go further and take "special measures" to get rid of
existing barriers for the disabled, it said.
</P>
<P>
Three people from the west province had sued the government
over the lack of sign-language interpreters for those receiving
medical services.
</P>
<P>
The B.C. government cut its funding for the service in 1990,
saying it would strain limited health care resources and create a
precedent for funding of similar services for the non-English
speaking immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
"It feels like 1989 and the Berlin Wall; the barriers are about
to start coming down," David Allen of the Canadian Hearing Society
was quoted by reports today as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ruling will go beyond the deaf and will affect every
Canadian who has a disability, said David Baker of the Advocacy
Resource Center for the Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
"For Canadians with disabilities, this is unquestionably the
most important case ever," Baker said.
</P>
<P>
"I think people in Canada can expect to see more disabled
people in schools, throughout the health care system and in
employment," he added.

BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- German Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt said today that most German companies are not prepared for
the shift to the single European currency, the Euro, which is due

<P>
Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps
to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the
country's state institutions were also not well prepared.
</P>
<P>
As a result, they possibly wouldn't be able to do transactions

HARARE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Rising cases of child sexual
abuse, neglect and poverty are exposing a lot of Zimbabwean
children to mental health problems, Zimbabwe's first lady Grace
Mugabe said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the commemoration of World Mental Health Day in
Harare, Mugabe said mental health problems of children and
adolescents in the country are real and very painful.
</P>
<P>
"The government has recognized the impact of mental health
problems of children in the country, especially with the upsurge
in sexual abuse and rise in numbers of street children," she
said.
</P>
<P>
This year's World Mental Health Day is commemorated under the
theme "children and mental health".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said policies needed to be formulated to address the
problems of street children to protect them from malnutrition,
sexual abuse and violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local psychiatrist Fidglis Chikara said the mental
health provided in the country is inadequate as there are only 11
psychiatrists for the country's 12 million people.

<P>
BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan national suspected of a
link with the 1986 deadly bombing of a Berlin discotheque today
was extradited to Germany six weeks after being arrested in Italy,
local press reported here.
</P>
<P>
Musbah Eter, 40, fleeing Berlin last July after a warrant for
his arrest was issued, is accused of building the explosive device
which blew up on April 5, 1986 at the LaBella discotheque
frequented by U.S. soldiers, killing three people and injuring 260
others.
</P>
<P>
He will stand trial in Berlin on November 18 on charge of
involvement in the attack, along with three other defendants --
Palestinian Yassir Chraidi, Ali Chanaa, a German national, and his
ex-wife Verena, who are all on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan secret service was said to have plotted the 1986
attack in the discotheque, which was mainly visited by
U.S. soldiers stationed in west Berlin. But the Libyan government
has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
In revenge, Washington ordered air strikes against the Libyan
cities of Tripoli and Benghazi in which dozens of people were
killed.

</P>
<P>
Brundtland who paid a courtesy call on Zimbabwean President

issue, real challenges lay in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The real challenges lie in Africa, especially in the fight
against malaria which kills an average of two million people
every year, not to add the problem of AIDS which is more
prevalent. There is need for more primary health care in Africa
followed by maybe Asia than anywhere else in the world," said
Brundtland.
</P>
<P>
She said if appointed, she will base her leadership on the
firm belief that a healthy and well-educated population is every
country's greatest resource.

Brundtland also commended WHO Regional Director for Africa

African Unity as a candidate, for having done well enough to
command respect in Africa.

BONN, October 10 (Xinhua) -- German parliament today approved a
bill to reduce state retirement pensions from the present 70 percent
of average net wages to 64 percent in stages during the period from
the year 2015 to 2030.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament,
was opposed by main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), which, holding
a majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat, was however unable to
block the reform.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government intends to keep the monthly
pension fund payments at its current level of 20.3 percent of wages or
salaries, but contributions would rise to 20.8 percent next year
unless being further subsidized by the government.
</P>
<P>
The government considers raising value added tax (VAT) to 16
percent from the current level of 15 percent to boost revenue and
avert an increase in pension contributions. SPD has vowed to use its
majority in the Bundesrat to block the plan.

Chinese goalkeeper Ou Chuliang then made several brilliant
saves including the one he palmed out a close shot by unmarked
Esam M. Sakeen.

At the 25th minute, Jassem M. Houwaidi netted his third goal in
his fourth match, putting the score at one-all.

<HEADLINE> Chirac to Visit Ukraine in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
will pay a state visit to Ukraine next year, probably in summer,
announced a French presidential spokesperson today in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma were attending the
second summit of heads of state or government of the 40-member
Council of Europe, which is Europe's largest forum, held today in
the eastern French city.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed the joint development of the Antonov
transport planes by Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany, according
to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Chirac called on Ukraine to continue its structural reforms,
and to adopt "transparent and stable legislation in the field of
investment and tax," said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The French president also asked Ukraine to make sure that the
Chernobyl nuclear reaction center, whose reactor exploded in 1986,
be closed before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Jacques de Larosiere, had
promised him to respect the commitment of the bank in helping
Ukraine strengthen the sarcophagus around the nuclear center.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma complained that the EBRD is too slow in realizing its
engagements for Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations has
agreed to donate 300 million US dollars in reinforcing the
sarcophagus around the Chernobyl reaction center via the EBRD.

<HEADLINE> Ireland to Welcome Likely "Bloody Sunday" Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has
indicated that it would welcome an apology from the British
government on the so-called "Bloody Sunday" incident in which 14
unarmed Catholic nationalists were killed.
</P>
<P>
Senior British government sources were quoted by today's Times
newspaper as saying that Britain would set up an independent
review to examine fresh evidence on the incident, paving the way
for a formal apology.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the press report, Ireland's new Foreign Minister
David Andrews said that the Irish government would be delighted at
such a positive response.
</P>
<P>
"I do think an apology would be welcome and I think it would be
helpful in the (Northern Ireland) peace process," he told the BBC
Radio.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Dublin government gave Britain's Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam some new evidence about the incident,
largely based on two television documentaries and a book
containing eyewitness accounts.
</P>
<P>
On "Bloody Sunday" -- January 30, 1972, British paratroopers
shot dead 14 Catholic men during a civil rights demonstration in
Londondery, Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rules Out Replacement for Britannia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson announced today that Britain's world-famous Royal Yacht
Britannia will not be refitted; nor will she be replaced after
being decommissioned in December.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said in a statement which ended months of controversy
about the yacht's future that the government is looking at options
for Britannia's future, including turning it into a heritage
center, floating museum or corporate hospitality center.
</P>
<P>
The yacht, once a potent symbol of the British Empire, will
begin a final round-Britain voyage from Portsmouth on October 20.
</P>
<P>
The Queen and many other members of the royal family will board
the yacht for the final leg of her tour from London to Portsmouth
where the decommissioning ceremony will be held on December 11.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement
last week that it was "very difficult" to justify spending
millions of pounds of public money on a new yacht.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the decision was backed by the royal
family which is anxious to avoid any accusations of extravagance.
</P>
<P>
The 44-year-old Britannia has circumnavigated the globe eight
times and taken the royal family on almost 700 overseas visits.

<HEADLINE> French PM Announces Plan for 35-Hour Working Week Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin announced today that he will present a draft law on
reducing legal working week time to 35 hours as of January 1,
2000, for all companies with more than 10 workers in France.
</P>
<P>
The government will also offer companies 9,000 francs (1,500 US
dollars) for employing one worker in 1998, while reducing working
week time by at least 10 percent and increasing the number of
staff by at least 6 percent, said Jospin.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement at the end of a job conference held in
his office building today and attended by representatives of
entrepreneurs, trade union leaders and government officials.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the reduction of working time depends on a
controlled increase of jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
To cut working week time to 35 hours is part of the major
legislative campaign promises made by Jospin before he and his
Socialist Party obtained power by beating the central-right
coalition in the early legislative elections held in May and June.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Calls for an End to Teachers' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today directed government officials to immediately meet with
the Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) in order to seek a
solution to the teachers' salary dispute.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally marking this year's Moi Day, the
president asked Head of the Public Service Fares Kuindwa and
other officials to report to him the results of their talks with
KNUT within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
In view of the new development of the on-going teachers strike
which started on October 1, the president directed that the
dispute be withdrawn immediately from the Industrial Court.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that his government has always been concerned about
the welfare of the public servants and wishes the salary dispute
to be "resolved amicably" and a return-to-work-formula found.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, a meeting between the government and the KNUT
reached a deadlock, with the teachers' union vowing to continue
with the strike until the government meets its demands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho ordered all
striking teachers to report to their schools by 8 a.m. on October
8.
</P>
<P>
As the teachers union vowed to ignore the education minister's
ultimatum, the Kenyan government referred the salary dispute back
to the Industrial Court on October 7.
</P>
<P>
The teachers are demanding a salary increase ranging between
150 and 200 percent for the 240,000 primary and secondary school
teachers in the country, but the government agreed to a 10-28
percent increase and allowance increment of between 15 and 100
percent.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Labour Minister Philip Masinde said that the government
can not meet the demands by the teachers' union, noting that
higher salaries will amount to about 1.4 billion U.S. Dollars a
year, or 56 percent of the total government revenue.

<HEADLINE> Tories Will "Conquer" Labor at Next Election: Hague </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Opposition leader William Hague
condemned the "cynicism" of Labor today by saying that the Tories
are the "only party of principle."
</P>
<P>
In his first party conference speech as party leader, Hague
said Labor's "policies without conscience" would "ultimately breed
contempt."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tories had to rediscover its tolerant, caring
heart and embark on "a process of reform and renewal" that would
prepare for a return to power at the next election.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader also made a public apology for former
Prime Minister Margret Thatcher's decision to take Britain into
the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry we did it," he told the conference which ended
today. "We should have the courage and the confidence to say so.
It did enormous damage to the credibility of our party and we paid
the price."
</P>
<P>
It was in 1990 that the former prime minister took the pound
into the ERM with Hague's predecessor John Major as her
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
In September 1992, it was Major, then as prime minister, who
desperately tried to defend the pound, raising interest rates to
15 percent, before Britain was finally ejected from the ERM.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Hague's penance was deliberately
designed to help the party to cleanse its past failures and move
on.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Kuwait 2-1 in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT, October 10 (Xinhua) -- China beat Kuwait 2-1 in the
dying minutes at a crucial game of the Asian World Cup soccer
qualifying tournament here Friday night.
</P>
<P>
With just two minutes left, Chinese forward Gao Feng dribbled
into the penalty box and left-footed the ball into the net for the
winner.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Qi Wusheng fielded Gao, known for speed and
calmness, with 17 minutes left in the second half as Kuwaiti
players looked jaded.
</P>
<P>
China, which had snatched three wins and one draw in their
previous seven encounters with Kuwait, opened the scoring through
its top striker Hao Haidong three minutes into action.
</P>
<P>
Hao, who has been troubled by a fever, blasted the ball into
the left corner of the net with a turnaround shot after connecting
a pass at the top of the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Chinese goalkeeper Ou Chuliang then made several brilliant
saves including the one he palmed out a close shot by unmarked
Esam M. Sakeen.
</P>
<P>
At the 25th minute, Jassem M. Houwaidi netted his third goal in
his fourth match, putting the score at one-all.
</P>
<P>
Houwaidi lobbed the ball into an open net as Ou ran out in a
desperate attempt to dispossess the Kuwaiti top striker.
</P>
<P>
China now places second in the five-team group A in which the
winner goes to the French finals and the second-finisher vies for
a berth with Group B runner-up.
</P>
<P>
The loser in the clash of the runner-ups fight for a remaining
spot with Australia.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has posted two wins and as many draws, topped the
group with eight points, just one point over China which recorded
two wins, one draw and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, which will plays its fourth game against Qatar on
Saturday, placed third with four points. Kuwait fell to fourth
with four points.
</P>
<P>
Qatar, which has only won one point from a draw with China, was
last.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 10 (Xinhua) -- South African mining
giants, Gencor and Gold Fields, are planning to merge their gold
operations in a bid to take the lead in global gold mining
industry, the South African Press Association SAPA said today.
</P>
<P>
The two groups intended to combine their gold operating
companies, exploration assets and mineral rights into Goldco, a
focused and autonomous gold mining group, SAPA quoted
unidentified senior officials of the groups as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The deal would link three of the world's premier mining
operations, Driefontein, Kloof and Beatrix, and would boast
output of more than four million ounces of gold per year.
</P>
<P>
The new company would have total minerable reserves of
approximately 120-million ounces, making it the largest gold
group in terms of equity accounted reserves.
</P>
<P>
Gencor Chairman Brian Gilbertson has initially been appointed
chairman of Goldco, and will take up a non-executive position of
joint deputy chairman of Gold Fileds, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Gilbertson said the merger would create one of the largest and
the most exciting gold companies in the world.

<HEADLINE> China Ratifies Protocols on Africa's Being </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Jiang
Zhengyun today handed the "Instrument of Ratification" on two
protocols to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty to OAU
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
The "Instrument of Ratification" was signed by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
It said, "in accordance with the decision made by the standing
committee of the eighth National People's Congress at its 26th
session", the Chinese President "ratifies protocol I and protocol
II to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty signed by Mr.
Li Zhaoxing, representative of the government of the People's
Republic of China in Cairo on April 11, 1996."
</P>
<P>
"The People's Republic of China enforces the full observance
of all enshrined in the afore-mentioned protocols," it added.
</P>
<P>
Upon receiving the "Instrument of Ratification", Salim
expressed his welcome and appreciation to China's ratification of
the two protocols, saying this demonstrated the commitment of the
Chinese government's support for the initiatives of Africa and
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
It also indicated China's desire to further develop the
friendly cooperation relations with Africa and the OAU, he added.
</P>
<P>
Salim pointed out that the declaration of the African Nuclear-
Weapon-Free-Zone is a contribution to the elimination of the
nuclear threat and China's support is very important for
realizing this goal.
</P>
<P>
Salim asked the Chinese ambassador to convey his appreciation
to Jiang and the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty was adopted by the
62nd ordinary session of the OAU council of ministers and
endorsed by the 31st session of the assembly of heads of state
and government in June, 1995.

<HEADLINE> Jody Williams Wins 1997 Nobel Peace Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Jody Williams, the
coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, has
been awarded the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to
eradicate antipersonnel landmines, said a press release issued
today by the spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
Judy Williams, 47, began working for the Vietnam Veterans of
American Foundation at the end of 1991 to bring together a
coalition to ban international landmines. From two organizations,
the coalition has grown to more than 1,000 non-governmental
organizations in over 60 countries working together as the
International Campaign to Ban Landmines.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Williams has spoken extensively all over the globe on the
issue of the landmines crisis and its only solution: an
international treaty to ban the weapon. She has also written
extensively about the issue on the socio-economic impact of the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
Upon graduation from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies, she coordinated the Nicaragua-Honduras
education project which organized and led fact-finding delegations
of US opinion makers to Central America.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Ms. Williams, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan conveyed his congratulations to her
by saying that it was a really well-deserved honor and it also
showed that the world had come together, civil societies and
non-governmental organizations had come together and worked with
governments.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the world had achieved a major achievement which was
a victory for every child and mother and all vulnerable societies
in these conflicts areas who had been killed or maimed by these
silent weapons. He urged all governments to sign the landmines on
banning landmines in Ottawa in December.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria in Fresh Row with Britain over Visa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- While the row over a bilateral
air traffic ban remains unsolved between Nigeria and Britain, a
new dispute on visa issues has emerged to accentuate the already
frosty relations.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has condemned as "unjustified and unacceptable" the
practice of stamping, marking or annotating the passport of
rejected visa applicants by the British High Commission, and
urged the commission to discontinue the practice.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, British High
Commissioner Graham Burton was summoned from Lagos to the
foreign ministry in the capital Abuja on Wednesday to hear the
complaints.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi told Burton that the British
Embassy should also refund the visa fees collected from
unsuccessful applicants since June this year and forward to the
ministry the inventory of all visa applications from the same
month.
</P>
<P>
The issue was first raised by Jibrin Chinade, director-general
of the ministry, in June this year when he accused the British
and United States embassies of treating Nigerian visa applicants
with disrespect.
</P>
<P>
He described the 75 percent visa rejection as "extremely high"
and contended that the mutilation not only contradicted the
practice by Nigerian embassies, but stigmatized such applicants
and jeopardized their chances in other embassies.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinade, foreign embassies in Nigeria earned
about three billion Naira (about 36 million U.S. Dollars) from
visa fees last year.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent reaction to Nigeria's demand for refunding visa
fees to unsuccessful applicants, the British embassy said on
Thursday it was the policy of the country to recover the full
cost of processing visas all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The British side explained that the fee was used to meet
administrative costs incurred in processing the application,
whether or not a visa was issued.
</P>
<P>
The British embassy said in a statement that its offices in
Lagos and Abuja "process between 100 and 400 new visa
applications each day, depending on the time of the year".
</P>
<P>
Last year, 83 percent of applicants received visas and 61
percent of all applicants were issued visa within 24 hours, it
said, adding, "monthly statistics give no reason to believe that
those percentages will be significantly different for the current
year."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Nigeria and Britain became cold in 1993
when a presidential election was annulled on charges of
malpractice. It got to the bottom following the military
government executed nine minority activists two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Britain was in the forefront of demanding the suspension of
Nigeria's Commonwealth membership at that time.
</P>
<P>
While no soft-pedaling was witnessed in the new British
government's policy toward Nigeria as speculated, aviation
authorities of the country ordered a ban last May on all
Nigeria-registered aircraft to enter its airspace.
</P>
<P>
The action met an immediate retaliation when Nigeria announced
a similar ban the following day.
</P>
<P>
With the British Airways suffering an estimated loss of more
than 80 million U.S. Dollars for ticket revenue alone since the
impasse, Britain held out the olive branch and lifted the ban in
August.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian aviation authorities, however, have kept silence
and the impasse still remains.
</P>
<P>
To date, there is no sign in sight as for when and how the
rift between the two countries could be closed.

<HEADLINE> Israel Agrees to Stop Using Canadian Passports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada said today that Israel
has agreed to stop using Canadian passports in covert operations.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy told
parliament that he got the assurance from his Israeli counterpart,
David Levy.
</P>
<P>
In a diplomatic letter received today, Levy apologized "for the
fact that any misuse of our passports may have caused
inconvenience or any problems of safety for any Canadian citizen,"
Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
"Israel will now undertake measures to ensure it never happens
again," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Canada recalled its ambassador to Israel to protest the use of
forged Canadian passports by two Israeli agents, who carried out
an attack in Jordan on Khaled Meshal, political chief of the
militant Islamic group Hamas, on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the letter was sent here in a bid to calm Canada's
outrage over the passport incident.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy to Grow 3.5 Pct in 1997: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Bank of Canada
predicted today that the Canadian economy will grow 3.5 percent
this year and 3.3 percent next year, ahead of other industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank, the largest commercial one in Canada, made the
forecast in a media briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Canada's growth this year will continue to be led by
construction and manufacturing, according to John McCallum, chief
economist of the bank.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, exports of vehicles, metals, electrical and
electronic products will remain healthy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The low interest rates, an improving job market and rising
consumer confidence will continue to have positive impacts on the
economy, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, an Ottawa-based economic think-tank, the
Conference Board of Canada, predicted a 3.4-percent growth for the
country's economy this year and 3.1 percent next year.

<HEADLINE> More Fighting in S. Leone Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- There were reports of more
fightings today just outside the Sierra Leonean capital of
Freetown, the British Broadcasting Corporation said.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the fightings was on a Nigerian-held army base in
a suburban town with reports of shellings and casualty, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
No casualty figures were released however.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Nigerian-led west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG) bombed the military headquarters of the junta,
which seized power in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG statement also said the force destroyed one of the
junta's helicopter gunship to retaliate the attack on ECOMOG
positions by the junta.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is carrying out the mission of enforcing embargo
ordered by west African leaders as a means to force the junta to
hand over power to the legitimate government it overthrew.
</P>
<P>
In what appeared as a retaliatory action, soldiers loyal to
the junta burned down the personal house of ousted President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in Freetown on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But the junta reportedly denied the burning, saying the damage
was done by Sierra Leonean youths opposed to the deposed
president, who has stayed in neighboring Guinea since the coup.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the Nigeria Television Authority
tonight, the junta has sought dialogue with President Kabbah on
the stand that "the situation in the country is strictly
internal".
</P>
<P>
So far no reply has been heard from President Kabbah, who just
return from New York where he addressed the United Nations
Assembly to seek support of the international community for
restoring democracy in his country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a resolution on Wednesday on
oil, weapon and travel sanctions against Sierra Leone, which is
seen as the strongest backing Kabbah has received at the moment.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah arrived in Nigeria Wednesday night and is
expected to take part in the meeting of the west African
Committee of Five on the crisis of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled for the Nigerian capital of Freetown
today and expected to discuss the new situation arising from the
U.N. sanctions. But no report of it has been available at press
time.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, Guinea, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia are members
of the committee set up at the order of the authority of the
Economic Community of West African States in the wake of the
coup.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Media Campaign Against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Saturday a 195-million-dollar advertising campaign
warning young people about the risks of drug use.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to launch an unprecedented high profile
prime-time media campaign to reach every child in America between
the ages of 9 and 17 at least four times a week, Clinton said in
his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
"Teaching our children about the dangers of drugs today can
mean saving their lives and our shared future tomorrow," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"Although overall drug use has declined dramatically, drug use
by our young people has doubled. Among eighth graders, typically
13 and 14 years old, drug use has nearly tripled, " Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
While illegal drug use by young people has risen, the number of
anti-drug public service ads has fallen by more than a third, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the entertainment industry never to glorify
drugs, but, more important, and show children that drug use is
really a death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Launches Information Technology Awareness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today launched a national information technology
(IT) awareness campaign, saying his government adopted IT as the
nation's number one priority.
</P>
<P>
"Through placing IT at the center stage of our socio-economic
development and planning, we are in fact attempting to adjust to a
new age," he said in his nationwide address tonight on radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described IT as the base of a new revolution of global
magnitude now in process, "accelerating the process of
globalization, reshaping our economy, and affecting our work and
life at a speed never seen before".
</P>
<P>
He said "To provide us the direction and the way forward with
IT, we have developed the National IT Agenda, or NITA, which
provides the framework for a national response to IT and to the
information revolution."
</P>
<P>
The NITA focuses on three elements crucial to the evolution of
the noble society: people development, info-structure (both hard
and soft infrastructure) development, and applications
development.
</P>
<P>
The NITA calls upon all Malaysians to do his or her part in
making sure that Malaysia is ready to enter the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of the NITA is to evolve a civil society in
the Malaysian mold, a society that is empowered by knowledge and
infused with its own distinctive value-system.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "It is the knowledge-rich and value-creating
society that will boost our national productivity to higher levels
and ensure our economical survival. It is also this society that
will become mature, liberal, democratic, tolerant, caring and
economically just."
</P>
<P>
He said "our future economic competitiveness will depend upon
our willingness to harness IT and become knowledge workers.
Through the use of information and knowledge we can increase not
only our productivity, but also the quality of our products and
services as well."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was of the view that only when both manufacturing and
service sectors are manned by knowledge workers and powered by IT
can Malaysia expect to sustain the required per capita GDP growth
rates that will enable the country to attain Vision 2020, that is
a goal to be a developed nation by the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
"With our future at stake we cannot afford to be a mere
spectator of the information revolution. We need to be a part of
it; we need to lead it even. This is why we are spending so much
time and effort to grow a local IT industry that is world-class.
This is also why, despite the recent currency crisis, the
MSC(Multimedia Super Corridor) projects will proceed as planned,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The MSC project which embodies the three elements of NITA is a
program to bring together the world's best IT and multimedia
companies into Malaysia to help it create and develop applications
that are culturally compatible with the various cultures of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "Malaysia is in a good position to take advantage
of IT. We have 25 years of experience in developing a formidable
electrical and electronics industry. We have a well-educated and
trainable work force and our IT infrastructure is relatively
well-developed. No doubt there is more to be done before we can
take full advantage of IT, but these are all positive factors that
can propel the country towards a new trajectory of growth."
</P>
<P>
He said that a nation must always think about tomorrow. It is
in thinking about tomorrow that Malaysia has decided to harness
the power of IT, committing his government to an active role in
pursuing this endeavor by not only providing the necessary
top-down leadership to promote IT development, but also
orchestrating a societal push for it.
</P>
<P>
Urging Malaysians to support the nation's initiative in
harnessing IT, the president said "Let us resolve to face the
globalized world together. Let us strive to realize all that we
wish for and not wait for it to happen."

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Send Agricultural Experts to Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will dispatch its
agricultural experts to a number of developing countries to shore
up south-south cooperation on fighting hunger and securing food,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said today.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hage, information officer of FAO's Cairo-based Near
East Office, made the remarks following a series of meetings FAO
Director-General Jacques Diouf held today with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Minister of
Agriculture Youssef Wali.
</P>
<P>
Diouf will leave Egypt for Turkey today, wrapping up a
three-day visit, to attend the International Forest Conference,
due to start in Ankara Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moussa and Diouf discussed the dispatch of Egyptian
agricultural experts to Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan within the
framework of the food security and cooperation program among the
countries of the south, Hage said.
</P>
<P>
They also tackled the possibility of Egypt's cooperation with
the FAO, through the Egyptian Fund for Technical Cooperation in
Africa, to help Tanzania implement a major project on food
security, he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters following his meeting with Mubarak, Diouf
played up the potentials for Egypt to increase its agricultural
land and expand cooperation with other developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke of the importance of preventing the use of food
as a pressure card in international politics.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, during the meeting, called for furthering efforts to
lessen the number of the hunger-stricken people around the globe,
put at 800 million, said the FAO chief.
</P>
<P>
Diouf said his meeting with Mubarak covered ways of realizing
the aim of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015, a
commitment pledged by 186 countries at the 1996 World Food
Summit, and FAO's relevant strategy.
</P>
<P>
Under a special program for food security, the FAO is helping
the low-income food-deficit countries, faced with food
shortfalls, limited funds to finance imports and declining food
aid, to increase food production and productivity quickly.

<HEADLINE> Over 200 Land Law Protesters Arrested in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 farmers have been
arrested since October 1 when a controversial land law took effect
in Egypt, according to a report of the Land Center for Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
Since then, two people have been killed and dozens injured in
the northern Delta in a wave of violence over the landmark law
that reforms the tenant-landowner relationship, Middle East Times
in its latest edition quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
One tenant farmer was shot dead by a landowner who tried to
evict him from his land and a 14-year-old girl was killed during a
battle between the families of a landowner and his tenant,
according to the Land Center.
</P>
<P>
A third man died of "physical shock" caused by his landlord's
refusal to renew his tenancy, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Since June, tension in rural Egypt has been mounting and there
have been violent clashes and sporadic arrests of both tenant
farmers and peasant advocates in 10 governorates over the
prospects that landlords are able to raise rents or evict tenants.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was passed in 1992 with a five-year grace
period, completely does away with land rent controls that have
been in place since the 1952 revolution.
</P>
<P>
The law ordains that between 1992 and October 1 1997,
rents be increased to 22 times the amount of tax paid by the
landowner, leaving it up to the owner and tenant to agree on new
rents after that.
</P>
<P>
From 1952 to 1992, land rents were locked at seven times the
land tax, which averaged 30 to 35 pounds (about 9 to 11
U.S. dollars) annually per feddan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 people are reportedly to have been killed, more
than 300 wounded and nearly 1,000 detained since protests against
the law began in January.
</P>
<P>
Most incidents of violence and clashes with the police took
place in early July, when tenant farmers tried to burn down the
local offices of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of unrest after the law came into effect,
Egyptian security services have deployed reinforcements throughout
villages in Upper Egypt, according to local newspapers.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Electoral Body Solicits Views on Constituency Delimitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Affairs
Commission of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
today called on all the local citizens to voice their opinions as
soon as possible over its recommendations on the geographical
delineation of constituencies for the forthcoming legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference to launch a two-week public
consultation on the recommendations, the commission's chairman,
Justice Woo Kwok-Hing, stated that the deadline was set for
October 24. It means all the SAR citizens should put forward their
views by the fixed day.
</P>
<P>
To run concrete affairs related to the elections of the first
SAR Legislative Council scheduled for May 1998, the three-member
commission was established on September 29. Its two other members
are Norman Leung Nai-pang, deputy-chairman of the City Bus Group
Limited, and Elizabeth SC Shing, director general of the Hong Kong
Management Association.
</P>
<P>
Woo told reporters that his commission would take into account
the public views expressed when compiling its final
recommendations. "The final recommendations are expected to be
submitted to Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa by the statutory
deadline on October 31, 1997," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the five legislative Council Constituency
Areas proposed by the commission, namely Hong Kong Island, Kowloon
West, Kowloon East, "New Territories" West and "New Territories"
East, were formed by appropriate grouping of the 346 District
Board Constituency Areas.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that in deciding on the electoral boundaries, the
commission has maintained its apolitical stance.
</P>
<P>
"Matters relating to maintaining political influence or
advantage are not only irrelevant considerations for the
commission, but the commission should avoid even giving any
semblance of favoring any one politician or political party as
against others," Woo said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to come forward and make known their views,
whether supportive or dissenting. But they should state their
opinions with full reason, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Feelings Vary in Cost Estimates of NATO Enlargement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Feelings were mixed when NATO
parliamentarians today started figuring out the discrepancies
among various enlargement cost estimates.
</P>
<P>
For politicians and economists, the lower price tag, which has
been forecast to last at least 12 years, was good news, while
defense industrialists preferred a higher price.
</P>
<P>
When the U.S. Congressional Budget Office first published its
estimate in March 1996, its prediction of 60.6--125 billion U.S.
dollars immediately became a target of sharp criticism from
politicians and economists.
</P>
<P>
Those who shared the high-cost view, especially some American
analysts, argued that a large sum of money has to be spent in
improving the interoperability and facilities of new members,
modernizing new member forces, equipping and training old NATO
allies to ensure their commitment to protect new members from
attack and accommodating new members in NATO headquarters in
Brussels and NATO command facilities elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department, however, reported its much lower
estimate to the Congress earlier this year, lowering the expansion
cost to between 27 billion and 35 billion dollars between now and
the year of 2009.
</P>
<P>
Those who supported the less-cost projection explained that the
money is better concentrated on enhancing compatibility and
interoperability in command systems, telecommunications and air
defense systems.
</P>
<P>
Poland, which had a similar projection, said that the inclusion
of this central European country into the North Atlantic alliance
would cost no more than 1.26 billion dollars in a 15-year period,
or 84 million dollars per year, an equivalent of 3.3 percent of
the country's 1995 defense budget.
</P>
<P>
Yet one often-overlooked impetus to NATO enlargement is that it
will automatically expand markets for defense industry giants like
Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed-Martin Marietta.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic that were invited to
join the military alliance last July are reportedly evaluating
such jet fighters as Saab AB's JAS 39 Gripen, Dassault's Mirage,
Lockheed-Martin's F-16 and McDonnel Douglas Corp.'s F-18.
</P>
<P>
One report said orders for aircrafts from those countries in
August could generate 10 billion dollars of business for Western
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
But the three invitees may hope that a new round of
conventional arms control in central and eastern Europe can help
reduce the financial burdens on them and prospective new members.
</P>
<P>
Harry Cohen, chief speaker of today's discussion on economic
affairs at the North Atlantic Assembly annual session, said that
the problem in cost estimation lied in the fact that both analysts
and pundits have bandied about divergent estimates.
</P>
<P>
"A principal source of this confusion is that cost estimates
are assumption driven," said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"The assumptions include: estimates of the nature and degree of
risk; the requisite degree of assurance the alliance needs to
provide new members; the time frame for achieving this assurance;
the adequacy of current capabilities and procurement policies; the
impact of strategic adjustments undertaken by NATO countries prior
to expansion; and the political and economic acceptability of the
resulting military requirements." he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that new studies would emerge to be less hypothetical
and more rooted in the commitments that are actually being
undertaken as the details of accession negotiations become known.
</P>
<P>
NATO is conducting its own cost study and is expected to
present a report in mid-November in preparation for the
decision-making meeting of NATO defense ministers in December.
</P>
<P>
Large or small, it's not easy to reach a consensus over
enlargement cost in the west, where taxpayers are likely to be
reluctant to support additional military spending in the post-Cold
War era.

<HEADLINE> Kiefer, Gustafsson Advance to Singapore Open Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Nicolas Kiefer rallied to a
6-7 (1-7), 6-3, 6-3 win over Swede Mikael Tillstrom on Saturday in
the Singapore Open tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The German will face Swede Magnus Gustafsson in Sunday's final.
</P>
<P>
Eight-seeded Kiefer sprained his right wrist late in the first
set and then lose the ensuing tiebreak 1-7 easily.
</P>
<P>
But Kiefer, who won his first ATP tour title in Toulouse two
weeks ago, overcame the pain to break Tillstrom's service twice in
the second set to draw level. His 14 aces helped him en route to
the victory.
</P>
<P>
But the wrist injury was serious enough to force the Germen and
his partner Alex Radulescu to quit their doubles semifinal against
Americans Jonathan Stark and Rick Leach, who received a walkover.
</P>
<P>
Stark and Leach will face the winners of the second semifinal
between Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes of India and Tillstrom
and his compatriot Niklas Kulti.
</P>
<P>
Tillstrom's compatriot Gustafsson, who lost to Jim Courier in
the China Open last week, tried to rebuild a career interrupted by
injury. He norrowly beat another Swede Thomas Johansson 7-6 (7-5),
4-6, 7-6 (10-8) to snatch the final berth.

ADDIS ABABA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The general assembly of
the All Africa Conference of Churches (AACC) wound-up here Friday
with a call to member churches to rise to the challenges of the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted at the end of the seventh general
assembly of the AACC urged member churches to renew their
commitment to the political, social and economic transformation
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The resolution noted that the political commitment will help
use reconciliation mechanisms to prevent, manage and resolve the
wounds and to restore harmony for peaceful co-existence in
African societies.
</P>
<P>
It said that to achieve the goal, strong campaigns are needed

will equip and strengthen people, especially children, youth and
women, it added.
</P>
<P>
Embarking on investments that are morally acceptable in order

<HEADLINE> Russia, Greece Warn Against Turkey on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Greece have warned
Turkey with war in case that Turkey attacks Russian or Greek ships
carrying Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russia's warning was issued by Russian ambassador to Nicosia
Georgi Muradov, who in a televised interview Friday night said his
country would consider a "casus belli" any Turkish attack on
Russian ships carrying the anti-aircraft missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Muradov's statement in Athens, Greek Government
Spokesman Demetris Reppas said that Greece would adopt the same
stand if a Greek ship is attacked by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat told the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation
Television that his country would honor the contract it signed
with Cyprus for the sale of S-300 missile systems to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said the missiles would come to Cyprus unless there was an
agreement on the island's complete demilitarization between the
two Cypriot communities or progress was reached in the Cyprus
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Muradov's statements were welcomed today by some local
newspapers. Greek daily Alithia described Muradov's statement as
a "political leverage."
</P>
<P>
Another daily newspaper Phileleptheros said that the Russian
stand could not be ignored as this affects developments in the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government signed a contract with Russian
manufacturers earlier this year for the purchase of S-300
surface-to-air missiles expected to be deployed in Cyprus in
mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted strongly to the missile deal, threatening a
preemptive strike to prevent the missiles' deployment in Cyprus,
fearing that the military balance in the area would change.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Turkish authorities searched some ships
travelling through the Bosporus Straits, suspecting they carry
components of the Russian missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000 troops in northern part of the
island, which was unilaterally declared by Turkish Cypriots as
a breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Hold Demonstration in Ramallah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A large demonstration was held
today in the West bank city of Ramallah in protest against the
Israeli prevention of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 Palestinians participated in the demonstration at
the main Manara Square of Ramallah, which was organized by
the Fatah Youth Organization, a reliable Palestinian source said.
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration which lasted about two hours, the
organizers strongly criticized Israel for preventing the
Palestinian people to establish an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators also criticized Israel for its continuous
occupation of the Palestinian territories, and urged Israel to
end its closure as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed total closures on Palestinian territories early
August following the bombing blasts in Jerusalem and the closure
has been strengthened since another bombing incident in Jerusalem
early September.
</P>
<P>
Israel so far refused to lift the total closure despite a
progress by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in fighting
againt terror and the improvement of security cooperation between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The same source told Xinhua that, someone tried to throw
molotov cocktails to a Jewish settler compound in Hebron, another
West Bank city about 50 kilometers south of Jerusalem, today, but
caused no damage to the compound and no one was injured.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police and troops rushed to the scene and conducted
questioning of the local residents and some arrests were made,
the source added.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Secretary-General Calls for More Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Secretary-General
Ajit Singh today called for more intensive efforts to prevent
haze, which has affected most ASEAN countries over the past two
months, from getting worse.
</P>
<P>
This matter was on the ASEAN agenda for a considerable time and
a program to this effect which included a decision to seek outside
help was made two years ago when the grouping's environment
ministers met in Kuala Lumpur, Ajit Singh told newsmen in Petaling
Jaya near here today after a briefing on the 29th ASEAN Economic
Ministers (AEM) meeting which is to be held on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general dismissed allegations that ASEAN was not
united in tackling the haze affecting the region, saying the
magnitude of the problem caught the grouping by surprise.
</P>
<P>
"All (of ASEAN) feel the necessity to act because it is a
serious problem affecting the region...the problem has been
recognized and measures to be taken to address it has been agreed
upon," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has sent some 1,200 fire fighters to Indonesia to help
quell raging forest fires that have been blamed for the haze.
</P>
<P>
Ajit said "there was help from others as well" including
technical assistance from Singapore, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has helped Indonesia by sending satellite photographs
to identify problem areas while Australia made available its
aircraft to be used as "water-bombers", he said.
</P>
<P>
The haze has affected Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and parts of
the Philippines and Thailand, all members of ASEAN.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Major Cost Estimates of NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Now that NATO has invited
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to negotiate their
accession to the military bloc, the enlargement cost is for sure
to loom over the coming ratification debates in the parliaments of
NATO member states.
</P>
<P>
Though NATO will not come out with its own estimate of
enlargement cost until mid-November, there were four major
preliminary estimates made by the U.S. Congressional Budget
Office, the independent Rand Corporation, the U.S. administration
and the Polish Euro-Atlantic Association.
</P>
<P>
Following are the cost projections made by the four
institutions:
</P>
<P>
1. In March 1996, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
disclosed the first extensive study on NATO enlargement cost in a
special report. But because the study projected very high costs
ranging from 60.6 billion to 125 billion U.S. dollars, it has
become the target of sharp criticism ever since.
</P>
<P>
The CBO report, which was based on the assumption that Slovakia
would also be invited to join in the first wave, made a lowest
price tag of 60.6 billion dollars, of which new members would pay
42 billion, the United States 4.8 billion and non-U.S. NATO allies
13.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
2. In late 1996, the Rand Corporation published its cost estimate
in the autumn issue of the journal Survival.
</P>
<P>
The Rand Corp. forecast a cost range from 10 billion to 110 billion
dollars over a period of between 10 and 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The California-based thinktank argued that the new members would
have to bear the greatest share of the cost but they would also derive
the greatest benefit.
</P>
<P>
Should NATO allies station forward deploy troops for defending
central and eastern European countries, the price tag would go up
to 110 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
3. In the spring of 1997, the department of defense under the
Bill Clinton administration presented to the U.S. Congress its
cost estimate that turned out to be significantly lower than the
CBO figure.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration estimated that direct enlargement cost
would average 700 million to 900 million dollars annually for a
total of 9 billion to 12 billion dollars spanning the period of
1997 to 2009.
</P>
<P>
It also came out with an itemized cost-sharing scenario that
breaks down to 35 percent paid by the new members, 50 percent by
non-U.S. NATO allies and 15 percent by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The total cost for the first wave of enlargement, according to
the U.S. administration estimate, would average 2.1 billion to 2.7
billion dollars per year or a total of 27 billion to 35 billion
dollars from 1997 to 2009.
</P>
<P>
4. The Polish Euro-Atlantic Association greatly reduced the
American estimates by stating in a report on the consequences of
NATO enlargement that for Poland alone, the enlargement would cost
no more than 1.26 billion dollars in a 15-year period.
</P>
<P>
The figure breaks down to 84 million dollars a year or 3.3
percent of the 1995 Polish defense budget.
</P>
<P>
The Polish estimate was based on the assumption that the money
for enlargement would be spent on such interoperability priorities
as command systems, telecommunications, air defense systems and
integrated air control as well as modernization of airfields.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month at the annual informal meeting of NATO
defense ministers at Maastricht, the Netherlands, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said that the enlargement cost
should not be magnified.
</P>
<P>
"The cost will be perfectly manageable," said the NATO chief at
the Maastricht meeting which highlighted the enlargement cost
together with the issue of the SFOR's future in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
NATO experts are now investigating in the three invitee
countries and they are expected to report their cost estimate to
NATO authorities in mid-November in the run-up to the December
decision-making meeting of defense ministers.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Copper and Aluminium Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China will expand its
nonferrous metals industry, especially oxidized copper and refined
aluminium, with a projected total investment between 1996-2000
expected to hit 45 billion yuan, according to an official of the
State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Chen Dajiang, director of the commission's Nonferrous Metals
Section, said Friday that the country's output of ten major
nonferrous metals in 1996 hit 5.2 million tons, ranking second in
the world next to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Four of China's 1,400 aluminium and copper plants only have a
combined annual production capacity of more than 50,000 tons each,
with most small plants currently operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
The sector will exert greater efforts to avoid redundant
construction in the coming years, and will upgrade its technology
by raising funds from different channels in order to enhance
market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The country will need some five million tons of ten major
nonferrous metals by the end of the century, including 1.3 million
tons of copper and 2.3 million tons of aluminium, according to
Chen.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Promises To Reach Grain Self-Sufficiency in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region
promises to yield over one million tons of grain by the year 2000
so as to become self-sufficient in grain.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels in Tibet will invest five
million yuan (about 603,000 US dollars) each year in grain
production, while local people will contribute labor and money
worth five million yuan, too.
</P>
<P>
That one-yuan input should yield one kilogram of grain is the
goal of the newly mapped out project of grain
self-sufficiency. The project will be first carried out in three
cities and prefectures including Lhasa and Xigaze, where there are
greater potentials and better agro-conditions than other areas in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The three areas are expected to produce 30,000-40,000 tons more
of grain annually at the end of this century. The grain
self-sufficiency project will require them to build irrigation
works, enlarge irrigated lands and improve agro-production
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The three areas will also have surplus grains to sell to other
areas in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The year 1996 is Tibet's ninth harvest year. The total grain
production of Tibet reached 770,000 tons. But it still needs
100,000 tons more in order to guarantee 400 kilograms of grain per
person a year. According to the Tibetan agricultural department,
so far 43 out of the region's 75 counties have not reached the
400-kilogram-grain line. Usually it is the central government that
fills the gap.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) --Five foreign ministers from five
west African states met Friday in Nigerian capital Abuja to
discuss the situation in Sierra Leone, after the U.N. has imposed
sanctions on its military government.
</P>
<P>
A committee of five comprising Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia
and Cote d'Ivoire has been set up by the Economic Community of
the West African States (ECOWAS) to deal with the S. Leonean problem
after the country's former president Ahmed Kabbah was overthrown in
a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the committee commended the U.N. for its
October 8 resolution that approves oil, arms and other sanctions
against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Chief Tom Ikimi said the resolution
is in "close alignment" with the decision of the ECOWAS summit of
heads of state in Abuja over a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi urged the military government led by Major Paul Johnny
Kromah to leave for the re-instatement of elected President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah who was overthrown during the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
Ghanian Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho called for an
examination of the U.N. resolution to harmonize it with that the
ECOWAS, "even though it supports our action on Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS's Acting Executive Secretary, Muhammadou Ohoumoudou,
expressed the hope for an earlier end to the crisis in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we have received endorsement of the international
community on what we are doing in Sierra Leone, let's see how
quickly we can resolve the issue," said Ohoumoudou.

<HEADLINE> Macao Budget for 1998 Expected to Rise 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The 1998 budget of the Macao
government, which is being drafted, is expected to increase five
percent over this year, a report said.
</P>
<P>
The local daily newspaper Correio Sino-Macaense today quoted
government sources as saying that the government expected
budgetary expenditure for 1998, which excludes some departments
responsible for their own expenditures, will increase five percent
over this year.
</P>
<P>
That would translate to about 10.4 billion patacas (about
1.316 billion US dollars) if calculated from this year's final
budget of 9.914 billion patacas (about 1.255 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government is now drafting the new budget and its policy
address for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure initially announced for 1997 was 9.912 billion
patacas (about 1.255 billion US dollars), and then over two
million patacas (about 253,000 US dollars) were added, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
The government spent more than 7.9 billion patacas (about one
billion US dollars) in 1993, and the figure surged to 9.2 billion
patacas (about 1.16 billion US dollars) in 1994, up 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The expenditure rise then slowed down at a one-digit rate up
until 1997, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The amount of government expenditure has been a heated topic
among local media. Some leading Chinese newspapers carried
editorials urging the government to spend less and save some money
for the future Macao Special Administrative Region, which will be
established in December 1999.

BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's new constitution has
come into force tonight after King Bhumibol Adulyadej signed it,
written on a traditional scroll, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, National Assembly
President Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchupan,
Constitution Drafting Assembly Chairman Uthai Pimchaichon and
opposition leader Chuan Leekpai attended the signing ceremony held
at the palace.
</P>
<P>
Parliament President Wan Muhamad Nor Matha contersigned the
charter after it was inked by the king.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution took effect immediately after it is
published in the Royal Gazette after the king's signature.
</P>
<P>
The complicated and controversial constitution has been praised
by the general public as the means to reduce, if not wipe out
completely, money politics, which has characterized Thai political
life for decades.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a great number of people, politicians in particular,
find many clauses in it inappropriate to Thailand, a country ruled
through constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution, approved by the parliament on
October 27 with an overwhelming majority, the House of
Representatives becomes the Upper House, while the Senate becomes
the Lower House: senators, like MPs, will be elected, instead of
through appointment.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will have only 36 members, instead of the current
49.
</P>
<P>
Members of the House of Representatives, once become cabinet
members, i.e., prime minister, ministers or deputy ministers, will
lose their MP status.
</P>
<P>
After the new constitution came into force, three organic laws
governing general elections will be drafted. After their passage,
new general elections will be held in accordance with the new
constitution.

<P>
LAGOS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State General
Sani Abacha said on Friday that he has not yet decided whether or
not to contest the 1998 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"It is something that one has to think about and articulate,"
Abacha told a 20-man delegation of traditional rulers from
Nigeria's nine eastern states, who are pressuring on him to
succeed himself.
</P>
<P>
"I have heard your message, it's a very difficult one. when
you are talking, I couldn't talk. I was just listening, I was
telling my colleagues that I did not expect this sort of thing,
so this is not for me to answer. It's a difficult message,"
Abacha said, quoted by This Day newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The head of state pointed out that quite "a number of us here
have made supreme sacrifice for the sake of this nation. It is
God that keeps Nigerians together".
</P>
<P>
The issue whether or not Abacha should become a civial
president at the end of the three-year transition to civil rule
program next October has been much talked about in and out of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the head of state openly commented on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
Last February, Abacha said in an interview with the Washington
Times it would be decided by his constituency if he should
participate in the forthcoming presidential election.

<HEADLINE> International Conference to Promote Population-Related Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The main theme of the 23rd
IUSSP General Population Conference scheduled to open here Sunday
is to arouse the scientists to make greater efforts in the
research of population science through the exchange of their
achievements and views in this field.
</P>
<P>
John C. Caldwell, President of the International Union
for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP), made the
remark here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that population growth, fertility,
mortality, reproductive health and the aging of population are the
subjects to be discussed during the six-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1928, IUSSP is a prestigious international academic
organization in the field of population studies, and the
four-yearly conference is its most important activity.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that China has been chosen as the venue of
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Caldwell said IUSSP has been very interested in China
since its population accounts for 22 percent of the world's
total, and great changes have taken place in its fertility,
mortality and life expectancy over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a significant number of Chinese members in the
IUSSP, and about 40 percent of the more than 1,300 participants in
the 23rd conference are from China.

<HEADLINE> 10 Percent of Drugs Sold in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- An alarming 10 percent of
pharmaceuticals on pharmacy shelves in South Africa may be
counterfeit, the today's Star newspaper quoted the managing
director of the Pharmaceuticals Manufactures' Association (PMA)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
A counterfeit drug could be a pill or medicine with no active
ingredient and often include talcum powder or sand. Non-sterile
water was sometimes used in drips and is fatal when injected, PMA
Managing Director Mirryena Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
"You get your more sophisticated counterfeiters, who put a
little bit of active ingredient into it, so it will pass a
superficial chemical test," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said counterfeit pharmaceuticals have been uncovered but
she refused to mention the brands for fear of scare in the
market.
</P>
<P>
The report also said state staff are stealing pharmaceuticals
from hospitals and state warehouses, doctors and pharmacists are
selling them.
</P>
<P>
The PMA official warned that criminals repackage toxic drugs
with false expiry dates and some of these available on streets
can kill.
</P>
<P>
In a major hospital in Gauteng province, more than half of the
drugs are believed to be stolen, some of them resold into the
private sector, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
State organizations are the major source of illicit
pharmaceuticals, West Rand South African Narcotics Bureau chief
Lobo das Neves said.
</P>
<P>
Even crime syndicates have infiltrated into the field.
Medicines Control Council (MCC) leader Johan Koch said syndicate
leaders bribe staff of state hospitals,institutions and
pharmacies, and some dispensing doctors are among the buyers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Disappointed over Australia's Allegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today expressed his disappointment over an
allegation by Australia that his government rejected a bid by
Australia's Transfield Defense Systems company for a defense
contract to hit back at the Australian government.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir was commenting on news reports quoting Australian
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer as blaming Australian former
Prime Minister Paul Keating's rift with his Malaysian counterpart
for the loss of the 5.6 billion ringgit (about 1.83 billion U.S.
dollars) contract to build 27 warships for the Royal Malaysian
Navy.
</P>
<P>
Keating caused a major political row between Malaysia and
Australia in 1993 by describing Mahathir as recalcitrant for not
attending the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
"We feel sad by such an allegation, " Mahathir was quoted by
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as telling reporters
after a function in the northeastern states of Terengganu today.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that there was never such an intention (to hit
back) and the question of revenge did not arise and such an
allegation should not have been made.
</P>
<P>
"To say that we did not offer (the contract) to Australia to
hit back is not very nice. Surely we are not expected to offer
everything to Australia," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that Malaysia received proposals from various
parties which were all capable and it was up to the government to
make its choice.
</P>
<P>
Shortlisted for the contract were four companies -- Transfield,
Danish Naval Group, Vosper Thornycraft and the German Naval Group,
a consortium of four German companies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The contract was reported to have been offered to a German
consortium, Bernama said. but according to Mahathir, he had not
yet received any information on the contract.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke will pay his first visit to Turkey since his
appointment to mediate the protracted Cyprus problem, Foreign
Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's visit is aimed at exchanging views with Turkish
leaders over the Cyprus peace talks, local newspaper Daily News
today quoted high-ranking officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. special envoy is coming in the next few days without a
specified agenda and will not carry any official message from
Washington, said the sources who are not identified in the report.
</P>
<P>
They said that Ankara will use this opportunity to express its
position and to learn Washington's views over the reconciliation
process on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a small island state in the eastern Mediterranean, has
been divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled north and Greek
Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which is recognized only by
Turkey, aggravating confrontation between the two rival
communities.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to meet Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem and other Turkish officials in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
After his contacts in Ankara, Holbrooke will fly to Nicosia to
meet Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash. Then he will visit Athens where he will hold
talks with Greek leaders.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash held two rounds of U.N.-sponsored direct
talks in the United States and Switzerland in July and August, but
no agreement was achieved.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Speed up phone Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will spend at least 10
billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 800 million U.S. Dollars) within
the next five years in installing new telephone lines throughout
the country in a move to reduce the long-standing waiting list.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to a three-day conference of the Zimbabwe Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy yesterday, Zimbabwe's Posts and
Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) planing director Tororiro
Chaza said the corporation intends to use a mixture of internally
sourced funds and loans.
</P>
<P>
Chaza stressed the need to extend telephone services to both
urban and outlying areas. He noted that in most successful
economies, an efficient telecommunication service has been
regarded as a factor of production.
</P>
<P>
Economic commentators have also cited Zimbabwe's poor
telecommunication system as one of the major constraints
restricting potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
About 433,000 lines can be installed in the five-year term.
This will improve teledensity (the number of telephones per 100
people) from the current 1.8 to 3.06.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda Asks Mombasa to Serve the Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has urged Kenya's port
of Mombasa to be prepared for the rise of commercial transport,
The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
John Nasasira, Ugandan Minister of Works, Transport and
Communication, said Uganda plans to build roads and a railway
line linking Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of normalizing situation both in Congo and
north-western Uganda, commerce, construction and transport in the
north-western Uganda are booming, according to a recent report
reaching here. The north-western Ugandan region has erected roads
linking eastern Congo and southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar of the Kenya Port Authority (KPA) on
October 9, the minister suggested Mombasa should serve the whole
region.
</P>
<P>
I.J. Mwangola, the managing director of KPA, said on the
occasion that Port Mombasa now put into use only 42 percents of
its transport capacity. He promised to improve its service.
</P>
<P>
With the looming business opportunities in the region, two
regional ports -- Mombasa of Kenya and Dar-es-Salaam of Tanzania,
are competing in local transport market. Both ports established
offices in kampala recently.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: China's Offshore Oil Industry Sets Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- (Editor's Notes: The 15th World
Petroleum Congress is to open in Beijing on October 12. Xinhua
News Agency is expected to release a series of backgrounders to
outline the development of China's oil industry.)
</P>
<P>
China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), China's second
largest oil developer, plans to keep its crude oil production at
14 million tons a year through to the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Also on its planning agenda is to secure two million tons of
crude oil from its overseas ventures.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas production capacity is planned to reach 8.5-10
billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
To this end, CNOOC is to verify 80 million tons of oil in place
and 60 billion cubic meters of natural gas. CNOOC also plans to
bring five oilfields on-stream.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC early last year inaugurated production with US-based
Amoco at Liuhua 11-1, China's largest offshore oilfield whose peak
production capacity is projected at 2.5 million tons annually.

<HEADLINE> Tower of Torch Erected out of Dilemma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- From within the Shanghai
"Barrel" Complex, a sculptural tower of torch was erected up
outside, beckoning in the Eighth National Games in China's most
populous city.
</P>
<P>
The tower of torch, with a historical note at the height of
19.97 meters, was originally supposed to be created within the
bounds of the complex when the designers drew the blueprint for
the newly-built 80,000-capacity complex.
</P>
<P>
Yet, all the constructors looked at each other aghast in April
as to wherein the tower to sit when the caps of fibre glass were
to be tightened to shadow all the seats within the kidney-like
complex.
</P>
<P>
All were plunged into a dilemma as the original blueprint was
casted into the rubbish bin since a mobile tower, supposed to be
set up in the field, is surely unable to set the holy flames
flaring in the wind at the limited height of four meters.
</P>
<P>
To put it in the stands will occupy some 300 seats for ever, a
big sacrifice for the complex. Besides, the glittering flame
poses a permanent risk to the caps of fibre glass, necessitating
an additional fire-proof shelve.
</P>
<P>
To go from bad to worse, the supply of gas also was a nagging
problem, and became virtually impossible since the pipe has to be
connected in the depth of 10 meters underground as the structure
of the complex was already cemented firmly.
</P>
<P>
Thus, designers racked their brains for a pool of suggestions,
including an air-lifting of the tower by helicopter to highlight
the festive atmosphere, but the whimsy-whamsy was rejected in the
bud as any helicopter is doomed to be pulled down to the floor
by the tower.
</P>
<P>
Months of efforts betrayed everyone before Gong Xueping, vice
mayor of Shanghai finalized the decision on May 16 to shift the
tower from within.
</P>
<P>
All in a hurry, the constructers, pipe workers and designers
combined their witts and efforts to set up the tower in three
months with two gas pipes, two water pipes, four lighters and 92
burners.
</P>
<P>
With a huge torch standing atop, the tower was erected upon a
platform decorated with sculptures of athletes, depicting the
harmonious marriage between arts and sports.

<HEADLINE> China Spends More on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China spent over 226 billion
yuan (more than 27 billion US dollars) on education in 1996, 20.47
percent more than it did the previous year, according to a latest
statistics report.
</P>
<P>
Of the total expenditure for eduction, 167.17 billion yuan
(about 20.14 billion US dollars) came from state revenue in 1996,
representing an 18.43 percent over 1995. It accounted for 2.44
percent of China's gross domestic product and 16.28 percent of its
budget in 1996, up 0.03 percentage points and 0.23 percentage
points over the previous year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The statistics report also showed that last year central and
local governments' allocations for education increased by 17.85
percent to 121.191 billion yuan (about 14.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report was jointly released by the State Education Commission
(SEC) and the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
A SEC official said that the report unveiled that the overall
education input has been increased remarkably, especially when being
calculated on the basis of the average expense for each student.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the growth of local government
allocation to education in a number of provinces and
municipalities has outpaced that of their regular revenue. They
include Beijing, Tianjin municipalities and Jiangsu, Zhejiang,
Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, Yunnan and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, regional disparity still exits,
adding that some local governments failed to meet the requirements
of education input set by the Education Law.
</P>
<P>
China began to make public its education expenses once a year
in 1994.

<HEADLINE> World Bank, IMF Should Desist From Blackmailing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi said that the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) should desist from blackmailing Kenya in the
disbursement of financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times today quoted the president as saying Friday at
a Moi Day rally that "it should be understood that when we are
dealing with (economic) reforms, we are thinking first of the
welfare of Kenyans."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the implementation of structural
adjustment programs adversely affected the vulnerable groups in
society, particularly children, women and the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Moi said that the recent suspension of a loan package to Kenya
by the two international financial institutions resulted partly
from a delay in restructuring the energy sector.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the energy sector require parliamentary
approval, noted the president, adding that "we don't have to
hurry them" and the government was willing to continue
collaborating with the Bretton Woods institutions.
</P>
<P>
The IMF lapsed the second disbursement of its 215 million U.S.
Dollars three-year program offered under the Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Some days ago, Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa
also criticized Structural Adjustment Programs, saying they were
"immoral and deserved condemnation".

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Strikers Urged to Refrain from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Striking farm workers should
desist from violence and destruction of farm property and
commodities of lands and agriculture, Zimbabwean Minister of
Lands and Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference, Kangai urged commercial farmers
to speedily reach a mutually satisfactory resolution with their
striking workers to end the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
The government may be forced to intervene if the two
negotiating parties failed to reach an agreement soon.
</P>
<P>
Wage negotiations between the farmers and their workers
reached a deadlock last week for the first time in this country,
resulting in the matter being referred for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize that the government would like to see
commercial farmers and their workers reaching a mutually
satisfactory resolution to the current impasse," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"But we are concerned about the violence and destruction of
farm property and commodities," said Kangai.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the destruction of property is against
the law.
</P>
<P>
Property worth millions of dollars has been destroyed on farms
since the workers' strike started at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
The government is also aware that there are some criminal
elements who are not farm workers, but they are roaming farming
areas intimidating farmers and workers.
</P>
<P>
Police are all out to look for these criminals and some have
already been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the farming season has just begun. There are
some crops, particularly the early crops under irrigation, such
as tobacco, whose seeds need to be transplanted.
</P>
<P>
Both farmers and workers should not allow such crops to go any
further under stress, "as that will lead to losses in production.
losses in revenue and therefore losses in future wages," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to both workers and commercial farmers for greater
initiative and a creative response to the situation now facing
the industry.

<HEADLINE> No Swimming World Records Expected from National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese swimmers are
orchestrated to win more gold medals instead of setting any world
record in the coming Eighth National Games, a top Chinese swimming
official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Ming, vice head coach of the Chinese National Swimming
Team, explained that "the gold medals are valued more precious
than any record in the Games by all the participating delegations
as each of them carries out a stereotyped gold-oriented
blueprint."
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Le Jingyi "is expected only to retain her
national title, a precious gold already accounted by the Shanghai
delegation," said Zhou, who also serves as head coach of the
Shanghai swimming squad.
</P>
<P>
Under such a circumstance, no world record is expected to be
set up in the swimming pool as more attention will be swifted to
winning the gold medals, even in miserable timings, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the competitions will still be tough enough as the games
will also serves as a qualifying tournament for the World Swimming
Championships to be held in Perth in January, the coach said.
</P>
<P>
Such a tight schedule may hinder the Chinese swimmers in the
World Championships, and both coaches and the athletes have to
sacrifice the records for the gold medals at home, Zhou Ming
explained.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, the Chinese swimmers failed to create any world
record in the Seventh National Games in Beijing, but they made big
splashes in Rome in the succeeding World Championships by winning
a total of 12 gold medals, some of them in world records. Endtiem

<TEXT>
<P>

reapt great achievements in sports in both international and
domestic arenas, from the development of sports industry to sports
exchange with other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the Chinese athletes have won 448
world titles and set up 356 world records, accounting for 43 and
42 percents respectively of the totals achieved in the past 48
years after the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
China remained firmly as a dominating sportspower in the
continent, topping the medals tally for the third consecutive time
in the Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the 1995 43rd World Table Tennis Championships, the Chinese
paddlers made a clean sweep of seven titles, a repetition of such
a feat first-ever achieved in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese athletes also displayed brilliant performances in
the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, garnering 16 golds twice and
finishing fourth on the gold tally each time.
</P>
<P>

home meets, demostrating the increasing role it was playing in the
international sports community.

infrastructure also witnessed a rapid growth in the past five
years, up 12.28 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
So far, China boasts of 615,693 stadiums and gymnasiums of any
kind, with per capita coverage of sports facilites increased from
0.05 square meters in early 1950s to current 0.65.
</P>
<P>
All the sports facilities are opened to the pulic under the
stipulations of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.

2.2 billion yuans (260 million U.S. dollars), with 600 million
yuans (65 million U.S. dollars) alloted for the development of
sports, striding a concrete step for the market-oriented reforms.

<HEADLINE> China to Decide on Olympic Bid After National Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China will decide whether to
launch another bid to host the Olympic Games after the Eighth
National Games and Shanghai might step in as the second Chinese
city to submit such an application, top Chinese officials said
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Shaozu, minister of the State Physical Culture and Sports
Commission (SPCSC), stressed China's attitude that the country
"has yet to seriously ponder upon the issue."
</P>
<P>
"We will make the final decision whether or not to launch
another bidding campaign after the National Games," he said at the
news conference prior to the opening of the Eighth National Games.
</P>
<P>
Beijing lost to Sydney in the most intense-ever bidding race
for the 2000 Olympic Games in 1993 due to "non-sport factors," as
Wu put it.
</P>
<P>
While Beijing was expected to submit its candidancy once China
decides to bid anew, Shanghai, China's most populous and largest
city, might also make a try as it is striving to become the
world's financial and trade center.
</P>
<P>
"The bidding campaign is a matter between contries. It's up to
the SPCSC to make the decision and we have no say upon it," said
Shanghai vice mayor Gong Xueping who also serves as vice chairman
of the Games' Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
But Gong pointed out that if SPCSC eventually favors another
bid and chooses Shanghai as the bidding candidate, Shanghai will
not let the chance slip off its hands.
</P>
<P>
"Then we will try our best to bring the Olympics home," Gong
said. "Right now, the priority should go to the National Games."
</P>
<P>
The Eighth National Games, the last major sports meet of China
in the centrury, will ring up its curtain on Sunday with
historical colors.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, that returned to China on July 1 after 156 years
under British rule, will make its debut in the comprehensive
sports meet under the name of "Hong Kong, China."
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, which was reported to exploit Hong Kong experiences
for its economic development, will take the opportunity to further
relations with Hong Kong, tagged as the "Pearl of Oriental."
</P>
<P>
"The two sides have forged very close ties in sports. Hong
Kong's return to the motherland provides precious favorable
conditions for our further cooperation," Gong said.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the two metropolitans have had an annual inter-port
soccer tournament since 1987. The recent match was held last
month, with Shanghai winning as the host.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the two sides will establish a soccer league featuring
all the top clubs," Gong said.
</P>
<P>
Gong also said that Shanghai has a lot to learn from Hong Kong
in horse racing. "We hope Hong Kong could give us a hand in the
horse racing."
</P>
<P>
Wu uttered his support for the inter-port cooperation in sports
beteen Hong Kong and Shanghai, but reminded that it must go in
accordance with the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.

<HEADLINE> Deforestation in Bangladesh Threatens Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The existence of wild animals and
birds in Bangladesh has been threatened due to massive
deforestation and indiscriminate cutting of trees in four
districts of this South Asian country, local press reports said
here today.
</P>
<P>
About 10 species of wild animals have already vanished from the
districts, while 10 more species are on the verge of extinction,
according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Illegal hunting, cruelty to wildlife, rapid settlement of human
beings and deforestation have led to this situation, the reports
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The four districts were rich in wildlife like porcupine, civet,
rabbit, fox, wild cat, mongoose, green frogs, tortoise, oyster,
squirrel and different kinds of birds two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has 105 species of mammals, 567 of birds and 129 of
reptiles which constitute rich wildlife resources of the country,
some experts noted, suggesting establishment of wildlife
sanctuaries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, wild birds have started migrating to safer
sanctuaries because law violators are seen shooting birds and
animals frequently, and some of them even mix poison with food to
catch animals, some experts said.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of tin
and rubber closed the week all lower.
</P>
<P>
This week, a strong recovery of the Malaysian Ringgit, which
closed at 3.0610/10 to the U.S. dollar from 3.3230/50 a week ago,
hit the tin and rubber markets.
</P>
<P>
The tin price on the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), which
touched an eight-year high last week when it closed at 20.22
Ringgit per kg due to the weakened Ringgit, closed this week
sharply lower by 3.65 Ringgit to 16.57 Ringgit per kg.
</P>
<P>
Turnover this week fell to 385 tons from 470 tons last week.
There were more offerors instead of bidders for tin as many buyers
shied away from the market due to the strengthening of the Ringgit
coupled with the downtrend on the LME that dampened market
sentiment further.
</P>
<P>
Trading this week was dominated mostly by buyers from Europe
and locals while Japanese buyers stayed away.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, the strengthening of
the Ringgit sparked some selling interest and kept most rubber
traders on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
November RSS One and SMR 20 each eased by nine sen to close at
281.50 sen (about 92 U.S. cents) per kg and 279.50 sen (about 91
U.S. cents) per kg respectively.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator price for October 9 stood at 208.42
Malaysia/Singapore cents per kg against 212.23 cents on October 2.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average this week stood at 212.59 cents per
kg against 206.07 cents per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the local rubber market next week will
depend on the Ringgit's trend against the U.S. dollar, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the Ringgit this week sparked some selling
interest and kept most rubber traders on the sidelines.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Build Houses for Street Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
establish committees in Nairobi and other cities to provide homes
for street children, the Kenya Times today quoted President
Daniel arap Moi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Moi was speaking Friday at a garden party held here at the State
House in Nairobi for some 2,000 street children in celebration of
this year's Moi Day.
</P>
<P>
He said that the committee to be set up in Nairobi would build
homes for street children in the capital city and provide them
with an opportunity to learn useful skills.
</P>
<P>
Similar committees will also be established in other parts of
the East African country with the financial support of the Moi
Children Fund, the president announced.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the street children of today would be adults in
the future, adding that there was need to mould them into
dependable children.
</P>
<P>
On the Moi Day, the president visited the Thomas Barnado House
and Mama Ngina Kenyatta Children's homes, and donated foodstuffs
like biscuits, rice, sugar, bread and milk to them.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by Human Rights Watch earlier
this year, Kenya has more than 40,000 street children, 25,000 of
whom are concentrated on Nairobi streets.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in addition to the hazards of living on
the streets, these children who live outside the protection of
responsible adults face harassment and abuse from the police.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government announced in June this year that five
rescue centers would be set up in urban areas for practical
support of street children.
</P>
<P>
At a Christmas party last year at the State House, President
Moi announced that he had set up a Moi Children
Fund to help raise money and establish homes for the children.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Has Large Percentage of Mental Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has a fairly large
percentage of patients with various types of mental disorders,
said a signed article carried by the just-published weekend
magazine Independent here today.
</P>
<P>
There are about 8.40 million mental patients in Bangladesh at
present, accounting for about 7 percent of the total population
(120 million), according to an official estimate.
</P>
<P>
Of the above-mentioned figure, 1.20 million fall in the
categories of serious mental disorders and 7.20 million in other
less-serious categories, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
However, there are 675 hospital beds for mental patients in the
country, of which 560 are in government hospitals and 115 in
private hospitals, the article quoted the official statistics as
stating.
</P>
<P>
"Nearly 70 percent of the mental patients belonging to urban
background are women," Dr. Anwara Begum, director cum professor of
the Institute of Mental Health, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Various stress factors contribute to the deterioration of a
person's mental state over a certain period of time, the professor
said, adding that urban women from upper-middle and middle classes
face many conflicting situations every day, and the most stressful
of these are interpersonal conflict between husband and wife. This
is the major cause of mental problem among urban women.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has stressed the need to restore Tanzania's
respect by eliminating government dependence on donor support
while reducing the overdependence of the people on the
government.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made the appeal while opening the National Convention on
Development "Vision 2025" Friday in Arusha, according to a news
dispatch from the northern Tanzanian town.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants attending the two-day symposium that
the long-term vision should focus on boosting productivity in
industries, agriculture and mining for a dynamic economy and
stable state to be attained.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that the government wants the people to stop
thinking that the government should single-handedly bring about
national development, adding the new vision entails increased
public participation in national activities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the governmental dependence on external aid has
reached a point whereby even salaries and transport have to be
paid through donor funds, asking, "What sort of independence is
that? What is our integrity as a state?"
</P>
<P>
He noted that in general, dependence has affected Tanzanians
to the extent that individuals wait for the government even for
things that they can do on their own such as building a school
toilet or providing school desks.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that today Tanzania proudly enjoys national unity,
social cohesion, peace and stability, adding the challenge is to
enable Tanzanians realize their full potential, develop
self-confidence and mobilize resources towards the betterment of
the tanzanian society.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the long-term strategy should incorporate
science and technology as well as a sense of commitment among the
people to bring about revolutionary changes.

<HEADLINE> India Revamps Management of Public Sector Undertakings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- With the view to giving
financial and operational autonomy for profit-making public sector
undertakings (PSU), the Indian government has issued a set of
guidelines for restructuring PSU boards by broad-basing them and
streamlining their decision-making process, The Hindustan Times
said today.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, which were issued here late on Friday, stated
that small boards should be broad-based by inducting at least
three non-official part-time directors. It should also be ensured
that the number of the non-official part-time directors increase
to one-third of the total strength of the board at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
While announcing delegation of decision-making for PSUs
earlier, the government had allowed some PSU boards to incur
capital expenditure on new projects, modernization and purchase of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of power would be subject to several conditions
and guidelines. The expenditure proposals have to be presented to
the board of directors in writing and reasonably well in advance,
with an analysis of relevant factors and quantification of the
anticipated results and benefits.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices rebounded on
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) market this week with a
mid-week spurt.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Index, which tracks 100 quality stocks, soared
36.72 points or 4.60 percent to close the week at 834.01 after
moving between a low of 791.02 and a high of 845.56 during the
week.

The Industrial Index rose 63.82 points or 3.88 percent to
1,704.81 and the Second Board Index surged 29.27 points or 7.29
percent to 430.32.
</P>
<P>
The rebound on the KLSE went side by side with the recovery of
the local foreign exchange market with Malaysia's Ringgit traded
at 3.0610/10 to the U.S. dollar at the week's close from 3.3230/50
a week ago.
</P>
<P>
During the week under review, one counter -- Nissan IOI -- made
a good debut on the Second Board, opening on Thursday at 5.90
Ringgit and closing the week at 5.45 Ringgit against its initial
public offering price at 3.90 Ringgit.
</P>
<P>
This week, the main board's ready turnover expanded to

1,105.945 million Ringgit (about 361.4199 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said that the bullish sentiments which
re-emerged on the KLSE this week are expected to be carried
forward to next week when the 1998 Budget which is widely believed
to put the economy on the right track will be announced.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Budget scheduled to be tabled in Parliament on October
17 is expected to be one that will boost confidence and steer the
economy away from stormy weather, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The bullish forecast for the local unit to bounce back to the
2.80 level to the U.S. dollar would also prompt the stock market
to recover further, they said.

<HEADLINE> Food Situation in Iraq Needs to Improve: UN Food Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Malnutrition is still a serious
problem among the people throughout Iraq, although there has been
an improvement in the food supply following the implementation of
the UN resolution to allow Iraq to sell oil for food.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest joint assessment mission by the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food
Program, "There is considerable evidence of widespread
malnutrition, and the quality, availability and nutritional value
of food in the country" is inadequate. "Supply shortages have been
experienced over the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
"The need for vulnerable group feeding remains essential. The
SCR 986 (UN Security Council Resolution No. 986) basket does not
meet the special nutritional food needs of vulnerable groups, such
as malnourished children," the joint mission said.
</P>
<P>
Financial sanctions have been imposed on Iraq by the UN since the
end of the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
However, under the UN's recent oil-for-food resolution, which
has permitted Iraq to export limited quantities of oil since 1996
to finance imports of food and other humanitarian needs, Iraq has
sold two billion U.S. dollars worth of oil in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
On June 8, 1997, the UN Security Council extended the
resolution to include the second half year.

<P>
BELGRADE, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, a member of
the Presidency of Bosnia, said today that it would be "a
disastrous mistake" if the international community demanded the
arrest of former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a disastrous mistake if the international
community does so, for it will stir up strong opposition from the
Serbs and threaten the Dayton peace accord," Krajisnik said while
talking to the newspaper Nedeljni Dnevnik in Novi Sad, the capital
city of Vojvodina Province in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic, who is regarded as a war hero by the Bosnian Serbs,
was put on the list of war criminals by the international tribunal
at the Hague after the three-and-a-half-year war ended in December
1995, in accordance with the Dayton peace accord signed in the
United States.

<P>
ROME, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Outgoing Italian Prime Minister
Romano Prodi expressed optimism today that there will be a quick
solution to the current Italian government crisis following the
resignation of his government Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prodi's government resigned after failing to get parliament to
endorse plans to cut the budget deficit in line with relevant
measures to adopt the European currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro began formal
talks today with the chairmen of the Senate and the Chamber of
Deputies, and may announce the dissolution of the parliament
elected 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the European summit in Strasbourg,
France, Prodi said he did not know what solution the president
will seek, but said, "I can assure you that it will be a quick
solution."
</P>
<P>
Though crises have put the country's plan of swapping lira for
the euro in doubt, it has dampened Prodi's optimism over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the chances for Italy to take part in Europe's
single currency "are based on the results we have achieved.
</P>
<P>
"It takes time to build and it also takes time to destroy," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Optimistic to Find Peaceful Resolution on Chechen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia could eventually find a
peaceful solution to the Chechen issue, Deputy Representative of
the Security Council of the Russian Federation Boris Berezovski
told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Berezovski spoke after talks between representatives from the
Russian federation and Chechen republic Thursday in Soci, a
Russian coastal city along the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen representative agreed to submit the two documents
on the republic's status to Russia's State Duma (the lower house
of parliament) and the Federation Council (the upper house), said
Berezovski.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides still hold differences, Berezovski
said. The Chechen representative insists on signing a
state-to-state agreement with Russia, while Russia only wants to
sign an agreement between the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
He said that only the Russian parliament could solve that
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation and the Chechen Republic reached an
agreement in August 1996 in Khasavyurt, a city in the North
Caucasus region in Russia's Dagestan Republic, ending the war in
Chechnya, which started in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to postpone the issue of Chechnya's status until
the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Berezovski said the reasons for the differences were because
they differed on explanations for the postponement. The Chechen
Republic regarded itself as an independent state since 1991.
</P>
<P>
But the security representative still felt optimistic. He said,
"The most serious crisis" between the two sides had been solved
during the Soci meeting.

<HEADLINE> UNDP's aid to Upgrade Water Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The 21st Century Urban Water
Management in China, a project funded by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP), will help launch a national drive
for sustainable urban water management in Chinese cities that face
severe water shortage, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The 1.1-million-US dollar project will support pilot
activities in Shijiazhuang," Liang Dan said yesterday in
Beijing. Liang is director of China's International Center for
Economic and Technical Exchanges, which will execute the project.
</P>
<P>
"Shijiazhuang is a north China city plagued by a lack of water
resources," Liang added. "The project will determine the most
appropriate reforms at the municipal level regarding water
resource management."
</P>
<P>
Half of China's 666 cities are threatened by water shortages,
according to Nie Meisheng, director of the Science and Technology
Department of Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
The nation's per capita water availability is 2,440 cubic
meters, only a quarter of the world's average, Nie added.
</P>
<P>
Each year, an average of 230 billion yuan (27.7 billion US
dollars) in industrial output value has been affected by water
deficiencies, Nie said.
</P>
<P>
She said the UNDP's aid project is of far-reaching significance
and should help China solve the water-related problems that are a
major stumbling block to China's sustainable economic and social
development in the coming century.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges Israeli Employers to Rise Wages for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is urging Israeli
employers to increase wages for Thai workers who were supposed to
get a pay rise five months ago, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Most workers receive a daily wage of 600-630 baht (17.1-18 US
dollars), which is about 100 baht (2.8 dollars) less than that
they should obtain under an agreement made between the two
countries, according to a survey by the Thai embassy in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In May, the Thai Labor and Social Welfare Ministry and Moshav
Movement, an Israeli agency in charge of Thai workers, agreed to
increase the basic wages for Thai workers.
</P>
<P>
But many employers ignored the pay rise agreement, especially
those who employed Thai laborers in flower plantations for export.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 out of 25,000 Thai laborers in Israel work in
agriculture while the rest are in construction, restaurants and
private residences.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Grants Amnesty to Army Deserters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Army has
declared an amnesty for all deserters and asked them to return to
duty as soon as possible, Defense Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
In view of the 48th anniversary of the Army, which fell on
Friday, the Army decided to grant an amnesty to all deserters, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty will be effective from October 10 to mid-night
October 24.
</P>
<P>
The deserters may report to the nearest military camp or to a
police station.
</P>
<P>
All those report for duty will not be punished and will be
entitled to their earlier held ranks, pay and allowances soon
after their return.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 have reportedly deserted the army in recent
years. Since 1995, the army has offered amnesty for deserters on
five occasions and over 10,000 deserters have reportedly returned.
</P>
<P>
During the latest amnesty on July 10-26 this year, a total of
4,026 army deserters returned for duty.
</P>
<P>
Sources said most of the deserters escaped their duties because
they were afraid of being sent to the front line to fight with the
guerrilla of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who have
been fighting for a separate state of their own for 14 years in
the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Producer ahead of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China Offshore Oil Nan Hai East
Corp (CONHE) had pumped out more than 10 million tons of crude oil
by October 3, exceeding the annual target of 9.75 million tons one
quarter ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
CONHE is expected to produce more than 12 million tons of crude
oil by the end of this year, according to today's China
Daily. CONHE has yielded 11.84 million tons of crude oil last
year, accounting for 80 percent of China's offshore oil.
</P>
<P>
This level of oil output is projected to continue into the
next century, said China Daily, adding that the South China Sea
fields will therefore be made China's fourth largest oil
producer. The three others are northeast China's Daqing, east
China's Shengli and northeast China's Liaohe.
</P>
<P>
CONHE is operating eight offshore oilfields, including China's
biggest offshore oilfield Liuhua 11-1, with overseas investors in
eastern areas of the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
In the past 14 years, CONHE has cooperated with 38 foreign oil
firms to explore and develop offshore oilfields in a
106,000-square-kilometer area, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"But we have discovered fewer than 10 percent of the largest
oil reserves in the eastern section of the South China Sea," a
CONHE official was quoted as saying. CONHE expects to receive
foreign financial support to help sustain its oil production level
in the next few years, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Prospects Good for Thailand's Garment Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Export prospects for the Thai
garment industry are good due to the weaker baht, according to
Chavalit Nimla-Or, president of the Thai Garment Manufacturers'
Association.
</P>
<P>
The value of garment exports for the last four months of the
year could be up by 25 percent over the same period last year in
baht terms and by 10 percent in dollars terms, Chavalit was quoted
today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The value of outbound shipments of garment as of July 31 was
49.16 billion baht (1.96 billion US dollars), up just 1.27 percent
over the 48.54 billion baht (1.94 billion dollars) recorded in the
first seven months of last year.
</P>
<P>
In major markets such as the United States and Japan, which
account for 74 percent of all garment exports from Thailand,
growth has been much higher at 8.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said, however, that sales to two smaller markets, the
Middle East and Eastern Europe, could fall by about 30 percent due
to competition from products made in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Thailand should adopt both short- and
long-term plans for market development, tailored to each region.
Government assistance in terms of finance and technology upgrading
is still needed.
</P>
<P>
A more competitive garment industry must be in place once the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) agreement starts to be implemented in
the next two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
But once the agreement takes effect, Thailand should seize the
chance to sell its products within the region since products from
outside, especially from Italy and Hong Kong, will face import
tariff of up to 30 percent. Products manufactured within ASEAN
will carry tariffs ranging from zero to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even in the low-end market, Thailand should stress quality and
promote the image that the country produces affordable -- but not
low-quality -- products, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy for Cyprus
Richard Holbrooke will visit Turkey next week to discuss the
division of the Mediterranean island, the State Department
announced today.
</P>
<P>
It will be his first trip to the region since his appointment
by President Bill Clinton earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, architect of the 1995 agreement to end the Bosnian
war, will be accompanied by Ambassador Thomas Miller, special
coordinator for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that Holbrooke will
not go to Greece, stressing that the move should not be
interpreted as a slap at Athens.
</P>
<P>
"It is not necessary for an American official of whatever
prominence to go to Greece and Turkey every time they go to the
region," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ankara talks are not a negotiation but a
continuation of discussions Holbrooke and Miller held with Turkish
officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
The two envoys also met recently in New York with Cypriot
President Glafcos Clerides. They plan to meet with Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash later this month in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is expected to meet top political figures on Monday
in Turkey, but the meetings are still being arranged, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"We are engaged in an active process of discussions to see what
assistance we can provide the parties in coming to a conclusion
(on Cyprus). We believe now is the right time to continue the
process in Ankara," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke and Miller "will discuss the full range of issues
relating to our efforts to promote a settlement of the Cyprus
dispute," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government Scales Down Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The increase in interest rates
and the peso depreciation have forced the Philippine government to
scale down its economic growth targets for this year.
</P>
<P>
The Development Budget Coordinating Committee (DBCC) Friday
approved the reduction of this year's gross national product (GNP)
target from the original 7 to 8 percent to between 5.5 percent and
6 percent. The Philippines' GNP grew by 6.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the gross domestic product (GDP) for 1997 was scaled
down to between 5 and 5.5 percent from the original target of
between 6.1 percent and 6.8 percent, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
GNP is the measure of a country's total production of goods and
services, including income from abroad, while GDP is considered a
more precise measurement of the domestic production of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
DBCC is an inter-agency committee composed of representatives
of the Department of Finance, the Department of Budget and
Management, the National Economic and Development Authority, the
Central Bank and the Bureau of Treasury.
</P>
<P>
But the committee has not adjusted its inflation target of
between six and seven percent.
</P>
<P>
It said that the changes in the 1997 growth targets were made
assuming an average peso-dollar rate is 28 to 29 pesos:1 for the
whole year and 29.50 to 33.50:1 for the last quarter of the year,
and interest rates are based on the benchmark 91-day Treasury Bill
rate of 12.5 percent average for the whole year and 14.6 percent
for the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
Since early July this year, the Philippine peso has depreciated
about 30 percent against the greenback and Friday's peso-dollar
exchange rate is 33.15:1.

<HEADLINE> Rusedski Beats Martin in CA Trophy ATP Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Greg Rusedski thrashed American
Todd Martin in the quarter-finals of the CA Trophy ATP Tour event.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-seed, who this week rose to No.4 in the world
rankings, won 6-1, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 to set up an all-British
semi-final against Tim Henman.
</P>
<P>
Henman, who has won his three previous meetings with Rusedski,
earlier booked his place in the semis with a 6-4, 6-1 defeat of
Slovakian Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
Canadian-born Rusedski, who hasn't dropped serve this week,
reached his fourth successive semi-final with a win in 1 hour 42
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski said he was not excited about facing Henman and was
more concerned about qualifying for the year-ending ATP Tour
Championships.
</P>
<P>
"As far as tomorrow goes, it will be just another match,
although an important one on the road to Hannover which is my
goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it was a good win for me today, especially as it was the
first time I have beaten Todd."
</P>
<P>
Henman was faster than Rusedski in his quarter, taking just 63
minutes to overwhelm Kucera.
</P>
<P>
Henman reached the semis for the second straight week. He lost
to Australian Mark Philippoussis in the last four in Basle,
Switzerland, last week.
</P>
<P>
Third-seed Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia continued his recent
renaissance with a 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 6-3 win over Bohdan Ulihrach
of the Czech Republic in his quarter.
</P>
<P>
He will now play former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of
the Netherlands who beat Sweden's Magnus Larsson 6-4, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Private Economy In China's Ethnic Minority Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The non-public sector of the
economy in ethnic minority regions in China has grown at an annual
rate of 30 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
By June, the non-state sector of the five autonomous regions of
Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Tibet, and Xinjiang had assets
of 27 billion yuan (3.25 billion US dollars) and three million
employees.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say that the growth of the non-state sector has
greatly contributed to the increase of jobs and tax revenues and
the growth of the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia, for example, has no limits on size or scope of
business in developing the sector and has set aside special
low-interest loans for private business.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has arranged one to
three-year tax breaks for private herdsmen in remote areas and has
supported joint ventures or ventures overseas.
</P>
<P>
In the past, non-stated-owned businesses were mainly involved
in small-scale retailing but are now involved in production,
processing, and technology. Many of them co-operate with overseas
partners and export their products.
</P>
<P>
The private sector has also become a major place for laid-off
workers from state-owned enterprises to find work. In Nanning, the
capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, they have provided
jobs for 70,000 of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Private companies in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have paid
1.83 billion yuan in taxes to the state in the past five years,
while the private sector in Tibet Autonomous Region accounts for
45 percent of the region's total revenues.

The Swiss teenager will play against fifth-seeded South African

in the semis.
</P>
<P>
Hingis' other defeats came in the French Open final against
Croatian Iva Majoli in early June and in Los Angeles in August by
American Lindsay Davenport.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian penitentiary
system will release more than 1,000 national and foreign inmates
due to a reform to the justice codex being promoted by the
Panamanian government.
</P>
<P>
This reform would permit, according to an official report, to
release 628 Panamanian inmates, and 414 foreigners who serve
condemns in several prisons of the country would be deported to
their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
This proposal, presented by the Panamanian government to the
plenum of the Legislative Assembly, will benefit the inmates who
have fulfilled the maximum penalty the law prescribes for the
crime they are accused.
</P>
<P>
After an intense discussion of several days, the new law was
passed last night in the third debate by the plenum of the
Legislative Assembly, and now must be approved by the President of
the Republic for its promulgation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the positive effects of this law project for the
administration of justice and on the Panamanian penitentiary
system, there were voices of protest, among them the Panamanian
College of Lawyers, which has asked President Ernesto Perez
Balladares not to approve the project.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman, the National
Basketball Association rebounding king for the past six years,
signed a one-year contract with to the reigning champion Chicago
Bulls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The deal, contingent upon a physical examination, means Rodman
could be in uniform for an exhibition game Saturday and at the
McDonalds Championship, an international club championship set
for next week in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, who made nine million dollars last season, will be paid
four million dollars with clauses that could boost his salary
near previous levels, provided he does not suffer injuries and
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was not available for Chicago's first exhibition game
against Seattle on Friday but could play when the Bulls and
SuperSonics meet on Saturday in Lawrence, Kansas.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls will be without their other starting forward, Scottie
Pippen, for up to three months after he underwent left foot
surgery last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rodman, 36, is best known for controversial kicking and
head-butting as well as a rainbow of hair dyes. Last season the
Bulls suspended Rodman for two games and the league banished him
for 12 games, 11 for kicking a cameraman and one for a scuffle
with a rival player.
</P>
<P>
A sprained knee sidelined him for the final month of the
season, but Rodman still won the NBA rebounding title with 16.1 a
game over 55 contests. In the playoffs his average slid to 8.4
rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Policy Issued 46 Years Ago Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A life insurance policy so old
that it could have been put into a museum that was discovered in
the northern Chinese port of Tianjin has been paid off by the
People's Insurance Company of China (PICC).
</P>
<P>
The policy was issued by the Tianjin branch of PICC, the
country's largest insurer, in 1951 to Wang Yongbin at a cost of
5,000 yuan (the currency then in use, 10,000 of which are worth
one renminbi yuan now).
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old policy remained unpaid and was found by a PICC
Life agent, who was visiting Wang's nephew, Wang Qinjian, while
trying to sell another policy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qinjian took the policy out and asked whether it was valid
or not. He was told that that particular life insurance business
was suspended in July, 1959, and that PICC had cleared all
policies.
</P>
<P>
But PICC honored the insurance policy for then 880,000 yuan, and
paid 155.8 renminbi yuan in compensation.
</P>
<P>
China re-opened its insurance companies in 1978.

MADRID, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Claudio Chiappucci was dropped
from the Italian team for Sunday's world road cycling race
championship on Friday after he failed a blood test.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Cycling Federation said it had revoked his racing
licence for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that the 34-year-old rider had
registered an excessive red blood cell count since the
International Cycling Union (UCI) introduced the tests this year.
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci was excluded from the Tour of Romandie in May
and, because he had to wait 15 days before a clearance test
could be performed, also missed the Tour of Italy.
</P>

The Italian was first tested by the Italian Cycling
Federation at the world championships on Thursday and again on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
From two tests on each day, eight analyses were made and all
were over the 50 per cent limit imposed by the Federation.
</P>
<P>
"As a Federation we have to look after the health of our
riders," said Giancarlo Cerutti, president of the Federation.
</P>
<P>
Chiappucci was told of the results after returning from the
junior road race championship where he had congratulated winning
compatriot Crescenzo d'Amore.
</P>
<P>
The UCI limit is 51 per cent and earlier in the year 10
riders were excluded from competition along with Chiappucci.
</P>
<P>
The last exclusions were in May after four riders, three
from the same team, were tested on the Tour of Italy.
</P>
<P>
Andrea Ferrigato was named as Chiappucci's replacement in
the Italian team for Sunday's race.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Communist Party Central Committee to be Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The 5th Congress of the Cuban
Communist Party (PCC) will reduce its Central Committee members to
150, 70 less than the previous one, announced its Second
Secretary Raul Castro today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced following the vote last night by the
1,500 delegates to the three-day Congress that opened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for the reduction, Raul Castro said the
PCC Central Committee must act accordingly with the times,
which demands smaller, more agile and easily convened
administrative organs.
</P>
<P>
He said the newly elected Central Committee must continue the
struggle to overcome the difficult economic problems facing the
country despite the intensification of the U.S. economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
The results of the voting for the formation of the PCC Central
Committee will be known this afternoon. The Central Committee will
also elect the first and second secretary and the rest of the
members of the political bureau.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Castro has been elected PCC first secretary
since the party was founded in the 1960s, and successive
congresses have continued to re-elect him to the post.

<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian balance of
trade with the United States will show this year the unprecedented
deficit of five billion dollars, the Brazilian Foreign Trade
Association (AEB) said today.
</P>
<P>
The amount is almost half of the total commercial deficit of
Brazil for this year, which will be between 10 billion and 12
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
AEB president Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes said the
deficit shows that Brazil has reached the limit of opening of its
market to U.S. products.
</P>
<P>
Brazil imported last year U.S. products for 11.8 billion
dollars and exported to that country 9.3 billion dollars.

WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) today approved an 18-month stand-by credit for Latvia,
in an amount of about 45 million U.S. dollars equivalent, to
support the government's 1997-1999 economic program.
</P>
<P>
However, the Latvian authorities have indicated their intention
not to draw on the credit as was the case under the recently
expired arrangement.
</P>

for 1997 and 5 percent for 1998, a reduction in the annual rate of
inflation to 9 percent in 1997 and 7 percent in 1998. They are
also included a narrowing in the external current account deficit
to 6.1 percent of GDP in 1997 and 4.9 percent in 1998. Gross
international reserves will be targeted at the equivalent of some
three months of imports for 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
Latvia joined the IMF in May 1992. Its quota is about 126
million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF credit currently
totals about 94 million dollars.

centre for police authorities of the European Union member states to
combat rising organized crimes.
</P>

thievery, nuclear smuggling and money laundering in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The analyzed data would then be tranfered to police authorities of
individual EU states to help them track down the criminals.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced his appointment today of
Olara Otunnu as his Special Representative for Children in Armed
Conflict, as one of the U.N. steps in helping child victims in
armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu, born in Uganda and having held many titles of
international organizations, has been widely recognized for his
long-standing commitment and contribution to diverse activities
relating to international peace and security, prevention of
conflict, and many others, according to the secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was actually made September 1. Otunnu will
serve as advocate for the protection of children in conflict
situations, promoting measures and taking concrete initiatives in
particular cases, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
But he has to work on voluntary contributions.
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, an estimated 2 million children have been killed in
armed conflict, according to statistics provided by the United
Nations. Three times that number have been seriously injured or
permanently disabled. Ten million children have been
psychologically traumatized by war, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years alone more than a quarter million
children under the age of 18 have fought as soldiers in 36
conflicts across the world.
</P>
<P>
Today, nearly 30 million children are refugees or internally
displaced because of war in their countries, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Special Representative for Children in Armed Conflict was
set up in line with a resolution of the U.N. General Assembly in
late 1996.
</P>

WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The secondhand-smoke lawsuit
brought by 60,000 U.S. flight attendants against tobacco industry
was settled today as the industry agreed to pay 300 million U.S.
dollars to establish a research foundation on diseases led by
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The attendants had sued for 5 billion dollars, claiming they
developed lung, heart and other diseases by breathing other
people's smoke on airliners. The trial began four months ago.
</P>
<P>
The settlement marks the first time the tobacco industry agreed
to pay damages in a secondhand-smoke lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement, the nation's four biggest cigarette
makers -- Philip Morris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco and Lorillard Inc. -- will finance the Broin
Research Foundation to study cures for illnesses caused by smoke
and to develop early-detection methods.
</P>
<P>
However, the attendants get no money, but under newly agreed-on
terms, they can easily file a claim individually and win.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, October 10 (Xinhua) -- About 31 percent of the 15-19
age group of Zambian girls have eighter given birth or are
pregnant, the Family Life Movement of Zambia said today.
</P>
<P>
It added that some as young as 10-year-old girls have gone
into marriage due to economic hardships, changing traditional
patterns and rapid urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Expressing her concern representative of the organization
Mwape Lubilo said in Kabwe, central Zambia today that early
marriage is leading to pregnancy, child bearing and illness such
as sexually transmitted (STD) diseases and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In a paper on "child, adolescent and youth development"
presented to a five-day workshop to discuss population, gender
and development advocacy, she said it is sad that early marriage
is an issue calling for urgent discussions.
</P>
<P>
The statutory law indicates legal marriage age at 18 years,
while on the contrary, the customary law pegs it at attainment of
puberty, she said.
</P>
<P>
There is an urgent need to harmonize the statutory and
customary laws in order to protect the girl-child, Lubilo said.
</P>
<P>
On abortion, she said available data shows that
inaccessibility to legal and safe abortions is a major cause of
maternal morbidity and mortality.
</P>
<P>
While friends, elders and sometimes herbalists are expected to
help in inducing abortion, recent data indicates that young
people could induce an abortion themselves, she said.
</P>
<P>
"A study conducted in four districts in Western Province
indicates that 12 percent of females in the age group 11-19 had
already experienced an illegal abortion without recording any
form of help," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lubilo said 17 out of 1,000 people in Zambia have an SDT such
as gonorrhoea, syphilis and herpes.

MAPUTO, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Mozambique
and Portugal today signed an agreement on water conservancy
cooperation, under which the latter will assist Mozambique in
managing its international rivers.
</P>
<P>
Roberto White, Mozambican Minister of Public Works and
Housing, and Ricardo Magalhaes, Portuguese Secretary of State of
Natural Resources sealed the pact on behalf of their respective
governments.
</P>
<P>
The accord stipulates that four more projects of water

1.65 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, White expressed the hope that such
cooperation be extended to the repairing of water supply
infrastructure in both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Magalhaes, on his part, noted that besides offering support to
Mozambique in managing international rivers, what jumps to
immediate attention is dam safety, the development of Monapo
river valley in Namula province in the north, research on Zambeze
river's exit to the sea as well as the training for Mozambican
technicians.
</P>
<P>
According to the Portuguese official, both countries are

<P>
ATHENS, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece today warned Turkey that
any attack by Ankara against a Greek vessel would be regarded as a
cause for war.
</P>
<P>
The warning was sent out today by Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas when asked to comment on statements by Russia's
ambassador in Cyprus, who said that his country would consider as
a "casus belli" a Turkish strike against any Russian ship
transporting S-300 surface-to-air missiles to Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"The same holds if a Greek vessel is attacked," Reppas said,
but added that he did not believe such a development was likely
"since everything is quite legal and in line with the interests
which any government would want to protect."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Turkey's aggressive designs and
statements regarding strikes against the vessels of other
countries were putting a strain on good relations between
countries.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Cyprus and Russia signed an agreement
under which Nicosia will purchase Russian-made S-300 ground-to-air
missiles to bolster the defense of the island republic.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has voiced its opposition to such a decision by Cyprus,
warning it would take all measures possible to stop the island
from deploying the missiles.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine said today pledged his country's renewed
commitment in Africa, saying France will not get involved in
Africa's internal conflicts.
</P>
<P>
France will give methodical support to the consolidation of
the foundation of the rule of law, the process of
democratization, good governance, and will be in favor of
sustainable development, which is the key to stability and peace
in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing African ambassadors to the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) here at the Africa hall this
evening.
</P>
<P>
"For several years now, Africa has offered growing
confirmation with each day of their determination to be active in
preventing and settling the conflicts that beset it," Vedrine
said.
</P>
<P>
"To enable the OAU to respond to the many emergencies more
effectively, France made a first contribution in November 1996 of
a million Francs to the mechanism for conflict prevention,
management and resolution," the minister added with an
announcement that France would contribute one million US dollars
to the OAU in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to peace-keeping operations in Africa, Vedrine said
"France intends next year to devote more than 30 million dollars
to training and equipment activities aimed at improving African
peace-keeping capabilities."
</P>
<P>
France "consistently supports maintaining significant flows of
aid" to Africa, the foreign minister said, adding that because
France "is convinced that there can be no lasting stabilization
in Africa without development, and although it is first and
foremost up to the Africans to find in themselves the dynamics of
development, the international community has an obligation to
help them in this endeavor."
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, he said,
France has been working unremittingly to help prevent crises,
favoring more and more a multi-lateral approach to questions of
security on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
France "has, on a number of occasions demonstrated its refusal
to let itself be drawn into internal conflicts or to interfere in
the internal affairs of its African partners, as it did in the
Congo Brazzaville crisis where it supports the international
mediation of President Bongo and of Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun," adding
that "about Comoro islands, France supports the mediation of
Ambassador Yere under the mandate of OAU."
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister is currently on an African tour.
He visited South Africa Thursday and will visit Cote d'Ivoire
tomorrow.

<P>
LUANDA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- An Angolan official today
hailed Nobel Peace Prize as being awarded to the international
campaigner for land mine clearance, saying it is a world
recognition.
</P>
<P>
Helder Cruz, head of Angola's National Institute for Removing
Obstacles and Explosives, said the decision is very correct,
since land mine clearance is a major event which has far-reaching
significance.
</P>
<P>
The decision will inspire the international community to make
continuous efforts in ridding the whole world of land mines, Cruz
added.
</P>
<P>
This year's Nobel Peace Prize has been given to the
international campaign for land mine clearance and its
coordinator Jody Williams.
</P>
<P>
This is also an encouragement to the Angolan government for
eliminating land mines, Cruz said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Angola has made great contributions to
clearing mines and educating its people of the danger of land
mines, and Angola will make further efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Angola is among the countries in the world which have a great
many land mines planted during the civil war. United Nations
statistics show that there are over 13 million land mines planted
in Angola, which has great impact on the country's rehabilitation
after a civil war of nearly two decades.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian
official on Friday urged the United States to be evenhanded in its
mediation for resolving disputes between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, the higher education minister of the Palestinian
Authority, told a gathering sponsored by the Arab-American Forum
that Washington should adopt a "more evenhanded position" and end
its habit of constantly embracing the Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
She deplored what she called the steady erosion of U.S.
opposition to Israeli settlement activity.
</P>
<P>
Whereas the United States used to call the Israeli settlement
activity illegal, it is now reduced to seeking a "temporary pause"
or a "time-out" in settlement construction, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said the peace process has been faltering because
Israel and the United States have been attaching disproportionate
attention to Israeli security while neglecting other components of
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> French FM Reiterates Paris' African Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine today declared his country's renewed commitment in
Africa, saying France will not get involved in Africa's internal
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
France will give methodical support to consolidating the
foundation of the rule of law, the process of democratization,
and good governance, and will be in favor of sustainable
development, which is the key to stability and peace in Africa,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when addressing African ambassadors to the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) at the Africa hall here this
evening.
</P>
<P>
France has refused recently to intervene in its former
colonies such as Congo Brazzaville and the Comoros since it was
bitten in Rwanda in 1994, accused of being biased toward the
former government troops.
</P>
<P>
"For several years now, Africa has offered growing
confirmation with each day of their determination to be active in
preventing and settling the conflicts that beset it," Vedrine
said.
</P>
<P>
"To enable the OAU to respond to the many emergencies more
effectively, France made a first contribution in November 1996 of
a million Francs to the mechanism for conflict prevention,
management and resolution," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that France would contribute one million U.S.
Dollars to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to peace-keeping operations in Africa, Vedrine said
"France intends next year to devote more than 30 million Dollars
to training and equipment activities aimed at improving African
peace-keeping capabilities."
</P>
<P>
France "consistently supports maintaining significant flows of
aid" to Africa, he said, because it "is convinced that there can
be no lasting stabilization in Africa without development, and
although it is first and foremost up to the Africans to find in
themselves the dynamics of development, the international
community has an obligation to help them in this endeavor."
</P>
<P>
As a permanent member of the U..N Security Council, Vedrine
said, France has been working unremittingly to help prevent
crises, favoring more and more a multi-lateral approach to
questions of security on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
France "has, on a number of occasions demonstrated its refusal
to let itself be drawn into internal conflicts or to interfere in
the internal affairs of its African partners, as it did in the
Congo Brazzaville crisis where it supports the international
mediation of President Omar Bongo and of Mr. Mohammed Sahnoun."
</P>
<P>
"About Comoro islands, France supports the mediation of
Ambassador Yere under the mandate of the OAU," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister is currently on an African tour.
He visited South Africa Thursday and will visit Cote d'Ivoire
tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of PKK Rebels Killed in Turkish Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's government troops have
killed 764 outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) militants in the
operations in northern Iraq since late last month, the Anatolia
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by the Turkish General Staff, which said
that at the same time 33 other PKK rebels were captured and 17
surrendered. It did not mention casualties of the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by jets and
artillery fire, launched cross-border operations in northern Iraq
to wipe out the PKK camps there.
</P>
<P>
Senior Turkish military sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said that Turkish troops had taken much of northern
Iraq under control through the three-week-long operations.
</P>
<P>
Describing the PKK as a threat to its border security, Turkey
said its latest operations in northern Iraq were aimed to prevent
the PKK militants from infiltrating into southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing offensive against the PKK rebels is "a limited and
routine action," it added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched military operations in northern
Iraq in the past two years to strike the PKK militants, who have
been fighting a 13-year-old war against the Turkish government for
an independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In spite of Ankara's efforts to play down the operations, Iran
and some Arab countries have condemned Turkey for violating Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, demanding an immediate
withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
A London-based Kurdish television reported Thursday that some
units of the Turkish troops had pulled out of northern Iraq. But
neither the Turkish Foreign Ministry nor its General Staff has
confirmed the reports.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has been disturbed by the PKK rebels who adopted a
hit-and-run tactic and often sought shelter in northern Iraq
during massive Turkish government troop offensives.
</P>
<P>
Turkey sent as many as 50,000 troops into northern Iraq last
May, dealing a heavy blow to the militants there.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon announced today
it would sell advanced air-launched missiles to Turkey and Greece,
two rivals who are both American allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece would buy 20 Harpoon anti-ship missiles for 35 million
U.S. dollars, and both Greece and Turkey would get Advanced
Medium-range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) anti-aircraft missiles,
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Greece would pay 42 million U.S. dollars for 90 AMRAAMs, Turkey
62 million U.S. dollars for 138 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The sales will go ahead unless Congress acts to stop them.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon said the sales "will not adversely affect either the
military balance in the region or U.S. efforts to encourage a
negotiated settlement of the Cyprus question."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, an island in the the Mediterranean Sea, has been
divided since 1974, when Turkey sent in troops to protect the
Turkish minority after a failed coup by Greek officers seeking
union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey claims Greece is threatening regional peace by
supporting plans of Cyprus' Greek-led government to deploy
Russian-made air defense missiles that could reach Turkey's
southern coast.

<HEADLINE> US CEOs Expect Slower Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief executives from some
of the U.S. largest companies expect the economy to lose some
steam but many say their own firms have yet to cool down, The Wall
Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the biannual survey of the U.S. Business Council, a trade
group that represents the biggest U.S. companies, more than three
quarters of the CEOs said that they think the economy will ease to
a moderate growth of 2 percent to 2.75 percent through the middle
of next year.
</P>
<P>
That is significantly slower than the U.S. economy's 4.1
percent growth rate in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, 11 percent reported that their own company's business
is more tepid now than three to six months ago, while 34 percent
said that their business is stronger.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that more than three-quarters of them said
they are having a hard time finding "competent workers", a problem
affecting their location decisions and expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80 percent of the leaders were operating with a leaner
work force and 68 percent were trying to find better ways to
retain employees, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
But only 35 percent of the CEOs said they are paying more to
get the workers they want and about half expect that wages and
salaries will rise no faster next year than they have this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that a slight majority of CEOs said the U.S.
interest rate will be higher by the middle of next year while
nearly half of them expect the dollar to be lower.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Build Trans-Continental Railway Tunnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has planned to build a
trans-continental railway tunnel in its largest city of Istanbul
in a bid to relieve the growing traffic pressure across the
Bosphorus Strait.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, linking Asia and Europe, has been approved by the
the cabinet, said Minister of Transportation Necdet Menzir today.
</P>
<P>
"This project will significantly contribute to solutions to
the transportation, traffic and environmental problems of
Istanbul," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected that the tunnel would be completed in
four years time.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government earlier proposed a third bridge over the
Bosphrous Strait for it was easier and quicker to build but
dropped the plan in the face of strong opposition from the public
who complained it would change the city's skyline.
</P>
<P>
There have already been two bridges, the Bosphrous Bridge and
the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, across the strait. But they are
becoming more and more limited in capacity for vehicles running on
them between Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The population of Istanbul, Turkey's commercial and
transportation center, has been increasing quickly due to large
numbers of migrants from the underdeveloped eastern and
southeastern Turkey, bringing huge pressure on urban traffic.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Japanese Talks over Trade Barriers Conclude </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
ended their annual review of a 1995 auto trade agreement with the
U.S. side expressing disappointment over the lack of progress for
enhancing exports of U.S.-made cars and parts.
</P>
<P>
During the 3-day talks, the United States had presented a
series of proposals on ways that Japan could speed efforts to
remove barriers to sales of both cars and auto parts, said Wendy
Cutler, assistant U.S. Trade Representative who led the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposals included further deregulation of the auto
repair market as a way of boosting sales of U.S.-made brakes and
other replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. auto companies have urged the Clinton administration
to launch a process that could lead to U.S. trade sanctions if
Japan does not speed up its deregulation process.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in San Francisco and included the
participation of trade officials from the 15-nation European
Union, Canada and Australia as observers.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States reached agreement in June 1995 on a
five-year program to expand sales of American and other
foreign-made cars and parts with an annual review required to
monitor progress.
</P>
<P>
Last year sales of U.S. cars in Japan did increase by 34
percent, but sales in the first eight months of this year have
declined by 19 percent. The U.S. overall trade deficit with Japan
has begun to widen after two years of improvement and is running
at an annual rate of 53 billion U.S. dollars, up from a 1996
deficit of 48 billion dollars.
