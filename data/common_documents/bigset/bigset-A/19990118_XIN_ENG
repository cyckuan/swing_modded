<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Hospitalized With Acute Stomach Ulcer Bleeding </HEADLINE>

<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
was taken to the Central Clinical Hospital Sunday with an acute
stomach ulcer bleeding, the presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
He is in stable condition but needs to stay in bed, it added.
"According to doctors, an emergency gastroscopy confirmed the
diagnosis. For the present moment his state is stable, a course
of anti-ulcer therapy was appointed," the Itar-Tass news agency
quoted the presidential press service as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was a second time that Yeltsin was hospitalized since
early last December when he was admitted into the same hospital
for pneumonia, after only three hours in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday ,the 67-year old president planned his first
return to the Kremlin office after the New Year holiday, but
canceled his arrangements without explanation.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman said then that he was in normal health and "is
fit and active."
</P>
<P>
This time, Yeltsin's doctors have "strictly recommended" that
he stay in bed in the coming days, thus throwing in doubt a
France visit scheduled for January 28, his first overseas trip
since last October, when he had to cut short a visit to Central
Asia because of illness.

WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Summoning the ghosts of war dead and the judgment of
history, House prosecutors wrapped up their opening presentation
at President Clinton's impeachment trial Saturday with a call to
restore the "sacred honor" of the presidency lest it become
"deeply and perhaps permanently damaged."
</P>
<P>
-- At least 45 ethnic Albanians were found killed Saturday in

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Issue Tops Arab Ministerial Meeting: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here on Sunday that the Iraqi issue will top the
agenda of an Arab foreign ministers conference slated for January
24.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with the Cairo-based Arab League chief Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, Moussa told reporters that Arab countries will
continue intensive consultations Saturday to ensure success for
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries had originally planned to hold the conference on
December 30 to discuss the Iraqi crisis following the U.S.-British
air strikes on Iraq on December 16-19.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched the strikes for what
they said the Iraqi failure to fully cooperate with the
U.N. weapons inspectors in charge of disarming Iraq of weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Given the differences among the Gulf Arab states, the Arab
League announced a postponement of the conference on December
28. Arab officials have since been engaging in intensive
consultations and preparations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said he briefed Abdel-Meguid on the outcome of the
recent consultations to set the scene for the conference.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of Egypt, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Syria and
Yemen met on January 2 and 13 and discussed the agenda of the
conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing through coordination and calm dialog in order
to serve the Arab interests and grapple with the formidable
problems in the region," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid said the current coordination and consultations
are aimed at ensuring success for the Arab foreign ministers'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will have a "difficult" task, but they will try
to reach a clear Arab position regarding the Iraqi issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed belief that military means "did not and
will not solve the problem regarding Iraq," saying the U.S. and
Britain "do not achieve anything with their use of power."
</P>
<P>
The Arab League, a pan-Arab organization, is "serious" in
seeking ways of getting the economic sanctions, imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait, lifted to end the sufferings of
the Iraqi people, he said.

MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ambassadors from five European
countries to Belarus on Sunday returned here, marking the end of
a 9-month diplomatic dispute.
</P>
<P>
They are from France, Germany, Britain, Greece and

KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged all people in the country to live peacefully
and in harmony together as the month of Ramadhan reminds all of
us.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a message congratulating Ugandan Moslems on
the successful completion of the Holy month of Ramadhan, a press
release from the President's Office said Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the president extended his personal good wishes
and those of the government to the entire Moslem community in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He commended the community for undertaking fasting and prayers
during the month to re-dedicate themselves to the teachings and
principles of Islam which emphasizes discipline, peace and
brotherhood among all mankind.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has a population of roughly 20 million, with 10 percent
of them being Moslems and the rest Christians.
</P>
<P>
Some Moslems were arrested as bombing suspects by the police
authorities in 1998, setting afloat rumors that the government was

<HEADLINE> Lesotho's Airline to Stop Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's national air
service, Air Lesotho, will close down on February 6 owing to heavy
losses, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors of Air Lesotho decided to terminate the
airline's operations following the receipt of a letter from the
chairman of the company, Eddie Absil.
</P>
<P>
SAPA did not say when the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Absil reported that Air Lesotho had been making losses
averaging 20,000 Rand (3300 U.S. Dollars) a month since it was
established following the privatization of the national airline,
Lesotho Airways.
</P>
<P>
Absil said the losses amounted to about three million Rand
(500,000 Dollars) over the 15-month period of operations of Air
Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The Air Lesotho management notified the Lesotho government
that it was unable to bear any more losses as the original
expectations of significant increases in passenger traffic on Air
Lesotho routes had not materialized.
</P>
<P>
It was announced at the weekend that the closure of Air Lesotho
 operations would not affect international air traffic between
Lesotho and Johannesburg as a South African airline would keep on
operating this service.
</P>
<P>
However, Lesotho's domestic air services will be terminated on
January 31.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Kicks off Visit to Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni left for a short working visit to Namibia Sunday at the
invitation of Namibian President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Sunday evening by the President's
Office said that the two heads of state will discuss bilateral
issues as well as issues concerning the region.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the two leaders will hold talks on
the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and other
regional matters.
</P>
<P>
Museveni, accompanied by State Minister of Regional Cooperation
Amama Mbabazi, was seen off at Entebbe International Airport, 45
kilometers south of Kampala, by First Lady Janet Museveni,
Vice-President Specioza Kazibwe and other senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the trip following the announcement of
postponement of the Lusaka summit.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka summit, originally scheduled for this weekend, was
reportedly put off again because DRC President Laurent Kabila
still refused to talk directly with the Tutsi rebels anywhere
outside Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, supported by forces from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and
Chad, has refused to hold face-to-face talks with the rebels
fighting to oust him. With rebels now occupying about 45 percent
land in the third largest African country, the situation there is
becoming increasingly volatile and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
Both regional and international efforts aimed at bring a
military standstill in the country have failed with neither side
agreeing to concede.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Denounces Iraqi Provocation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday condemned
Iraq's non-recognition of the U.N.-demarcated Iraqi-Kuwaiti
border and denied its accusation over the U.S.-British air strikes
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after a weekly cabinet session said "the
cabinet reasserts its rejection and condemnation of these Iraqi
measures and statements which reflect negligence of international
resolutions," the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The moves also constituted provocation against the oil-rich
Gulf emirate, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On January 9, some Iraqi lawmakers urged scrapping U.N.
resolution 833, which demarcates the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border in 1993,
two years after the 1991 Gulf War, set off by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
held Kuwait and Saudi Arabia accountable for Iraq's human and
property losses in the U.S.-British air strikes on December 16-19
because they allowed the two countries to use their airspace and
bases for the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first response from Kuwaiti government ever since.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti cabinet praised other member states of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for their support to Kuwait
and their calls on Iraq to abide by international resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization
established in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Chairs Meeting on Proposals on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday chaired a meeting of senior officials to discuss draft
proposals now on the Security Council table regarding the embargo
imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, an official spokesman said any practical and
fair solution that will keep the region and the world away from
crises and repeated aggressive acts should keep off the
double-standard policy, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
France, the U.S. and Russia proposed plans this week to the
U.N. Security Counil to settle the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
In their plans, France and Russia recommended oil embargo on
Iraq should be lifted and the U.N. Special Commission on disarming
Iraq (UNSCOM) be replaced by a new arms control commission.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. proposed in its plan to allow Iraq to sell as
much oil as it wants, and to keep UNSCOM in place and continue its
mission.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not reveal the details of the meeting,
but reiterated the same measures and arrangements imposed on
Iraq should be adopted against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990 following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait should be lifted totally and immediately, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said what was done concerning Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction was enough and Iraq had fulfilled all its
obligations, adding Israel's weapons of mass destruction should be
dismantled.
</P>
<P>
The matter of reparations Iraq has deserved due to the
aggression since 1991 should be tackled according to the
international law, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Other parties concerned should bear the costs of any
U.N. activity as it was unfair and unacceptable that Iraq born the
costs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reiterated that Iraq's sovereignty, security and
independence should be seriously respected, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting asserted Iraq's determination to protect
its air spaces from the U.S.-British warplanes's violation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its Western allies imposed no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War. Baghdad
denounced them as unauthorized by the U.N. and illegal.
</P>

Present at the meeting were Vice-Chairman of the
Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) Izzat Ibrahim, Vice-President

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Inquiry Into Alleged Legal Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) - Israel's police opened an
intensive investigation Sunday into an alleged legal scandal
which has rocked the law enforcement and political establishment
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The National Fraud Squad of the police summoned two key
figures in the affair for questioning, trying to find out who
is behind a series of forged documents which charged that a
drug case 17 years ago was a judicial scandal, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Yehiam Ohana, a business man living in the north who was
sentenced to two-and-half years in prison in 1982 on conviction
of drug dealings and has been requesting a retrial for the case
over recent years, was questioned by the police for the whole day,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Rachael Lev, who was hired by Ohana to help in his request for
retrial and suspected of forging documents trying to prove his
innocence, was brought to the investigators by the police after
she failed to appear before them citing a nerve breakdown.
</P>
<P>
The case burst into the limelight last week after the local
newspaper Ma'ariv reported that the country's Attorney-General
Elyakim Rubinstein was studying some documents he received
recently which alleged that Ohana was framed 17 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The documents claimed that police officers fabricated the
drug dealing charges against Ohana in an attempt to prevent
one of his close friend from being appointed police chief in
the northern areas.
</P>
<P>
They said the police officers blackmailed the presiding judge
into convicting Ohana, threatening to make public information in
their obsession that the judge raped a young woman and then
sent her to the United States to keep her silent.
</P>
<P>
Involving many people in the law enforcement systems, some
of them holding senior positions nowadays, the reported legal
scandal sent a shock wave around the country.
</P>
<P>
But the whole story soon turned out to be a different
legal scandal. The police and state prosecutor's office said
some of the documents presented to Rubinstein were forged.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Porat, chairman of the parliament's law committee, who
originally received the documents and passed them on to
Rubinstein earlier this month, has said that it is hard for
him to believe that all the documents are forged.
</P>
<P>
He added that he found it "inappropriate" that the police were
conducting the investigation in the affair.
</P>
<P>
"The documents contain very serious allegations regarding the
most senior police officers. Therefore the police is not an
objective body in this case," he said.
</P>
<P>
He and another legislator Doron Shmueli, a close friend of
Ohana, are expected to be questioned about the source of the
documents. The Ma'ariv reporter who first revealed the case is
also expected to be summoned for questioning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ohana denied rumors that he had fallen victim to a
fraud scheme made up by Lev, saying Lev had refused to take money
from him.

of the Eid al-Fitr Monday, the end of the holy month of Ramadan.

The freed are the members of the Islamic Resistance Movement

Hamas spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has also complained
that the current security cooperation between the PNA, Israel and
the U.S. was blocking the Hamas attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In early December, Israel suspended the implementation of the
Wye River peace agreement signed with the PNA last October.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel withdraws its troops from another
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for the PNA's tougher
action on Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Despite the suspension of the peace deal, negotiations between
the two sides are still underway over the security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said Saturday that
he has held meetings with officials of the Palestinian security
services over the past two weeks in a bid to strengthen the
security cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the Israeli general elections in May, it is reported
that the PNA does not hope to have terrorist attacks take place
lest they are capitalized on by the right-wing candidates in the
race.

<HEADLINE> 4th Round of Burundi Peace Talks to Start Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The fourth round of
Burundi peace talks will open Monday amid hopes that economic
sanctions on the tiny central African nation could be lifted,
according to reports reaching here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All factions in Burundi, as well as two former presidents of
the country, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Jean Baptiste Bagaza,
are expected to attend the talks in Arusha, north Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This round of talks will debate on the reconstruction and
development of Burundi, Mark Bomani, an aide to the peace mediator
Julius Nyerere, was quoted as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The past three rounds, also under the chairmanship of Nyerere,
former president of Tanzania and a veteran African statesman, have
debated on the nature of Burundi conflict, democracy and good
governance, and peace and security for all.
</P>
<P>
The talks have been trying to end a bitter ethnic conflict in
which more than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in the past few years in a series of massacres and in armed
conflicts between the Tutsi-dominated army and Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
The new round of talks starts ahead of a scheduled meeting of
the heads of Great Lakes states next Saturday to review progress
attained at the talks and discuss the possibility of fully or
partially suspending economic sanctions imposed on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Major Pierre Buyoya came to power in a military coup in July of
1996, toppling a civilian government led by Ntibantunganya. East
and central African countries, backed by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), imposed sanctions on Burundi shortly after
the incident.

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns Massacre of Albanians in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry Sunday
condemned the recent massacre of Albanian Muslims in Kosovo after
an international observer mission reported mass execution in the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi expressed regret
over the killings over the past two days, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that at least 45 ethnic Albanians were killed, and
their bodies were found at Racak, near Stimlje town, 30 kilometers
south of Pristina, by the Kosovo Verification Mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The tensions in Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia, have
heightened since February 1998 when bloody clashes erupted between
Serbian police and ethnic Albanians who demand independence from
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Asefi voiced concern over the repetition of such tragic events
in Kosovo, saying the Muslim world is concerned about the ongoing
situation in Kosovo and the hardship imposed on Muslims there.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, certain countries' political abuse has
deteriorated the situation in Kosovo, causing further loss of
lives, destruction of houses and displacement of many people in
the cold winter.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify the countries by name.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic of Iran, as the chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, urges immediate halt to
the killings, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Those responsible for such a heinous crimes should be brought
to justice, he added.

<HEADLINE> UK Highest Court to Rehear Pinochet's Immunity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Seven of Britain's most senior
judges will begin on Monday to rehear former Chilean leader
Augusto Pinochet's claim that he is immune from prosecution and
extradition outside Chile.
</P>
<P>
If they find in favor of the retired general, he will be
whisked to a military airfield where a Chilean Air Force plane is
on standby to fly him back to Santiago, the capital city of Chile.
</P>
<P>
But if they rule against him, a series of appeals will follow
on for many months to come.
</P>
<P>
Monday's rehearing is the latest step in a lengthy and complex
legal process.
</P>
<P>
Last November, five judges of the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, ruled by three to two that Pinochet had no immunity
from immunity as a former head of state.
</P>
<P>
Their decision made possible the proceedings to extradite him
to face trial in Spain, where a judge has claimed that Pinochet is
responsible for the deaths and disappearances of 3,000 people
during his 17 year rule in Chile, which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However in December, the House of Lords set aside its own rule
in the previous month, in an unprecedented move which deeply
embarrassed British government law officers.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyers had protested that one member of the
November panel had failed to declare his close links with Amnesty
International, the human right body which strongly support the
charges against Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Amnesty International and the Chilean
government are permitted to intervene in the rehearings on Monday,
which will take place before a new seven-judge panel.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested on October 16 in a London hospital while
recovering from a back operation after receiving the Spanish
extradition request.

<HEADLINE> Two Britons Kidnapped By Men in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Two Britons have been kidnapped
by unidentified men in Yemen, the United Kingdom Foreign Office
confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm that two British people have been kidnapped in
Yemen," a Foreign Office spokesman said. "We are urgently trying
to contact their families. Until we have done that, we will not be
disclosing any further information."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a BBC report said that the two Britons were seized
along with four Dutch citizens while driving in the north of Yemen
and that there was no immediate indication of who was behind the
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping is the latest in a series of such incidents
involving Britons in Yemen. Earlier this month Yemeni tribesmen
seized a British oil worker and then released him a few days
later.
</P>
<P>
Last month, four Western tourists who had been taken hostage in
Yemen were killed during a shootout between militant Islamists and
government forces.

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Yeltsin Hospitalization No Threat to Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Sunday that President Boris Yeltsin felt fine and
that his latest confinement to hospital did not threaten the
stability of Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The president feels fine," Primakov told the Itar-Tass news
agency after Yeltsin was taken to the Central Clinical Hospital
with a bleeding stomach ulcer.
</P>
<P>
"No extraordinary situation has arisen in the country due to
the president's illness," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday evening, presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said that Yeltsin fully preserves his power.
</P>
<P>
"No special decisions or special instructions followed the
hospitalization of the president," Tass quoted Yakushkin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said a planned trip to France on January 28-29 would be
decided by Yeltsin and French President Jacques Chirac. There were
reports saying that Yeltsin could stay in hospital for as long as
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Primakov has been in day-to-day charge of affairs since Yeltsin
appointed him prime minister last September following the
financial crisis in August which brought about the fall of the
previous government.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he was in permanent contact with
Yeltsin and there was no more to the president's illness than the
Kremlin had already announced.
</P>
<P>
Yakushkin, the presidential spokesman, told reporters that he
talked to Yeltsin Sunday afternoon and Yeltsin's voice "is rather
cheerful."
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, the president is upset by some changes in his
schedule which has been drafted for next week," Yakushkin said.
"He is upset as every person who suddenly gets sick. In fact,
nobody likes to start the new year at hospital."
</P>
<P>
This was the second time that Yeltsin was hospitalized since
early last December when he was admitted into the same hospital
for pneumonia, after only three hours in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, planned to return to the Kremlin last Thursday
after the New Year holiday, but canceled his arrangements without
explanation.

<HEADLINE> EU, Polish Ambassadors Return to Minsk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The ambassadors of Britain,
France, Germany, Greece and Poland returned to Minsk Sunday, about
a nearly seven-month absence from the Belarussian capital.
</P>
<P>
The return marks a partial end to a row between Minsk and
Western missions over the diplomatic missions in the Drozdy
compound, site of the residence of Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador of the United States remains at home for
"consultations". It is also not clear whether or when the Japanese
ambassador will return to Minsk.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the EU diplomatic missions, including candidate
countries to the EU, as well as the U.S. and Japan were recalled
last June "for an indefinite period of consultations" due to the
conflict over Drozdy.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the Belarussian Foreign Ministry advised that
ambassadors in Drozdy move out of the compound to other places in
Minsk or in the capital's suburbs as the compound needed
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Many ambassadors described their eviction from Drozdy as a
violation of the convention on diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
Following the ambassadors' departure, some Western countries
imposed a ban on entry visas to most Belarussian leaders.
</P>
<P>
With the return of the diplomats, the ban would be lifted
within weeks, Itar-Tass quoted British Ambassador Jessica Pearce
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Talks on settling the Drozdy row started several months ago and
a compromise was reached last December.
</P>
<P>
"Bygone is bygone," French Ambassador Bernard Fassier said at
the Minsk airport. "We should concentrate now and create effective
cooperation between our countries."
</P>
<P>
According to their December compromise, ambassadors will have
access to Drozdy for a month after their return. They have to move
their residences from Drozdy to other places within the period,
Tass said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Leader Attacked Over Spy Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak was criticized by the government Sunday
for his refusal to sign on a letter calling on Washington to
release an Israeli spy.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a weekly cabinet meeting, Minister
of Immigration and Absorption Yuli Edelstein said Barak's move
will waste the chance for Jonathan Pollard, an ex-U.S. navy
intelligence analyst sentenced to life imprisonment in the U.S. in
1986 for spying for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his "great
disappointment" at the cabinet meeting over Barak's decline to
sign on the letter recently initiated by a ministerial committee,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he had hoped that the government's effort to
get Pollard released will gain national support, adding that this
is a national issue instead of a political one.
</P>
<P>
Edelstein, who is a member of the ministerial committee, said
that the idea was that a letter signed by the leaders of the
ruling party and the main opposition party will greatly enhance
the chance for Pollard's release.
</P>
<P>
But Barak's office contended that Barak prefers a
behind-the-door approach to settle the Pollard issue, saying
Netanyahu's strategy of launching a public campaign has proven
futile.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has repeatedly rejected Israel's
plead for the release of Pollard on humanitarian ground.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has threatened to boycott a signing ceremony of the
Wye River peace deal with the Palestinians in October last year
unless Clinton promised to release Pollard. Clinton rejected the
ultimatum but promised to review the case.
</P>
<P>
Senior aides to the U.S. president have started to submit their
proposals over the issue. But Edelstein said Israel did not know
that they have suggested because some of the aides strongly
opposed the release of Pollard given the severe damage he caused
to the U.S. intelligence.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Bank Warns Against Fake Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia has warned
the public against carrying out foreign exchange transactions on
the streets in view of increased incidences of counterfeit U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
A bank spokesman warned Sunday that the fake 10-thousand-Kwacha
 (one Dollar equals over 2,000 Kwacha) notes that were in
circulation in the Copper Belt have spread to capital Lusaka,
reported the Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that a large amount had been found with a person of
foreign origin by police, who is now helping with the
investigations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said many people had been swindled out of
thousands of genuine U.S. Dollars by street dealers who trick them
into exchanging Dollars with counterfeit notes.
</P>
<P>
It appears that the fake Dollars are thriving on the market
going by the amounts being detected and also the amounts being
used to swindle people out of their genuine Dollar notes, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned shop owners, especially those running night clubs
and bars to be especially careful when transacting in the
10-thousand-Kwacha notes.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Raps U.S. Illegal Access to Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Sunday condemned the
illegal access of a U.S. delegation to northern Iraq via Turkey to
meet leaders of Kurdish warring factions.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed foreign ministry spokesman said a U.S. delegation
led by Elizabeth Joans, the State Department undersecretary
assistant, has entered northern Iraq illegally with a number of
Turkish foreign ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say when the delegation entered northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation met leaders of Kurdish warring factions to
discuss schemes against the Iraqi people, the Iraqi News Agency
quoted the spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The real aim of the Americans is to maintain the status quo of
the Kurdish autonomous region, he added.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
in 1990, the U.S-led western allies set up a no-fly zone in
northern Iraq with a claimed aim of keeping minority Kurds from
Baghdad's oppression. Baghdad has since lost its control over the
region.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Turkey Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic
Union of Kurdistan in northern Iraq signed a peace deal in
September 1998 after seven years of fighting for the control over
the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it has become very clear that foreign
interferences coming from Turkish territories have complicated the
situation in northern Iraq and pushed it toward a tragic direction
that threatened the life and security of the Kurdish people.
</P>
<P>
He called for an immediate end to these interferences in
Iraq's internal affairs so that the Iraqi central government's
authority will be re-established in the region and prosperity of
Iraqi people can be achieved.

CAIRO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here Sunday that he and his Jordanian and Palestinian
counterparts have planned to hold a meeting on the stalled
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that the three ministers will meet in
Jordan's capital Amman in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
He did not specify the time of the meeting due to what Egypt's
Middle East News Agency said the officials' engagements in the
following weeks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes as part of the continued discussions of and
coordination of stances on the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks
among the three parties, the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
The peace process between the Palestinians and Israel has come
to a standstill after the Jewish state froze the implementation of
the Wye accord and decided to hold early general elections on May
17.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by the two sides last October in
Washington, Israel should withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank in three phases. But the accord was suspended by Israel
only after the first phase was carried out in early December as
Israel accused the Palestinians of igniting violence against it.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to shelve the accord unless the
Palestinians meeting conditions including collecting illegal
weapons, reducing police forces, which the Palestinians denounced
as requirements not stipulated in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the two Arab countries which have conceived
peace with Israel, have been actively mediating the peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel.

plan to enhance the Jordanian economy.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the plan includes cutting budget deficit,

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Elephant Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Wildlife Service
(KWS) will start a five-day aerial count of elephants in the Tsavo
game park from Monday in a move to help gauge the impact of
renewed ivory trade in African elephant range countries.
</P>
<P>
Paula Kahumbu, the scientific advisor to the KWS director, said
in a statement issued Sunday that 10 aircrafts and some 40
personnel on the ground, including wildlife experts from South
Africa and Zimbabwe will take part in the census.
</P>
<P>
The tenth conference of the Convention of International Trade in
 Endangered Species (CITES), held in Harare, Zimbabwe, 1997,
re-opened an experimental ivory trade by allowing three southern
African nations to sell a shipment of ivory to Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, CITES agreed at the meeting that should elephant
populations in other African countries become threatened, the
permit would be cancelled.
</P>
<P>
But Kenya is among countries which fear that even a limited
lifting of the ban on the ivory trade will revive the large scale
poaching of earlier years.
</P>
<P>
"The need to establish the status of the Tsavo elephant
population is now imperative in order to be able to gauge the
impact of a reopening of trade in ivory,'' Kahumbu said.
</P>
<P>
The Tsavo Game Park, Kenya's largest game park, saw big threats
of the extinction of elephants by illegal poaching in the 1970s
and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
By 1988, the number of elephants in Tsavo had fallen to 5,363
from more than 45,000 in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"After 1988, intensive anti-poaching efforts were rewarded, and
by 1994 the elephant population in Tsavo had risen to over
7,000,'' said Kahumbu.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has not had the cash until now to monitor the situation
accurately but now hopes to repeat the survey every year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Consults U.S. on Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's top financial
officials met Sunday with U.S. officials, seeking ways to keep
Latin America's largest economy from succumbing to an Asian-style
currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan and central bank
president Francisco Lopes met U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
The two Brazilian officials also met officials at the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank on Saturday
and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Officials described the talks as a wide-ranging review of steps
Brazil already has taken and what needs to be done to calm
investor unease.
</P>
<P>
Malan told reporters that Brazil may ask for early release of
the next installment of the 41.5 billion U.S. dollars rescue
package that the IMF put together for Brazil in November.
</P>
<P>
Brazil has received nine billion U.S. dollars of the package
already, and a similar amount was scheduled to be released next
month.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets around the world staged big gains on the news
as investors demonstrated relief that the government of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso would no longer be wasting the country's
dwindling foreign reserves to prop up the currency.
</P>
<P>
Private economists warned that investor sentiment could sour
quickly unless Brazil moves much more forcefully to address
underlying problems, including the government's huge budget
deficit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges NATO to Look at Military Option in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The United States urged the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Sunday to take a hard
look at military options as a fragile cease-fire unraveled in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do all that we can do to preserve the
cease-fire," State Department spokesman James Rubin said as NATO
ambassadors prepared to take up the latest crisis in an emergency
session in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The White House held a second day of strategy meetings, and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called allied leaders to
discuss bloody developments in the Serb province.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also denounced as "complete nonsense" an accusation by
Serbia's deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, that the United
States and Britain were training the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
"for fighting and propaganda."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was working on his State of
the Union message, was kept informed of Kosovo developments by
Sandy Berger, his national security assistant.
</P>
<P>
Berger's deputy, James Steinfield, presided over a meeting of
senior officials from the State Department, the Pentagon and other
parts of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
It was their second meeting in two days on Kosovo.
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and Undersecretary of
Defense Walter Slocombe were among participants.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's a very difficult situation and an outrage to
everybody," David Leavy, the spokesman for the National Security
Council, said of the massacres in southern Kosovo of 45 ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Rubin said, "The Serb return to the area was a
provocation, with the predictable result of instigating these
clashes." The statement blamed the massacre on Serb security
forces.
</P>
<P>
The White House and State Department urged both Serbs and
ethnic Albanians to uphold a cease-fire declared in October when
American mediator Richard Holbrooke brokered an agreement with
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Milosevic promised in October to pull out
special Serb police units and to contain Yugoslav troops.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Cuba Denounce Neglect of U.N. Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Cuba on Monday
indirectly denounced the United States and Britain for bypassing
the United Nations in dealing with international issues,
according to the Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released after talks in Moscow, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and his Cuban counterpart Roberto
Robaina Gonzalez expressed "deep concern" over attempts to upset
the international relations system established by the U.N..
</P>
<P>
These principles, which took shape after World War II and are
based on the U.N. Charter, should be respected by all members of
the world body, stressed the two ministers, indirectly referring
to the bombing last month of Iraq by the United States and
Britain without the approval of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched air strikes because the
Iraqi administration refused the U.N. arms inspection team's
access to some sensitive sites which were suspected of being
factories used to produce weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Moscow strongly opposed using force against Iraq without U.N.
approval, but this was ignored by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
They "emphasized that the principle of not using force, the
threat of force or any other measure of coercion or diktat
enshrined in the U.N. Charter is imperative in character, is
binding on all states and places a categorical ban on all
military and coercive measures and all other actions, such as
blockades, embargoes and other such actions, that have not been
sanctioned by the world community," said the statement entitled
"In Support of the United Nations".
</P>
<P>
"The charter itself contains direct and clear provisions for
exceptions to the ban, under which the U.N. Security Council
alone enjoys the authority to sanction coercive measures aimed at
maintaining or restoring international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to bypass the Security Council may undermine the
existing mechanism of peace maintenance, produce chaos in
international affairs and lead to primacy of force over
international law.
</P>
<P>
"A special place in the process of U.N. reforms belongs to
work to rationalize the operation of the Security Council. The
fact that the U.N. Security Council bears the main responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security, as laid
down in the Charter, must not be questioned under any
circumstances," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Any decision to enlarge the Security Council must "strictly
comply with the principle of fair geographic representation and
be widely agreed, ideally being based on the consensus of the
U.N. member countries."
</P>
<P>
The ministers said that the U.N. was the "only universal
international organization that is aimed at accumulating efforts
by the world community to agree on principles for the resolution
of conflict situations and the strengthening of the international
security and stability system based on the U.N. Charter".
</P>
<P>
Robaina, who arrived here Sunday evening on a working visit,
is scheduled to meet Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
the speakers of both houses of the Russian parliament on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Major News Item in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's legal team on Tuesday plans to lay out
a defense that will plunge into the conflict-laden factual
record about the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky
and the statement she made under oath about it -- a shift from a
previous strategy that emphasized that none of the charges
against Clinton merited removal from office, even if true.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Divided NATO delegates in Brussels, confronted with
growing violence in Kosovo, called on President Slobodan
Milosevilc of Yugoslavia to respect a cease-fire, but backed off
reviving NATO plans from last fall to bomb Serbian targets in
Kosovo and Sebia proper.
</P>
<P>
-- The Defense Department said it was dropping its demand
that Scott Ritter, a former United Nations arms inspector in
Iraq, provide it with advance copies of a book in which he is
expected to step up his criticism of the Clinton Administration.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- After 18 months of watching one currency after another
succumb to global speculators, Argentina is talking about taking
the ultimate step: getting out of the national currency business
altogether.
</P>
<P>
-- Yeltsin was hospitalized with what aides said was a
bleeding ulcer, reviving concerns over his ability to govern. A
spate of ailments and absences have kept the Russian president,
in whose hands the constitution puts enormous power, sidelined
amid political and financial crises. He may not go to France on
January 28.

<HEADLINE> Jansen Forced to Leave Palace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jansen, 21, completed his signing with Blackburn on Monday,
making him the sixth striker in the club at a price of four
million pounds (6.62 million U.S. dollars) for him.
</P>
<P>
The England under-21 striker agreed to a six-year deal with
Rovers only five months after signing a similar contract at
Palace.
</P>
<P>
"Aston Villa and Southampton showed an interest in me during
the summer and the chairman asked if I wanted to sign a long-term
deal which I was happy to do," said Jansen.
</P>
<P>
"I never asked to leave Palace. It was just the financial
situation there, otherwise I would have stayed."
</P>
<P>
Jansen will have to fight it out with five other strikers for
a starting slot at Rovers but does not expect to be left out of
the side.
</P>
<P>
"I am a confident player. I believe in my own ability and I
think I am worth a place in the team. Everyone is playing for
their places but I think I can hold my own."
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Jansen has increased speculation that Brian
Kidd is ready to sell one of his other strikers and assistant
manager Tony Parkes admitted players will soon be leaving the
club.
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be Einstein to work out that, we can't keep
all of them happy when they are all fit," said Parkes.
</P>
<P>
"There may be some unrest and Brian Kidd will deal with that
when it happens."
</P>
<P>
Kevin Davies, Nathan Blake and Ashley Ward have all arrived in
the last few months to complement regulars Chris Sutton and Kevin
Gallacher.
</P>
<P>
Parkes added that Kidd, who is off duty with flu, had rated
Jansen highly ever since last season when he underwent a trial at
Manchester United, where Kidd was assistant manager.
</P>
<P>
Jansen, then with Carlisle United, turned down an offer to
move to Old Trafford and instead headed south to Palace.
</P>
<P>
Kidd, who took over from Roy Hodgson in December, has also
bought winger Keith Gillespie and is interested in Liverpool
midfielder Jason McAteer and teenage midfielder Seth Johnson of
first division Crewe Alexandra.

<HEADLINE> Europe, India Cooperation Meeting to Be Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indian business people and
entrepreneurs will soon have an opportunity to compare notes with
their European counterparts when a cooperation meeting is held in
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the meeting was announced here on Monday by the
joint commission of the European Union and India.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, to be known as the Europartenariat or European
cooperation, will attract more than 350 Indian companies that
expect to benefit from the European Union's Asia Invest Program
which encourages business link-ups between Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is slated for March 15 and 16.
</P>
<P>
At the time being, the European Union is India's largest
trading partner, with a 26-percent share of the country's exports
and a 25-percent share of its imports.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the European Union and India has grown
from 14 billion ECU (16.3 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994 to 19.7
billion ECU (23 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Though India's total imports have picked up, European Union's
exports to this Asian country have receded, resulting in a trade
deficit of 340 million ECU (397.8 million dollars) for the first
time in this decade on the part of the union, according to the
union's statistical bureau Eurostat.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were
killed and 11 others critically injured as a fierce storm system
packing several tornadoes raced across western Tennessee in the
United States on Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Six people died when a tornado whipped through Madison County,
said Kurt Pickering, spokesman for the state's Emergency
Management Agency. At least 71 county residents were hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Three of the deaths occurred in a subdivision south of
downtown Jackson, a town of nearly 50,000 in west-central
Tennessee. At least 60 homes and businesses in the Jackson area
were damaged or shattered. A new Tennessee National Guard armory
and two UH-60 helicopters were destroyed at McKellar-Sipes
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Officials have opened two shelters to house the victims. Extra
state troopers and military police have been dispatched to the
area.
</P>
<P>
In Henderson County, 40 kilometers east of Jackson, about 30
homes were damaged or destroyed. A woman's body was discovered in
the ruins of her home and her husband was seriously injured,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Another person was killed in Hardeman County in southwestern
Tennessee, authorities said, but details on the death were not
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
The tornadoes also cut power in many areas as high winds
ripped tree limbs and power lines.
</P>
<P>
The storm died down in Tennessee as it headed east early
Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of
Bangladesh's Jatiya Sangsad, the country's parliament, will start
on January 25, the official BSS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
President Shahabuddin Ahmed will make an inaugural address
explaining the government politics and programs in fulfilling the
constitutional obligation, on the opening day of the 12th session
of the seventh parliament, which was elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The session is expected to see fierce debating on the country's
economic situation following the trimming of the Annual
Development Program due to the over-two-month-long flood last
year. The ruling and opposition parties will also deliberate on
the country's crucial political situation with focus on the city
corporation and municipal elections scheduled for late February.
</P>
<P>
On the legislative aspect, the Civil Procedural (Amendment)
Bill 1998, which was passed by the parliament in its last session
and sent to the president for assent, will be placed before the
parliament again for reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in the country that the president
returned a bill with a note of dissent.
</P>
<P>
One fresh bill seeking provision of legal aid to the poor will
be introduced before the parliament, which is expected to deal
with all the 10 bills sent to different standing committees during
its last session last November.
</P>
<P>
The bills include the Bangladesh Law's Revision and Declaration
(Second Amendment) Bill 1998 and the Transplantation of Limbs and
Organs in Human Body Bill 1998.
</P>
<P>
The parliament secretariat has started working ahead of
schedule, as government offices enjoy a three-day holiday for
Eid-ul-Fitr starting Monday, but the parliament secretariat's
officials and employees get two days off only.
</P>
<P>
And after Eid, the parliament secretariat will function in
double shifts on week days for the smooth conduct of the winter
session and will work one shift even on Friday, one of the
country's two weekly holidays, the BSS said.

computer grade examination, said that it has lost over 500,000
yuan because it has had to recall all of the 16,000 software
products it has so far sold.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenming, the former director of the company's new
product development department, was picked up by police after
evidence of his crime was discovered, including the computer code
of the virus and printed documents of the program design.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has confessed and revealed that his actions were revenge
against a company director with whom he had a disagreement. He
took advantage of his power in the company to input a foreign
virus in the company's new products, which had been under
development since December last year.
</P>
<P>
The case is still being investigated and most of the software
products sold have already been returned to the company.
</P>
<P>
Wuyou has manufactured 20,000 copies of the new software and
said that news of the virus affecting its products has damaged
its reputation among customers who are mainly schools.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Licensing for Telecom Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) today issued the first batch of special licenses
for 18 Chinese and foreign telecommunication equipment
manufacturers in a bid to combat smuggling and the marketing of
inferior goods and to encourage foreign companies to transfer
technology to China.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, China restructured the licensing system for
telecommunication equipment which previously was controlled by
several authorities, putting all the power into the hands of MII.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, director-general of the Bureau of
Telecommunications Administration of MII, said that past
experience proved that many overseas-funded companies failed to
meet their commitment on technology transfer and export goals.
Instead, Zhang noted that they refused or delayed technology
transfer using various excuses and sold almost every item of
their product range in the China market.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, telecommunications equipment made by
both Chinese and foreign companies for the domestic market will
have a special tag attached to it. Products without the tag
cannot be sold or used in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that it is also designed to combat rampant
smuggling that threatens the survival of China's
telecommunication equipment manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent smugglers from attaching fake tags to
products, the tags are fitted with anti-piracy technology. MII is
to phase out all old tags under the previous licensing system
within 12 months, the first to be abolished will be those on
mobile phones, which are part of a massive smuggling racket.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will also carry out ongoing quality inspection on
the products of those companies that have obtained licenses.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee service quality to license applicants, M
II has set up two administration centers in Beijing. It has also
abolished the practice of issuing licenses on the quota basis.
Instead, various models can be sold in unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
Among the first companies that obtained licenses today are
Shanghai Bell, Motorola and Nokia.

<HEADLINE> China's Engineering Consultants Reject Projects Without Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling engineering
consultancy sector is being encouraged to say "no" to projects
which don't have approval in a bid to avoid mistakes and ensure
the smooth implementation of the state's macroeconomic goals.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the economy, China will focus on increasing
investments in infrastructure this year to expand domestic
consumer demand. Experts predict that investment in fixed assets
in 1999 will most probably excel that of last year's
approximately 2.8 trillion yuan as the central government has
decided to continue pro-active fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
So, in the early stages, consultancy for many projects,
especially key state projects, as well as project management and
quality, has become an important factor in stabilizing
macroeconomic growth and enabling the right decisions to be made.
</P>
<P>
The three-day second session of the China National Association
of Engineering Consultants, which began here today, focuses on
how the sector will provide better services for government
departments and various project owners taking into account the
current difficult economic situation.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the opening ceremony, Li Rongrong,
vice-minister of the State Development Planning Commission, asked
the consultancy sector to help promote China's investment and
capital pooling system reform, starting with project quality.
</P>
<P>
The sector should also get actively involved in mapping out
the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005) and macroeconomic control
policies, as well as in research areas of great significance, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the sector to provide all round and through-process
consulting for projects, especially those involving key state
infrastructure, to help the government guarantee the quality of
preliminary project consultancy and appraisal in a move to
effectively speed up economic development and avoid waste of
effort in construction.
</P>
<P>
Over a long period of time, decision-making on major
infrastructure projects was mainly made by central and local
leaders without any consultation. Beginning in the early 1980s,
China introduced the consultany practice which incorporated the
need for feasibility studies. Now, some 2,000 approved
consultancy companies in China have opened up with the emphasis
on ensuring that the right decisions are made in advance of
actions being taken.
</P>
<P>
Practice shows that projects which have enjoyed consultancy
advice have yielded good results. However, some projects turned
out to be a failure as the consultancies involved gave the go
ahead merely so that they could benefit, along with the owners.
</P>
<P>
Sector insiders are now calling for much tighter control over
this kind of malpractice.

<HEADLINE> China Still Mulling About Nagano Games Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The skaters who desperately wanted to end China's winter
Olympic gold drought were once again hurtled to the ground when
they
only managed five silvers in Nagano despite they had triumphed in
a series of world-level competitions and produced a couple of
world records in their run-up to the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I've never thought of finishing without a single gold with so
many world class skaters in the team," Xin Qingshan, head coach
of the Chinese national team, said during the China's Ninth
National Winter Games here.
</P>
<P>
Xin, 38, who started his short track coaching career in 1983,
ascribed the loss mostly to his coaching ability.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one to blame most. I didn't expect such a big loss,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The other reason is tactical immaturity of the skaters, for
it's the first Olympics for most of them," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (S), who won three silvers in women's 500-, 1,000-
and 3,000-meter relay in Nagano, said she would never forget the
feeling in the Olympic Games. "I was so nervous that I could
hardly control my movements," said the two-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
"I have benefited a lot from the Olympic experience," said
Yang Yang (A), who took a silver in the women's 1,000m in Nagano.
"Now I am no longer afraid to compete against South Koreans or
Canadians."
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (A), who led the national squad to their best-ever
World Cup performance in 1998, won the overall champion in the
World Cup Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang (S) and Wang Chunlu finished second and third
respectively in the World Cup overall rankings last season while
Li Jiajun topped the men's overall standings.
</P>
<P>
"We shifted our training method by concentrating on the
understanding of the rules and the comprehensive capability for
the competition," said the 24-year-old Li.
</P>
<P>
"A nation-wide known psychologist gives us class every week
and we study video tape recording of competitions three times a
week," added Li, who narrowly missed the Olympic title as South
Korean Kim Dong-Sung stuck out his right foot from behind at the
finish to win the men's 1,000m in Nagano.

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Square Face-lift Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The long awaited renovation of
Beijing's famous Tiananmen Square was kick-started today when the
first new paving stone was laid in the world's largest city
square.
</P>
<P>
Huge industrial machines and busy workers have replaced
tourists on the 880 meters long and 500 meters wide square, and
stacks of pink granite slabs are piled up near the Mao Zedong
Memorial Hall.
</P>
<P>
The first paving stone was laid within the confines of the
memorial hall. All the old stones will be replaced by special
new ones, shipped in from nearby Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
They are said to be wear and tear proof and have a more
beautiful finish.
</P>
<P>
Last year city authorities said that the Memorial Hall will
reopen on March 15, 1999, so the renovation of that area must be
completed efficiently.
</P>
<P>
Renovation of the whole square will be completed by July
ready for the grand celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary of
the founding of the People's Republic on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The project includes replacing paving slabs throughout the
square as well as around the confines of the Mao Zedong Memorial
Hall, improving lighting around the periphery of the square,
renewing the loudspeaker systems, installing new fountains and
repairing underground pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to end up with a 21st century style square which
will reflect China's modern, new capital which was once the
center of the world in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
The first renovation of the Tiananmen square took place in
1959 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of New
China but much of the square is now out of date and it needed
upgrading to maintain its political and historical importance.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Economy Grows by 9.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's economy grew by a
remarkable 9.7 percent in 1998 over the previous year to reach
some 200.9 billion yuan (about 25 billion U.S. dollars), despite
the negative influence of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The figure exceeds the nine-percent target set by the
municipal government at the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qi, deputy major of Beijing, attributed the achievement to
the surging internal market demands as well as the investments in
infrastructure. Increased bonds and bank loans have also
contributed to the result.
</P>
<P>
An average Beijing resident's annual income hit 8,500 yuan
(about 1,000 U.S. dollars) in 1998, an increase of 6.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Witnesses Rapid Insurance Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's total insurance
premiums for 1998 reached 124.73 billion yuan, up 14 percent from
the previous year, according to statistics released here today by
the China Insurance Regulatory commission (CIRC).
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the premiums for property insurance was 49.96 billion
yuan, up three percent over 1997, while that for health and
accidental injuries insurance increased 18 percent to 6.5 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September of 1998, the total assets of the
insurance sector reached 199.08 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's insurance sector has enjoyed rapid development over
the past few years in line with the deepening of the reform and
opening policies, with the premiums rising by 37.6 percent
annually, according to Ma Yongwei, President of the CIRC.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that the insurance sector has made a great
contribution to the country's economic and social development, as
it paid business tax of 4.82 billion yuan and various
compensations worth 55.59 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the year there were 25 insurance companies set
up, including four state-owned, nine private share-holding, and
12 overseas-funded, which offered cover for 1,000 different items.
</P>
<P>
The sector continued its efforts to open to the outside world,
and so far, 14 overseas-funded insurance companies have been or
are being set up in the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, 113 foreign companies from 17 countries
have set up 202 representative offices in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, domestic insurance firms have also spared no
efforts in tapping the overseas market. By the end of last year,
Chinese insurance companies had set up 33 branches and eight
representative offices overseas.
</P>
<P>
Ma acknowledged that the country's insurance market also faces
some problems, such as poor management and needed an improvement
in its assets quality. He pointed out that the CIRC will
strengthen its efforts to standardize the market to guard against
risk.
</P>
<P>
According to Ma, the sector will pay more attention to
readjust insurance structures and improve its management to make
firms more competitive on the domestic and world markets.

ter said. "It is a link in a chain of events which have occurred
in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
He called for direct negotiations between Belgrade and the
Kosovo Albanian leadership, saying that "the political settlement
in Kosovo has been slipping".
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian First Deputy Foreign
Minister Alexander Avdeyev is expected to go to Belgrade shortly,
possibly on Tuesday, for talks with Yugoslav leaders, Interfax
reported, quoting informed sources.
</P>
<P>
Avdeyev's visit was planned before the latest killing of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, but his talks with the Belgrade
leaders will focus on the discovery of 45 murdered Albanians in
Kosovo over the weekend, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> 98-Year-Old Lonely Heart Receives 11 Responses of Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Eleven women aged between 25
and 80 had by this afternoon responded to a marriage
advertisement made by a 98-year-old man a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kebiao, who was born in 1900, placed the advertisement
in the Shenjiang Service Herald, a newspaper in Shanghai. In the
advertisement he said that after the death of his wife in 1997 he
first felt free but gradually a year later found that he was
lonely and realized the profound truth that "half of a man is
woman"; thus he was seeking a companion to "banish his
loneliness."
</P>
<P>
Zhang included two stipulations: the woman must understand the
truth that "half of a woman is man" and she must be able to
communicate with him.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, a native of Haining City, Zhejiang Province, studied in
Japan and was awarded a doctoral degree when he was young. After
his return from Japan, he worked in Shanghai as editor of a
magazine, established a literature society, wrote essays and
fiction, and was well-known in the literary community of Shanghai
in the 1920s and 1930s.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zhang lives in Haining and is able to take care of
himself. He asked a friend to place the marriage advertisement in
the Shanghai newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that the 11 respondents have all expressed
their respect for Zhang's knowledge and achievements and said
that they are willing to keep him company during the last years
of life.
</P>
<P>
"It won't matter if she is old or young and she can remarry
after my death,' Zhang said. He added that he is paid an average
of more than 700 yuan in retirement pension each month, which is
boosted by occasional author's fees.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper official said that the names of the respondents
will be forwarded to Zhang and appointments will be arranged in
accordance with his instructions.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Calls for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Monday urged the Iranian nation to close ranks as
rival factions were bogged down in political quarrels over
mysterious murders of dissidents in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peace is a must in the country in order to solve the economic
problems of the people, Khamenei said at the ceremony to mark the
Eid Fitr, the last day of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He said that some people in the country are trying to harm the
unity of the nation by writing and saying futile things, the
Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian conservatives and moderates have been engaged in a
white-hot wrangling after the conservative-dominated Intelligence
Ministry admitted that some of its own agents were involved in
serial political murders of an opposition leader, his wife and
three dissident intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who control most of the country's organs,
openly accused supporters of the moderate President Mohammad
Khatami of being behind the murders and attempting to seize the
Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the moderates called for the resignation of
Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi and a fundamental
change in the country's security and intelligence system
following the killings.
</P>
<P>
"The Muslim and revolutionary people of Iran respect all the
manifestations of unity and believe whatever that harms unity
comes from the devil," the Iranian leader said, "therefore, it is
essential that all gatherings throughout the country be held
peacefully and honorably."
</P>
<P>
Those who for their short-term interests, want to create a
wave in the pacific ocean of the Iranian nation and disturb the
people, should know that they will get nothing out of their
attempt, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei also expressed regret to the outbreak of tensions in
the course of Friday prayers congregations in certain cities over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a group of hard-liners attacked the Friday prayers
congregation in Isfahan and did not allow the pro-moderate Friday
prayers leader Ayatollah Jalaluddin Taheri to deliver his speech.
</P>
<P>
Taheri was forced to cancel the Friday prayers congregation
and his body guards were forced to shoot to the air after a group
of assailants cut off laud speakers and hurled objects to him.
</P>
<P>
Taheri, well-known for his support for President Khatami,
withdrew in October from the election of the Experts Assembly, a
powerful body to elect or dismiss the supreme leader, in a
protest to the conservative Guardian Council for disqualifying
moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, Khamenei urged leaders of Friday prayers throughout
the country to refrain from raising issues which may result in
division and discord.
</P>
<P>
Following the admittance of the Intelligence Ministry, some
Friday prayers leaders called for an open trial on those arrested
in connection with political killings in order to find out those
behind the curtain.

<HEADLINE> Examinations to Improve Quality of China's Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Police throughout China now
have to face assessment tests every five years which check their
qualifications and effectiveness, a procedure which will gauge if
they can retain their jobs, said an official with the Ministry of
Public Security today.
</P>
<P>
The measure is aimed at improving the overall quality of
police and encourage a merit certification system, said Tian
Qiyu, vice-minister of public security, adding that the directors
of public security bureaus at county level should also be
expected to sit an examination before taking up their posts.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 510,000 members of police forces in
36 of China's larger cities, and public security departments in
railway, transport, civil aviation, and other sectors, had taken
such exams, with one percent failing.
</P>
<P>
Those with college education make up more than 30 percent of
the total number of police , but there are only 22.5 percent of
the police who actually graduated from police schools. The
overall quality of police at the grass-roots level is a continual
worry for the government, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the examination system will be expanded from the
existing city locations to public security departments at
prefecture and county levels this year, with 600,000 police
expected to take the exam.

<HEADLINE> Defense Lawyers Withdraw from Lesotho Mutiny Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- All six defense lawyers
have withdrawn from the trial of 50 Lesotho soldiers in Maseru,
capital of Lesotho, South African Press Association reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the soldiers' legal team, Khalaki Sello
said they withdrew because they objected to the trial being held
within the precinct of a maximum security prison.
</P>
<P>
"A trial within a prison could send only one signal that the
accused would spend some time at the place," Sello said.
</P>
<P>
There was a sharp exchange between Sello and the judge-advocate
Brendan Cullinan, after Sello claimed the trial was a political
one.
</P>
<P>
Sello said the charges were political since the soldiers were
not being tried for murder or stock theft, but he later withdrew
this accusation.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was adjourned until Tuesday to enable the accused
to decide on alternative legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
The 50 soldiers have been charged with mutiny following an
uprising in the Lesotho Defense Force in September last year, when
junior officers dismissed nearly 30 senior officers.
</P>
<P>
The junior officers arrested the commander of the Lesotho
Defense Force and forced him to make a statement over Radio
Lesotho that he had dismissed the senior officers and that he had
personally resigned.
</P>
<P>
This led to widespread unrest erupting on September 22 which a
task force from South Africa and Botswana were sent to quell.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Expresses Concerns Over Factory Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Following a boiler explosion
which injured a number of people earlier this week, Chinese
president Jiang Zemin has telephoned a senior official in the
State Economic and Trade Commission about the incident in
northwest China's Ningxia Autonomous Region, urging him and his
colleagues to place great importance on people's lives.
</P>
<P>
I saw the news on TV and it made me very uneasy. The
quality of boilers and similar high-pressure containers within
state properties can affect people's lives. There should be no
negligence," Jiang told Sheng Huaren, director of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, on January 16.
</P>
<P>
Jiang urged Sheng to increase quality control inspection of
such products, as the commission is responsible for safe
production. He added that any hidden danger must be removed and
ample precautions be taken when boilers are in operation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the country had introduced a tight safety
mechanism dozens of years ago, but now it has become lax again in
some aspects and the situation is very dangerous. Therefore,
lessons should be learned from such incidents to ensure perfect
safety.
</P>
<P>
The explosion two days ago caused a big fire and injured a
number of people.
</P>
<P>
For the past month China has been hit by a series of
explosions, the collapse of buildings and bridges and other
incidents, many of them the results of poor construction owing to
the corruption of officials.
</P>
<P>
The commission has decided to take a series of measures to
implement Jiang's instructions, including closing firms illegally
engaged in producing boilers, improving inspection controls, and
punishing officials responsible for such incidents.

<HEADLINE> Revolution of Learning, Reference Not Guidance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The controversial book
"Revolution of Learning" should only be regarded as a reference
work rather than as a definitive guide for everyone, said a
Chinese scientist.
</P>
<P>
If everyone thinks and studies in the way mentioned in the
book, it will be contradictory to the book's theme, which is
"innovation", said Prof. Yang Xiongli, an expert with the
Shanghai Research Institute of Physiology.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese company has said it will invest a total of 100
million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) into the sales
promotion of the book throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yang has also showed dissatisfaction over some
misinterpretation in the translated version of the book. In an
extreme case, the Chinese version of the book said "the ce
rebellum, or brain stem controls many of your instincts, such as
breathing and heart beat." But even a middle school student knows
that the cerebellum is in charge of the body's motor senses.
</P>
<P>
"It is acceptable for the 'Revolution of Learning' to suggest
that study is the only way to adjust oneself to the information
society," Yang said, "but it is misleading for it to advocate the
same learning style for everybody."
</P>
<P>
He said he does not agree with the Chinese promoter of the
book, who claimed that they will sell 10 million copies of the
book in China which it hoped would allow the whole of the
nation's younger generation to study in accordance with the
book's methods.
</P>
<P>
It is also unacceptable if administrative and education
departments are involved in the promotion activities, said Yang,
who is also an academician of the China Academy of Sciences.

CHANGSHA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified man, who
could be a rural migrant, might be responsible for the bus
explosion which left four people seriously wounded last night in
this capital of central China's Hunan province.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witness, Fu Yong, a 16-year-old student, said that he saw
the man put a lighted cigarette into a big sack he had brought
onto the bus, and then the sack exploded.
</P>
<P>
"The young man looked like a farmer who was in the city
looking for temporary work. He was dressed in tatty clothing and
was generally scruffy. He smoked continuously as he traveled and
when the bus approached a major stop, he put the dog-end into a
sack he had with him, got off the bus and the explosion
followed." added Fu.
</P>
<P>
But police did not confirm this account, saying that the
incident is still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Thirty seven passengers were hurt, including four severely.
Hospital sources said that after emergency treatment all were now
out of danger.
</P>
<P>
The most severely wounded was a 40-year-old woman who lost
both her legs. She was in a state of shock after losing too much
blood, according to Li Yuedong, an executive of the Changsha No.1
People's Hospital. Surgeons were forced to amputate her legs to
save her life. Another two persons have now also had legs
amputated.

<HEADLINE> Muslims in Somalia Celebrate Eid-Al-Fitri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Somali capital Mogadishu
is made very colorful Monday by thousands of people cheering and
chanting to celebrate the occasion of Eid-Al-Fitri following the
culmination of the Holy month of Ramadan on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Children wore new clothes and blew sirens and balloons, while
hundreds more of them played with toy guns and pistols
impersonating the street fighters of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The main mosques of the capital and the major towns of Somalia
mainly read the Takbiir which is always recited on the two Islamic
holy festivals, Eld Al-Fitri and the Eid Al-Ad-ha on the
pilgrimage season.
</P>
<P>
Families paid visits to their relatives and shared large meals
and sweets with them, while the poor were offered food alms and
money. However, as usual, everything is disputed in Somalia be it
political, social or religious especially since the civil war
began in the country nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
An Islamic group which calls itself "Ahlu Sunna Wal-Jama" had
been asking people on Sunday night not to recognize the sighting
of the moon by the other religious groups and the ordinary
civilians as well. Messages to refuse the Eid Al-Fitri had been
broadcast Sunday night on a radio run by Ahlu Sunna Wal-Jama in
south Mogadishu calling on the people to continue fasting and
fulfill their daily obligations,
</P>
<P>
Early Monday morning as most of the mosques began reciting the
Takbiir, others have opened their business stalls and Koranic
schools ordering their demoralized offspring to take their daily
lessons in accordance with the norms of their affiliated group's
wishes. Nonetheless, there has not been any face-to-face dispute
or disturbances anywhere in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The Eid Al-Fitri was exceptionally observed in the main street
of Makka Al-Mukarramah in the heart of the city known as Bermuda
neighborhood, where the governor of the disputed administration
of Mogadishu, Hussein Ali Ahmed, has opened it for circulation
after nine years of closure due to the civil strife.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people strolled in the street gingerly just to see
how devastating the war had been. Over 70 percent of Bermuda area
had been ruined by clan clashes in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Ali Ahmed also inaugurated a new campaign in cleaning the
street of Makka Al-Mukarraniah Sunday. Over 40 trucks and
hundreds of volunteers took their brooms and baskets to get rid of
the sand which covered the tarmac road.  According to reports,
the opening of the road followed an underground negotiation
between Ali Ahmed and elders from the area for a possible full
deployment of police force in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Similar celebrations took place in the main towns of Kismaio,
Merca, Garoweh, Bossaso, Baidoa and Beletuein where local people
have read the Takbiir for several hours before the Eid Prayers.

goods and services, shrank for the first time in seven months, as
calculated before adjustments for seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
A 13.4 percent fall in the trade surplus from a year earlier
helped push down the current account surplus.
</P>
<P>
Exports in November plunged 12.8 percent while imports tumbled
12.5 percent from a year before, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
The setback in Japan's exports was attributable mainly to
slack demand in crisis-hit Asian countries, while the drop in
imports reflects falling crude oil prices and weak domestic
demand resulting from the recession, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Exports to the United States, Japan's largest trade partner,
dropped by 7.1 percent, the first year-on-year decline in two ye
ars and eight months.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said it would take time to judge whether
there was a reversal in Japan's trade picture.
</P>
<P>
"We have to monitor the situation for a little longer before
judging what the trend will be in the future," an official said.
</P>
<P>
In November, the yen averaged 120.58 against one U.S. dollar,
compared with 125.27 yen a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Flight to Lhasa, One of China's Most Comfortable Air Journeys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Aboard the A-340 Airbus headed
for Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region,
even passengers with much flying experience can find anything to
complain about, except perhaps for the early time of departure.
</P>
<P>
Passengers are obliged to rush to the airport before dawn in
order to catch the plane, which leaves Chengdu, capital of
southwestern Sichuan Province, at 6:40 a.m. every morning.
</P>
<P>
Flight 4401 is currently the only air route linking the
Tibetan capital to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"Flights to Lhasa must take off in early morning to avoid
possible dangers caused by the increasing air turbulence over the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau after sunrise," said an official with the
China Southwestern Airlines, which has been running the
Chengdu-Lhasa air route since its debut more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But according to a passenger named Liu, who often takes
domestic flights on business trips, the flight to Lhasa still
ranks among the country's most comfortable air journeys.
</P>
<P>
The plane has large, comfortable seats and an advanced
audio-video system, he said, while the in-flight service is also
first class.
</P>
<P>
"I never expected such a smooth and comfortable flight over
the Roof of the World," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the Chengdu-Lhasa air route was first opened, a journey
to Lhasa was an ordeal for every passenger, and the small plane
bought from the former Soviet Union could only carry 90 people
each flight, a China Southwestern senior official recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Now my plane can accommodate 370 passengers, with
state-of-the-art navigation and communication systems," said Yi
Daqi, chief pilot of Flight 4401 for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
To provide a better service for Tibetan passengers, Yi and his
crew members are now studying the Tibetan language in their spare
time.
</P>
<P>
"The plane is good, so is the service. Actually there is
certainly nothing about it to upset anyone," Julien Temple, a
representative from Handicap International, commented when the
plane landed in Lhasa at 8:30 a.m., bang on schedule.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Police Smashes Counterfeit Money Gang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua ) -- The Chaoyang Branch of
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Security has solved a major
case involving the trafficking of counterfeit Chinese currency
and confiscated about 110,000 yuan worth of forged notes.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the bureau, the police arrested
four suspects, leaving the man believed to be the overall
mastermind, Nie Yong, a native of southwest China's Sichuan
Province, still at large.
</P>
<P>
The four suspects are Pang Shuyan, Liu Minglu, Zeng Guangfu and
Nie Yong's elder brother Nie Bin. The illegal activities were
first brought to their attention from the area around Chongwenmen
District after members of the public provided information.
</P>
<P>
Pang and Liu were caught red-handed as they tried to trade
counterfeit yuan notes for genuine ones and later police also
found 106,000 yuan worth of counterfeit money, all in 50-yuan
denominations, in Nie Yong's house.
</P>
<P>
Police say the notes, which were today sent to the People's
Bank of China for checking, will be destroyed by the bank later.
</P>
<P>
Chinese laws stipulate that people found guilty of trafficking
counterfeit money over 100 yuan in value will be given a sentence
of re-education through labor. For higher denominations the
punishment will fit the level of the crime.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than six million yuan worth of counterfeit money
was confiscated by Beijing's departments of public security,
banking and postal and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Most of the counterfeit notes confiscated by Beijing police
are made in south China's Guangdong Province and central China's
Henan Province. Some of the counterfeit notes are so perfect
that it is hard to tell them from the genuine.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Agriculture Expected to Grow 5.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is expected to
achieve its target of a 5.4-percent growth in the agriculture
sector in the current fiscal year ending on June 30, 1999, sources
from the Planning Commission said Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate may slide in case of any downward
revision of wheat output owning to delayed winter rain, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
The post-rain situation of wheat crops is yet to be
ascertained, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
"As far as the rice is concerned, we have achieved the target,"
the sources said, adding that "the reports received so far suggest
that we are right on target regarding sugarcane."
</P>
<P>
But the delayed winter rain has seemingly disrupted the overall
forecast of the agriculture growth rate target, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the long spell of fog that gripped the country in
December has definitely affected the cotton crops and the target
of 10 million bales is certain to be revised downward, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Based on various indications, the sources said, the cotton
production is estimated at 9.2 million bales and may go down
further.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan achieved an agriculture growth rate of 5.9 percent
during the fiscal year of 1997-98, compared with a modest increase
of 0.6 percent in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Out of the gross domestic product of the country, the
agriculture sector took a lion's share of 24.6 percent in the
financial year of 1997-98.

<HEADLINE> China-Made Bicycles Popular in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China-made bicycles have become
increasingly popular in Bangladesh for its high quality and
accounts for 20-25 percent of the Bangladesh market at present.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh now imports about 100,000 bicycles from China each
year, a sharp increase from 15,000-20,000 four years ago, Mizanur
Rahman, managing director of Meghna Group, the sole agent of
China's famous Phoenix-brand bicycles, told Xinhua on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the bicycles were purchased by government and
non-government institutions and some were sold in the countryside,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 bicycles were imported from China during the first
nine months of last year, but sales dropped during the last
quarter of the year due to the prolonged flood hitting the country
between July and September and the devaluation of the country's
currency, the taka, by 6 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that sales of China-made bicycles would pick up
soon when people's purchasing power is recovered.
</P>
<P>
The price of China-manufactured bicycles is a bit high, Rahman
said, adding that this sometimes gave way to India-made bicycles
that were much cheaper.
</P>
<P>
China-made bicycles are sold for 3,700-3,800 taka (about
76.29-78.35 U.S. dollars) each while an India-made one would cost
only 2,000-2,500 taka (about 41.24-51.55 dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
One way to expand the share of Chinese bicycles in the
Bangladesh market of some 400,000 items a year is to set up joint
ventures, which could reduce the cost of production and increase
the product's competitiveness, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Modernizes Meteorological Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved substantial
progress in meteorological modernization and research, with
meteorological monitoring and services approaching or reaching
levels in moderately developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Wen Kegang, director of China Meteorological Bureau, made the
comments during a recent national meeting held in Xi'an, capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China is one of the few countries capable of
building and launching weather satellites represents the nation's
advanced level in related research, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
The investment-pofit ratio for China's meteorological sector
jumped from 1:20 in the early 1980s to 1:40, said Wen, adding
that accurate and timely weather forecasts provided an important
foundation for China's battle against the record summer flooding
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said a number of meteorological programs have been listed
as key research projects, and noted that China's accuracy rate on
weather forecasting is expected to grow another 5-10 percent on
the current level of 60 percent when the projects are completed
by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Australian Minister Sees Majority Support for Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The federal cabinet minister
for finance and administration, John Fahey, Monday predicted that
the majority of Australians will favor an Australian head of state
in the November referendum.
</P>
<P>
Employment Services Minister Tony Abbott Sunday stirred up
pro-republicans in the coalition by declaring that the republic
movement was driven by the chattering classes in the country and
republicans thought non-republic Australia was the "arse end of
the earth."
</P>
<P>
Fahey argued that pro-monarchist Abbott has every right to
express his views on the republic in a colorful way, but he denied
that support for the republic is limited to the chattering
classes.
</P>
<P>
Fahey followed Environment Minister Robert Hill in declaring
his determination to support the "Yes" vote when the republican
question is put in the November 6 referendum.
</P>
<P>
Like Hill, Fahey disputed Abbott's claim that coalition
ministers would be unlikely to give priority to the republic and
that the referendum would fail.
</P>
<P>
"I think the majority of Australians in fact do favor having an
Australian citizen as our head of state," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's supported by a broad cross-section of Australians, those
who believe that we have a right to seek a national identity, that
we are mature enough as a nation to say for the 21st century that
the head of state should be an Australian citizen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fahey was the only other known pro-republican apart from Hill
in the cabinet to come out fighting Monday. Treasurer Peter
Costello and Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith remained
silent while Abbott declined to add to his comments.
</P>
<P>
Australian Republican Movement (ARM) Chairman Malcolm Turnbull
said support for a republic within the government has grown since
last February's Constitutional Convention.
</P>
<P>
"There is obviously a variety of views within the coalition
government about the republic, but support within the government
for an Australian head of state has been growing over the past 12
months," he said.
</P>
<P>
The republican issue seems set to remain on the agenda for the
next few weeks. Opposition leader Kim Beazley is also planning an
Australia Day speech in Sydney on the republic.

JERUSALEM -- Aurec, one of the three major cable TV companies in

market as soon as it opens to competition, the local daily Haaretz
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- British Airways has acquiesced to a request from
the Israeli Transport Ministry to extend its weekend
discount-flight program to include Thursday evenings in a bid to
enable observant Jews to take advantage of the low costs, the
local daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's unemployment rate stood at 8.5 percent in
November last year, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate between August and November was 8.5 percent,
slightly down from 8.6 percent during the March to July period.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Its Own Cellular Phone Handset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's first domestically
developed mobile telephone went on sale today.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured by the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Mobile
Communication Equipment Corp. Ltd.,in Xiamen in east China's
Fujian province, the Huaxia No 1." GSM handset is priced at
about half that of foreign makes.
</P>
<P>
The company's President Guo Zeli said that technologically it
ranks with middle or top of the range international models but
will be very competitive in the Chinese market because of its
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
He predicts that the launch of the handset will trigger
another round of fierce competition in China's mobile telephone
market.
</P>
<P>
Xie Linzhen, an official with the Ministry of Information
Industry (MII), remarked that it marked a great leap forward in
China's efforts to develop its own mobile communications industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the number of mobile telephone users in
China had topped 25 million and sales income of mobile
communications exceeded those of local and long distance
landlines.
</P>
<P>
MII forecasts that by 2000, the number of cellular telephone
users in China will grow to 40 million.
</P>
<P>
However, at present most of the dozen or so mobile telephone
manufacturers in China are wholly or partially owned by overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
Xie said that the Chinese-made handsets are faced with strong
competition from foreign products and stressed that domestic
manufacturers have to improve their performance-price ratio to
obtain a larger market share.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen Overseas Chinese Mobile Communication Equipment
Corp. Ltd., is a joint venture between the Xiamen Overseas
Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd., the biggest exporter of color TV
sets in China, and the Guangzhou Communication Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Research Institute is the only one that has the
technologies able to write software for mobile phones in Asia. It
began developing handsets in 1991, a year before China introduced
the first mobile telephone systems from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese companies such as Dongfang Telecommunications
and Shenzhen Kejian have also developed a range of commercial
mobile phones and other major Chinese electronics companies such
as Konca, Haire and TCL are well ahead with their own development
plans.

<HEADLINE> New Foundation Promotes Hepatitis Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A new hepatitis control
foundation established in the Chinese capital plans to provide
free vaccines for poverty-stricken children.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Foundation for Hepatitis Prevention and Control
(CFHPC) will offer free hepatitis B vaccines for children in poor
and remote areas, as well as for the children of parents declared
redundant by state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The foundation at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine
will also raise funds to support scientific research and
educational activities.
</P>
<P>
China allocates between 30-50 billion yuan (3.6-6 billion U.S.
dollars) annually for treatment of various types of hepatitis,
according to Professor Su Chong'ao, secretary-general of the
CFHPC.
</P>
<P>
China reportedly faces a serious epidemic of A-E hepatitis,
with more than 600 million Chinese, or half of the country's
population, infected by hepatitis B. Some 120 million individuals
carry the HB virus, with a fourth of carriers expected to
contract liver diseases, according to Su.
</P>
<P>
He said some 12 million Chinese contract liver diseases, with
over 300,000 dying from related diseases each year.
</P>
<P>
"Some 40 percent of pregnant women carrying the HB virus will
bear carriers of the virus," according to Su.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that nationwide vaccinations among newborns
would reduce the proportion of HBV carriers to under one percent
within 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Su pointed out the vaccination campaign initiated in 1992 has
effectively blocked the spread of hepatitis B amongst newborns. "
The problem now is the inability of poverty-stricken families to
shoulder the 20-yuan cost for each vaccination."
</P>
<P>
The foundation has received donations of 12.8 million yuan,
including cash, drugs and vaccines, from pharmaceutical companies
and individuals both at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Tourist Industry Hit by Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Asia's economic crisis cost
Australian tourism up to 665 million Australian dollars (about 420
million U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months in 1998, despite
increased business from the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary Australian Bureau of Statistics data released
Monday showed that visitors to Australia from overseas fell by 4.2
percent to 3.7 million in the 11 months to November 1998, compared
with the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Arrivals from Northeast and Southeast Asia both recorded falls
over that period, down by 16.8 and 18.5 percent to 1.1 million and
 482,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Council Australia (TCA) said there was no doubt the
sector had been hit hard by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"This equates to a loss in revenue of around 665 million
Australian dollars which has meant a tough 1998 for many tourism
businesses," TCA Chairman John Schaap said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea led the fall in tourist arrivals from Asia,
recording a decline of 74.5 percent to 57,100, followed by
Indonesia, down 44.7 percent to 81,600; Thailand, 32.8 percent to
42,200; and Malaysia, down 23.4 percent to 99,600.
</P>
<P>
But arrivals from the United States rose 13.3 percent to
337,200 while those from New Zealand and Europe went up by 4.1 and
8.8 percent to 650,800 and 820,900 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Tourist Commission (ATC) said the United States
and Europe remained the best performing regions in 1998 for the
Australian inbound tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
ATC Director John Morse said growth from the two traditional
regions and the vital New Zealand market insulated the industry
from much of the pain of the Asian economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
"The statistics put Australia on track to record just a
4-percent decline in international visitor arrivals in 1998,"

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Supervision of Insurance Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance regulatory
authority announced today that it will adopt a series of new
measures to strengthen supervision of the insurance sector in
order to ensure good market order.
</P>
<P>
Ma Yongwei, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), told Xinhua today that strict regulation will
be carried out in terms of both market practices and the
compensation capacity of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that more effective regulation is a must due to t
he immaturity of China's insurance market, incomplete legal
system and insufficient self-control capacity of insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
He said this year's regulatory efforts will focus on
rectifying the insurance market. Illegal insurance companies will
be banned and illegal activities will be dealt with severely
according to law.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC will strictly control the establishment of new
insurance companies over the next two years, according to Ma.
</P>
<P>
The intermediary insurance market will also be rectified, said
Ma, adding that illegal intermediary institutions will be banned
and individuals or organizations involved in illegal activities
will be subject to severe punishment.
</P>
<P>
He said the CIRC plans to ratify one or two professional
intermediary insurance institutions in order to standardize
related business activities gradually.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC will also strengthen regulation over the capital
conditions of insurance companies, reducing risks and perfecting
the legal system and various other key aspects of the sector,
said Ma.

<HEADLINE> Australian Navy Seeks Fund for Submarine Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Australian Navy
(RAN) is considering asking for more federal funding to iron out
problems with the weapons system of its six Collins submarines.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to ask the cabinet to top up the
5-billion-Australian-dollar (3.15 billion U.S. dollars) submarine
construction program, which was originally written in 1985 to
upgrade combat capabilities, was "still under consideration within
the department," an RAN spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, it's an enhancement of the combat system and
other aspects of the submarines," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A report published in The Australian Monday said that the RAN
was forced to renegotiate its contract with the Australian
Submarine Corporation to bring the computerized weapons system to
an acceptable standard.
</P>
<P>
The weapons system has been plagued with problems over the
course of the project.
</P>
<P>
The main problem with the combat system lies in its tactical
data-handling system, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the problems, the Defense Department is to seek the
cabinet's approval for about 50 million Australian dollars (31.5
million U.S. dollars) for a new project to "augment" the combat
system for the six Collins-class submarines.

freestyle final.
</P>
<P>
Thorpe, 16, unbeaten in major 400 freestyles since winning the

appeared jaded after the last turn and finished second in 3:43.40.
</P>
<P>
"That was a really good swim for me," Thorpe said. "I'm
incredibly happy with that. Grant swam that race really well and
I had to come over the top and catch him. Fortunately, once
again, I was able to do that."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines Monday
officially withdrew its bid to host World Expo 2002 after the
private sector failed to meet President Joseph Estrada's condition
to shoulder the entire cost of the global fair.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Spokesperson Jerry Barican told reporters here
Monday afternoon that Estrada has instructed Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon to inform the Bureau of International Exposition
(BIE) that his decision to relinquish the country's right to host
the global fair is final.
</P>
<P>
"He instructed Secretary Siazon to immediately convey the
Philippines' decision to concerned parties so that other
countries, which bid for the hosting of the event, could make
their final preparations and arrangement with the BIE," Barican
said.
</P>
<P>
Barican said that Estrada gave the order after the private
sector "failed to come up with the needed financial package and
cash requirements for the hosting of World Expo 2002."
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier said he would reconsider his decision to
withdraw the country's hosting bid if the private sector could
raise the 6 billion pesos (150 million U.S. dollars) needed to
stage the event.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would not spend a single centavo of
public funds for the project due to budgetary constraints.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Warns Refugees against Firearms, Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has warned all
the refugees sheltered on its territories against possessing
firearms illegally and committing crimes, local newspapers
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Ali Ameir
Mohamed has ordered refugees who possess firearms illegally to
surrender them to relevant authorities during his three-day visit
in the western Kigoma region over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He told the refugees at the camps that they must refrain from
taking part in banditry or they will meet punitive measures.
</P>
<P>
"Any military activities by refugees might cause military
clashes between Tanzania and her neighboring countries, something
unhealthy for two friendly countries," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last year Tanzanian parliament passed a bill, limiting the free
travel by refugees outside their camps.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed requested the services like health, water and education
by relief organizations to refugees which are also offered to the
Tanzanians who have been living with refugees peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, at least 5,400 new Rwandan refugees entered
neighboring Kagera Region last week to flee fresh fighting between
the government troops and rebels of the late Rwandan President
Juvenali Habyarimana, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
They quoted refugees as saying that Rwandan soldiers have
launched an operation to arrest all Interahamwe militia who are
alleged to have taken part in the 1994 Rwanda massacres over some
500,000 people, mainly Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is estimated that over 350,000 refugees from
Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Rwanda and
Somalia are in refugee camps in Tanzania.

eight cents to 3.06 Singapore dollars. CSA sank 25 cents to end at

</P>
<P>

that global stock markets relaxed a little after Brazil had taken
a move to float its currency in stride.
</P>
<P>
They also said institutional players expected the Brazil crisis
will not have a significant impact on the region and returned to

BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp. (CNOOC) plans to cut production cost this year in a bid
to raise profits to one billion yuan in spite of declining oil
prices and markets worldwide, according to a senior official tod
ay.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC President Wei Liucheng said the corporation plans to
produce 15.5 million tons of crude oil and 3.8 billion cu.m. of
natural gas during the year.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that China's oil industry weathered the severe tests
of the Asian financial crisis, as well as declining prices and
markets, and rampant smuggling in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China successfully reshaped its petroleum system and the CNOOC
succeeded in fulfilling government production targets by
dramatically cutting production costs and expanding oil and gas
exploration and production.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that CNOOC produced 16.31 million tons of
crude oil and 3.8 billion cu.m. of natural gas in 1998. Verified
oil and gas reserves grew by 172 million tons and 5.8 billion
cu.m. by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Wei said the CNOOC will prioritize offshore oil and gas
exploration during 1999, and will attempt to attract wide-ranging
foreign cooperation in oil and gas exploration in the South China
Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea.

<TEXT>
<P>
Rios, the Open runner-up last year, told organizers he had a
stress fracture in his back which he aggravated playing in New
Zealand last week.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean world No. 2 underwent an MRI scan and was advised
to rest until March.
</P>
<P>
Rios was the third high profile male player to pull out of the
tournament before striking a ball and left organizers, who two
weeks ago boasted a full list of the top 20 men in the world,
with a tournament with gaping holes.
</P>
<P>
World No. 1 Pete Sampras withdrew earlier in the month citing
exhaustion brought on by a hectic end to 1998, and 11th seed
Goran Ivanisevic pulled out today, also with back trouble.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawals reflected the heavy physical pressure the
world's elite tennis players are under and, as devastating as
they were to organizers, they came as no surprise.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Architecture Industry to Use More Overseas Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Overseas edition of
People's Daily reported today that China's architecture industry
has pledged to use more overseas capital to renovate state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Construction Zheng Yijun said the industry
will introduce overseas capital to establish more knowledge- and
technology-intensive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government will continue to encourage a certain number of
large enterprises to adopt international administrative methods,
including public biding for projects instead of simply seeking
contracts for construction of projects. He added that the
industry will expand cooperation with overseas contracting
businesses.
</P>
<P>
Overseas capital had been used for more than 30,000
architecture projects by the end of 1997, with total contracts
valued at 15 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Construction companies from 14 countries and regions,
including the United Stated, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
Singapore and Germany, have established operations in China.
</P>
<P>
China has so far established 1,388 Sino-foreign joint ventures
in the architecture sector.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Strive to Revive Economic Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Monday called upon his countrymen to strive
harder to revive all economic activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir commended Malaysians for being highly disciplined and
patient in facing the economic slowdown and not panicking or
losing their sense of direction but working hard to increase the
national income and revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that if all citizens are of one heart and purpose,
our country will return to its original strong economic position
within a short period," he said in his message marking the Eid
al-Fitr, the end of the holy month of Ramadan, over radio and
television Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysians generally stood solidly behind the
government and this had foiled efforts by certain groups to
destroy the Malaysian economy and force the country to bow to
their demands.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the economic problems would abate
by the turn of the century, saying there was an increased
possibility now of overcoming these woes as the government had
succeeded in freeing the national economy from the pressures of
currency traders and foreign share speculators.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of Muslims in Malaysia preserving
peace and order in the country, Mahathir said "For if there are
racial riots in Malaysia, Muslims also will become victims and may
become weak and be controlled by others."
</P>
<P>
He also urged Malaysians to cooperate with one another for
their mutual progress and not damage the country through the
pursuit of self interest.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Receive Medical Treatment, Doctors Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Doctors confirmed Monday that
Russian President Boris Yeltsin is suffering from a stomach ulcer
and should receive medical treatment, presidential spokesman
Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that doctors at the Central Clinical
Hospital described Yeltsin's conditions as satisfactory. He
didn't specify what kind of medical treatment Yeltsin should
receive.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 67, was hospitalized Sunday for acute gastric ulcer
bleeding. He will undergo treatment for two to three weeks, the
NTV television channel reported.
</P>
<P>
The president's poor health has again prompted calls for his
resignation and early elections. Yeltsin "is not in the condition
to perform his duties," Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, one should think how to turn them over to
the prime minister (Yevgeny Primakov) and the government and how
to elect a new president," Itar-Tass quoted Zyuganov as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Yakushkin said there is no need for a transfer of
power and the "nuclear briefcase" as "the president can fully
perform his duties".
</P>
<P>
At the White House, site of the government, Primakov's
spokeswoman Tatyana Aristarkhova said there is no change in the
premier's schedule in connection with Yeltsin's hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
Primakov "has not received any additional instructions (from
Yeltsin)," Aristarkhova said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov will chair a routine meeting with his deputies and
meet with a delegation of the international conference of free
trade unions led by General Secretary Bill Jordan on Monday, she
said.
</P>
<P>
He will depart for Kazakhstan in the evening to attend the
inauguration ceremony of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on
January 20. Nazarbayev was reelected on January 10.
</P>
<P>
A visit to Davos to attend the international economic forum is
still on Primakov's agenda for January 29-31, Aristarkhova said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Bans Overseas Phone Calls Via Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications of Lebanon has banned Internet service
providers from offering voice communications service, the Daily
Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The service, known as the Voice Over the Internet, provides
Internet subscribers with a cheap means of calling overseas.
</P>
<P>
Internet service providers will be prosecuted if they fail to
comply with the terms and regulations of their licenses, warned
Abdel Monem Youssef, general director of the ministry's operations
and maintainance section.
</P>
<P>
The licenses, which were granted by the ministry, require
Internet companies to refrain from offering voice services. And
video conferencing is also banned.
</P>
<P>
Only the ministry has the exclusive right to provide
international and local phone lines, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
And Internet companies which don't abide by the terms of their
licenses are undermining the ministry's revenues and depleting
public funds, Youssef said.
</P>
<P>
Following the ministry's decision Saturday, Intracom, one of
the several companies that offer what is called the "e-phone
service", announced to suspend its phone-via-Internet service.
</P>
<P>
The company had launched a nation-wide advertising campaign a
week ago to promote the new product.
</P>
<P>
Of Lebanon's 10 Internet service providers in operation, only
four have access lines spread throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The service providers are generating approximately 1 million
U.S. dollars a month in revenues, thanks to growing numbers of
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry show that Lebanon has less than

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Disaster Preparedness Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China has planned to
accelerate the development of earthquake forcasting centers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Seismological Bureau is currently evaluating
related projects and drafting a national plan for development of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
"Introducing high technology and establishing a domestic
disaster preparedness research system will reduce damage
resulting from earthquakes," according to Lu Deshou,
vice-director of the bureau's disaster preparedness department.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that development of the new industry will involve
wide-ranging sectors, including the electronics, machine-building
and new materials industries.
</P>
<P>
China's accuracy rate for earthquake predicitons has reached
advanced international levels following a three-decade effort by
scientists. However, the accuracy rate for short-term predictions
of earthquakes within three days is lower than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the lack of timely predictions for earthquakes has
resulted in the loss of many lives, said Lu, adding that the
large number of fatalities during the Tangshan earthquake in 1967
was the direct result of the lack of timely predictions.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders to Welcome King Hussein's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Some Arab leaders are expected to
join a grand welcome ceremony Tuesday for Jordanian King Hussein's
return to the kingdom from a six-month cancer treatment in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
However, the official list of those high-ranking Arab visitors
is not available yet.
</P>
<P>
It has been confirmed that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa al-Thani will attend the
event, the national daily Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the ceremony will be the United Arab Emirates
Chief of Staff Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed and other high-ranking
officials from Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab heads of state have also voiced their desire to visit
King Hussein, including Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn
Abdul-Aziz and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
More than 1 million Jordanians are to take to the streets to
celebrate King Hussein's homecoming.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left Jordan for the United States in mid-July 1998 and
underwent treatment for lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
Hussein has said on several occasions that he had fully
recovered from his illness after treatment at the Mayo Clinic,
Minnesota in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The king had stayed in Washington and London for more than two
weeks for recuperation after he left the Mayo Clinic last

<TEXT>
<P>
Works published before the Cultural Revolution mainly consist
of folklore and mysteries, with many of the books destroyed in
order to "eliminate feudalistic concepts". And the rarity of
related works has led to soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
Experts acknowledge that limited distribution of cartoon
books, compared to stamps, coins, and master paintings and
calligraphy pieces, offer collectors substantial investment
potential.
</P>
<P>
They also note that the value of cartoon books will possibly
surpass values for stamps and paintings over the next few years,

<HEADLINE> Sword Adds Clues to Western Han Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A bronze sword dating to the
Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.--24 A.D.) has been found in Puding
County in southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
This is the maiden finding of such a relic in the southwestern
part, making people know more about the country's culture over
the period.
</P>
<P>
The sword is queerly shaped, with a gourd-like hilt and a long
sunken part, with a length of 29.6 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
A farmer at Huachu Village found the sword when digging a well
in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
The sword-lying part was a mountain valley, and then became
arable land after many years of alluviation, archeologists say,
ruling out the possibility for the sword to come from a tomb or
an ancient relic site.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Overhaul Tariff System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to
streamline its tariff system in the next several months to better
support development of industry, agriculture and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The overhaul, the first since 1995, will give some relief to
importers affected by the weakened baht and shrinking local
markets, finance ministry officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The changes will affect abut 7,000 product categories. The
maximum tariff on the majority of products is 30 percent, with
some officials saying they favor a cap of between 15 percent and
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Reductions of rates on many products would help reduce
production costs for industries dependent on imported raw
materials and intermediate products.
</P>
<P>
Lower import tariffs would also increase pressure on domestic
producers to cut their own costs and improve quality, a crucial
medium-term goal for policy makers looking ahead to increased
competition from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Still, sensitive industries such as agriculture would continue
to be protected under the tariff regime, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda has told members of a
tariff study group to submit their findings by mid-year. The
group, chaired by finance ministry permanent secretary Supachai
Pisitvanich, includes representatives of the Board of Investment
and the industry, commerce and agriculture ministers.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural and environmental products were left largely
untouched in the 1995 tariff overhaul. But both categories,
particularly agricultural goods, will be evaluated closely.
Tariffs on agricultural products now are as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another industry likely to be affected is petrochemicals. Tens
of billions of baht has been invested in building up a domestic
petrochemical industry that remains uncompetitive despite generous
tariff protection.
</P>
<P>
One challenge will be balancing the local demands of upstream
petrochemical producers for protection from imports, against calls
by intermediate and downstream companies for lower tariffs to
reduce production costs.

<HEADLINE> Britain Deploys Warship off Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
deployed a navy frigate in the troubled waters off Sierra Leone to
assist in the monitoring of rebel activities in that country,
media reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The frigate of HMS Norfolk with a detachment of troops and a
Lynx helicopter on board was sent to the west African country when
the rebels invaded central and eastern areas of capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the warship off Freetown was aimed at
providing " logistical" support to the west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG which is supporting the
democratically-elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, according to
British officials.
</P>
<P>
But, the heavily-armed warship and its crew will not take a
direct part in fighting between the ECOMOG troops and the rebels,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Omrie Golley, spokesman of the rebel Revolutionary United Front
(RUF), said Sunday in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, that RUF commanders
in the field feared that the Norfolk planned to guide ECOMOG's
Alpha jet warplanes.
</P>
<P>
"They are worried it will eavesdrop on our communications and
help the Alphas pinpoint our positions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the deployment of warship was in response to the
calls made last week by the Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka
Anyaoku on the international community to support Nigeria's
efforts in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Britain flew in a transport plane full of military jeeps for
ECOMOG on Friday, according to a spokesman for the ECOMOG force.
</P>
<P>
In a statement last week, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
announced an extra aid of one million Pounds to the ECOMOG forces
in Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Power Revenue Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Electricity Board's
(UEB) revenue from the supply of power to local customers grossed
81.9 billion Shillings (81.9 million U.S. Dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Monday's Monitor newspaper quoted a senior official with the
UEB as saying over the weekend that this figure represents an
increase of 33 percent from that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Revenue from the export of power to Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda
went up by 15 percent to a level of 14.4 billion Shillings (14.4
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The parastatal's total revenue from electricity bills had
dramatically gone up from 67 percent a few years ago to over 85
percent in 1998, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, UEB is still losing about 24 percent of its revenue to
unbilled consumers.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is a country which is suffering from lack of power. The
Owen Falls Dam, which has a capacity of 180 megawatts a year,
satisfies three quarters of the country's total power demand.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current economic growth in Uganda, power demand has
already outstripped supply. The power deficit has resulted in
frequent load- shedding through which various parts of the country
are switched off from supply at peak hours of the day.
</P>
<P>
The inadequate electricity supply and frequent power cuts have
adversely affected economic activities and industries are
operating at 37 percent under capacity.

<HEADLINE> Listing of China Bonds Helps to Deepen HK Debt Market: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa said here
Monday that the listing of China bonds in Hong Kong represented a
big step forward for the local debt market.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here Monday during a meeting with China's
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng, who came to attend the
signing ceremony for the listing of China bonds on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange. The Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic
of China successfully issued one billion U.S. dollar global bonds
in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tung said: "I welcome the listing in Hong Kong of the bonds
issued by the Ministry of Finance as this would help to deepen
and broaden our debt market. It represents a big step forward for
our debt market."
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
show that the gross value of all debt products in Hong Kong by
the end of August 1998 amounted to 390.7 billion HK dollars (50
billion U.S. dollars), of which 17 percent were Exchange Fund
Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that apart from the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the only place of listing for the
U.S. dollar bonds issued by China's Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
"The listing here of the bonds also enhanced Hong Kong's role
as China's fund raising center," said the Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Tung and Xiang also exchanged views on the global and regional
economic development and recent performance of the international
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Before he met Tung, the finance minister paid a visit to the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong on Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> China to Cut Steel Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China plans to cut its steel
output to eliminate overproduction, according to Wang Wanbin,
director of the State Administration of Metallurgical Industrial.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the comment during today's national metallurgical i
ndustry meeting. He said this year's profit target of five
billion yuan (602.4 million US dollars) is based on strictly
controlling gross output. Efforts will also center on preventing
46 medium- to large-sized steel producers from incurring losses.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show China increased pig iron output by 6.7
percent to 118 million tons during 1998, with steel output rising
by 6.9 percent to 114 million tons and rolled steel output by 9.8
percent to 105 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The total 1998 output value for the metallurgical sector hit
195 billion yuan, a year-on-year rise of 5.4 percent. The
sector's profits for the year stood at some two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang said overproduction has resulted in the excessive waste
of resources, and warned that measures must be adopted to prevent
huge losses of state assets.
</P>
<P>
China's steel output has jumped substantially since 1993, with
the 1998 output alone growing by 24.5 million tons, or 27.4
percent. However, 1998 profits fell to 2.3 billion yuan last
year, compared to a high of 29.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wang attributed the drop to normal price cuts, as well as
overproduction resulting from redundant construction.
</P>
<P>
He said the goal of controlling production is to increase
returns for steel producers and create conditions for
technological advances and the development of sound enterprises.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A veteran politician of
Israel's opposition Labor Party will formally leave the party and
join the centrist party which was set up by Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
former chief of staff of Israeli military.
</P>
<P>
Nissim Zvilli, who is also a member of Israeli Knesset
(parliament), told local daily The Jerusalem Post on Sunday night
that he left the Labor because he did not think it would win the
elections scheduled on May.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe (Labor leader Ehud) Barak stands a chance of
defeating (Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu in the Elections,"
said Zvilli.
</P>
<P>
Zvilli also predicted that Shahak would be elected as prime
minister since "someone with his nature can ease the atmosphere
currently pervading the country."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Knesset finally approved early this month a bill
calling for early elections and all main parties have launched
their election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zeev Begin, son of former prime minister Menachem
Begin, registered his right-wing party Herut on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The party's key guiding principles include increasing Jewish
settlements throughout "Israel and the Land of Israel" and not
handing over Golan Heights to any foreign regime.

<HEADLINE> No Violation of Court Ruling on Talks With Marcos Family: Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that its talks with the family of the late president
Ferdinand Marcos on recovering their alleged ill-gotten wealth do
not violate any court ruling.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Monday morning, Executive Secretary
Ronaldo Zamora said that the government is making sure it does not
violate the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by the
Supreme Court against such talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have not concluded or made any definite agreement. We
understand the terms of the TRO, and we are making sure we do not
violate that", he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora expressed his hope that Congress will allow the Estrada
administration to conduct negotiations with the Marcoses to remove
any legal obstacle to the talks.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing is for Congress to allow us to conduct

its approval, or to just go ahead with the talks. We believe
congressional approval remains the best option", he said.

percent share for the government of whatever wealth would be
recovered during the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Release Tests of Y2K for Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will release at the end of March the official results
of the validation tests its examiners conducted on the computer
system efficiency of banks in order to remedy the effects of the
millennium bug problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview here Monday, Dolores Yuvienco, head of the
central bank's Y2K Task Force, said that there is no need to worry
about the problem because the central bank is doing everything to
address the problem before the year 2000, when all computer
systems will read the last two zeros in computers as 1900.
</P>
<P>
She urged banks to complete all the testing of internal and
external systems by June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central bank issued a circular in September 1997 requiring
banks to submit action plans for conversion program for the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the central bank issued another circular which
required them to accomplish a self-assessment questionnaire in
order to determine the quality of their preparation.
</P>
<P>
Yuvienco said that those who will fail to submit a monthly
report of their actions as mandated in the two circulars will be
subjected to certain enforcement actions.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Not to Give Up Power: Zambian Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- President of Zambia's
opposition party, the United National Independence Party (UNIP),
Kenneth Kaunda, will never relinquish party leadership until the
party returns to power, its administrative secretary Basil Kabwe
has said.
</P>
<P>
"In the leadership of the UNIP, members throughout the country
have told Kaunda in no uncertain terms, that congress or no
congress, they will never let him go until UNIP gets back into
power," Kabwe said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Monday quoted Kabwe as saying "anyone who
thinks that a new leader can replace Kaunda and expect to lead the
UNIP to victory in 2001, is a victim of wishful thinking and pipe
dreaming".
</P>
<P>
He also said the party performed badly in the recent local
government elections because internal strife, wrangling and
character assassination have continued unabated within the Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The internal strife has made it difficult for leaders to
mobilize members, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kabwe was reacting to press reports attributed to senior Chief
Inyambo Yeta's adviser George Zulu that Kaunda could not lead the
UNIP into the next millennium because he had already played his
role.
</P>
<P>
Kabwe further said it was up to Kaunda himself to say what he
wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled the country for 27 years and was defeated by
incumbent President Frederick Chiluba in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the 74-year old veteran politician told the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in London that he "would
not retire from active politics soon because current events in
Zambia's political arena would not warrant that."
</P>
<P>
Kaunda said he would contest the Zambian presidency in 2001.
And he would continue leading his party until his followers decide
he had to leave.

<HEADLINE> Agreement Inked on Listing of China Bonds in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Finance
and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange signed an agreement here Monday
for the listing of China global bonds issued at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government successfully issued one billion U.S.
dollar Global Bond in December 1998, the first time that China
re-entered the international capital market as a sovereign issuer
since the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, China's Minister of Finance, said at the
signing ceremony Monday: "We strongly support Hong Kong in her
efforts to develop a full-fledged bond market, and to maintain
her importance as one of the world's financial centers. "
</P>
<P>
"The decision by the Ministry of Finance of the People's
Republic of China to list the Global Bond in the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange and myself being here today at this listing signing
ceremony, are to help achieve this objective," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guangyao, Director General, International Department of
the Ministry of Finance, and Alec Tsui, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, inked the listing agreement, which
replaced one signed in 1993 and incorporated several minor
technical updates.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), said on the same occasion: "I deeply
believe that the bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance will
soon develop as another successful product in the Hong Kong
market."
</P>
<P>
He stressed: "The signing ceremony represented that Hong
Kong's securities market has entered into a new era, it also
symbolized that our role as China's fund raising center has been
further enhanced."
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, there have been seven issues of Chinese bonds on
the Hong Kong bourse, including the latest one billion U.S. doll
ar China Global Bond due in 2008.
</P>
<P>
The SAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa Monday attended the
signing ceremony and proposed a toast to the successful
development of the Hong Kong debt market.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Uganda Target Anti-Malaria Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan manufacturer of an
over-the- counter anti-malaria treatment banned by Uganda recently
has defended the quality of its product, Dawaquin, which remains
on sale elsewhere in east Africa.
</P>
<P>
Rogers Atebe, chief pharmacist of Dawa Pharmaceuticals which is
the Nairobi manufacturer of the drug banned three weeks ago by
Uganda's National Drug Authority (NDA), said Dawaquin is
manufactured to stringent quality standards and could therefore
not be substandard.
</P>
<P>
The chloroquine-based drug may be taken for both curative and
prophylactic purposes in the event of malaria, he was quoted by
Monday's East African weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Uganda ordered the drug's withdrawal, saying tests by the NDA
found it did not contain the recommended levels of chloroquine.
The NDA is Uganda's overall drugs registration and regulatory
body.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, Beth Rapuoda, the head of country's malaria control
 program, said although she did not have specific data on
Dawaquin, the program's policy was that such chloroquine-based
anti-malaria should be gradually withdrawn as resistance levels to
them had reached unacceptable levels. Dawaquin, however, is still
on sale in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, Rapuoda said, Kenya had adopted new
guidelines on the treatment of malaria, replacing chloroquine with
sulphadoxin / pyrimethamine as the first line treatment for
malaria. The guidelines will be implemented in Kenyan public
hospitals this year.
</P>
<P>
Dawaquin's ban in Uganda was announced in the wake of a report
in the December issue of the East African Medical Journal that
more than half of all chloroquine-based anti-malaria drugs on sale
in Uganda were substandard.
</P>
<P>
The study involved testing chloroquine phosphate tablets and
injectable samples obtained from 50 registered pharmacies and drug
dealers selected at random in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The samples obtained were manufactured in India, Kenya, Uganda,
Europe, China, Cuba and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Rebels in DRC Can Only Meet Kabila in Kisangani: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of rebels
fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) can only hold direct talks with him in
Kisangani, one of their bases in the east, a rebel leader has
said.
</P>
<P>
Rebel chief leader Earnest Wamba dia Wamba made the
announcement on Sunday, according to a report in Monday's New
Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Wamba was quoted as saying that his offer of Kisangani as a
venue to meet the government side was to counter the offer by
Kabila to meet them in the capital city Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
On January 7, Kabila made a surprise offer on state television
to meet the rebels in Kinshasa, stressing that there was no
question of their going to meet the rebels elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Face-to-face negotiation has always been the rebels' main
precondition to discuss any possible ceasefire, Wamba said.
</P>
<P>
With military support from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Chad and
others, Kabila had refused to talk to the rebels, who occupy
nearly half of the country, before making the offer on television.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the rebels, though allegedly supported by Uganda and
Rwanda, have difficulty in gaining new ground on the front line.
</P>
<P>
The stalemate and the prolonging of the five-month-long war has
drawn regional and international attention. But no peaceful
solution to the problem is yet in sight since neither of the two
sides agree to make concessions.

Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in

and demanded his immediate removal.

The Serbian Socialist Party, in a statement, expressed its
"strongest" condemnation of Walker's remarks, saying that the
whole world in the past few months has seen clearly that ethnic
Albanian "terrorists" are the only obstacle to a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis. While ethnic Albanian "terrorists"
have repeatedly slaughtered and kidnapped civilians, Serb
policemen, Yugoslav service men and even members of the OSCE
Kosovo Verification Mission, Walker has all along kept silence,

<HEADLINE> China Initiates Policy Research on Population Aging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's population of over 13
million people includes 320 centenarians, up 30 percent on last
year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Three Shanghainese have reached the age of 109, with the list
of centenarians including one couple living in suburban district,
according to a report carried today in a Shanghai-based newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The report demonstrated the nationwide concern about the
rising number of senior citizens in China, the world's most
populous country which is currently facing a so-called "graying
tide".
</P>
<P>
China will have 400 million people over the age of 60 within a
short 50 years, compared to the current total on 120 million,
according to estimates released by the China National Committee
on Aging (CNCA) which studies aging issues.
</P>
<P>
Major cities such as Shanghai and Beijing have witnessed
rapidly rising aging populations in recent years, with close to
10 percent their citizens over the age of 60.
</P>
<P>
One CNCA official noted that solutions must be found for a
number of problems related to aging, including social welfare and
insurance services for senior citizens, and effectively
protecting their rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The CNCA has launched a comprehensive project to formulate
national policy research on aging issued in the first half of
next century.
</P>
<P>
"Lawmakers must be prepared to face new challenges related to
aging," according to CNCA Chairman Zhang Wenfan. He added that
related efforts will require extensive advice and scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
Scholars plans to focus on subjects such as the impact aging
will have on China's economy and society, as well as policies for
senior citizens and longevity research.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Use English as State Language, Scrapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda has decided to replace
French with English as its official language, Rwanda President
Pasteur Bizimungu announced on the eve of the East African
Cooperation (EAC) summit slated for January 21 which will discuss
Rwanda's membership application.
</P>
<P>
The regional organization groups three English-speaking
countries -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu was quoted by Monday's East African weekly as saying
that because Rwanda's historical, cultural and business links with
east Africa are stronger than those shared with faraway
French-speaking west African countries, Rwandans are already
hoping to join the EAC.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda will now align itself with the Anglophone
nations of east Africa instead of its traditional Francophone
partners because France played a role in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
"If you follow the recent reports of investigations from the
French parliament, it is clearly indicated that France has been
involved in the genocide in Rwanda and in the events which
preceded the massacres, because they wanted to defend their own
language," said the president.

<HEADLINE> Manila Vows to Pursue Peace Talks With Rebel Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday that it is determined to pursue peace negotiations with the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) despite the rebel group's
attacks on government troops in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In a radio interview here Monday, Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora said that the government's peacekeeping forces are ready to
launch offensives against lawless elements as a way to restore
peace and order in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The government is aware that the attacks on government
detachments are the handiwork of the MILF and not of its lost
commands, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue peace negotiations with the MILF, but we will
not allow them to talk peace and attack us at the same time, then
point the blame to lost commands, we don't believe that. We know
that they are under one central command. We want to make sure they
understand that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said this was the reason President Joseph Estrada
ordered the police and military to step up their offensives
against criminality and terrorism in Mindanao as early as two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF is fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the Southern Philippines, but its demand has been
rejected by the government. The two sides are scheduled to start
formal peace talks in the first week of February.

<HEADLINE> 5,000-Year-Old Cultural Relics Damaged in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Shizuitou cultural relics site in Baoji City, about 180
kilometers west of Xi'an, capital of the province, has been under
preservation at the provincial level since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The relics include rich cultural ruins dating back to the New
Stone Age and the Qin (221-207 B.C.) and Han (206 B.C.-220 A.D.)
dynasties. A Xinhua reporter saw a 20-meter-deep ditch, hundreds
of meters long and dozens of meters wide, which had been dug out
at the Shizuitou cultural relics site, which covers an area of
20,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The damaged relics include pottery of the New Stone Age, house
ruins of the Longshan Culture dating back 4,000-4,500 years,
bricks of the Han Dynasty and ruins of the ancient pottery kiln
as well as three tombs.
</P>
<P>
Police in Baoji City also confiscated a large number of
cultural relics illegally held by some construction workers,
including pottery bowls belonging to the New Stone Age and the
Zhou Dynasty, and knives, swords, jade hairpins and more than 200
coins of the Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
As early as May 1996, Baoji City's archeological team had
submitted a map outlining the cultural relics site to the
construction company.
</P>
<P>
However, the request to pay attention and protect the relics
during construction, which began last November, was ignored.
</P>
<P>
The city's cultural relics protection department is said to
take legal actions against the construction unit, accusing it of
violating the state Cultural Relics Protection Law which
stipulates that construction projects are forbidden on cultural
relics sites under protection.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi in northwest china is well-known for its numerous
cultural relics and historical sites. The Shizuitou site attracts
great many tourists from home and abroad every year.

<P>
TIANJIN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-five percent of Tianjin
Municipality's 3,000 state-owned enterprises have introduced a
system opening enterprise affairs to workers and practicing
democratic management since late 1997, and this system has proved
effective in combating various financial difficulties at these
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Now, more than 200 of the enterprises have been brought out of
the red or have reduced their losses, and 100 of them were
recently cited for outstanding performance in successfully
implementing the system.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the system includes holding
workers' congresses, joint conferences with the participation of
people representing the Party, the administrative departments and
trade unions, and publicizing the actual situations in the
enterprises to keep workers fully informed.
</P>
<P>
Through those methods, workers may discuss affairs including
major tasks and production decisions, the use of business
promotion fees, the distribution of bonuses and salaries, and the
appointment or removal of officials.
</P>
<P>
Based on opinions from workers' congresses, 467 officials of
these state-owned enterprises have been removed or suspended
temporarily from their original official posts, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that implementation of the system has also
made for a closer relationship between the enterprises and the
workers, and has aroused workers' initiative in caring for the
enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Railways Corporation
(KRC) has announced that it will raise freight charges from the
Indian Ocean port of Mombasa to inland container depots effective
from February 1.
</P>
<P>
Moving a 20-foot container from Mombasa to Kisumu and back --
with the container empty one way -- will now cost 1,016 U.S.
Dollars, up from 800 Dollars, while the charge for a 40-foot
container will be 1,575 Dollars, up from 1,500 Dollars, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Charges for the same trip, but with the container loaded both
ways, will be 886 Dollars, up from 844 Dollars, for a 20-foot
container, according to the special traffic notice released by the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The changes come exactly one year after Kenya Railways effected
a 10- percent hike in freight charges, citing increased demand for
Railtainer services following extensive damage to the country's
road and railways systems by the El Nino rains. No reasons were
given for this year's price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Last year's increase in tariffs provoked protests from

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The social cost of road
crashes in New Zealand, a country with a population of less than
3.8 million, is estimated at 3.2 billion NZ dollars (1.7 billion
U.S. dollars) a year in hospital treatment, loss of wages,
compensation, counseling and investigation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Land Transport Safety Authority of New
Zealand, 504 people died on New Zealand roads and more than
10,000 were injured last year.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post Monday quoted Neil Gyde, an officer in charge
of the traffic section of the National Headquarters of the NZ
Police, as saying that police aim to reduce the road toll to 470
deaths and cut reported injuries to 12,400 this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it has been a horror start to 1999 on New Zealand
roads with 27 deaths, the Wellington-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"This year our target is no more than 470 deaths. It's a big
task. We're coming off a baseline of 500-odd," Gyde said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the top three causes of fatalities
are drink-driving, speed and not wearing seatbelts.

<HEADLINE> Backlog for Airlines as Wellington Airport Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Airlines have been busy
Monday clearing a backlog of thousands of passengers after the
Wellington International Airport reopened in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The airport was closed to nearly all flights Sunday due to low
cloud and fog.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, Air New Zealand alone canceled 40
domestic and international flights, affecting the travel plans of
at least 3,000 passengers, including many diving teams, who
participated in the 11th Diving World Cup from January 12 to 16.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of passengers is expected to totally clear
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Local media said Wellington air traffic control had problems on
 Saturday morning with a temporary failure of glide path landing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
But Airways Corporation communications manager Heather Hayden
said it could not be used at that time anyway due to low cloud,
which was down to 45m.
</P>
<P>
"The equipment is used to guide pilots when cloud is between
150m and 180m. The failure was unusual and would be investigated,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Inflation Hits 38-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in New Zealand is
at its lowest point in 38 years, according to figures released by
 Statistics New Zealand Monday.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose only 0.4 percent,
the smallest annual increase since 1960.
</P>
<P>
In the last quarter of 1998, prices actually fell 0.8 percent,
the largest Quarterly fall since 1957.
</P>
<P>
The main factor pushing prices down was cuts in mortgage rates,
 Statistics New Zealand says, adding banks slashed mortgage rates
to 30-year lows in the latter part of last year, resulting in a
12 percent fall in the mortgage rate component of the CPI.
</P>
<P>
Lower property prices and lower power bills due to increased
competition also pushed the CPI down, according to Statistics New
Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Commission Proposes Small Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Clarifying the property rights
and relationship between administration and enterprises
constitute the core reform for small state-owned firms, according
to a report by the Macroeconomic Research Institute under the
State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Sales of auctions will be used to transform small enterprises
into businesses more suited to the market competition, says the
report by the China Small Enterprise Development Research Panel.
</P>
<P>
The reports notes that the separation of administration from
enterprise management will support anti-corruption and sharpen
competition.
</P>
<P>
Support policies will target the expansion of employment and
anti-poverty efforts, and will promote the specialization and
cooperation and technological renovations.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving related goals will require the further emancipation
of minds and enhanced awareness," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It urges governments at various levels to attach still greater
attention to supporting the development of small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided by the State Economic and Trade Commission
show that the number of small to medium-sized enterprises account
for 99 percent of ventures in the state-owned industrial sector,
with their output value and pretax profits making up 60 percent
and 40 percent of the respective totals.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed, two
others were injured and at least 2,000 shanties were gutted in a
devastating fire at a slum here on Sunday evening, press reports
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fire units from 10 stations rushed to the spot to extinguish
the blaze in Mohakhali, in the north part of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the fire originated from domestic stove and
spread to the adjoining slum houses quickly. The fire devoured all
the shanties there, which were made of bamboo, straws, tin and
other materials, and provided shelter to some 10,000 dwellers.
</P>
<P>
In another fire incident, more than 100 shops were gutted at
Mirpur Cooperative Market in the city on Sunday afternoon, the
Bangladesh Observer daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which broke out in a hardware shop on the first floor
of the four-storied building, originated while some workers were
working with highly inflammable tincture in candle light at the
Luxmipur Hardware Shop, the report quoted fire fighters and police
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to the adjoining shops quickly leaving more
than 60 shops gutted completely and 40 others partially. Only a
few shops on the same floor remained unaffected.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said a barrel full of tincture blasted with a bang
during the fire, fueling the flames and turning it as an inferno.
No deaths or injury was reported.
</P>
<P>
Shop owners said the fire spread to the adjacent shops so
quickly that they could not even remove the cash. "We have lost
everything," they said.
</P>
<P>
Some unscrupulous people, "in the name of helping fire
fighters," looted goods from the affected market during the
incident, according to the shop owners, who estimated the fire
damage at 80 million taka (1.65 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China to Draft Law Protecting Private Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China will draft a law to
protect private firms and strengthen regulations on taxation
aimed at such firms, according to a prominent figure in the
nation's legislature.
</P>
<P>
Li Yining, with the National People's Congress (NPC) said here
on Saturday that the Wholly Owned Enterprise Law will be drafted
soon and submitted to the NPC for approval this year.
</P>
<P>
Li, a renowned economist and also deputy director of NPC's
Financial and Economic Committee, has played a key role in the
enactment of the Securities Law passed last month.
</P>
<P>
The Wholly Owned Enterprise Law will mainly focus on
administration and management of private companies owned by
domestic investors, since China already has a law on
overseas-funded businesses, including wholly owned foreign firms,
said Li.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the new law will contain clauses stipulating
standardized accounting management by private firms to prevent
them from evading tax obligations.
</P>
<P>
The law, expected to be promulgated in 1999, will serve as an
initiative taken by China in its efforts to cultivate promising
growth areas for its economy amidst slowing economic growth on
the whole.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed that output of China's private sector
reached 847 billion yuan (102 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, and
seven percent of the country's industrial and commercial taxes
were paid by private businesses.
</P>
<P>
As China's state sector is undergoing an overhaul, the country
needs a thriving private sector to absorb workers trimmed from
state firms.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still much discrimination against private
firms as the nation's corporate circles have been dominated by
state enterprises for decades.
</P>
<P>
The country has recently stepped up removing obstacles
hindering development of the private firms.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, began
to permit lending rates of commercial banks to fluctuate in a
wider range around its benchmark rates late last year.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, a group of private companies were allowed to
handle foreign trade on their own for the first time.

Kan won 180 votes while Matsuzawa took 51. There were two

As many as 145 parliament members of the DPJ, the country's

</P>
<P>
Kan's victory was widely expected because of the backing he

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatian star and the
tournament's 11th seed Goran Ivanisevic has withdrawn from
Australian Open due to a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic notified tournament officials of his decision on
Monday, ahead of his first round match against Andrei Cherkasov
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The same injury had forced Ivanisevic out of the Colonial
Classic in Melburne last week, an exhibition match by the world's
leading eight players.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic had complained of back pain since playing in Qatar
earlier this month, but said last week he hoped it would not
prevent him playing in the Open.
</P>
<P>
He has been replaced in the open by Germany's Bernd Karacher.
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic's withdrawal, while not entirely unexpected, was
the second blow delivered to the tournament in its first few
hours.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Germany's Anke Huber provided the first upset in the
first match completed in Melbourne on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Huber knocked out 13th seed Irina Spirlea in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
In what was always going to be one of the toughest first round
matches for the seeded players, Huber won 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The German, ranked 18th in the world, was runner-up here in
1996 and has made the fourth round in the past two years.

Raptors, who would ship Billups to Denver.
</P>
<P>
The Raptors would receive at least one first-round draft pick
from the Wolves or Nuggets, who also may receive Raptors forward
Reggie Slater.
</P>
<P>
All deals and signings cannot be announced until Tuesday, when
the NBA is expected to complete the new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Garrett played for the Timberwolves as a 30-year-old rookie in
the 1996-97 season, averaging 8.0 points and 7.3 rebounds per
game and taking over as the starting center late in the season.
But he left as a free agent to sign a five-year, $15 million
contract with the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 25, made the All-Rookie Second Team with 11.6 points,
4.7 assists and 4.4 rebounds as a starter last season.
</P>
<P>
Billups was selected third overall by the Boston Celtics last
year. He was dealt to the Raptors in February as part of the
Kenny Anderson trade.
</P>
<P>
Williams, 32, played 25 games last season as he completed a
remarkable comeback from nerve damage in his left foot. He had
played just 10 games over the previous three campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Williams was a member of the 1989 Detroit Piston, who won the
NBA title. He also played for Phoenix, Charlotte and Indiana and
holds the all-time record with 97 consecutive free throws over
two seasons in 1993. He has career averages of 11.0 points and
5.8 assists in 411 games.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Agree with Steve Kerr on Multi-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The exodus of the
three-time defending champions Chicago Bulls reportedly has begun
as free agent guard Steve Kerr agreed to a multi-year deal with
the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Kerr, who made the series-winning jumper in the 1997 NBA
Finals against the Utah Jazz, has agreed to undisclosed terms and
will sign the contract on Monday. He made $750,000 last season in
the final year of a four-year contract he signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kerr's departure is the first of what is expected to be many
as the Bulls begin an enormous renovation following superstar
Michael Jordan's retirement announcement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kerr is one of nine free agents from the Bulls, a group that
includes star forward Scottie Pippen and six-time defending re
bound champion Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Kerr is the all-time leading three-point
shooter and a nice fit for the Spurs, who boast the strong inside
attack of All-Star center David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Despite
the absence of a consistent perimeter shooter, San Antonio won 56
games last season.
</P>
<P>
Kerr averaged 7.5 points last season, his 10th in the NBA and
fifth with Chicago. His career three-point percentage of 0.473 is
best among those with at least 250 made. He won the Long Distance
Shootout at All-Star Weekend in 1997 and his 1994-95 clip of 52.4
percent is an NBA record.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua)-- Despite a sluggish export
situation, China exported 66.54 billion U.S. dollars of machinery
and electrical goods last year, a 12.2 percent rise on a yearly
basis, according to a report in the Economic Daily.
</P>
<P>
This figure was higher than the 65 billion-U.S-dollars target
set by the State Council at the beginning of the year, the Daily
said.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted customs statistics showing that in 1998,
China's combined imports and exports of machinery and electrical
goods totaled 130.41 billion U.S. dollars, a growth of 9.9
percent over 1997, and accounted for 40.3 percent of the
country's gross foreign trade volume.
</P>
<P>
The export structure has been further improved, helping bring
about a marked rise in the export of high value-added goods such
as digital processing equipment and high-grade home appliances.
</P>
<P>
The market has also been further diversified, bringing more
trade with North America, the European Union and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The export target set for 1999 is 71.5 billion U.S. dollars,
which would represent a rise of 7.5 percent over last year.

<HEADLINE> Gloomy Prospects for Sri Lanka's Export in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Exporters
Association (SLEA) has predicted that 1999 will be an extremely
bad year for the country's export performance, due to drastic
increases in freight rates and severe price competition.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's export growth from January to November last year
had dropped to 3 percent from 14 percent in the previous year,
said sources with the SLEA Monday.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the apparel sector and the agricultural sector all
other exports had declined steeply, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the situation is likely to get worse with
increased freight rates and terminal handling charges as a result
of shipping lines establishing cartels.
</P>
<P>
From January 1999 Terminal Handling Charges have increased by
40 percent to the United States and 55 percent to Europe. Freight
rates have been increased to a further 1000 U.S. dollars per 40
feet container and 600 dollars per 20 feet container.
</P>
<P>
The sources expressed fear of the impending decline and
probable closure threatening the export industry.
</P>
<P>
They said due to devaluation manufacturers from Southeast Asia
have reduced the selling prices of their products and Sri Lanka
has also been compelled to do so.
</P>
<P>
The value of all coconut products have declined from 7,900
million rupees (116 million U.S. dollars) during January-October
1997 to 6,700 million rupees (98.5 million dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Tea prices have taken a downturn since August 1998, which are
expected to continue to fall in 1999, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The prices offered by buyers to the apparel industry has
dropped by 10 percent, said the sources, adding that the rubber
industry has also had to cut down prices to meet international
competition.

BANGKOK, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Thai shrimp exporters have
chartered a Thai Airways International (THAI) plane to fly shrimps
to Shanghai, aviation sources said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
That will be the first shipment of shrimps bound for the
metropolitan city.
</P>
<P>
Normally, THAI reserves about half of the 40 tons of cargo
space on selected passenger flights for loading farm products.
Being able to double the amount of farm cargo will be a boom to
exporters, said the sources on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Most of the shrimps exported to Shanghai are fresh, and bring
in more revenue than frozen products, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The exporters has signed a one-year contract with THAI for the
use of the plane, which will not carry passengers.
</P>
<P>
After the Shanghai run, the plane will be used to export other
products such as durian, rambutan, longan and fresh flowers to
other markets, especially Hong Kong and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The exporters also want to maximize the utilization of the
plane by finding goods to ship back to Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Research on Genes of South China Tigers Faces Financial, Technical Difficulties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese research program on
the genes of south China tigers has been suspended for financial
and technical reasons, according to an official in charge of the
program.
</P>
<P>
Cui Liping, director of the China South China Tiger Protection
and Coordination Committee, expressed her hope that both domestic
and overseas research organizations will join the efforts to
promote this research.
</P>
<P>
China created a genetic data base for south China tigers in
Shanghai in 1995 as part of efforts to save this endangered rare
animal species, and the Shanghai Zoo has collected the sperm,
blood, hair and skins of more than 20 South China tigers.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that researches on artificial insemination, external
fertilization, embryo transfer and cloning have not been started
because of insufficient funds, poor research facilities and an
insufficient technical faculty, and the collected samples are now
being kept in canned liquefied nitrogen at 196 degrees below zero
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that China now has 51 South China tigers in
captivity, but most of them are close blood relations. Experts
have predicted that these tigers could vanish within 50 years or
two generations unless something is done right now.
</P>
<P>
Cui said the Shanghai Zoo plans to send some blood samples to
the Giant Panda Research Center in Chengdu for DNA analysis to
clarify the blood relationships among the tigers now in
captivity.

The Transport Ministry opposed the council's contention that

In addition there is a conflict between the Transport Ministry

</P>
<P>
The Transport Ministry wants to integrate the TOT and CAT in
the form of a holding company, but the Finance Ministry argues
that the TOT and CAT should establish holding companies separately
to prevent a monopoly during liberalization.
</P>

Concession conversion has been put on hold by the state
Enterprise Policy Committee, chaired by Deputy prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>

The committee selected the Thailand Development Research

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Political Parties Demand OSCE Mission Head's Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav political parties
Sunday strongly condemned William Walker, chairman of the Kosovo
Verification Mission of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, for lying about the latest development in
Kosovo and demanded his immediate removal.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Socialist Party, in a statement, expressed its
"strongest" condemnation of Walker's remarks, saying that the
whole world in the past few months has seen clearly that ethnic
Albanian "terrorists" are the only obstacle to a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
While ethnic Albanian "terrorists" have repeatedly slaughtered
and kidnapped civilians, Serb policemen, Yugoslav service men and
even members of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, Walker has
all along kept silence, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The only explanation to Walker's silence is that he is the
ally of the ethnic Albanian "terrorists," it said.
</P>
<P>
The party urged the Kosovo Verification Mission to report
subjectively to the international community on what is happening
in Kosovo. It also asked the international community to ease
supporting the Albanian "terrorists" in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Lefties Coalition said through its spokesman that
Walker told lies for the purpose of provoking new international
pressure on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that Walker has become the spokesman and
protector of the ethnic Albanian "terrorists," it said, he no
longer has the right to serve as head of the OSCE Kosovo Mission.
</P>
<P>
Golan Latinovik, chairman of the Supreme Committee of the
Yugoslav Communist Party, said at a press conference that the
United Stated intends to use the OSCE as a tool for it to
dominate the world and Walker is the executor of this intention.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Radical Party also issued a statement demanding
the OSCE leadership to dismiss Walker right away.
</P>
<P>
It said that Walker's hatred of the Serb Republic and people
is by no means less than that of the "terrorist groups" in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
His continued serving as mission chairman will only further
worsen the situation in Kosovo and throw into question the
existence of the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, it said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, the
Serb police were forced to exchange fire with illegal Albanian
militants last Friday in the village of Racak, South Kosovo,
killing at least 15 militants.
</P>
<P>
Walker announced Saturday in Pristina that after his
on-the-spot verification, he was sure that the Yugoslav police
force had killed 45 ethnic Albanian civilians in Racak. Walker
also asked the U.N. war crime tribunal in the Hague to send
investigators to Racak within 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Freeway Pileup Injures at Least 12 in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 12 people were
injured as some 50 cars and trucks smashed together in a massive
freeway pileup in Michigan State of the United States on Sunday,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The chain-reaction crash occurred on Interstate 94 just south
of Detroit, and the accident was blamed on black ice, fog and
high speed.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Michigan State Police Trooper John Sosa as
saying that the fog and drivers moving too fast "coupled with the
black ice on the roadway caused cars to spin out of control."
</P>
<P>
"Those factors spelled nothing but trouble," he said.
</P>
<P>
The crash led to the closure of the freeway in both directions
over a section of several kilometers for hours. Authorities
reopened I-94 to eastbound traffic at about noon Sunday, two
hours before the westbound lanes were reopened.

<HEADLINE> China's State Farms Expected to Grow Six Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's state farms, key
players in the country's agricultural sector, are expected to
grow by six percent and produce 17.2 million tons of grain this
year, says today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The country's 2,100 state farms now produce a sizable portion
of the total agricultural output, including one-tenth of
state-procured commodity grains and 80 percent of the country's
rubber, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yuzhuang, director of the ministry's Bureau of State
Farms, said last year's gross national product in the sector grew
by five percent to 43.73 billion yuan (dlrs 5.27 billion), and
grain output hit 16.4 million tons, the second highest harvest in
history.
</P>
<P>
"Central tasks this year are to improve the quality of farm
produce and readjust the product mix to meet diversified market
demands," Zheng said, adding that major products that need
improvement include spring wheat, cotton, fodder corn, sugar
beets and rye.
</P>
<P>
Vice minister of Agriculture Lu Ming has recently told a
national agricultural conference in Beijing that annual growth
rate of state farms has dropped from 9.5 percent in the 1978-96
period to an average 5.7 percent since 1997, and that the
money-losing trend lingers.
</P>
<P>
Lu attributed the downturn to the shrinking markets and export
volume, and urged the state farm sector to apply high technology
to processing of agricultural product as well as the marketing of
farm produce.
</P>
<P>
Enhanced industrialization is expected to allow optimization
of industrial resources and make it more adaptive to the market
economy, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
State farms cover 4.8 million hectares of arable land, about
4.6 percent of the country's total. Since much of them lie in
arid regions, the promotion of applied farming technologies,
especially water-saving irrigation techniques, has a significant
bearing on the farms, experts say.

<HEADLINE> More Foggy Days in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The number of foggy days in
Beijing has been increasing in recent years due to the
interaction of suspended particles and vapor, environmental
protection experts were quoted as saying by today's Beijing
Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
They backed up their conclusion with statistics showing that
the city's annual foggy days had increased to 256 in 1997, from
only 40 days in 1983, and the number of such days further
increased last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that visibility in Beijing was 18 kilometers on
average in the 1950s, but is now less than 10 kilometers. They
explained that solar radiation weakened by heavy suspended
particles in the air has also caused more of moisture in the air.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported that the present-day fog can only be
dispelled by heavy winds because of the huge proportion of
suspended particles in the air.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 17 (Xinhua) -- An anti-money laundering
law, the first of its kind in Romania, took effect on Sunday for
the crackdown of rampant under-world economy, which amounts to 22
percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Exchange and transfer of money made through illegal deals such
as drug trafficking, smuggling, theft, fraud and tax evasion are
listed as money laundering in the law.
</P>
<P>
Offenders of the law will be jailed for three to 12 years, and
masterminds and accessories for five to 15 years, under the law.
</P>
<P>
A national bureau and provincial branches will be set up for
gathering and analyzing information related to suspected
money-laundering and sending it to judicial departments.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, for sums over 10,000 ECU (about 11,740 U.S.
dollars), the banks and other financial institutions must verify
the client's identity before a transfer is made.
</P>
<P>
Romania annually loses at least one billion U.S. dollars of
revenue because of the under-world economy, which has nearly
doubled in the past five years, according to a survey by an
authoritative institution released in December.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Tomb with Anti-robbery Gears Found Robbed in Xi'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The builders of a Han Dynasty
(206 B.C. -- 220 A.D.) tomb filled it with sand in order to allow
the dead rest in peace. But their effort has proved futile as
archeologists in Xi'an recently found that this tomb had been rob
bed.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Shaanxi Provincial Archeological Research
Office unearthed the tomb on a building site of the Xi'an
Communications School in the city's northern suburb. The sex of
the tomb's occupant could not be determined because the burial
site was left in a poor condition after it was pilfered.
</P>
<P>
Sand-filled tombs are rare, and this was the first found in
Xi'an. Such tombs are not easily robbed because would-be thieves
are afraid of being inundated by the falling sand, experts said,
adding that these cunning robbers had kept clear of the tomb room
and dug to the bottom, drilling a hole and taking out the buried
treasures.
</P>
<P>
A lamp made in the Song Dynasty (960 A.D. -- 1279 A.D.), which
was left inside the tomb, is an indication that the robbers were
probably Song people.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 50 articles inside the tomb, including
six servants and a number of jars, pots and clocks, reflecting
the high standard of sculpture in that dynasty. However, gold,
silver, and jade articles that were probably placed beside the
noble tomb occupant are missing.

<HEADLINE> Education Priority Given to Ethnic Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
ethnic minority groups, particularly the less populous ones while
running to meet its deadline regarding compulsory education,
today's "China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quotes Wang Fulin, spokesman of the State Ethnic
Affairs Commission as saying that the program, kicked off in 1996
to help the students of 22 ethnic minorities, will keep its
momentum this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 2000, the minorities with a population less than
100,000 people are expected to make high school a must for 85
percent of their students, said Lan Zhiqi, an official with the
education department of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has vowed to make the nine-year
compulsory education program accessible to 85 percent of students
by the end of the century. The task is especially challenging in
ethnic regions, Lan said.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's 55 ethnic minorities, 525,860 people belong
to the 22 groups which have a population of less than 100,000 p
eople, accounting for 0.6 percent of the total minority
population.
</P>
<P>
Most of these small minorities live near borders, where
traditional ways of life are centered around fishing and hunting
in addition to farming. Poverty is still haunting many ethnic r
egions, which hinders the development of education, Lan said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to increase investment in
these areas. Primary school teachers will go through special
training, and high school teacher are to be trained at the
prefecture level. Teachers have to speak both standard Chinese
and the local language, both of which are taught in the schools,
says the paper.

<HEADLINE> Rural Economy Contributes Greatly to Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 18 (Xinhua) -- The rural areas around
Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, produced 112 billion
yuan in gross domestic product last year, one-third of the city's
total.
</P>
<P>
According to recent figures from the municipal statistics
bureau, the rural economy grew by 15.2 percent last year and
played a major role in helping the city achieve a 10.1 percent
growth despite the negative impact of the lingering Asian
financial crisis and weakened consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Deputy mayor Feng Guoqin attributes this development mainly to
the diversified rural economy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanghai's rural areas have stepped up
efforts to draw investment from other parts of the city, and this
has resulted in an increasing number of township enterprises.
Last year, these enterprises reported 270 billion yuan in
industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors have rushed in to set up 9,280 ventures
over the years, with contractual capital of 15.99 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Private businesses have also flourished, especially in several
newly established private economic zones, which turned out 18
billion yuan of industrial output last year, accounting for about
seven percent of all rural output.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost island
province of Hainan is witnessing a leveling out of educational
standards between its ethnic minority group and the Han majority
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic minority people account for 17 percent of the p
rovince's total, but they have received more educational funds
and infrastructure investment than the Han residents over the
past decade, with the annual education appropriation amounting to
300 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Fu Honghe, head of the provincial education department, said
that Hainan has set up a complete educational framework in areas
densely populated by ethnic people, where some 64 percent of the
population have received nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200 middle schools and eight vocational
training schools as well as two adult higher-learning institutes
and a university in the nine ethnic autonomous prefectures.
</P>
<P>
These areas have managed to eliminate illiteracy and the
number of ethnic university students per 10,000 people has incre
ased to 6.5 percent from 3.6 percent in 1990, which is 2.9
percentage points higher than the average level in the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there has been a large number of talented graduates
from the area's 20 training schools and secondary schools who have
 helped boost the professional expertise in sectors ranging from
tourism to electronics.

New life-styles and increased income will trigger a higher
demand for fast food and for cosmetics, beauty and health
products.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds Urban Residents Concerned about Progress of Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- China's urban residents have
voiced their most anxious concerns in a recent survey which finds
that anti-corruption campaign, employment reform and making
changes to the social insurance system are among the top three.
</P>
<P>
The other three issues of most concern include environmental
protection, reform of state-owned enterprises and the
strengthening of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The survey has polled 785 people in Beijing, Tianjin,
Guangzhou, Chongqing and other large cities.
</P>
<P>
It also indicates that after six consecutive interest rate
cuts by China's Central Bank, savings are now regarded as the
safest and best choice for investments forms by urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Among those surveyed,76.9 percent say that they prefer
saving money in banks and 63.5 percent say they will increase
their deposits, while 23.6 percent say they would choose to buy
securities and stocks.
</P>
<P>
Most of them do not plan to increase their investments in
1999, however, as housing costs are high for most of them and
they would rather wait and see how the economy progresses before
making further decisions.

CHONGQING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two marrow matches

China's Chongqing Municipality have been found in Taiwan in the

Xinhua released a story on December 17 last year about how
people are giving a helping hand to Zhang Yu, a female student at
Chongqing Normal University, who was diagnosed with acute

At present, China has marrow bases in Beijing, Shanghai and Gu
angzhou, but no same-type marrow as that of Zhang was found at

The Tzu Chi Taiwan Marrow Donor Registry has selected 22
marrow records from 160,000 on file since Zhang's records were
transferred to the center at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Xinqiao Hospital, where Zhang Yu is now a patient, has
selected 14 donors from the 22 based on age, sex and health

<HEADLINE> Man-made Rainfall Alleviates Drought in the Yellow River Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Man-made rain has helped
alleviate drought and increase agriculture production on the
upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the amount of artificial rainfall has
reached more than three billion cubic meters in the area over the
past two years. The period artificial rainfall lasted more than
180 days and reached 2.07 billion cubic meters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, second longest in China, originates from
Qinghai and passes through nine provinces and autonomous regions,
with a total length of 5,464 kilometers. Since 1990, sustained
drought has caused a sharp decrease of water flow on the upper
reaches, making some river sections dry up on the lower reaches,
affecting the economic expansion of the river valley.
</P>
<P>
High elevation and large pieces of marshland are ideal for
producing rainfall on the upper reaches of the Yellow River,
meteorologists say.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai will step up even greater efforts in producing
rainfall with support from the central government in the next few
years, officials have revealed.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia Issues New Policy on Trade Financing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia (BI) has issued
a new policy extending the government-sponsored trade financing
scheme to all exporters and applicable to the import of all
commodities, the Indonesian Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new policy was issued on January 11, 1999 and therefore,
exporters can start to utilize the facility or to open the
guaranteed letter of credit through designated banks, BI's Foreign
Affairs Division Chairman Nana Supriatna said.
</P>
<P>
"The new policy is designed to enhance the utilization of the
facility as it has not been used optimally," Nana was quoted by
the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that importers are also eligible for the facility, not
confined to only those holding PET (facilities for certain
exporting companies).
</P>
<P>
"Importers/exporters who do not hold the PET will also be
allowed to utilize the facility," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nana explained that exporters are now allowed to import all
sorts of commodities, not only 46 kinds of commodities as in the
previous ruling, provided that they are raw materials intended for
export-oriented products.
</P>
<P>
"The policy also allows all banks, not only 28 designated
banks, to handle the trade financing on the condition that they
have no arrears in international trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nana said that the policy is only applicable to the BI trade
financing scheme, the funds of which is derived from the
government. While, the trade financing scheme provided by other
countries such as Japan Exim Bank and U.S. Exim Bank, are exempted
from the policy.
</P>
<P>
Data at BI shows that the realized trade financing scheme
offered by BI only reached 664 million U.S. dollars of the
allocated 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Former German captain Juergen
Klinsmann has decided not to resume his career in the United
States and has retired for good.
</P>
<P>
"I toyed with the idea and I collected information about Major
League Soccer. But I've decided to retire for good," Klinsmann
told the German sports news agency SID on Sunday from his Los
Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann, 34, retired from the German national team after its
ouster by Croatia in the World Cup quarterfinals in France last
summer.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann's wife is American and the couple and their son now
live in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
One of the top forwards in the world in the past decade,
Klinsmann, finished his 11-year international career with 108
caps and 47 goals -- sharing second place on the all-time German
scoring list with Rudi Voeller. Gerd Mueller had 68 goals in 62
games.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann has been without a club contract since leading
Tottenham Hotspur out of the relegation zone in England's Premier
League last season.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann said he wanted to stage a charity match in Germany
that would also serve as his official farewell.
</P>
<P>
"I really wanted to say good-bye to my fans in Germany. But
the German federation refused to do it. I am very sad and
bitterly disappointed," Klinsmann told SID.
</P>
<P>
The German Soccer Federation (DFB) has stopped staging such
matches for its long-serving players as a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann said he was not sure now whether he would travel to
Florida for a farewell party when the German team goes there for
matches against the United States on Feb. 6 in Jacksonville and
Colombia on Feb. 9 in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Golkar Apologizes for Past Mistakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) finally apologized to the people for its past
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
"Golkar sincerely apologizes to the entire nation for all
mistakes and wrongdoings of the past," Golkar's General Chairman
Akbar Tandjung said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the party also apologized for failing to accommodate
all aspirations of the people during its rule.
</P>
<P>
The apology was the first ever made by the Golkar chairman. The
ruling group came under strong criticism when it said last year it
would not apologize to the public as demanded.
</P>
<P>
Golkar believes that this apology is timely considering the
predominantly Muslim nation will be overwhelmed by the spirit of
Idul Fitri (feast celebrating the end of fasting period) -- that
is, forgiveness, Akbar said.
</P>
<P>
The largest Muslim country in the world, Indonesia, is set to
celebrate the Idul Fitri festivities on January 19 and 20.
</P>
<P>
Golkar has been blamed for many shortcomings considered to have
caused the protracted economic crisis following the downfall of
Soeharto as the president of the New Order government on May 21
last year.
</P>
<P>
Top Golkar executive Marzuki Darusman had apologized to the
people in November last year. However, Akbar said Marzuki's
apology was too early and was thus considered personal, and did
not represent the party as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"At last, golkar's board of executives utilized the momentum
behind this period, and we as an institution, consider it to be a
perfect time to formally apologize to the people for past
mistakes," Akbar was quoted by national newspapers Monday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During Soeharto's 32-year reign, Golkar always enjoyed
landslide victories in elections. Critics say elections under
Soeharto were identical to money politics and contained an
abundance of vote-rigging.
</P>
<P>
Responding to critics, Akbar said: "What happened in the past
as well as what happens now, are the products of all of us as a
nation, and this includes any socio-political issues. Golkar
admits that shortcomings did exist, and that wrongdoings had taken
place. But, what's more important is the future. Based on a new
commitment, we also vow to look toward a brighter future."
</P>
<P>
He said Golkar is set to enter a new era, an era of openness
and democracy.

<HEADLINE> Fowler Close to Liverpool Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Robbie Fowler is on the brink
of agreeing a new contract to stay at Liverpool for five years
after his current deal ends in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
Manager Gerard Houllier witnessed Fowler's tremendous
hat-trick in the seven goal mauling of Southampton - when the
Liverpool star completed a century of Premiership goals - and
predicted the imminent end to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A smiling Houllier claimed: "It won't be long now. Yes, I am
confident.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to know much more by the end of the week. Am I
expecting a positive outcome? Yes, of course I am," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fowler's advisors were at Anfield on Saturday as the player
returned to almost his best form after a near year-long battle to
recover from a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
The belief now at the club, and particularly from Houllier, is
that Fowler wants to stay.
</P>
<P>
Certainly after his outstanding form against the sorry Saints,
he showed his sharpness is almost spot on.
</P>
<P>
He has suffered somewhat this season from probably coming back
too soon from a serious injury, and his battle for true match
sharpness has gone hand in hand with protracted negotiations
about his future.
</P>
<P>
Now he has taken his tally to 13 in 24 games for the season.
The second goal of his hat-trick cracked the century mark, and
he's now got 101 in 175 league matches.
</P>
<P>
His overall goals record for the club is an astonishing 142 in
240 - no wonder Houllier wants to tie him down for a very long
time.
</P>
<P>
The partnership with Michael Owen has totalled 30 already for
the season, and Liverpool are now second only to Manchester
United -- next week's FA Cup opponents at Old Trafford -- in the
Premiership scoring stakes.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool's improved form on the back of a six-match unbeaten
run has given them a genuine chance of finishing in the top three
and taking a Champions League spot, with the FA Cup and at least
a UEFA Cup qualification very much on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Fowler, who is the fourth player after Alan Shearer, Ian
Wright and Les Ferdinand to net a century of Premiership goals, a
dmitted he didn't even realise he had reached the 100 mark.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I didn't realise it was my 100th league goal until
Jamie Carragher ran up to me afterwards to tell me. "He said to
me,that's your 100th goal', and I didn't even know."

<HEADLINE> NATO Condemns Kosovo Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- NATO condemned on Sunday the
massacre of 45 Kosovar Albanians after an emergency meeting by its
ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
But the western military alliance did not decide on any
military intervention in the Yugoslav province and called instead
on the Yugoslav authorities to cooperate fully with the
international war crimes tribunal in accordance with the United
Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement issued late on Sunday, the alliance said
that the urgent meeting demanded the Yugoslav government take
immediate steps to ensure that those responsible for the massacre
that took place last Friday in the village of Racak in southern
Kosovo are brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
"The names of those who participated in the killing and those
who gave the orders must be divulged and they must be handed over
to the international war crimes tribunal for prosecution if
requested," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
NATO also decided to send two of its senior military officers
to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia next Monday to explain to
the Yugoslav authorities the gravity of the situation and their
obligation to respect all their commitments to NATO and to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The alliance condemned all acts of violence, the statement
added. "It calls on both sides to cease hostilities immediately
and to begin negotiations toward a lasting political solution
which provides greater autonomy for Kosovo and which preserves the
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The two Belgrade-bound NATO officers are NATO Military
Committee Chairman Klaus Naumann and NATO Supreme Commander in
Europe Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
NATO suspended its threat of air strikes against Yugoslavia
late last October but kept the order for strikes in place so that
it could quickly revert to the use of force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Right now a France-led extraction force is being stationed in
nearby Macedonia as a rescue team for the hundreds of
international truce verifiers in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> German Draft Budget Foresees New Borrowing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The new German government's draft
budget for 1999 envisages new government borrowing of 33.3 billion
dollars, according to a government sources on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Expenditures are due to increase to 288.76 billion dollars from
270.36 billion dollars the year before as Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine refrains from making deep cuts in the social services
sector, reports of the German Press Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, expect the Social Democratic-led government
to lower spending in this sector in the year 2000 when the
financial situation is likely to get tighter.
</P>
<P>
Among the "transitory items" were 4.85 billion dollars in cash
transfers to help plug a gaping hole in the postal pension fund
that was far bigger than previously expected as well as transfers
to the state pension fund to finance pension payouts.
</P>
<P>
Revised by this sum, the budget would grow only 1.7 percent to
274.97 billion dollars in 1999, rather than 6.8 per cent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The largest single budget is the 102.54 billion dollars labor
budget, up about 5.92 billion dollars from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The transport and building budget comes second with 28.52
billion dollars followed by the defense budget of 27.98 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is due to approve the draft budget on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> 18 Killed in Fighting Between Ethiopian Govt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen people were killed
Saturday in a fighting between Ethiopian government troops and the
rebel Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) militiamen at the Kenyan
frontier town of Moyale in North Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Moyale District Commissioner Stephen Kipkabut Sunday confirmed
the incident, saying that the fighting claimed the lives of 14
Ethiopian soldiers and four OLF militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Kipkabut said that the Ethiopian government forces had
wrongfully crossed the border on the pretext of looking for OLF
militiamen who had attacked their bases.
</P>
<P>
He said that four Kenyans were injured on the Kenyan-Ethiopian
border when the Ethiopian soldiers in pursuit of OLF militiamen,
attacked a village at the Dambalafachala Location of Moyale
District.
</P>
<P>
The injured Kenyans had been identified as two home guards and
two civilians at a Moyale Village which was attacked by the
Ethiopian troops in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Kipkabut said the Ethiopian government forces were engaged in
a shoot- out by a group of armed home guards, injuring two of the
home guards.
</P>
<P>
Following the fighting, many Kenyans were fleeing from the
border areas in fear of fresh escalation of battles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The district commissioner said he had visited the Ethiopian
side Saturday morning after addressing public meetings at
Dambalafachala and its environs to reassure the residents of their
safety with a view to protesting to the Ethiopian authority.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Kenyan troops were now patrolling the
border, ready to repulse any other incursions into the Kenyan
side.
