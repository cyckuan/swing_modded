Mexican bishop says Vatican is trying to pressuring him to resign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ A bishop known for his advocacy for the
poor claims the pope's envoy to Mexico is pressuring him to resign.
	   Arturo Lona Reyes, bishop of the diocese of Tehuantepec in the
southern state of Oaxaca, said Wednesday that papal nuncio Justo
Mullor sought his resignation for calling a synod of priests from
his diocese without consulting first with his bishop coadjutor.
	   No one was available at the nuncio's office to comment Wednesday
evening.
	   The archbishop of the Oaxaca diocese, Hector Gonzalez Martinez,
said Mullor began ``an episcopal and fraternal dialogue'' and an
``administrative process'' with Lona Reyes, but did not say if he
had asked for his resignation.
	   He said there is no judicial process under way to remove him
from his position.
	   Lona Reyes has been an advocate of the rights of Indians and the
poor and frequently has criticized the government. He is a close
friend of Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in
Chiapas state, who has been accused by government officials of
supporting Zapatista rebels.
	   Four priests and several parishioners began a hunger strike
Sunday asking church officials that Lona Reyes be allowed to finish
his pastoral service ``with honor.'' Lona Reyes is 73 and would
retire in two years.

Another obesity gene identified
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Scientists have found another defective gene
that can make people fat. A 300-pound (136-kilogram) man passed it
to his son, who at age 4 already weighs 70 pounds (32 kilograms).
	   It's at least the fifth gene that's been linked to human obesity
when defective.
	   The boy, who stands 3-feet-6 (107 centimeters) was born at
normal weight but has been abnormally heavy since age 4 months.
British scientists found that he and his father share a mutation in
a gene called MC4R, which stands for melancortin-4 receptor.
	   Normally, this gene is active in a part of the brain that's
involved in regulating appetite. It creates a molecular hitching
post that a brain substance grabs to exert its effects. This
substance dampens appetite, at least in rodents.
	   The mutated version of the gene probably fails to produce a
usable hitching post, scientists said in the October issue of the
journal Nature Genetics. The researchers are at Addenbrooke's
Hospital in Cambridge, England, and the Institute of Child Health
and Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.

 &UR; Search for corn genes gets dlrs 12 million grant
	   TUCSON, Arizona (AP) _ A multiuniversity team has received a
dlrs 12 million National Science Foundation grant to help it
identify all 50,000 corn genes.
	   The United States grows 80 million acres of corn a year for a
dlrs 30 billion crop. Only about 1 percent of the corn plant's
50,000 genes are known, according to plant sciences professor Vicki
L. Chandler.
	   Stanford University researchers will head the five-year project.
Also involved are plant scientists from the University of
California, Berkeley; the University of California, San Diego; the
University of Illinois, and Iowa State University.

 &UR; Cornerstone unveiled for latest project at New York Botanical
Garden
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The modernization of the New York Botanical
Garden took another step forward when a cornerstone was unveiled
for a dlrs 39 million plant studies center at the 107-year-old
institution.
	   ``Botany is an historical science,'' said the president of the
Botanical Garden, Gregory Long. ``Even the most technologically
advanced new research, such as DNA sequencing, sends scientists
back to specimens, books and field notes that may be hundreds of
years old.''
	   As if to underscore the point, a ceremony Sept. 28 included the
placing of a time capsule in the stone, containing letters,
published articles, a library card and glass jars with DNA
test-ready samples of rose petals and sugar maple leaves, from New
York's official state flower and tree.
	   The five-story building housing the plant studies center is
already in place as an extension of the garden's 1900-vintage
beaux-arts museum, but the internal facilities are still to be
completed. The museum itself is undergoing a dlrs 6.5 million
renovation as part of a seven-year dlrs 200 million master plan.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 10th graf that Kim speech Wednesday did not
mention Korean people's historical suffering, sted did not mention
the past &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to put the past behind them, the leaders
of Japan and South Korea signed an agreement Thursday to boost
economic cooperation and inaugurate a ``new partnership'' between
the two countries.
	   President Kim Dae-jung, on his first visit to Tokyo as South
Korean leader, met with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on how
the two countries should handle the Asian economic crisis.
	   In the agreement, Obuchi gave an explicit apology for Tokyo's
harsh 1910-1945 colonization of the Korean Peninsula _ a period
still deeply resented in South Korea.
	   ``I feel acute remorse and offer an apology from my heart,''
Obuchi said as Kim watched at a news conference following their
meeting.
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the sincerity of the Japanese
statement, adding that the ``form and feeling'' of the apology was
different from in the past.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said.
	   The Obuchi statement followed a speech Wednesday night in which
Emperor Akihito reiterated a previous apology, acknowledging that
``Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean
Peninsula.''
	   The pact signed Thursday included agreements on economic
cooperation, more student exchanges between the two countries and a
South Korean pledge to lift bans on Japanese culture, such as
movies. The two sides also agreed to work together in their
approach to North Korea.
	   Kim arrived on Wednesday for a four-day visit. He met with
Akihito after arriving and spoke at a gala banquet at the Imperial
Palace. Later Thursday, he was to address Parliament.
	   Despite the Japanese apology, the two sides clearly stressed the
economic and cooperative aspects of the summit. In a speech
Wednesday night, Kim made no mention of the Korean people's
historical suffering. Instead, he pointed out that the two nations
will be working together as co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup soccer
tournament.
	   Economy played a central role in the meeting. Obuchi offered Kim
a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   ``I express my gratitude for Japan's support despite its own
economic difficulties,'' said Kim, who added that Japan could help
further by opening more of its markets to Korean products.
	   Also on the agenda was last month's rocket launch by North
Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the North
has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   In Thursday's talks, the two sides acknowledged that a program
to build nuclear reactors in the isolated country was the best way
to insure North Korea does not develop its own nuclear weapons.
	   Japan withdrew funding from the program after the recent rocket
launch. The leaders on Thursday made no mention about if or when
Japan would restore the funding.

Byron Scott, Steve Fisher named Sacramento assistants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SACRAMENTO, California (AP) _ Sacramento Kings coach Rick
Adelman hired NBA veteran Byron Scott and former Michigan coach
Steve Fisher as assistant coaches.
	   On Wednesday, John Wetzel was appointed lead assistant and Pete
Carrill, the longtime Princeton coach, was retained for the final
year of his contract. Terms of the individual deals were not
released.
	   The coaching assignment is the first for Scott, who played 14
seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers and Indiana Pacers. He played
in Greece last season.
	   ``I'm very excited for this opportunity,'' Scott said in a
prepared statement. ``This is something I've wanted to do for the
past three years.''
	   Fisher, who coached Michigan for nine seasons and led the team
to the 1989 NCAA college championship, was fired Oct. 10, 1997,
after a school investigation found rules violations involving a
booster.
	   Wetzel has 25 years of NBA experience as a coach and player. He
was an assistant for seven years under Adelman, including a
six-year stint in Portland.
	   Adelman was hired in September to replace Eddie Jordan, who was
fired. The Kings have not had a winning season since moving to
Sacramento in 1985.

Philippines' Cardinal Sin to stay in hospital to rest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Manila's influential Roman Catholic
archbishop, Jaime Cardinal Sin, has recovered from an internal
infection but will have to stay in the hospital for several days to
rest, church officials said Thursday.
	   ``His fever has receded and the stomach pains are gone,'' Sin's
aide, Monsignor Socrates Villegas, said in a radio interview. ``He
is recovering.''
	   Villegas said Sin's condition improved after doctors removed a
tube inserted into Sin's peritoneum, the membrane lining the
abdominal cavity that also surrounds internal organs such as the
liver and the kidneys.
	   The procedure was needed for kidney dialysis because Sin was
having renal problems.
	   Church officials said the tube had apparently introduced
bacteria into Sin's system.
	   But Villegas said doctors advised the 70-year-old Sin to stay in
the hospital to rest.
	   ``If he goes home, doctors cannot stop the cardinal from working
hard again,'' said Villegas. ``A few days' stay in hospital to rest
will be good for him.''
	   Sin helped prompt the ouster of strongman Ferdinand Marcos in
1986 when he called for citizens to support a military revolt
against the president. Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in
the streets, forcing Marcos from power.
	   He continues to be heavily involved in political and social
issues.
	   The Philippines is Asia's only predominately Catholic country.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with company denying subs are shoddy. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   The report prompted the builder, Australian Submarine Corp., to
say problems were being fixed and all six would be handed over to
the Navy within budget.
	   ``We're developing a new class of submarine and we've had some
teething problems with different equipment,'' Australian Submarine
Corp. spokesman Ross Milton said.
	   ``But we're fixing them; that's what you would expect.''
	   The newspaper quoted the secret report as saying the main cause
of the noise is the disturbed flow pattern of water along the hull
and into the propellers, which are also vibrating and cracking
because of faulty construction.
	   It also said the engines suffer gearbox failures and overheating
generators, the combat systems are virtually useless due to faulty
software, and the boats have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   It said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would not accept
any more of the submarines -- which cost 800 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each -- until all the faults were
fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   Milton from Australian Submarine Corp. admitted there were
problems.
	   ``It works, it's not meeting the full functionality of the
specification and it's being improved in that way in stages.
There's been no change,'' he said.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that construction
problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

Dozens dead in Papua New Guinea highlands landslide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A landslide hit a remote
part of Papua New Guinea's mountainous highlands, killing at least
32 people and reportedly burying a church congregation.
	   Unconfirmed reports put the death toll as high as 140.
	   The National newspaper said the congregation was buried alive
last Friday near the isolated Maramuni Station in the northern part
of Enga province.
	   Eight bodies had been recovered and a 9-year-old girl was the
sole survivor of the disaster, the newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman for the province administrator's office told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio she had received reports that
32 had died following heavy rains in the area.
	   But Teata Poko, a spokesman for the National Broadcasting
Commission in the Enga provincial capital of Wabag, said reports
filtering down from the isolated region were that many more had
died.
	   ``The landslide is believed to have killed up to 140 people,''
Poko said.
	   The National Disaster and Emergency Services said it was still
awaiting confirmation of the disaster from state emergency
authorities, who Thursday were flying by helicopter to the area.
	   Reports were that the landslide occurred at a bush location 3-6
miles (5-10 kilometers) east of Maramuni Station during heavy rain
early Friday morning, Poko said.
	   But confirmation of details was difficult because Maramuni
Station is in a very remote area with no road or telephone links,
he said. A landslide in the same area in 1960 killed 60 people,
Poko said.
	   The National reported that the victims were sleeping after a
prayer meeting, and included eight people from one family.

Commissioner's office to discipline Yankees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Angry at repeated violations of baseball's rules
by the New York Yankees, the commissioner's office intends to start
disciplining the team Thursday, The Associated Press has learned.
	   Officials of the commissioner's office and the American League
were livid at the team and owner George Steinbrenner, who threw
baseball's public relations staff out of the team's offices
Wednesday, saying he needed the space for an accountant.
	   In addition, on Tuesday and Wednesday the Yankees violated the
rules issued by the commissioner's office dealing with the space
allotted reporters on the field before games.
	   After New York's 4-1, 12-inning loss to Cleveland on Wednesday
in Game 2 of the AL championship series, the Yankees announced they
were canceling their workout, which had been scheduled for Jacobs
Field on Thursday.
	   Under the rules developed last winter by Paul Beeston,
baseball's chief operating officer, postseason teams are required
to hold mandatory workouts prior to Games 1 and 3.
	   AL vice president Phyllis Merhige was clearly exasperated with
the Yankees, and other members of baseball's brass said the team
was routinely ignoring directives from both the league and the
commissioner's office.
	   The Baseball Writers Association of America sent Beeston a
letter Wednesday protesting the team's conduct.
	   Beeston's rules were prompted by the Florida Marlins' refusal to
come to the interview room after the seventh game of the World
Series last year. During meetings with groups of reporters last
winter, he promised teams would be fined if they violated the
rules.

 &UR; Dozens dead in Papua New Guinea highlands landslide

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ A landslide hit a remote
part of Papua New Guinea's mountainous highlands, killing at least
32 people and reportedly burying a church congregation.
	   Unconfirmed reports put the death toll as high as 140.
	   The National newspaper said the congregation was buried alive
last Friday near the isolated Maramuni Station in the northern part
of Enga province.
	   Eight bodies had been recovered and a 9-year-old girl was the
sole survivor of the disaster, the newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman for the province administrator's office told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio she had received reports that
32 had died following heavy rains in the area.
	   But Teata Poko, a spokesman for the National Broadcasting
Commission in the Enga provincial capital of Wabag, said reports
filtering down from the isolated region were that many more had
died.
	   ``The landslide is believed to have killed up to 140 people,''
Poko said.
	   The National Disaster and Emergency Services said it was still
awaiting confirmation of the disaster from state emergency
authorities, who Thursday were flying by helicopter to the area.
	   Reports were that the landslide occurred at a bush location 3-6
miles (5-10 kilometers) east of Maramuni Station during heavy rain
early Friday morning, Poko said.
	   But confirmation of details was difficult because Maramuni
Station is in a very remote area with no road or telephone links,
he said. A landslide in the same area in 1960 killed 60 people,
Poko said.
	   The National reported that the victims were sleeping after a
prayer meeting, and included eight people from one family.

Train derails in southern India, two killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ A high speed train jumped its tracks on
a busy southern Indian railroad route Thursday, killing two people
and injuring 11 others, officials said.
	   Ten cars of the train hurtled off the track in the Guntur region
as the train traveled before dawn from Secunderabad to Narsapur in
Andhra Pradesh state, railroad department officials said.
	   The accident paralyzed railroad service in the area, 1,375
kilometers (853 miles) south of New Delhi.
	   Another train with doctors, officials and rescue volunteers was
rushed to the site of the accident, the officials said.

China reaffirms resolve to get military out of business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The government intends to enforce its decision to
have China's military and police give up their sprawling business
interests, state-run media on Thursday cited Vice President Hu
Jintao as saying.
	   Hu's remarks were made at a meeting of top-level officials who
gathered in Beijing earlier this week to discuss the issue, the
reports said.
	   The conference concluded that getting the army, armed police and
police to stop their involvement in business activities was crucial
to prevent corruption that has undermined public trust in the
government, said the reports carried in several official
newspapers.
	   In July, Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered China's military
to get out of business. But so far, little seems to have been done.
	   The government will provide adequate funding to enable the
military to give up its businesses, Hu was quoted as saying.
	   PLA businesses fund an estimated one-third of the military's
operating expenses and are a pervasive force in China's commercial
life, from cellular phone networks to karaoke halls.
	   Gauging from the comments cited in the report, central
authorities are still gathering support and gearing up to begin the
difficult task of closing down the military's huge commercial
empire.
	   PLA morale is already sagging as bankrupt military businesses
lay off employees, including many officers' wives. The intricate
military-industrial complex also includes many firms that were once
PLA factories but are now ostensibly supervised by the State
Council, China's Cabinet.

Jordan leaving options open for return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Michael Jordan says he is not ruling out
returning to the Chicago Bulls, the Chicago Tribune reported.
	   ``What's most important right now is for me to see where the
league is going, then look deep inside myself to make a clear-cut
decision. So for now I'm keeping my options open,'' Jordan said in
an interview published in the Tribune's Thursday editions and on
the newspaper's Internet site.
	   Jordan said his final decision must await the conclusion of the
NBA lockout that has canceled the preseason schedule and threatens
at least part of the regular season.
	   Jordan, 35, said he is ``completely healthy, and the love I have
for basketball, for the challenge of it, is still there for me.''
	   His comments are in contrast to what the Bulls star said in July
when Jordan told a news conference he was retired, but wouldn't
make it official until the lockout ended.
	   Jordan also said he isn't opposed to playing for Tim Floyd or
for an organization still run by general manager Jerry Krause.
	   ``I played with Jerry there the last five or six seasons, and
we've been successful,'' Jordan said. ``I don't like it. But that's
not going to be my final deciding factor.''
	   Jordan had indicated last season he wouldn't play for any coach
but Phil Jackson, who led the Bulls to six NBA titles in the last
eight years. Jackson left this summer and the Bulls hired Floyd as
coach-in-waiting.
	   Jordan said he thinks Jackson might return to coach him. But he
acknowledged that the odds of Jackson coaching the Bulls this
season are ``probably a million to one.''
	   Jordan had nothing critical to say about Floyd, the former Iowa
State coach he and Jackson referred to last season as ``Pink''
Floyd.
	   ``I don't fault him. I fault Jerry Krause for driving Jackson
away,'' Jordan said.
	   Floyd said Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf recently told him he
still plans to do his best to sign Jordan again.
	   Jordan acknowledged it would be a challenge to win a title with
a new coach.
	   ``For me, if there's no challenge, I don't want to play,'' he
said. ``But the Catch-22 for me is that I don't want people saying
I came back when I shouldn't have or I stayed too long.''

Major points discussed during Korean president's visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Japan-SKorea
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The following are some of the main points discussed in talks
Thursday between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi:
	   ECONOMIC COOPERATION: Obuchi offered dlrs 3 billion in loans to
help small South Korean companies ride out their country's economic
downturn. Part of the money will also go to building new power
plants in South Korea. While praising the aid, Kim called on Japan
to further open its markets to agricultural products and other
foreign exports.
	   MORE CONTACT: The two agreed that the leaders of both countries
should meet at least once every year. Kim invited Emperor Akihito
to visit South Korea to attend ceremonies of the 2002 World Cup,
which the countries will co-host. It would be the first imperial
visit to South Korea ever. Other initiatives included more
exchanges between South Korean and Japanese officials and citizens
and a new ``working holiday'' program allowing students to hold
temporary jobs in each others' countries.
	   NORTH KOREA: Kim and Obuchi called last month's launch of a
multi-stage rocket by communist North Korea a threat to the region.
They reiterated support for a program to build civilian nuclear
reactors in the isolated country as the best way to block North
Korea from developing its own nuclear weapons. The two also said
they should work within existing defense agreements with the United
States to insure regional stability.
	   OTHER ISSUES: Kim said South Korea will end restrictions on
Japanese culture, such as movies, and pledged support for Japan
taking a higher profile in international affairs, especially within
the United Nations. Tokyo has long sought a permanent seat on the
Security Council.

Dollar plunges against yen, Tokyo stocks tumble on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei shedding 3.74 percent in early afternoon
trading, latest dollar level and bond price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
Thursday afternoon after plunging overnight amid hopes that Japan's
economic and banking problems may be resolved. Tokyo stock prices
tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 121.54 yen in early afternoon trading, down
6.64 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York
level of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
was down 517.41 points, or 3.74 percent, at 13,308.20 points. On
Wednesday, the average surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its
second-largest points gain this year.
	   Tokyo players bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or
oversold, dollar positions, bringing the dollar a bit higher than
its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on
Wednesday's dollar plunge. ``I don't talk about specific levels,''
Miyazawa said. ``The market is the market.''
	   In New York on Wednesday, the dollar fell a stunning 8 percent
against the yen overnight for the largest one-day drop in
percentage terms in a quarter century. The last time the dollar
posted such a sharp single day drop was in 1974, according to Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The yen rally came amid growing optimism that Japan's government
will soon enact a bill designed to strengthen the country's ailing
banks.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been wrangling with
opposition forces for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday
	   The government was scheduled to begin deliberations on the law
Thursday and media reports said the bill would pass Parliament by
the end of the current session on Oct. 16.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, export-oriented issues, including
auto and high-technology issues, were losers after the yen's dive
to near 120 yen against the dollar.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt major Japanese
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more
expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 28.75 points, or 2.75 percent, to 1,018.23. On
Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back
an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points before
reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at 7,741.69 on
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.780 percent from Wednesday's close of
0.770 percent, driving its price down to 109.18 yen from 109.28
yen.

Report: Chinese dissidents released, but harassment continues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two Chinese democracy campaigners detained by
police for trying to form an opposition political party have been
released, although they were facing continued police harassment, a
human rights group said Thursday.
	   Xie Wanjun, who was detained on Sept. 21, was released from
police custody on Wednesday but has been ordered to move out of his
home, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Fellow dissident Liu Lianjun was allowed to return home on
Tuesday, but about 20 police were keeping 24-hour watch outside his
home, the Hong Kong-based group said.
	   Police also refused to return a computer they had confiscated
from Liu's home, and were thus preventing him from earning his
livelihood as a computer repairs teacher, it said.
	   Wan accused police of having his former employers evict him in
order to force him to leave the country.
	   Xie and Liu were detained after they attempted to file an
application with the authorities to set up an opposition group, the
China Democracy Party.
	   News from Liu and Xie that their application was not rejected
outright encouraged dissidents that the Communist Party might be
ready to end a virtual 49-year ban on opposition politics.
	   But the police accused the dissidents of disturbing ``social
order'' and of distorting remarks made by the civil affairs
officials who dealt with their application.
	   Liu's and Xie's initial optimism lead dissidents in at least
eight provinces and cities to apply or prepare applications to set
up China Democracy Party branches.
	   But the authorities signaled their determination to keep the
Communist's monopoly on power by detaining at least a dozen
democracy campaigners, many of whom had connections to the China
Democracy Party.
	   While the government has maintained its tight repression of
public dissent, its tactics have changed somewhat. Most of the
dissidents rounded up in the latest police sweeps have since been
released, albeit with warnings to stop their activities.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with company reaction in 5th-7th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   The report prompted the builder, Australian Submarine Corp., to
say problems were being fixed and all six would be handed over to
the Navy within budget.
	   ``We're developing a new class of submarine and we've had some
teething problems with different equipment,'' Australian Submarine
Corp. spokesman Ross Milton said.
	   ``But we're fixing them; that's what you would expect.''
	   The newspaper quoted the secret report as saying the main cause
of the noise is the disturbed flow pattern of water along the hull
and into the propellers, which are also vibrating and cracking
because of faulty construction.
	   It also said the engines suffer gearbox failures and overheating
generators, the combat systems are virtually useless due to faulty
software, and the boats have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   It said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would not accept
any more of the submarines _ which cost 800 million Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each _ until all the faults were
fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that construction
problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

McNamee builds on twin towers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian Open promoter Paul
McNamee looked at the New York skyline last month and saw an
alternative set of twin towers _ Patrick Rafter and Mark
Philippoussis.
	   ``I guess being in New York and looking at the World Trade
Center I had an idea that the two Aussie boys, Rafter and
Philippoussis are the twin towers of Aussie tennis,'' McNamee said
at Thursday's launch of the 1999 Australian Open.
	   McNamee believes the U.S. Open finalists will give his event a
strong foundation to follow from last year's record-breaking
turnout sparked by Rafter's first of his two titles at Flushing
Meadows.
	   While Australian fans consider Rafter to be a classically built
and fine upstanding young player, there are also many who consider
Philippoussis' career is on shaky psychological ground.
	   Philippoussis is in dispute with Australia's tennis hierarchy
after a public spat with Davis Cup captain John Newcombe.
Philippoussis was also upset when Davis Cup coach Tony Roche was in
Rafter's corner for last month's U.S. Open final, won in four by
Rafter.
	   Tennis Australia president Geoff Pollard and McNamee both
indicated they would like the brawling to end before the Jan. 18-31
Australian Open _ the first Grand Slam of 1999.
	   But there is little doubt having a good guy-bad guy situation
with Rafter and Philippoussis will help boost the event.
	   Melbourne is Philippoussis' home town but Rafter's
well-publicized charity donations have won him more respect than
Philippoussis' better-publicized love of fast and expensive cars.
	   ``Melbourne should be proud of Mark and give him a chance,''
said McNamee. ``I hope he gets a fantastic response. Some people
put that bad boy spin on him but I hope not by a Melbourne crowd.''
	   Pollard said Rafter and Philippoussis would lead a twin
publicity drive for next year's open, which will feature the
world's top 20 men and 18 of the top 20 women, barring injuries.
	   The organizers have boosted prizemoney by 17.5 percent to offset
the Asian currency crisis, but in real terms for players the prize
pool has hardly improved.
	   The Australian dlrs 10 million from last year equated to U.S.
dlrs 6.7 million. With the fall in Australia's dollar against the
greenback, the Australian dlr 11.75 million is worth U.S. dlr 6.8
million.
	   McNamee said demand for corporate boxes remained high and
appeared unaffected by the weak economic climate.
	   ``Tennis is hot right now and the product is fantastic,'' said
McNamee.
	   The organizers have maintained their controversial disparity
between prizemoney pools for men and women. The women will receive
94 percent of the men's prizemoney.
	   Parity ``was tempting,'' said McNamee. ``But really we wanted to
invest our money in offsetting the devaluation of the Australian
dollar and that was our priority this year.
	   ``It's something we're going to continue to look at in the
future and we need to respect that there is a lot of strength and
growth in the women's game.''

Official denies 140 dead in landslide, says seven killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with official saying only seven died &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ An official in remote
mountainous highlands Thursday denied reports that dozens of people
died in a landslide, saying only seven people were killed in two
demolished huts.
	   The deputy provincial administrator of Enga Province, Wakaf
Macksaen, said media reports that up to 140 people in a church
congregation may have perished in the landslide last Friday were
``all wrong.''
	   Macksaen said the landslide happened about 4 a.m. Tuesday in an
isolated area southeast of Maramuni Station in the north of the
province, following heavy rain.
	   His account contradicted a report in The National newspaper,
which said a church congregation was buried alive last Friday, and
also went against comments made by another regional official.
	   Teata Poko, a spokesman for the National Broadcasting Commission
in the Enga provincial capital of Wabag, said reports filtering
down from the isolated region were that many more had died.
	   ``The landslide is believed to have killed up to 140 people,''
Poko said.
	   Confirmation of details was difficult because Maramuni Station
is in a very remote area with no road or telephone links.
	   The newspaper said that eight bodies had been recovered and a
9-year-old girl was the sole survivor of the disaster.
	   Macksaen, who visited the site of the landslide at Pafalangus
village Thursday, confirmed that a girl, either eight or nine years
old, survived the landslide uninjured.
	   He said the landslide carried away two houses made of flimsy
bush materials nestled in a valley surrounded by steep mountains.
	   ``There were a total of eight people in the houses. One escaped,
the others were carried away,'' Macksaen said. He said it killed
five men and two women.
	   Three or four of the bodies had already been recovered, he said.
	   Macksaen said the area around Maramuni was very unstable and
landslides occurred regularly.
	   Another official, a spokeswoman for the province administrator's
office, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio she had received
reports that 32 had died following heavy rains in the area.
	   ``We've got reports saying that 32 people have been buried alive
(by) a big landslide in a mountain area,'' she said, on condition
of anonymity.
	   Poko said that a landslide in the same area in 1960 killed 60
people.

Dollar plunges against yen, Tokyo stocks dive on profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei losing 5.92 in mid-afternoon trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
Thursday afternoon after plunging overnight amid hopes that Japan's
economic and banking problems may be resolved. Tokyo stock prices
tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 121.54 yen in early afternoon trading, down
6.64 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York
level of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
stood at 13,006.57 in late afternoon trading, down 5.92 percent, or
819.04 points, erasing all the gains it posted the previous day. On
Wednesday, the average surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its
second-largest points gain this year.
	   Tokyo players bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or
oversold, dollar positions, bringing the dollar a bit higher than
its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on
Wednesday's dollar plunge. ``I don't talk about specific levels,''
Miyazawa said. ``The market is the market.''
	   In New York on Wednesday, the dollar fell a stunning 8 percent
against the yen overnight for the largest one-day drop in
percentage terms in a quarter century. The last time the dollar
posted such a sharp single day drop was in 1974, according to Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The yen rally came amid growing optimism that Japan's government
will soon enact a bill designed to strengthen the country's ailing
banks.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been wrangling with
opposition forces for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday.
	   The government was scheduled to begin deliberations on the law
Thursday and media reports said the bill would pass Parliament by
the end of the current session on Oct. 16.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, export-oriented issues, including
auto and high-technology issues, were losers after the yen's dive
to near 120 yen against the dollar.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt major Japanese
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more
expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 46.15 points, or 4.41 percent, to 1,000.83. On
Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back
an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points before
reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at 7,741.69 on
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.780 percent from Wednesday's close of
0.770 percent, driving its price down to 109.18 yen from 109.28
yen.

Rangers sign first-round draft pick

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Rangers have agreed to contract
terms with Manny Malhotra, a center who was their first-round pick
in the 1998 NHL entry draft.
	   The Rangers announced the signing in a news release Wednesday
night just a couple of hours before a midnight deadline that would
have forced the Rangers to return the 18-year-old Malhotra to the
junior ranks for the entire 1998-99 season.
	   No contract terms were announced, but it was believed that
Malhotra signed for the dlrs 975,000 a year under the rookie salary
cap.
	   In seven preseason games with the Rangers, Malhotra had two
assists. In two seasons with the Guelph Storm of the Ontario Hockey
League, Malhotra recorded 32 goals and 63 assists along with 55
penalty minutes in 118 games. The 6-foot-2 (1.88-meter), 210-pound
(94.5-kilogram) center also had 14 goals and 13 assists in 30
career playoff outings with the Storm.

Sukarno's daughter supported by huge rally in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri addressed tens of thousands of supporters in Bali on
Thursday in what many regard as her first step toward running for
president of the world's fourth-most populous nation.
	   Despite Bali's fierce tropical heat, the crowd turned the open
field where the rally was held into a surging wave of support for
Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno.
	   Dressed in red, the color of her Indonesian Democratic Party,
and carrying countless red signs, pictures and banners in her
support, the crowd shouted ``Mega must win!'' every time her name
was mentioned from the stage.
	   ``If the people elect us as a government, we will have the guts
to speak out for the interests of the ordinary people,'' Megawati
said during her hour-long speech.
	   Most of it focused on Indonesia's crippling economic crisis,
which has left the nation with more than 80 percent inflation, food
shortages, widespread unemployment and soaring poverty.
	   Pitching her speech at the downtrodden of Indonesia, Megawati
said that life for ordinary people is getting harder and harder as
the economic crisis drags on.
	   She didn't criticize the country's current president, B.J.
Habibie, or his predecessor, Suharto, by name.
	   But Megawati did say that corruption had sprung up like
mushrooms during Suharto's many years in power. ``This fungus has
destroyed Indonesia over the past three decades,'' she said. ``Now
we must destroy the fungus.''
	   The crowd on the outskirts of Sanur, estimated at 50,000 to
100,000, exploded in cheers.
	   Megawati also said that Indonesians must have more say in
electing their government and holding it accountable.
	   ``I warn the power holders that Indonesia has lost its
credibility in the eyes of the world because sovereignty doesn't
really belong to the people,'' she said.
	   Given all the rioting and looting that has wracked other parts
of Indonesia this year, government officials and the military had
tried to ban the gathering on the tranquil resort island.
	   But only a few dozen police appeared near the field Thursday,
and there were no signs of violence in the crowd. Most people had
walked hours down streets closed to traffic to reach the field.
	   The government deployed several thousand police, soldiers and
civilian security guards to Bali _ a Hindu enclave in
Muslim-dominated Indonesia, and a major source of foreign exchange
for a country suffering its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   But many of the soldiers were kept out of sight Thursday, in
buildings around the field where the rally was held.
	   In May, about 1,200 people died in riots on the neighboring main
island of Java, forcing President Suharto to quit 32 years after he
took power from Sukarno, Megawati's father.
	   In recent weeks, Habibie, Suharto's successor and longtime ally,
has been targeted by protests, and he has promised to hold
democratic elections next year. But he also appears to be intent on
fending off Megawati and other challengers for the presidency.
	   Many people believe that Indonesia's brutal economic problems
are increasing Megawati's popularity, and that was certainly
evident on Thursday, the first day of the three-day congress of her
faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   Megawati bitterly resents Habibie's government for not
officially recognizing her as the rightful leader of the party,
which has been wracked by squabbling and violence for years.
	   She maintains that she was deposed illegally as head of the
party in 1996, when dozens of her supporters were killed in a clash
with police and troops in Jakarta.
	   She accuses Suharto of engineering her ouster by a rival faction
and has criticized Habibie for refusing to recognize her as the
true party chief.
	   Habibie's government maintains the party is rightfully
controlled by Megawati's rivals.
	   But you wouldn't have known that at Thursday's rally.
	   The huge crowd included Sukarno's widow, Dewi Sukarno. On
Wednesday, she held a news conference in Jakarta to publicly accuse
Suharto of plotting a coup attempt against Sukarno in the 1960s and
secretly killing him later.
	   Surrounded by tens of thousands of Megawati's supporters at the
rally in Bali, Dewi Sukarno said that her stepdaughter ``is bound
to become president.''

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: PMs; RECASTS with quotes, details; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to move beyond the past, Japan offered its
fullest apology yet for its 35-year colonization of South Korea in
a pact Thursday heralding a ``new partnership'' between the two
countries.
	   The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, outlined fresh areas of
cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability in North
Korea.
	   ``It is my conviction that this joint declaration will be a new
start,'' Obuchi told reporters after a morning meeting and signing
ceremony with Kim.
	   Before looking to the future, Japan and South Korea addressed
some of the unpleasant past: Japan's harsh 1910-1945 rule over the
Korean Peninsula _ a period still deeply resented in South Korea.
	   The apology offered Thursday differed little in wording from
past Japanese statements of remorse, which have been considered in
South Korea as lacking in sincerity.
	   The difference this time, however, was that phrasing of the
apology was negotiated between the two sides, written in a document
and signed, putting down Japan's recognition of past misdeeds in
black and white.
	   ``I feel acute remorse and offer an apology from my heart,''
Obuchi said. He added later: ``I have made our country's position
clear.''
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the sincerity of the Japanese
statement, adding that the ``form and feeling'' of the apology was
different from in the past.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said.
	   The Obuchi statement followed a speech Wednesday night in which
Emperor Akihito reiterated a previous apology, acknowledging that
``Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean
Peninsula.''
	   The signing came a day after Kim arrived in Tokyo for a four-day
visit, his first since becoming president. He met the emperor on
Wednesday and spoke at a gala banquet at the Imperial Palace. Later
Thursday, he was to address Parliament.
	   Despite the Japanese apology, the two sides clearly stressed the
economic and cooperative aspects of the summit. The two sides need
to work together on Asia's economic problems, and they will also
co-host the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   As a sign of closer ties, Tokyo and Seoul are considering a
visit to South Korea by Akihito. Such a trip is a touchy subject,
since it was in the name of the late Emperor Hirohito _ Akihito's
father _ that Japan conquered much of Asia before and during World
War II.
	   Both Kim and Obuchi said they were working on such a visit, with
Kim saying arranging an imperial trip to South Korea before the
2002 World Cup was ``a target.''
	   ``We're neighbors and it's been 33 years since we've established
diplomatic relations,'' Kim said. ``So I think the fact that the
emperor hasn't visited yet is extremely unnatural.''
	   The pact signed Thursday included agreements on economic
cooperation, more student exchanges between the two countries and a
South Korean pledge to lift bans on Japanese culture, such as
movies.
	   Economy played a central role in the meeting. Obuchi offered Kim
a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   ``I express my gratitude for Japan's support despite its own
economic difficulties,'' said Kim, who added that Japan could help
further by opening more of its markets to Korean products.
	   Also on the agenda was last month's rocket launch by North
Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the North
has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   In Thursday's talks, the two sides acknowledged that a program
to build nuclear reactors in the isolated country was the best way
to insure North Korea does not develop its own nuclear weapons.
	   Japan withdrew funding from the program after the recent rocket
launch. The leaders on Thursday made no mention about if or when
Japan would restore the funding.

Padres 3, Braves 2, 10 innings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Ken Caminiti hit a solo home run in the 10th
inning and the Padres overcame a rare lapse by baseball's premier
closer Trevor Hoffman to beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 Wednesday
night in a rain-delayed Game 1 of the National League championship
series.
	   On an evening when daring running sent the game into extra
innings, Caminiti trotted around the bases after connecting with
one out in the 10th off Kerry Ligtenberg.
	   It was the fourth postseason homer of Caminiti's career, and
helped him atone for failing to come up with a key throw that let
the Braves tie it.
	   Ruben Rivera's double and dash home on Jim Leyritz's dribbler
gave the Padres a 2-1 lead in the eighth. But in the ninth,
Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 save chances this season, could not
protect the edge and gave up Andruw Jones' tying sacrifice fly.
	   In fact, Hoffman could not even close out the game. With two
outs in the 10th, he walked pitcher Tom Glavine _ pinch-hitting
because the Braves ran out of position players _ and Donne Wall
relieved.
	   Wall, who had only one save this season, walked Chipper Jones
before retiring Andres Galarraga on a long fly to center field.
	   Ryan Klesko walked with one out in the Atlanta ninth and
surprisingly tried to take third on Javy Lopez's single to left.
Rivera's throw beat him, but Caminiti did not catch the throw and
Klesko _ his nose bloodied from colliding with Caminiti's shoulder
_ was safe.
	   Andruw Jones, whose home run gave Atlanta an early 1-0 lead,
swung away on a 3-0 pitch and hit a sacrifice fly.
	   Hoffman pitched two innings and wound up with the win. The game
ended at 1:43 a.m., pushed back by a two hour, one minute rain
delay at the start
	   The win was a good omen for the underdog Padres. The last five
teams to win the opener of the NLCS have gone on to the World
Series.
	   San Diego sustained a loss, however, when 50-homer man Greg
Vaughn limped off in the fifth inning because of a strained left
quadriceps. His status was day-to-day, and Rivera replaced him.
	   Game 2 will be Thursday night, with Braves nemesis Kevin Brown
pitching against Glavine. Last fall, Brown beat Atlanta twice at
Turner Field in the NLCS for Florida.
	   Steady rain, lightning and thunder threatened to cause the first
rainout in the two-year history of Turner Field. After a delay of 2
hours, 1 minute, the field was ready and the game began, though it
started raining lightly in the last two innings.
	   The bad weather might have helped hold the crowd down to 42,117
_ about 9,000 short of a sellout and the smallest in Atlanta
postseason history. But even before the storm came, the game was
not expected to be sold out.
	   Padres starter Andy Ashby and Atlanta ace John Smoltz dueled
evenly into the seventh with the game tied at 1.
	   Rivera, usually Tony Gwynn's late replacement, opened the eighth
with a double off Smoltz. Caminiti followed with a fly to medium
right-center, and Rivera tagged up and tested Andruw Jones' strong
arm.
	   Rivera's head-first slide barely beat the throw, though his
momentum carried him a couple of feet off the bag. But third
baseman Chipper Jones was busy raising his glove to show the umpire
that he'd made the tag, and Rivera scrambled back to safety.
	   That brought up pinch-hitter Leyritz, whose six postseason home
runs included three in the first-round win over Houston.
	   Leyritz tapped a ball to the right of Dennis Martinez, and the
reliever ran to field it. Martinez looked at Rivera, but elected to
throw to first baseman Galarraga.
	   Rivera immediately broke home and again slid in headfirst,
beating Galarraga's wide throw. Galarraga was charged with a double
error, for leaving the bag early and his bad throw.
	   Gwynn picked on a familiar victim for an RBI single that made it
1-all in the fifth. A leadoff single by Carlos Hernandez, a
sacrifice by Ashby and a costly two-out walk to Quilvio Veras
brought up Gwynn, and the eight-time NL batting champion lined the
first pitch to left field.
	   For Gwynn, it was his second hit of the night and he's now
30-for-65 (.455) lifetime against Smoltz.
	   Atlanta averted even bigger trouble, though, when right fielder
Michael Tucker followed by making the defensive play of the game, a
backhanded, leaping catch as he ran into the fence on Vaughn's
drive.
	   Atlanta went ahead in the third when Andruw Jones led off with
his fourth career home run in postseason play.

Tung address receives mixed review in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Many in Hong Kong are dissatisfied with their
chief executive's policy address, saying that while it set an
ambitious blueprint for long-term economic development it offered
no quick fixes to ease their immediate pain, polls and editorials
said Thursday.
	   But speaking on a phone-in program on government-owned Radio
Hong Kong, leader Tung Chee-hwa appealed for patience.
	   ``The government has done everything it can do,'' he said. ``It
won't be long before we see the impact of the (stimulus) measures
we have implemented.''
	   On Wednesday, Tung fell short in his annual address of promising
concrete measures to kick start the sagging economy, which is
expected to shrink by 4 percent this year, and ease growing
unemployment, already at a 15-year high.
	   But he laid out extensive plans to diversify the economy and
pledged more funding to promote high-tech industries.
	   ``We have to look at how to rebuild our economic base and
maximize citizens' wealth when the economy recovers,'' he told the
radio audience.
	   A poll conducted by Hong Kong University said 38.2 percent of
the 469 respondents said they were dissatisfied with the address,
compared with 23.5 percent who were satisfied.
	   A total of 44.4 percent of the respondents said they were
dissatisfied with his economic policy compared with 18.5 percent
who were satisfied.
	   Tung was criticized for ignoring the plight of the growing
legion of the unemployed in his address. He offered little in new
initiatives to create jobs and improve social welfare.
	   ``You care too much about the interests of property developers.
Have you forgotten the pains of average citizens?'' a caller to the
radio program, surnamed Siu, told Tung.
	   About 30 Democrats staged an overnight sit-in in front of the
legislature to protest the blueprint.
	   But the property sector generally welcomed Tung's address. The
property sub-index was up 4.2 percent in early trading, while the
blue-chip Hang Seng Index gained 0.65 percent.
	   ``The government seems to be supporting the market even though
there were no new specific measures like last year,'' said Vincent
Cheung, an equity sales manager at Sassoon Securities.
	   Tung said Wednesday his priority was to stabilize property
prices, but fell short of scrapping a long-term goal of providing
85,000 new housing units a year, a target widely blamed for the
property slum.
	   Meanwhile, most newspapers were unimpressed by the address. The
South China Morning Post said: ``The government is still not ready
to face up to the full consequences of the recession on public
spending.''
	   The Hong Kong Standard was more forgiving: ``Mr. Tung has done
what any good leader will do: take the long-term view and make
preparations for it.''

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates in grafs 9-10 with navy admitting noise problem but
saying it will be fixed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   The report prompted the builder, Australian Submarine Corp., to
say problems were being fixed and all six would be handed over to
the Navy within budget.
	   ``We're developing a new class of submarine and we've had some
teething problems with different equipment,'' Australian Submarine
Corp. spokesman Ross Milton said.
	   ``But we're fixing them; that's what you would expect.''
	   The newspaper quoted the secret report as saying the main cause
of the noise is the disturbed flow pattern of water along the hull
and into the propellers, which are also vibrating and cracking
because of faulty construction.
	   It also said the engines suffer gearbox failures and overheating
generators, the combat systems are virtually useless due to faulty
software, and the boats have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   Rear Adm. Chris Oxenbould, deputy chief of the Australian navy,
told reporters later Thursday: ``The principal problems that we
have got relate to the acoustic signature of the submarines -- the
noise that the submarine makes -- and also with the combat systems.
	   ``We are going to fix the problems that confront us at the
moment,'' he said.
	   The Telegraph said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would
not accept any more of the submarines -- which cost 800 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each -- until all the
faults were fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   Milton from Australian Submarine Corp. admitted there were
problems.
	   ``It works, it's not meeting the full functionality of the
specification and it's being improved in that way in stages.
There's been no change,'' he said.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that construction
problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.

Tokyo cautiously welcomes yen's renewed vigor _ but ponders why
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Traders and investors weren't sure just why it
happened, but the dollar's biggest drop against the yen in 25 years
was welcomed by many Thursday as a badly needed boost for at least
one sector of Japan's sickly economy _ its debt-laden banks.
	   As Japan slept, the U.S. dollar plummeted in its largest
single-day decline since 1974, losing 7.4 percent of its value
against the yen. It recovered slightly to 121.58 yen in early
afternoon trading in Tokyo, still down 6.50 yen from late Wednesday
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   Traders had conflicting views of what was going on.
	   The yen's dramatic gain was alternatively attributed to a
brightening outlook for recovery in Japan, a loss of faith in the
U.S. economy, and the mysterious movements of hedge fund investors.
	   But whatever the source of the yen's sudden vigor, analysts said
that if it sticks _ and they said that is still a big if _ it would
be good news for Japanese banks, which are mired in a bad debt
crisis and seen as a major pull on efforts to get the country out
of recession.
	   ``The weak yen was killing Japan,'' said Richard Koo, economist
at Nomura Research Institute. The rise ``will make everything
easier.''
	   Specifically, he said, the yen's gain promises to ease Japan's
credit crunch and take some pressure off other Asian economies.
	   The weakness of the yen, which began earlier this year, raised
fears of another round of currency devaluations across Asia that
would push regional economies into deeper distress and roil
financial markets around the globe.
	   The concern was that the falling yen made Japan's exports
cheaper, which in turn undercut the exports of other Asian nations,
like hard-hit Indonesia and South Korea, that need export income to
fuel recoveries.
	   The strength of the yen now could have the opposite effect,
hurting companies like Sony and Nintendo, which sell more than half
their goods overseas.
	   But many economists argue the gains to be made by Japan's banks
could be more significant.
	   Because many of the banks have lent money abroad in dollars, the
weaker U.S. currency cuts down the value of their loans, easing
their burden and making them less reluctant to lend at home.
	   The credit crunch over the past year has hit small- and
medium-sized companies especially hard, driving Japanese firms to
bankruptcy in record numbers.
	   But while economists said Thursday's rise in the yen could be a
sign of hope for the Japanese economy, they also warned the country
has a long way to go to recovery.
	   Japan's government is working on a bill to strengthen banks, and
it was widely expected to pass Parliament by the end of the current
session on Oct. 16.
	   The bill is just one step toward cleaning up as much as dlrs 1
trillion in bad loans in Japan's banking sector, a process that is
likely to take years.
	   And there was no guarantee the yen's power would last.
	   ``There's no way to tell if the dollar will stay around here,''
the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency Taichi Sakaiya said.

Report: investment in Singapore is on track, but falling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ New investment in Singapore this year is
meeting expectations, but falling below pre-crisis levels, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   ``The target of 7.8 billion Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.8
billion) announced by the (prime minister) is achievable'' in 1998,
Economic Development Board chairman Philip Yeo was quoted as saying
in The Straits Times. But predictions for 1999 are ``something we
are much more careful about because the market mood is not very
strong,'' Yeo cautioned.
	   In the first half of the year, new investment in the Southeast
Asian city-state from foreign and local sources totaled 3.9 billion
Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.4 billion), on track with government
estimates for the year, according to the report.
	   Singapore's economy is slowing in line with its neighbors
sluggish performance, and may enter a technical recession in the
last half of 1998. The government has repeatedly revised growth
forecasts downward, and leaders recently predicted the year's gross
domestic product would fall below 1 percent.
	   Even if investments meet economic planners' goals this year, new
capital for business projects will have fallen to its lowest level
in three years, the newspaper said.
	   Total investments reached 8.5 billion Singapore dollars (U.S.
dlrs 5.2 billion at current exchange rates) in 1997, and 8.1
billion Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 4.9 billion at current rates)
in 1996, said the daily.
	   In the past, the Economic Development Board, a division of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, had predicted that new investment
would raise the figure to 10 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 6.1
billion at current rates) a year by 2000.

Philippine stocks rise on yen's advance; index up 3.1 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks surged for a second
day Thursday, mirroring a region-wide advance sparked by the
Japanese yen's sharp rise against the dollar, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 37.66 points,
or 3.1 percent, to 1,250.41 following its 42.59-point jump
Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was 10.15 points higher at 414.26
after Wednesday's 11.46-point rise.
	   Ricardo Puig, research director of Kim Eng Securities, said the
stock market was drawing strength from an apparent improvement in
investor sentiment following the yen's dramatic increase against
the dollar.
	   Major blue chips continued to rake in gains, with Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co. cornering more than a third of the
day's trades.
	   Overall, gainers beat losers 70 to 22, with 34 issues unchanged.
	   Wednesday's dollar freefall, according to currency dealers, was
triggered by positive market reaction to reports that Japan's
ruling party would be able to pass legislation in the current
session of Parliament to pump public money into ailing banks.
	   Puig said the direction of the yen and other regional currencies
in coming days will continue to influence the local stock market's
movements.
	   Nicholas Ty, analyst for Capital Securities One, said
businessmen's encouraging rating of President Joseph Estrada's
performance in office in the first 100 days of his term also helped
shares extend their gains.
	   Ty warned, however, that a sharp correction in the stock market
could ensue if Japan again fails to pass the needed legislation to
cure its ailing banks.
	   In currency trading, the peso was steadily rising at midday,
riding the crest of the gains by the yen and other regional
currencies against the U.S. dollar, dealers said.
	   At midday the dollar averaged 43.420 pesos, down from
Wednesday's average of 43.643 pesos. The dollar hit a morning low
of 43.30 pesos.
	   Trading was brisk, with corporate buying picking up as the
dollar dipped.
	   Dealers said the dollar could weaken further against the peso if
the yen continued its advance, but the local currency's gains might
be capped just above 43 pesos.
	   The Philippine Central Bank was not active in the spot market
and held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent
and 16 percent, respectively.

ASEAN alarmed by sharp drop in foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries have been
alarmed by a sharp drop in foreign investment in the region,
prompting them to hasten plans to demolish barriers to trade,
officials said Thursday.
	   The officials said foreign investment has fallen by 33.6 percent
for the nine members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
since Asia's financial crisis erupted in July 1997.
	   The alarm over the sharp decline prompted ASEAN trade ministers
to agree in meetings in Manila this week to take bold steps to
boost investment and tourism, they said.
	   Some ASEAN countries said the plans would need to be studied and
approved by their respective governments. If specific steps are
approved, they will be announced at a summit of ASEAN heads of
state in December to give them impact, said an ASEAN official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said the ministers realized they needed to respond
quickly because of strong international competition for trade.
	   On Tuesday, ASEAN trade officials agreed to accelerate plans to
remove regional trade barriers to encourage business and investment
and help Asia recover from the 15-month financial storm.
	   The officials set a goal of completely eliminating tariffs for
many products traded in the region by the year 2003, instead of
their previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5 percent by
that year.
	   As a result, average tariffs will fall from 5.37 percent this
year to 2.68 percent in 2003, they said.
	   ASEAN also agreed to accelerate tariff cuts for some sensitive
agricultural products, such as rice and sugar, after Indonesia
offered to eliminate all tariffs on rice by the year 2010 within
the region.
	   On Wednesday, ASEAN trade ministers signed an agreement creating
an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove barriers to investment
from ASEAN countries by the year 2010 and by 2020 for investment
from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country would be
granted the same investment rights as local citizens in other ASEAN
countries in which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions where a
country's constitution limits equal treatment.
	   ASEAN members include Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN officials earlier said that foreign investment in the
region had dropped by 50 percent from the first half of 1997 to the
first half of this year, but later revised the figure to 33.6
percent after Vietnam submitted new trade figures.

Dollar tumbles against yen, Tokyo stocks finish sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei close, latest dollar, bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
Thursday afternoon after diving overnight amid hopes that Japan's
economic and banking problems may be resolved. Tokyo stock prices
tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 122.92 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 5.26
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
stood at 13,006.57 in late afternoon trading, down 5.92 percent, or
819.04 points, erasing all the gains it posted the previous day. On
Wednesday, the average surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its
second-largest points gain this year.
	   Tokyo players bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or
oversold, dollar positions, bringing the dollar a bit higher than
its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   Concern about U.S. markets, fears that the U.S. economy could
slow more quickly than previously thought and increasing prospects
that Japan's bank recapitalization bills may be passed soon were
among negative factors for the dollar, traders said.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds continued their selling while Japanese
institutional investors bought dollars on dips, but all of them
were afraid of betting on one direction,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka,
trader at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on
Wednesday's dollar plunge. ``I don't talk about specific levels,''
Miyazawa said. ``The market is the market.''
	   On Wednesday, the dollar fell a stunning 8 percent against the
yen for the largest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter
century. The last time the dollar posted such a sharp single day
drop was in 1974, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been haggling with the
main opposition parties for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday.
	   Media reports say the legislation, which is designed to
strengthen the nation's ailing banks, is expected to pass the upper
house and become law by the end of the current Parliamentary
session on Oct. 16.
	   But many stock investors came to question how effective the plan
will be when it is actually implemented, said Fumikazu Onishi, a
strategist with Nikko Securities.
	   ``The wild fluctuations in recent yen-dollar exchange rates also
dealt a big blow to exporting companies, dampening overall
sentiment,'' Onishi said.
	   Export-oriented issues, including auto and high-technology
issues, were losers after the yen's dive to near 120 yen against
the dollar.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt major Japanese
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more
expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, to 1,001.50. On
Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back
an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points before
reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at 7,741.69 on
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.780 percent from Wednesday's close of
0.770 percent, driving its price down to 109.18 yen from 109.28
yen.

ASEAN: Crisis has thrust Southeast Asia into common destiny
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries now share a
common destiny because of the region's financial crisis and
therefore must work together to solve it, according to the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   In a report to ASEAN trade ministers, who ended two days of
meetings in Manila Thursday, ASEAN Secretary General Rodolfo
Severino said one of the most important lessons from the
15-month-old crisis is that markets increasingly view countries in
Southeast Asia as one entity.
	   ``While one can dismiss this contagion effect as a reflection of
market panic, I think it also reflects the very real process of
economic integration that has been going on in the region,''
Severino said.
	   ``Hence, Asian countries will increasingly share good times and
bad times together,'' he added.
	   The report concluded that ASEAN countries must not only take
measures at the national level to deal with the crisis, but also
forge a strong regional response.
	   ASEAN has recently launched a mutual surveillance system to spot
future problems in ASEAN economies, and some members are discussing
the use of local currencies for inter-ASEAN trade to reduce their
reliance on dollars.
	   At the Manila meetings, the trade ministers also agreed to speed
up the reduction of tariff barriers within the group and spur
investments by creating an ASEAN Investment Area, which aims to
grant reciprocal business rights.
	   Severino's report said the surveillance system should encourage
early action to head off potential financial problems.
	   Under the system, an oversight group will monitor a range of
economic and financial data and, if necessary, exert peer pressure
for corrective actions when signs of financial or economic
difficulties appear in a member country.
	   ``This represents an acknowledgment of the growing
interdependence of ASEAN members' financial systems and its
understanding that weakness in one country could have repercussions
for another country,'' the report said.
	   It urged ASEAN countries to resist pressures from industry
groups seeking a slowdown or reversal of the group's commitment to
greater trade liberalization.
	   ``It is ... important that ministers send a positive signal to
the world that ASEAN remains not only firmly committed to regional
economic integration, but is also accelerating this process,'' the
report said.
	   It said ASEAN should contribute to current debate over a new
structure for the international financial system.
	   ``Otherwise, others will be deciding, once again, the economic
destiny of Southeast Asia to the peril of the region and its
people,'' Severino's report warned.
	   The report also urged Japan to take stronger steps to stimulate
its economy to lessen the impact of the financial crisis, and said
rich countries should keep their markets open to exports from badly
affected regions of the world, such as Southeast Asia.
	   ``Ministers must take every opportunity to convey to the major
industrialized countries what their responsibilities are and what
are our expectations of how they can pull the global economy back
from the precipice,'' the report said.

Russian vodka smuggled in as cleaning fluid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Could vodka be an efficient cleaning
fluid?
	   Lawyers for Russian vodka salesman Vladimir Kloubkov pleaded
this case, but it did not prevent him being convicted and fined on
smuggling and tax evasion charges in Adelaide Magistrates Court on
Thursday.
	   Kloubkov, 31, had pleaded guilty to smuggling 9,600 bottles of
vodka into Australia in July by disguising the shipment as cleaning
fluid.
	   The court was told he paid customs duty of 3,353 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,010) for cleaning fluid instead of the 148,245
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 88,950) due for importing the same
amount of vodka.
	   Kloubkov's lawyer, Paul Rice, said the vodka had been
contaminated during the manufacturing process in Russia and could
not be sold as vodka, so Kloubkov actually intended to sell it as
cleaning fluid.
	   The court was told Kloubkov, who works for the Russian company
Destiny, which makes Russkaya vodka for sale in Russia and
overseas, made his first trip to Australia in May to try to
establish a market for Russkaya.
	   He went back to Russia before returning to Australia on the ship
Paliser Bay on July 28 with a container of 9,600 bottles of
Russkaya labeled as cleaning fluid.
	   Kloubkov declared the bottles to Port Adelaide customs officials
as cleaning pastes and powders but investigators searched the
container and sent a number of bottles to be analyzed, which were
found to contain vodka.
	   Magistrate Joseph Baldino ordered Kloubkov to pay a total of
6,102 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,660) including fines and
court costs and the vodka to be handed over to customs officials
for its destruction.

Palestinian strike, clashes in Hebron to protest Israeli blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NASSER SHIYOUKHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians staged a general strike
and clashed with Israeli forces in Hebron on Thursday to protest an
eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank and a curfew in the
downtown area.
	   Shops and restaurants were shuttered. Schools were also closed
and teen-agers threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers
guarding one of the Jewish settler enclaves in the city center.
	   The soldiers responded with rubber-coated steel bullets.
	   As the clashes broke out, the Israeli army lifted its closure of
Hebron which had barred Palestinians from entering and leaving the
city. However, a curfew on some 30,000 Palestinians living in the
Israeli-controlled downtown area remained in effect.
	   The closure and curfew were imposed Sept. 30, after two dozen
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured by two hand
grenades thrown by a man who apparently escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   A leaflet distributed Tuesday by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah group called for a general strike Thursday and for
clashes Friday near the Israeli-run zone unless the closure and
curfew were both lifted.
	   About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in downtown
Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and protected by
large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

Report: U.S. says Australia's new submarines are ``noisy duds''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 10-11 with navy admitting noise problem but
saying it will be fixed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A top-secret U.S. Navy report calls
Australia's new Collins class submarines noisy duds incapable of
defending themselves, a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The Daily Telegraph said the report by the U.S. Navy's Undersea
Warfare Center was particularly critical of the noise the
submarines made.
	   The newspaper quoted a source who had seen the report as saying
the submarines made ``as much noise as a rock concert.''
	   ``If they are cruising underwater at more than 10 knots they
might as well be on the surface,'' the source said.
	   The report prompted the builder, Australian Submarine Corp., to
say problems were being fixed and all six would be handed over to
the Navy within budget.
	   ``We're developing a new class of submarine and we've had some
teething problems with different equipment,'' Australian Submarine
Corp. spokesman Ross Milton said.
	   ``But we're fixing them; that's what you would expect.''
	   The newspaper quoted the secret report as saying the main cause
of the noise is the disturbed flow pattern of water along the hull
and into the propellers, which are also vibrating and cracking
because of faulty construction.
	   It also said the engines suffer gearbox failures and overheating
generators, the combat systems are virtually useless due to faulty
software, and the boats have vibrating periscopes and bad welding.
	   Rear Adm. Chris Oxenbould, deputy chief of the Australian navy,
told reporters later Thursday: ``The principal problems that we
have got relate to the acoustic signature of the submarines _ the
noise that the submarine makes _ and also with the combat systems.
	   ``We are going to fix the problems that confront us at the
moment,'' he said.
	   The Telegraph said the Royal Australian Navy had warned it would
not accept any more of the submarines _ which cost 800 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 480 million) each _ until all the
faults were fixed.
	   The navy faces a bill of up to 1 billion Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 600 million) to fix the noise and faulty combat systems
on the submarines, which were ordered in 1987.
	   Navy chief Vice-Admiral Don Chalmers ordered the classified U.S.
Navy report after problems with the first two boats emerged.
	   Five of the diesel-powered Collins class subs have been ordered
at a total cost of 5 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3
billion).
	   They are based on the Swedish Kockums-designed submarine.
	   The construction of Collins class submarines for the Australian
navy has been dogged by problems, including the development of the
boats' computer combat system.
	   The software system links sensors such as radar, sonar and
periscopes to torpedoes and missiles by way of multi-function
displays in the control room.
	   In April, a federal parliamentary committee noted that
Australian Submarine Corp. claimed in 1992 that construction
problems would take only a few weeks to fix.
	   The project has recently been the subject of two reports by the
Australian National Audit Office, both of which were critical of
defense management.
	   A navy spokesman. Cmdr. Rod Dudfield, would not discuss the
noise issue but said the U.S. Navy report would be used to enhance
the project.

Palestinians strike, clash with troops in Hebron to protest Israeli

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinians staged a general strike
and clashed with Israeli forces in Hebron on Thursday to protest an
eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town and a curfew in
the downtown area.
	   Shops and restaurants were shuttered. Schools were also closed
and teen-agers threw stones and empty bottles at Israeli soldiers
guarding one of the Jewish settler enclaves in the city center.
	   The soldiers responded by firing rubber-coated steel bullets.
	   As the clashes broke out, the Israeli army lifted its closure of
Hebron which had barred Palestinians from entering and leaving the
city. However, a curfew on some 30,000 Palestinians living in the
Israeli-controlled downtown area remained in effect.
	   The closure and curfew were imposed Sept. 30, after two dozen
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured by two hand
grenades thrown by a man who apparently escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   A leaflet distributed Tuesday by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's Fatah group called for a general strike Thursday and for
clashes Friday near the Israeli-run zone unless the closure and
curfew were both lifted.
	   About 450 Jewish settlers live in a number of enclaves in
downtown Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and
protected by large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

Former Japanese finance official sentenced for bribery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former Ministry of Finance official was given a
suspended two-year prison sentence and fined Thursday for accepting
bribes of lavish entertainment from four brokerage houses.
	   The case is part of a wide probe into an influence-peddling
scandal at the ministry. Prosecutors allege officials took bribes
in exchange for warning financial institutions about government
inspections.
	   The Tokyo District Court on Thursday ruled Toshio Miyano, 51, a
former senior inspector at the ministry's Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission, gave preferential treatment to firms who
provided the entertainment, a court official said.
	   Miyano was also fined 5.23 million yen (dlrs 43,500) _ the value
of the entertainment he received. Typical entertainment gifts
include fancy dinners, drinking parties and golf rounds at ritzy
country clubs.
	   Presiding Judge Fumihiro Abe was quoted by Kyodo News agency as
calling Miyano's crime ``evil'' and criticizing Miyano for
continuing to accept entertainment even after the ministry
introduced stricter regulations.
	   Abe said he suspended the sentence for three years because
Miyano, who was dismissed from the ministry in July, had already
been punished by society by losing his job, Kyodo reported.
	   According to the ruling, Miyano accepted bribes in the form of
wining, dining and golfing in return for forwarding copies of
ministry documents discussing possible punishments against
brokerage houses and other favorable treatment.
	   It said Miyano was entertained on 75 different occasions from
April 1993 to June 1996 by Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi
securities companies _ at that time the country's top four
brokerages.
	   Miyano is the third of four former finance officials indicted in
the bribery scandal to be sentenced.

Dollar tumbles against yen, Tokyo stocks finish sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Nikkei close &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was sharply lower against the yen
Thursday afternoon after diving overnight amid hopes that Japan's
economic and banking problems may be resolved. Tokyo stock prices
tumbled on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 122.92 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 5.26
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level
of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed
the day's trading at 13,026.06, down 5.78 percent, or 799.55
points. On Wednesday, the average surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97
points _ its second-largest points gain this year.
	   Tokyo players bought the U.S. currency to cover short, or
oversold, dollar positions, bringing the dollar a bit higher than
its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   Concern about U.S. markets, fears that the U.S. economy could
slow more quickly than previously thought and increasing prospects
that Japan's bank recapitalization bills may be passed soon were
among negative factors for the dollar, traders said.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds continued their selling while Japanese
institutional investors bought dollars on dips, but all of them
were afraid of betting on one direction,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka,
trader at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa declined to comment on
Wednesday's dollar plunge. ``I don't talk about specific levels,''
Miyazawa said. ``The market is the market.''
	   On Wednesday, the dollar fell a stunning 8 percent against the
yen for the largest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter
century. The last time the dollar posted such a sharp single day
drop was in 1974, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party had been haggling with the
main opposition parties for weeks over the bank plan but the major
sticking points had been resolved by the time the bill was
submitted to Parliament on Wednesday.
	   Media reports say the legislation, which is designed to
strengthen the nation's ailing banks, is expected to pass the upper
house and become law by the end of the current Parliamentary
session on Oct. 16.
	   But many stock investors came to question how effective the plan
will be when it is actually implemented, said Fumikazu Onishi, a
strategist with Nikko Securities.
	   ``The wild fluctuations in recent yen-dollar exchange rates also
dealt a big blow to exporting companies, dampening overall
sentiment,'' Onishi said.
	   Export-oriented issues, including auto and high-technology
issues, were losers after the yen's dive to near 120 yen against
the dollar.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt major Japanese
exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive strength
in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more
expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, to 1,001.50. On
Wednesday, the TOPIX gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street. There, the Dow Jones industrial average gave back
an early 115-point gain and slid as much as 113 points before
reversing course and closing just 1.29 points lower at 7,741.69 on
Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.780 percent from Wednesday's close of
0.770 percent, driving its price down to 109.18 yen from 109.28
yen.

Big Cat flops in NLCS debut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Andres Galarraga waited 13 years to play in the
National League championship series.
	   It was hardly a memorable debut for the Big Cat.
	   Galarraga, renowned as one of the game's best defensive first
basemen, committed two errors on one play in the eighth inning, and
the San Diego Padres went on to beat the Atlanta Braves 3-2 in Game
1 of the NLCS Wednesday night.
	   The 37-year-old had made only one postseason appearance in his
long career, playing for the Colorado team that lost to the Braves
in the 1995 division series.
	   After Atlanta clinched a first-round sweep over the Chicago Cubs
on Saturday night, Galarraga was one of the most animated players
in the champagne-soaked clubhouse, reveling in the his first trip
to the championship series.
	   His joy was tempered by a miserable performance in Game 1, but
he still managed to smile afterwards.
	   ``There's a long ways to go,'' he said. ``It's just the first
game. We can turn it around tomorrow. I'm happy to be where I'm at
now.''
	   At the plate, Galarraga went 0-for-5 with three strikeouts, and
he made the final out with two runners on in the 10th by flying out
to deep center. In the field, his judgment and throwing arm let him
down.
	   The unusual two-error play came with one out in a 1-1 game, and
Ruben Rivera at third for the Padres. Jim Leyritz, the perennial
postseason hero, dumped a slow roller no more than 45 feet (14
meters) down the third-base line and pitcher Dennis Martinez
pounced off the mound to grab it.
	   Martinez tried to look Rivera back to third but the runner broke
for the plate as soon as the throw went to first. Galarraga spotted
Rivera's ploy out of the corner of his eye and wound up pulling his
foot off the bag in his haste to make a play at home.
	   Leyritz was safe _ and so was Rivera when Galarraga's throw
skipped wide past catcher Javy Lopez.
	   Error on the catch. Error on the throw.
	   Galarraga had a chance to redeem himself in the 10th after the
Padres went ahead on Ken Caminiti's homer. The Big Cat thrilled
what remained of the crowd when he sent a pitch to the far reaches
of the Turner Field, but he wasn't fooled.
	   ``I knew it was a fly ball to center field,'' he said.
	   Before the season, Galarraga signed a dlrs 24.75-million,
three-year contract with the Braves to add right-handed power to
the middle of the lineup. He did just that, hitting .305 with 44
homers and 121 RBIs.
	   His defense was an added bonus for the Braves, who had the
lead-footed Fred McGriff at first for the previous five seasons.
	   Galarraga made 11 errors during the regular season, but that was
acceptable because he created so many more chances with his
quickness around the bag _ the origin of his nickname _ and
willingness to take chances.
	   On Wednesday night, it came back to haunt him.
	   ``I'm going to keep positive,'' Galarraga said. ``Tomorrow is
another day. Maybe it will be better for me.''

Grounded South Korean fishing boat sinks, causing fears for

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A South Korean fishing ship that
grounded on rocks two days ago sank Thursday off Stewart Island,
causing fears of oil fouling the island's east coast and killing
wildlife.
	   Penguins, thousands of muttonbirds, brown kiwis, seals and a
wide range of other bird and sea life lived in the area where the
ship has sunk.
	   The Dong Won 529 hit rocks on Breaksea Islands on Tuesday and
its 38 crew were evacuated. Salvage experts and local authorities
have since been trying to figure out how to refloat the ship.
	   People at the scene Thursday night were extremely surprised the
ship had sunk.
	   ``There was an attempt yesterday with a couple of tugs and a
number of fishing boats to pull the vessel off and they failed
completely. In fact ... the vessel didn't move at all,'' said the
director of Maritime Safety, Russell Kilvington.
	   ``The salvors on behalf of the charterers Sanfords had been on
the vessel to probably a few minutes of it moving, and I don't
believe they had any view it was going to move,'' he said.
	   With 300 metric tons of fuel oil plus some hydraulic and
lubricating oil on board, wilder weather would be welcome to help
disperse the oil, Kilvington said.
	   ``That (fuel oil) does disperse quite readily, and in dispersed
quantities is not a major hazard, but certainly great lumps of it
will be harmful to wildlife,'' he said.
	   ``There are small quantities of lubricating oil, probably
hydraulic oil. That's relatively small in quantity, but very
harmful.''
	   Aerial spraying would probably be used to disperse any oil that
leaked from the vessel. Depending how deep the surrounding water
was, it might also be possible to pump oil off the vessel,
Kilvington said.

Cathay Pacific studying Philippine Airlines' records for possible
</HEADLINE>
investment

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways is
studying the financial and management records of Philippine
Airlines to decide whether to invest in the Philippine flag
carrier, an airline official said Thursday.
	   Debt-laden PAL reopened Wednesday after a 13-day shutdown caused
by disagreements with its largest labor union over a management
recovery plan.
	   Peter Foster, a Cathay Pacific regional manager, said the
company would soon decide whether to invest in PAL.
	   He said Cathay Pacific is ``taking a very close look'' at the
airline, but declined to comment on what they have found or what
stake they are considering.
	   PAL officials say two other foreign carriers, Northwest Airlines
and Singapore Airlines, are also interested in a possible
investment. Officials from Northwest Airlines arrived in Manila on
Wednesday, they said.
	   Foster said the airline business in the Philippines remains
viable despite financial difficulties besetting PAL and other local
carriers.
	   He declined to comment on PAL's history of labor problems, but
said Cathay Pacific ``is a good employer.''
	   PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the
region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   PAL's closure on Sept. 23 left much of the Philippine
archipelago without air service. To help fill the vacuum, the
government enlisted Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines to
temporarily fly some of PAL's domestic routes.
	   Those flights ended Wednesday.

Russian vodka smuggled into Australia as cleaning fluid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Could vodka be an efficient cleaning
fluid?
	   Lawyers for Russian vodka salesman Vladimir Kloubkov pleaded
such a case, but it did not prevent him being convicted and fined
on smuggling and tax evasion charges in Adelaide Magistrates Court
on Thursday.
	   Kloubkov, 31, had pleaded guilty to smuggling 9,600 bottles of
vodka into Australia in July by disguising the shipment as cleaning
fluid.
	   The court was told he paid customs duty of 3,353 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2,010) for cleaning fluid instead of the 148,245
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 88,950) due for importing the same
amount of vodka.
	   Kloubkov's lawyer, Paul Rice, said the vodka had been
contaminated during the manufacturing process in Russia and could
not be sold as vodka, so Kloubkov actually intended to sell it as
cleaning fluid.
	   The court was told Kloubkov, who works for the Russian company
Destiny, which makes Russkaya vodka for sale in Russia and
overseas, made his first trip to Australia in May to try to
establish a market for Russkaya.
	   He went back to Russia before returning to Australia on the ship
Paliser Bay on July 28 with a container of 9,600 bottles of
Russkaya labeled as cleaning fluid.
	   Kloubkov declared the bottles to Port Adelaide customs officials
as cleaning pastes and powders but investigators searched the
container and sent a number of bottles to be analyzed, which were
found to contain vodka.
	   Magistrate Joseph Baldino ordered Kloubkov to pay a total of
6,102 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,660) including fines and
court costs and the vodka to be handed over to customs officials
for its destruction.

Indian ambassador says fears of arms race in subcontinent
</HEADLINE>
'far-fetched' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Fears of a nuclear arms race on the
Indian subcontinent are far-fetched, with the five underground
tests in May a stabilizing element in the region, India's
ambassador said Thursday.
	   Gopalaswami Parthasarathy strongly defended India's nuclear
weapons program, saying it was prompted in part by the hypocrisy of
the Western nuclear club.
	   ``Since it became clear to us that disarmament was not going to
be achieved by platitudes, we came to the conclusion that we had a
nuclear option ... and that option had to be exercised,'' he said.
	   Parthasarathy told the Australian Institute of International
Affairs that despite a ruling of the world court that nuclear
powers move toward disarmament, the United States and others were
moving in a direction that aimed to ``perpetuate their hegemony.''
	   ``Which meant they would perpetually retain nuclear weapons.
They would retain the right to threaten anyone else with nuclear
weapons.''
	   The sole aim of the Clinton administration's nuclear policy was
to ``cap, roll back and eliminate India's nuclear program,'' he
said.
	   Parthasarathy said the notion of a nuclear arms race on the
subcontinent was far-fetched and that India and Pakistan were
currently negotiating a nuclear agreement.
	   ``Each one has known that the other has had the capability and
could put together a nuclear device at very short notice for the
last 11 years,'' he said.
	   ``So what really has happened after the testing in the
subcontinent is that this ambiguity has ended. Things are out in
the open. I would go to the extent of calling it a stabilizing
element.''
	   Parthasarathy also said nuclear power was the answer to India's
economic aspirations.
	   The economy was expected to grow about 6 percent this year, and
the government was aiming for 8 percent growth.
	   Such high growth rates could be achieved only if India's energy
sector grew 15 percent a year -- through nuclear power, he said.
	   India's natural reserves of fissile material and its need to
avoid further fossil fuel pollution made nuclear energy a ``very
crucial long-term requirement,'' he said.

Iran to join mediation efforts between Turkey and Syria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
travels to Turkey and Syria Thursday to mediate in the escalating
dispute between the two countries, the Iranian news agency
reported.
	   Iran is currently head of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, a 55-member group that includes Syria and Turkey.
	   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran, as head of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference, will make practical efforts to end the
rising tension between Turkey and Syria,'' the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported. The report was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and received in Cairo.
	   Turkey has demanded that Syria end support for Turkish Kurdish
rebels or ``face the consequences.''
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels.
	   On Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between
Syria and Turkey in an attempt to reduce tensions.

Blair urges `strong message' on force over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged
nations deliberating the crisis in Kosovo Thursday to make clear
Yugoslavia faces a military attack if it does not end its crackdown
in the rebellious province.
	   Blair said Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has engaged in
``brinksmanship'' with nations trying to end the crisis ``because
he has not been given a strong enough message.''
	   The prime minister spoke in an interview with British television
networks while flying from Beijing to Shanghai, his second stop on
a five-day visit to China. His remarks came hours before officials
from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the United States
were to meet in London to discuss the crisis.
	   ``I hope the international community lives up to its
responsibility to send President Milosevic a united and strong
message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying on,'' Blair
said. He added that only that ``message backed up by the will to
use force if necessary'' will get Milosevic to ``stop behaving in
an appalling way.''
	   Britain and the United States have been pressing for NATO air
strikes if Milosevic does not pull back his Serb forces, which are
attempting to crush separatism by ethnic Albanians. Germany and
other alliance members have expressed reservations, and Russia, the
only nation in the six-member Contact Group not in NATO, has said
force will only worsen the situation.
	   Blair said Milosevic must end the crackdown and permit the safe
return of more than 250,000 refugees to their homes to stave off
the air strikes.

Asian Development Bank approves dlrs 70 million loan to Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Manila-based Asian Development
Bank has approved a dlrs 70 million loan for infrastructure and
housing development projects in Sri Lanka, the bank said in a
statement.
	   ``Deficiencies in basic infrastructure are restraining urban
areas from playing an active role in the economy's growth,'' the
ADB statement said late on Wednesday.
	   The loan will be used for developing roads, water supply and
drainage systems. Improvements in low income housing also will be
financed through the loan, it added.
	   The total project cost is estimated at dlrs 100 million, with
the ADB's dlrs 70 million repayable over 40 years at a nominal
annual interest rate of 1 percent. The balance will be financed by
the Sri Lanka government and other credit institutions.
	   The Asian Development Bank had earmarked around dlrs 180 million
as its loan disbursements in the current year for Sri Lanka.

Carolina quarterback removes himself from lineup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE MACENKA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Kerry Collins decided he needs
a break from being the Carolina Panthers' quarterback. Some of his
teammates are wondering if it might be best to make it a permanent
change.
	   The troubled career of the Panthers' first-ever draft choice
took another dip Wednesday when Collins walked into coach Dom
Capers' office and said he wanted to be removed from the starting
lineup.
	   ``He just said his heart's not totally into it, and in turn, he
felt it was the fairest thing to let me know,'' Capers said.
	   While Capers was noncommittal on the subject of how Collins'
move might affect his future with the Panthers, some of his
teammates didn't flinch when asked if the quarterback would be able
to lead them again.
	   ``Not effectively,'' offensive lineman Frank Garcia said. ``He
may be able to come in and play, but will people respect him as a
leader? No.''
	   Fullback William Floyd offered a similar view.
	   ``From a player's standpoint,'' Floyd said, ``you want a guy you
know is always going to be into it, regardless of what happens or
what the situation is.''
	   Collins, whose move came six days before the NFL's trading
deadline, did not speak with reporters before leaving the team's
headquarters. His agent, Leigh Steinberg, was traveling Wednesday
and did not return telephone messages left at his office.
	   For the immediate future, Steve Beuerlein has been promoted to
Carolina's starter and will be backed up by Shane Matthews.
Collins, who was at practice Wednesday, is the team's third-string
quarterback.
	   Capers said that since Collins had just informed him of his
feelings earlier in the day, it was too soon to say how his status
with the Panthers might change as the trade deadline approaches.
	   ``I would not rule out any possibilities right now,'' Capers
said.
	   It remains to be seen if any other NFL teams would be interested
in someone who had the league's highest interception total and its
worst quarterback rating last year.
	   Collins has had his share of troubles this season, making him a
frequent target of criticism for Carolina's 0-4 start heading into
Sunday's game at Dallas (3-2).
	   He has completed 47 percent of his passes and thrown for eight
touchdowns, but he has also been intercepted six times. He fumbled
once and was intercepted twice in Sunday's 51-23 loss to Atlanta.
	   ``He said he felt like he disappointed the team somewhat,''
Capers said of Collins, whom the Panthers selected with the fifth
overall draft pick in 1995.
	   Collins had winning records as a starter in his first two
seasons. He guided the 1996 Panthers to the NFC West title and a
berth in the conference championship game, both unprecedented
accomplishments for second-year NFL expansion teams.
	   But his 1997 season began with his jaw getting fractured by
Denver's Bill Romanowski in an exhibition game. By the time the
year was over, various media reports had questioned whether Collins
was a racist and drank too much, and he was being frequently
cascaded with boos by fans at home games.
	   In the offseason, the Panthers declined to pay Collins a dlrs 6
million bonus that would have extended his contract another three
years. The team opted instead to let him play this year as a
restricted free agent and become an unrestricted free agent after
the season.
	   Now he faces the possibility of spending the rest of this year
so deep on the Panthers' depth chart that he doesn't get any more
action, a scenario that is unlikely to brighten his job prospects.

Philippine president calls 105 former Muslim rebels to army duty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada called 105
former Muslim rebels to active duty Thursday as army officers to be
assigned to engineering and infantry units in their former
battleground.
	   The former Moro National Liberation Front rebels finished one
year of officer training Thursday and were called to duty as army
second lieutenants, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Gregorio Fajardo.
	   Fajardo said most would be assigned to engineering brigades to
help in constructing bridges and buildings on the main southern
Philippine island of Mindanao.
	   He said the others would be deployed to infantry divisions for
combat duty, also on Mindanao.
	   The rebels were allowed to enter government service under a
peace accord signed in 1996. The pact ended a quarter-century
rebellion that killed more than 120,000 people on Mindanao, which
Filipino Muslims consider their homeland.
	   Like other regular military officers, 50 of the former rebels
are college graduates. Fajardo said. Another 34 attended college
and the rest only finished high school. However, 38 of the new
officers have undergone foreign military training, he added.
	   Fajardo said a second batch of 55 former MNLF guerrillas began
their training in April and will finish next year.
	   Under the peace agreement, a total of 7,500 former guerrillas
will be selected for integration into the country's military and
police forces.
	   More than 1,000 former rebels are undergoing basic infantry
training. An earlier batch of 1,101 former rebels completed
training in January and are now in the army as enlisted personnel.
	   Another rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which
broke with the MNLF in the 1970s, has opened peace talks with the
government. A smaller extremist group is still fighting the
government.

Russian official: IMF remains `wary,' holds off on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund doesn't plan to
give Russia a new loan installment until the country implements an
economic reform program to deal with the current crisis, the
finance minister said Thursday.
	   ``They expect practical steps first,'' Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov said after returning from Washington, where he sought the
release of loans from the IMF and other international lenders.
	   ``If these steps help to stabilize the situation and are based
on free-market instruments, then they will receive understanding
and support,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government badly needs foreign loans
to help pay its many debts, including overdue wages owed to many
state workers. But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has
yet to finalize an economic plan to address the economic crisis
that hit in August.
	   Zadornov said that the government had already factored into its
fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 billion in loans that it hasn't yet
received from the IMF.
	   The IMF helped arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package for
Russia in July, but Moscow has not received any new installments
since the August crisis.
	   The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia
is ``very wary,'' he added.
	   Primakov says he will continue with market reforms in Russia,
but a draft economic plan published by the Russian media last week
called for a number of Soviet-style administrative controls. The
prime minister said the plan was purely preliminary and only
contained proposals.
	   The government not set a date for announcing the new economic
plan, but one top official said Wednesday that it would be ready by
the end of the month.
	   The official, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, has
also said that Russia will not be able to pay off its debts this
fall without help from the International Monetary Fund.
	   But Zadornov said that Russia doesn't link servicing its debt
with more foreign aid.
	   ``The government's political stance on the issue is that we must
pay off our external debt,'' he said.
	   In another development Thursday, the government said its foreign
currency reserves were at dlrs 12.8 billion as of Oct. 2, up from
dlrs 12.4 billion a week earlier.

Alaska Air halts flights to Russia's Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alaska Airlines stopped its flights to Russia's
Far East on Thursday because they haven't been making any money
since the country's financial crisis hit in August, a Russian news
agency reported.
	   Since 1994, Alaska has had two flights a week in the summer and
one in the winter to Russia, serving the cities of Magadan,
Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.
	   The flights were halted because passengers have dwindled for the
past several weeks, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The airline has said it would consider resuming service in late
spring.
	   It also said Alaska Air hopes to provide connecting service to
Russia through its marketing partner, Reeve Aleutian Airways, which
now offers charter service to the region.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two Chinese democracy campaigners detained by
police for trying to form an opposition political party were
released, but complained that police were harassing them, a human
rights group said Thursday.
	   It also reported seven other activists were detained Wednesday
night and Thursday morning. The detentions and releases were part
of the government's tight controls on the country's small and
fragmented dissident community.
	   Xie Wanjun, who was detained Sept. 21, was released Wednesday
but has been ordered to move out of his home, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. He
accused police of forcing his former employer to evict him from his
home.
	   Fellow dissident Liu Lianjun was allowed to return home Tuesday,
but about 20 police kept a 24-hour watch outside his home, the Hong
Kong-based group said.
	   Police also refused to return a computer they had confiscated,
it said.
	   Xie and Liu were detained after they attempted to file an
application with the authorities to set up an opposition group, the
China Democracy Party.
	   News from Liu and Xie that their application was not rejected
outright made some activists think the Communist Party might be
ready to allow an opposition party to form. Activists around the
country applied to set up branches.
	   But the authorities signaled their determination to keep the
Communist Party's monopoly on power by detaining at least a dozen
democracy campaigners.
	   While the government has maintained its tight repression of
public dissent, its tactics have changed somewhat. Most of the
dissidents rounded up in the latest police sweeps have been
released and warned to stop their activities.
	   In Changsha, a city in southern China, police detained Li
Wenming and six other activists after they held a meeting Wednesday
night. Two were released, but five remained in custody Thursday,

Strong quake rattles southwestern Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A strong earthquake shook southwestern
Greece on Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries
or serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.2, occurred at
6:50 a.m. (0350 GMT) off the Ionian Sea island of Zakinthos about
300 kilometers (180 miles) west of Athens, the Athens Geodynamic
Institute said.
	   It came two days after a stronger quake, with a preliminary
magnitude of 5.7, rattled the same area. Only minor damage was
reported.
	   A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage and magnitude
5 can produce moderate damage.

Red Wings begin mission to win another Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEN RAPPOPORT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Hockey Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Can the Detroit Red Wings three-peat?
	   When the regular NHL season opens this weekend, the Red Wings
will begin going after their third straight Stanley Cup. Only three
other franchises in the league have won as many as three in a row,
the last the New York Islanders, who won four straight from
1980-83.
	   Some pretty good teams have missed winning three straight,
including the Edmonton Oilers of the 1980s, who won five Cups in
seven years.
	   ``I think we're in the same boat that we were last season,''
defenseman Larry Murphy said. ``We're one of a handful of teams
that have a real good chance of winning. Hopefully the team
improves as the season goes along, that we get the good breaks and
everybody plays well.''
	   The Red Wings open their season on the road Saturday night,
playing at Toronto in one of 12 games. The NHL season starts Friday
night with Philadelphia at the New York Rangers, Tampa Bay at
Florida and San Jose vs. Calgary at Tokyo.
	   The Red Wings will pretty much return the same team that won
their second straight Cup and the ninth in team history with a
four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals last spring.
	   ``(It's the) same thing as last year,'' forward Darren McCarty
said. ``It's too early to tell. But we feel really confident in our
team.
	   ``We lost Bob Rouse (who signed with San Jose) and Slava
(Fetisov, who retired), but we picked up (defenseman) Uwe Krupp
(who signed as a free agent) and we're just as good, if not better,
on defense. So, there's no reason why we can't'' repeat.
	   The Red Wings still have a way to go to match the Montreal
Canadiens teams that won a record five straight from 1956-60. Like
the Islanders, the Canadiens also had a four-year run from 1976-79.
	   The Toronto Maple Leafs won three straight in different decades
_ 1947-49 and 1962-64.
	   ``Last year, we never really thought about (winning the Cup) all
year,'' Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman said. ``We didn't even talk
about winning two in a row. It wasn't an issue. Even going into the
playoffs we really didn't. You don't even have to talk about your
goal being winning because that's the goal, you know? So you don't
have to say it.
	   ``And we just kind of played. And when the playoffs came around,
we stepped up our play. So our approach this year, again, is let's
just play in training camp, go through it, enjoy ourselves and
enjoy the year.''
	   In other games Saturday, it's St. Louis at Boston, the Rangers
at Montreal, Pittsburgh at the New York Islanders, Anaheim at
Washington, Tampa Bay at Carolina, New Jersey at Chicago, Florida
at Nashville, Buffalo at Dallas, Ottawa at Colorado, Los Angeles at
Edmonton, and Calgary vs. San Jose at Tokyo.

Most Asian markets rally on stronger yen, but Tokyo falls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets opened higher
Thursday, lifted by a strengthening Japanese yen, but worries about
its effect on Japan's vaunted exporters pushed Tokyo's key Nikkei
index sharply lower.
	   In Tokyo, the dollar was at 122.92 yen in afternoon trading,
down 5.26 yen from late Wednesday but above its late New York level
of 120.25 yen overnight.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. currency fell 8 percent against the yen _
the largest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter-century.
The last time the dollar posted such a sharp single-day drop was in
1974, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The yen's strength, resulting from expectations that Japan was
making progress in putting its troubled banking system back on
track, gave stock and currency markets in the region a shot in the
arm.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng index had climbed 3.8
percent to 8,037.15 points by midday, with property shares leading
the advance. In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index climbed 2.4
percent to 943.40 points, adding to Wednesday's 2.1 percent gain.
	   But renewed vigor in Japan's currency had the opposite effect on
Tokyo stocks, which bucked the regional trend and closed sharply
lower, virtually erasing the previous day's huge rise.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed
at 13,026.06, down 5.78 percent, or 799.55 points. On Wednesday,
the average had surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its
second-largest points gain this year.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt shares of major
Japanese exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive
strength in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports
more expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   ``The wild fluctuations in recent yen-dollar exchange rates also
dealt a big blow to exporting companies, dampening overall
sentiment,'' said Fumikazu Onishi, a strategist with Nikko
Securities.
	   Profit-taking after Wednesday's rise also helped depress prices,
traders said.
	   Concern about U.S. markets, fears that the U.S. economy could
slow more quickly than previously thought and increasing prospects
that Japan's bank recapitalization bills may be passed soon were
among negative factors for the dollar, traders said.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds continued their selling while Japanese
institutional investors bought dollars on dips, but all of them
were afraid of betting on one direction,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka,
trader at Nippon Credit Bank in Tokyo.
	   Media reports said legislation designed to strengthen the
nation's ailing banks, submitted to Parliament Wednesday, is
expected to become law by the end of the current parliamentary
session Oct. 16.
	   On other regional bourses Thursday, Thailand's SET index was up
2.9 percent in early trading, Indonesia's JSX index rose 2.7
percent, and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.8 percent. The
Philippines' PSE index closed up 3.1 percent.
	   In Hong Kong, the property sector was encouraged by Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa's policy speech late Wednesday and lower
interbank interest rates, which had eased on the stronger yen. The
property sub-index rallied 8.2 percent in the morning.
	   Tung offered government support for the property market in his
speech and backed down from some of the government's earlier
housing construction targets, which were widely blamed for the
property slump.
	   ``The government seems to be supporting the market even though
there were no new specific measures like last year,'' said Vincent
Cheung, an equity sales manager at Sassoon Securities in Hong Kong.

Jordan still hasn't decided whether to return to the Bulls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Michael Jordan still hasn't decided whether to
return to the Chicago Bulls.
	   ``What's most important right now is for me to see where the
league is going, then look deep inside myself to make a clear-cut
decision. So for now I'm keeping my options open,'' Jordan said in
Thursday's Chicago Tribune.
	   Jordan said he won't make his decision until the end of the NBA
lockout, which has already wiped out the preseason schedule and
could delay the start of the regular season.
	   But he backed away from previous statements that he wouldn't
play for any coach but Phil Jackson, who left the Bulls after they
won their sixth title in eight years.
	   Jordan told the Tribune it would be a challenge to win a title
with a new coach.
	   ``For me, if there's no challenge, I don't want to play,''
Jordan said. ``But the Catch-22 for me is that I don't want people
saying I came back when I shouldn't have or I stayed too long.''
	   Jordan, 35, said he is ``completely healthy, and the love I have
for basketball, for the challenge of it, is still there for me.''
	   Since the Bulls won their sixth title in June and Jackson
decided not to return, Jordan has strongly hinted that he wouldn't
come back either.
	   But he told the Tribune he isn't opposed to playing for new
coach Tim Floyd or for an organization still run by general manager
Jerry Krause, who isn't one of Jordan's favorites.
	   ``I played with Jerry there the last five or six seasons, and
we've been successful,'' Jordan said. ``I don't like it. But that's
not going to be my final deciding factor.''
	   Jordan said he thinks Jackson might return to coach him, but he
acknowledged that the odds of Jackson coaching the Bulls this
season are ``probably a million to one.''
	   Jordan had nothing critical to say about Floyd, the former Iowa
State coach he and Jackson referred to last season as ``Pink''
Floyd.
	   ``I don't fault him. I fault Jerry Krause for driving Jackson
away,'' Jordan said.
	   Floyd said Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf recently told him he
still plans to do his best to sign Jordan again.

Indian ambassador says fears of arms race in subcontinent
</HEADLINE>
`far-fetched' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Fears of a nuclear arms race on the
Asian subcontinent are far-fetched, with the five underground tests
in May a stabilizing element in the region, India's ambassador said
Thursday.
	   Gopalaswami Parthasarathy strongly defended India's nuclear
weapons program, saying it was prompted in part by the hypocrisy of
the Western nuclear club.
	   ``Since it became clear to us that disarmament was not going to
be achieved by platitudes, we came to the conclusion that we had a
nuclear option ... and that option had to be exercised,'' he said.
	   Parthasarathy told the Australian Institute of International
Affairs that despite a ruling of the world court that nuclear
powers should move toward disarmament, the United States and others
were moving in a direction that aimed to ``perpetuate their
hegemony.''
	   ``Which meant they would perpetually retain nuclear weapons.
They would retain the right to threaten anyone else with nuclear
weapons,'' he added.
	   The sole aim of the Clinton administration's nuclear policy was
to ``cap, roll back and eliminate India's nuclear program,'' he
said.
	   Parthasarathy said the notion of a nuclear arms race on the
subcontinent was far-fetched and that India and Pakistan were
currently negotiating a nuclear agreement.
	   ``Each one has known that the other has had the capability and
could put together a nuclear device at very short notice for the
last 11 years,'' he said.
	   ``So what really has happened after the testing in the
subcontinent is that this ambiguity has ended. Things are out in
the open. I would go to the extent of calling it a stabilizing
element.''
	   Parthasarathy also said nuclear power was the answer to India's
economic aspirations.
	   The economy was expected to grow about 6 percent this year, and
the government was aiming for 8 percent growth.
	   Such high growth rates could be achieved only if India's energy
sector grew 15 percent a year _ through nuclear power, he said.
	   India's natural reserves of fissionable material and its need to
avoid further fossil fuel pollution made nuclear energy a ``very
crucial long-term requirement,'' he said.

U.S. wary of Australian swim team says Pilczuk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ United States team members were wary of
Australia's growing swimming strength heading into the Sydney 2000
Olympics, world champion American Bill Pilczuk said Thursday.
	   ``Australia is the favorite going into the Olympics, you've got
home court advantage,'' Pilczuk said at a new conference ahead of
Saturday's swimming ``skins'' meet. ``Australia is coming off a
good world championship and an even better Commonwealth Games, and
the U.S. is starting to get a bit panicky.''
	   Australia won 23 of the 32 gold medals on offer at the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur last month, setting one relay
world record and nudging another in the individual 200-meter
freestyle.
	   Pilczuk, who won the world 50-meter freestyle title in Perth in
January, returned to Australia for the international meet in the
2000 Olympics pool.
	   Pilczuk, who edged Russian ace Alexander Popov in Perth, is one
of several overseas swimmers in Sydney for the Australian dlrs
100,000 (U.S. dlrs 58,000) ``skins'' event.
	   The foreign contingent also includes South Africa's dual Olympic
breaststroke champion Penny Heyns and compatriot Ryk Neethling and
Canada's Commonwealth 400-meter individual medley champion Joanne
Malar.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kim calling for more Japanese investment, grafs
20-21 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to move beyond the past, Japan offered its
fullest apology yet for its 35-year colonial rule of South Korea in
a pact Thursday heralding a ``new partnership'' between the two
countries.
	   The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, outlined fresh areas of
cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability in North
Korea.
	   ``It is my conviction that this joint declaration will be a new
start,'' Obuchi told reporters after a morning meeting and signing
ceremony with Kim.
	   Before looking to the future, Japan and South Korea addressed
some of the unpleasant past: Japan's harsh 1910-1945 rule over the
Korean Peninsula _ a period still deeply resented by South Koreans.
	   The apology offered Thursday differed little in wording from
past Japanese statements of remorse, which have been considered in
South Korea as lacking in sincerity.
	   The difference this time, however, was that phrasing of the
apology was negotiated between the two sides, written in a document
and signed, putting down Japan's recognition of past misdeeds in
black and white.
	   ``I feel acute remorse and offer an apology from my heart,''
Obuchi said. He added later: ``I have made our country's position
clear.''
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the sincerity of the Japanese
statement, adding that the ``form and feeling'' of the apology were
different than in the past.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said.
	   The Obuchi statement followed a speech Wednesday night in which
Emperor Akihito reiterated a previous apology, acknowledging that
``Japan brought great suffering on the people of the Korean
Peninsula.''
	   The signing came a day after Kim arrived in Tokyo for a four-day
visit, his first since becoming president. He met the emperor
Wednesday and spoke at a gala banquet at the Imperial Palace. Later
Thursday, he was to address Parliament.
	   Despite the Japanese apology, the two sides clearly stressed the
economic and cooperative aspects of the summit. They need to work
together on Asia's economic problems, and also will be co-hosts for
the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   As a sign of closer ties, Tokyo and Seoul are considering a
visit to South Korea by Akihito. Such a trip is a touchy subject,
since it was in the name of the late Emperor Hirohito _ Akihito's
father _ that Japan conquered much of Asia before and during World
War II.
	   Both Kim and Obuchi said they were working on such a visit, with
Kim saying arranging an imperial trip to South Korea before the
2002 World Cup was ``a target.''
	   ``We're neighbors and it's been 33 years since we've established
diplomatic relations,'' Kim said. ``So I think the fact that the
emperor hasn't visited yet is extremely unnatural.''
	   The pact signed Thursday included agreements on economic
cooperation, more student exchanges between the two countries and a
South Korean pledge to lift bans on Japanese culture, such as
movies.
	   Economy played a central role in the meeting. Obuchi offered Kim
a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South Korea overcome its
severe economic downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its
economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International
Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   ``I express my gratitude for Japan's support despite its own
economic difficulties,'' said Kim, who added that Japan could help
further by opening more of its markets to Korean products.
	   At a luncheon given by economic and business leaders later in
the day, Kim urged Japanese businesses to increase investment in
South Korea and called for the two countries to work together to
boost bilateral trade.
	   He also called for businesses of Japan and Korea to forge ``a
common strategy'' for cross stock investment, technology transfer
and joint research.
	   Also on the summit agenda was last month's rocket launch by
North Korea. The rocket flew over Japan, causing concern that the
North has considerably improved its missile capabilities.
	   In Thursday's talks, the two sides acknowledged that a program
to build nuclear reactors in the isolated country was the best way
to ensure that North Korea does not develop its own nuclear
weapons.
	   Japan withdrew funding from the program after the recent rocket
launch. The leaders on Thursday made no mention about if or when
Japan would restore the funding.

Skinheads sentenced for drowning Roma
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Three skinheads were found guilty
of murder Thursday and sentenced to prison for chasing a Gypsy
teenager into a river where he drowned five years ago, the news
agency CTK reported.
	   The agency said that Jaroslav Churacek, Zdenek Habich and Martin
Pomije were sentenced to 8.5, 7.5 and 7 years in jail respectively.
	   They were found guilty of attacking, along with 14 other people,
a group of Romas in the south Bohemian town of Pisek, 100
kilometers (62 miles) south of Prague, in September, 1993.
	   Four of the Gypsies jumped in horror into the Otava river where
one of them, 16-year-old Tibor Danihel, drowned.
	   The three, who also were found guilty of an attempted murder,
were given relatively low sentences as they were juveniles at the
time of the attack.
	   Another attacker, identified as Milan Brat, will stand a
separate trial, CTK said.

Cambodian ruling party calls for top-level talks to break
</HEADLINE>
stalemate &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The president of Cambodia's ruling
party called Thursday for direct talks with senior opposition party
leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh to break the stalemate in
negotiations to form the next government.
	   Acknowledging that ``working group'' negotiations between the
ruling party and the two-party opposition had yielded no concrete
results, Cambodian People's Party president Chea Sim said in an
interview with a pro-government newspaper that he and Cambodian
leader Hun Sen should hold parallel negotiations with Ranariddh.
	   Ranariddh and most senior officials of his FUNCINPEC party were
meeting in Bangkok Thursday to discuss party strategy for Friday's
working group session. The prince flew to Thailand after parliament
was ceremonially convened Sept. 24.
	   ``We hope that the prince will return from Bangkok to Phnom Penh
in the near future in order to facilitate negotiation at two levels
_ one will be led by parties' top leaders and another by the
working groups _ to proceed at the same time,'' Chea Sim told the
newspaper Rasmei Kampuchea (Light of Cambodia).
	   A negotiation session Monday ended in deadlock after the three
parties maintained the same positions they have held since Hun
Sen's party narrowly won the July 26 national election.
	   The ruling party, winner of a majority in parliament but not the
two-thirds necessary to form the government alone, is eager to see
a new administration installed so the government can regain the
international legitimacy it lost when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a violent coup last year.
	   But the opposition claims that Hun Sen's electoral victory was
achieved through fraud and intimidation. The two parties insist
that their allegations must be thoroughly investigated before
parliament holds its first official meeting.
	   The opposition also entered Monday's talks with demands for a
general amnesty for all opposition politicians and supporters
facing court action for their roles in anti-government
demonstrations staged after the election.
	   Saying that the stalemate has prolonged an economic recession,
Chea Sim argued that the opposition's fraud allegations and calls
for amnesties ``are not vital to the country'' and should be dealt
with after the government is formed.
	   The suggestion received a frosty response from Prince Sisowath
Sirirath, a working group negotiator from Ranariddh's party.
	   ``We need to agree with everything beforehand because our
experience with the ruling party over the last five years has been
very bitter,'' Sirirath said.
	   Sirirath also said that Chea Sim's wish to exclude junior
opposition leader Sam Rainsy from the proposed top-level talks
would likely not be agreed to.
	   ``I don't want to speculate on what Ranariddh might say, but I
think we should have tripartite negotiations,'' he said.
	   Sam Rainsy, who is under court investigation for his prominent
role in the demonstrations, left Cambodia last month and is
currently on a tour of the United States and Europe to lobby for
support for the opposition.
	   All members of parliament from the Sam Rainsy Party are now
outside Cambodia in what a spokesman described as a move to be free
from ruling party intimidation.
	   ``Definitely all 15 of them are out of the country,'' Sam Rainsy
Party spokesman Rich Garella said. ``They want to make decisions
that are in the best interest for the country and reflect the will
of the people.''
	   FUNCINPEC lawmaker Ahmad Yahya said at least half of his party's
43 members of parliament were also outside Cambodia for various
reasons.

Arafat meets Yeltsin for talks on Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin welcomed visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday and the two leaders
discussed the prospects for a breakthrough in Middle East peace
talks, officials said.
	   Arafat is on a two-day visit to Moscow in the wake of his
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Those talks raised hopes
that the stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   ``I welcome you and your comrades in arms and hope your visit
will be successful,'' Yeltsin told Arafat at the start of their
talks in the Kremlin.
	   Arafat is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
and other government officials and sign a Russian-Palestinian
agreement on trade and economic cooperation.
	   The Palestinian leader is also expected to meet with Russian
Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Alexy II.
	   ``Russian-Palestinian talks assume a special meaning in the
light of the difficult situation in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Arafat's meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday made ``substantial
progress,'' according to Albright.
	   Palestinians were less optimistic, saying no agreements were
reached Wednesday except to continue talks in Washington on Oct.
15.

Tajik president, opposition leaders make progress in peace process
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president and the
country's main opposition leader met to discuss speeding up the
peace-process in the republic torn by violence, a presidential
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The meeting between President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition
leader Said Abdullo Nuri on Wednesday was ``fruitful and held in a
constructive atmosphere,'' said presidential spokesman Zafar
Saidov.
	   The two men discussed the investigation into the September
killing of a prominent opposition leader, as wells as solidifying
peace agreements in this poor, mountainous Central Asian country.
	   They also debated the peaceful disarmament of independent bands
of gunmen, who periodically launch attacks outside Dushanbe. A
deadline for them to turn over their weapons expired Wednesday, but
many have not done so.
	   Outbreaks of violence between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition still occur periodically in Tajikistan,
despite a peace agreement last year that ended five years of civil
war.

Palestinian strike, clashes in Hebron to protest Israeli blockade

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers, injuring four, including a
news photographer who was in serious condition after being struck
in the head.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade on
Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in force, confining
30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes erupted Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt. Several Palestinian news
photographers and cameramen moved closer to film those injured when
troops fired more rubber bullets. Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse news agency, was struck
in the forehead and was taken to a nearby hospital.
	   Doctors said Abu Alan was in serious condition.
	   Throughout Hebron, shops, restaurants and schools were closed in
observance of a general strike called by Palestinian Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement to protest the closure and curfew.
	   The restrictions had been imposed Sept. 30 after two dozen
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured by two hand
grenades thrown by a man who apparently escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   Several dozen Palestinians wearing black ski masks staged a
march in the Palestinian-run area of Hebron Thursday morning,
chanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great'' and ``We don't want
to see settlers in the city.''
	   About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in downtown
Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and protected by
large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

200 migrating geese perish after eat pesticides
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Some 200 geese migrating south from the
Danube Delta to Egypt died after eating crops treated with
pesticides, a government official said Thursday.
	   The birds flew from the Danube Delta in Romania to neighboring
Moldova and munched on corn in a field as they prepared for the
long journey.
	   Local farmers near the town of Taraclia found the dead geese
next to a lake and alerted the police, said Mihai Alexei, head of
the government ecological department.
	   Before authorities arrived, some farmers took some of the birds
and sold them at the market. Goose in white sauce is a local
speciality.
	   There were no reports of any people falling sick from eating the
birds, doctors in the region said.
	   Every year thousands of wild geese migrate south from the Danube
Delta, a massive nature reserve, to the Nile River region in Egypt.

Russian official: IMF remains `wary,' holds off on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov's comments in new grafs 9-10, ADDS
context. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund doesn't plan to
give Russia a new loan installment until the country implements an
economic reform program to deal with the current crisis, the
finance minister said Thursday.
	   ``They expect practical steps first,'' Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov said after returning from Washington, where he sought the
release of loans from the IMF and other international lenders.
	   ``If these steps help to stabilize the situation and are based
on free-market instruments, then they will receive understanding
and support,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government badly needs foreign loans
to help pay its many debts, including overdue wages owed to many
state workers. But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has
yet to finalize an economic plan to address the economic crisis
that hit in August.
	   Zadornov said that the government had already factored into its
fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 billion in loans that it hasn't yet
received from the IMF.
	   The IMF helped arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion international loan
package for Russia in July, but had disbursed only dlrs 4.7 billion
of that sum before the crisis hit in August, freezing further
installments.
	   The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia
is ``very wary,'' Zadornov added.
	   Primakov says he will continue with market reforms in Russia,
but a draft economic plan published by the Russian media last week
called for a number of Soviet-style administrative controls. The
prime minister said the plan was purely preliminary and only
contained proposals.
	   Speaking at the Cabinet session on Thursday, Primakov reiterated
that the government's top priority is to pay off wage and pension
debts, which sparked a day of nationwide demonstrations on
Wednesday.
	   ``We must draw lessons from that, since the people have mostly
been driven by the dissatisfaction with economic conditions,''
Primakov said. ``We must take economic steps to take the country
out of this difficult situation.''
	   The government has not set a date for announcing the new
economic plan, but one top official said Wednesday that it would be
ready by the end of the month.
	   The official, First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, has
also said that Russia will not be able to pay off its debts this
fall without help from the International Monetary Fund.
	   But Zadornov said that Russia doesn't link servicing its debt
with more foreign aid.
	   ``The government's political stance on the issue is that we must
pay off our external debt,'' he said.
	   In another development Thursday, the government said its foreign
currency reserves were at dlrs 12.8 billion as of Oct. 2, up from
dlrs 12.4 billion a week earlier.

Poet Laureate awarded Britain's largest poetry prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Poet Laureate Ted Hughes' critically acclaimed
``Birthday Letters,'' a volume of poems chronicling his courtship
and marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath, has won Britain's
largest poetry prize.
	   The anthology, a publishing sensation when it was launched
earlier this year, has earned the 10,000-pound (dlrs 16,900)
Forward poetry prize.
	   ``My book 'Birthday Letters' is a gathering of the occasions _
written with no plan over about 25 years _ in which I tried to open
a direct, private, inner contact with my first wife, not thinking
to make a poem, thinking mainly to evoke her presence to myself and
to feel her there listening,'' the poet said in a statement
Thursday night. He did not attend the awards ceremony.
	   Plath committed suicide in 1963 by gassing herself in an oven
after Hughes left her for another woman. Hughes was long vilified
by feminists on both sides of the Atlantic for driving his
30-year-old wife to her death and has refused to be interviewed
about the poems.
	   ``Except for a handful, I never thought of publishing these
pieces until last year, when quite suddenly I realized I had to
publish them, no matter what the consequences,'' Hughes said.
	   Geordie Greig, literary editor of the Sunday Times and chairman
of the judges, called the book a work of ``timeless genius,'' and
one of finest sequences of poetry written this century.
	   ``Ted Hughes has produced poetry of a ``searing intensity and
searching illumination on love and loss,'' he said.
	   Hughes, 68, has been poet laureate since 1984. When ``Birthday
Letters'' made its debut, critics called it one of Hughes' best
works and said it placed him alongside Blake, Keats and Auden in
the poets' pantheon.
	   Other collections shortlisted for the Forward prize were from
Anne Carson, Gwyneth Lewis, Derek Mahon and Glyn Maxwell.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
arrived in Damascus Thursday to join in efforts to mediate the
escalating dispute between Turkey and Syria.
	   Kharrazi headed immediately to the Foreign Ministry to meet his
Syrian counterpart, Farouq al-Sharaa.
	   Kharrazi is expected to fly to Turkey later Thursday for talks
with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Turkish officials said.
	   Iran is currently head of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, a 55-member group that includes Syria and Turkey.
	   ``The Islamic Republic of Iran, as head of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference, will make practical efforts to end the
rising tension between Turkey and Syria,'' the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported. The report was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and received in Cairo.
	   Turkey has demanded that Syria end support for Turkish Kurdish
rebels or ``face the consequences.''
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels.
	   Turkey ``hopes that the tension with the Syrian regime can be
solved through diplomatic channels,'' Haldun Otman, deputy
spokesman for the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in Ankara Thursday.
	   On Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between
Syria and Turkey in an attempt to reduce tensions.

Investigators killed in droves probing rightist paramilitary

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ They take on the most dangerous
assignment in a dangerous land, seeking evidence against right-wing
paramilitary squads linked to Colombia's drug traffickers and the
army. They pack only .38-caliber revolvers in a land of Uzis.
Often, they die.
	   In the last year and a half, 35 agents from the investigative
division of the federal chief prosecutor's office have been killed.
They are victims of what the unit's director calls ``an offensive''
by landowner-backed militias who want to stop a probe of their
expanding criminal enterprises.
	   ``We know we're paying a high price in blood, but we have a duty
to press on,'' a grim-faced Pablo Elias Gonzalez said in an
interview after attending a mass for two slain agents.
	   The 2,000 investigators from the CTI division work with
prosecutors on sensitive and groundbreaking probes into many of
Colombia's most violent criminals.
	   Just surviving is considered a good day at the office.
	   ``Sometimes when I return (to Bogota headquarters) they ask me
how it went. Great, I tell them ... because I made it back,'' said
a 31-year-old agent who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   He gets paid about dlrs 750 a month to go out and comb the
lawless Colombian countryside for evidence that could put
paramilitary leaders behind bars. In the field, all he's got to
protect him are a pistol and a trusted partner.
	   Still, he sees a purpose to the risks he takes in a country
where 90 percent of violent crimes go unsolved.
	   ``We all have to contribute some way,'' the agent said. ``If we
all just try to stay safe then surely our country's future will
never change.''
	   As if they needed reminding of the dangers they face, all CTI
employees were sent recently to have dental records taken _ in case
they're killed and there's no other way to recognize them.
	   The latest to die were agents Edilbrando Roa and Jhon Alejandro
Morales, who were investigating the massacre of 16 people by
suspected paramilitary gunmen in Sonson, a mountain hamlet in the
state of Antioquia, 110 miles (177 kilometers) northwest of Bogota.
Abducted Sept. 3 at a roadblock outside town, the investigators
were found with two pistol shots each to the head.
	   Roa and Morales were hoping a witness might link a top commander
of the feared militias _ who are funded by drug traffickers and
landowners to battle guerrillas _ to members of the Colombian
military and police.
	   ``Whenever you touch that triangle of alliances, things get
really ugly in Colombia,'' said Robin Kirk, a Colombia specialist
with U.S-based Human Rights Watch/Americas.
	   Kirk said the chief prosecutor, Alfonso Gomez Mendez, and those
working under him have been the exception in a government that has
generally failed to take on the militias.
	   ``The risks people are taking are enormous,'' said Kirk. ``The
threats are real and they are carried out with a ruthlessness
that's astonishing.''
	   In the militias' most brazen act of retaliation, paramilitary
gunmen last October ambushed a government convoy in southern Meta
state, killing 11 officials including three CTI investigators and
six army escorts who were out to seize drug traffickers' property.
	   Founded as hired guns by drug lords nearly two decades ago, the
paramilitary groups have become a force unto themselves, with about
7,000 men in all. They formed an organization last year and
demanded a role in peace talks to end Colombia's nearly
four-decade-old civil war.
	   The militias have targeted civilians they suspect of ties with
leftist rebels, and are blamed for numerous massacres. They have
also taken over valuable land and contraband routes that had been
controlled until recently by the rebels.
	   So far, investigations against the groups have yielded only
convictions of low-level army and militia members. But prosecutors
say they've captured 100 paramilitary members this year, and are
building cases against major figures, including army generals,
Colombia's top paramilitary boss Carlos Castano and the country's
veteran guerilla leaders.
	   Colombian authorities have linked Castano to rural massacres and
to the 1997 murders of two human rights workers in their Bogota
apartment. U.S. officials say he is one of Colombia's top 10 drug
traffickers.
	   Investigators' biggest score to date was the arrest in February
of emerald baron and suspected paramilitary boss Victor Carranza.
	   CTI investigators played a key role, tracking down Carranza at
his ranch near Bogota and _ fearing a tip off by corrupt officers _
moving in without advising the police or army.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices plunged as steeply Thursday
as they had gained the previous day, as investors began to question
government plans to rescue ailing banks. The U.S. dollar tumbled
against the yen for the third consecutive day.
	   Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
closed at 13,026.06, down 5.78 percent, or 799.55 points. On
Wednesday, it had gained 6.17 percent, or 803.97 points _ its
second-largest points gain this year.
	   Thursday's slide in the Nikkei was the largest single-day points
fall since 846.75 points last Dec. 19.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 122.36 yen, down 5.82 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
120.25 yen overnight. The dollar now has fallen a total of 13.40
yen in three days in Tokyo.
	   Wednesday's surge by the Nikkei was spurred by optimism that
Japan will fix its fragile banking system and spend more money to
lift its slumping economy.
	   But Thursday's plunge came when many stock investors came to
question how effective the plan will be, said Fumikazu Onishi, a
strategist with Nikko Securities.
	   ``People began to question how effective the proposed steps will
be when implemented, though they contain stricter disclosure
requirements for banks and other measures better than now,'' Onishi
said.
	   Onishi said the wild fluctuations in recent yen-dollar exchange
rates also dealt a big blow to Japanese exporting companies,
dampening overall sentiment.
	   Media reports say legislation designed to strengthen the
nation's ailing banks is expected to pass the upper house and
become law by the end of the current parliamentary session Oct. 16.
The powerful lower house passed the legislation last Friday.
	   Export-oriented issues, including auto and high-technology
shares, were losers after the yen's dive to near 120 yen against
the dollar. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in
dollar terms abroad.
	   Among losing blue chips was Sony, which dropped 8.7 percent, or
780 yen (dlrs 6.40), closing at 8,150 yen (dlrs 66.80). Shares of
Toyota Motor closed at 2,800 yen (dlrs 22.90), down 310 yen (dlrs
2.50), or 9.97 percent.
	   Trading was fairly heavy, with an estimated 527 million shares
changing hands on the first section, compared with Wednesday's
turnover of 631 million. Declines outnumbered advances 971 to 210,
with 111 issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section shed 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, to 1,001.50. On
Wednesday, it had gained 50.03 points, or 5.00 percent.
	   The decline in Tokyo followed another volatile session overnight
on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average closed down
1.29 points at 7,741.69 Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, concern about U.S. markets, fears that the U.S.
economy could slow more quickly than previously thought and
increasing prospects that Japan's bank recapitalization bills may
be passed soon were among negative factors for the dollar, traders
said.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds continued their selling while Japanese
institutional investors bought dollars on dips, but all of them
were afraid of betting on one direction,'' said Katsuaki Tanaka,
trader at Nippon Credit Bank.
	   Covering of oversold dollar positions nudged the dollar higher
than its overnight New York level, traders said.
	   On Wednesday, the dollar plunged 8 percent against the yen, its
largest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter-century.
	   The dollar ranged between 120.25 yen and 123.50 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.780 percent from Wednesday's close of 0.770 percent,
driving its price down to 109.13 yen from 109.28 yen.

Blair defends better British-Chinese relations as necessary

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Thursday defended the closer relations he has engineered with
China, saying Britain cannot afford to ignore the world's new
rising power.
	   Leaving Beijing and his political parlays with Chinese leaders,
Blair brought a group of British business executives to Shanghai to
champion Britain's commercial interests in China's high-rise
financial capital.
	   Britain and China announced a ``comprehensive partnership'' at
the outset of Blair's five-day visit, the first by a British prime
minister in seven years. In talks Tuesday and Wednesday, Blair and
China's president and premier declared the rancor of much of the
1990s behind them following Britain's smooth handover of Hong Kong
15 months ago.
	   In keeping with the now officially warm ties, Shanghai Mayor Xu
Kuangdi said aides to President Jiang Zemin called him Thursday
morning to make sure Blair would be well taken care of.
	   Greeting Blair, Xu gushed nostalgic about his brief stint as a
student in Britain in the 1980s.
	   ``When I hear that proper British English, not American-style
English, I get a special, warm feeling in my heart,'' Xu told the
prime minister.
	   ``We can have no better advertisement than from you,'' Blair
said.
	   Remembering his own visit to Shanghai 10 years ago, Blair
marveled at the skyline now transformed by skyscrapers: ``I can't
believe it. It's amazing.''
	   The amicable atmosphere contrasted with awkward moments in
Beijing Wednesday. Police hauled away for questioning one of
China's most prominent dissidents, pushing human rights back on
Blair's agenda. British television crews dogged Blair about Xu
Wenli, and Blair brought the case up with President Jiang, the only
individual case he raised in two days of talks.
	   On Thursday, Blair said the increasingly interconnected world
economy made closer ties with China a necessity.
	   ``What we've learned, whether its dealing with issues like
Kosovo or Iraq or this financial crisis in Asia, is that the world
needs China. We need China to be engaged,'' Blair told British
television networks while flying from Beijing to Shanghai. He noted
that by not devaluing its currency, China kept the Asian financial
crisis from worsening.
	   ``For Britain to be a friend of China, to be closely engaged in
China, that matters to us. It matters because of China's position
economically, but it matters because China is one of the big powers
in the world and will be even more so,'' Blair said.
	   The more than dlrs 800 million in contracts British businesses
signed during his visit mean thousands of jobs back home, and
China's market is growing, Blair said. He added: ``I want Britain
to be China's No. 1 friend in Europe.''
	   While in Shanghai, the prime minister cut the ribbon for a
British factory making industrial valves and opened the offices of
Royal Sun Alliance, the first British insurer granted a business
license in China. He also stopped by Shanghai's stock exchange and
attended a British trade and food exhibition.
	   Blair was to head for Hong Kong on Friday to check on the
progress the former British colony has made since the July 1, 1997,
handover.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers, injuring four people,
including a news photographer who was in serious condition after
being struck in the head.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade on
Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in force, confining
30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes erupted Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt. Several Palestinian news
photographers and cameramen moved closer to film those injured when
troops fired more rubber bullets. Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse news agency, was struck
in the forehead and taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors said
he was in serious condition.
	   Throughout Hebron, shops, restaurants and schools were closed in
observance of a general strike called by Palestinian Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement to protest the closure and curfew.
	   The restrictions were imposed Sept. 30 after two dozen Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured by two hand
grenades thrown by a man who apparently escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   Several dozen Palestinians wearing black ski masks staged a
march in the Palestinian-run area of Hebron Thursday morning,
chanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great'' and ``We don't want
to see settlers in the city.''
	   About 450 Jewish settlers live in a number of enclaves in
downtown Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and
protected by large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

Has the shooting stopped? It's hard to verify
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government says the fighting has
stopped in Kosovo. But the ethnic Albanians driven into the hills
from this village 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, say otherwise.
	   The shelling and shooting comes morning and evening, they say.
Serb police maintain a heavy presence throughout the area. Their
main purpose appears to be to intimidate the refugees and prevent
them from returning to their homes.
	   Police, on the other hand, claim it is the Kosovo Liberation
Army, loosely organized bands of ethnic Albanian guerrillas
fighting for independence, that is shooting at them, keeping the
situation tense in the area of the government's most recent
offensive.
	   Hundreds of people have died in seven months of open conflict in
this largely Albanian province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's brutal crackdown on
ethnic Albanians seeking independence has driven many here into the
rebel ranks.
	   ``We will die here in the mountains,'' said Refki Pacarizi, 21,
an electronics student who returned to his home here and has been
unable to get back to Pristinia to continue his studies. ``When we
have no more food, and nothing on which to live, we will die. To be
alive is sweet.''
	   The KLA is here too, just a short distance from those police
armored vehicles. They slip unobtrusively by, packed into a tired
Toyota, rocket-launcher balanced on a camouflage-clad knee, or
stand talking quietly to a friend or relative in the village.
	   It is certainly possible that KLA fighters have attacked Serbian
police, as they say. Nothing, however, is verifiable first hand.
	   ``As long as foreign observers or the press is here, the police
do nothing,'' said Lulzim Pacarizi, who is also the local
representative of the ethnic Albanian Human Rights Council. ``As
soon as you leave, they will start shooting again. When they see
you pass Malisevo, they will radio.''
	   The main road through the region is ghostly. Villages are shot
up and empty. The vineyards along the highway go untended. Turn
down a dirt road and travel a few kilometers into the hills,
however, and the dusty track is teeming with thrashed out cars,
horse carts and pedestrians.
	   Farmers are still trying to bring in some corn. A makeshift
market on a hillside sells tomatoes, peppers, some cabbages,
matches, fuel in plastic containers and other odd bits of goods
needed by people condemned to live with nature, or crowded into
undamaged buildings.
	   Dragobil is empty, but some of the men come every day to check
their houses and assess the situation. A resident grabs a visitor's
shoulder and indicates two new holes in his house, blasted that
very morning, he says.
	   Two families tried to come back recently. When two men tried to
put some animals into a meadow, they were seized and shot, said
Lulzim Pacarizi.
	   Seventeen of the surrounding villages are empty. Thousands of
their former inhabitants are living in the hills.
	   Gjevgjet Hoxha walked into one of the makeshift camps of plastic
shelters in Pagarusa, about five kilometers from Dragobil. He is
from nearby Maralia and says he just spent the morning in the
basement of his house to escape Serb police shooting.
	   ``This has been going on for more than a week,'' he said.
	   Hoxha and the refugees here know the police armored vehicles are
just a few kilometers away and are waiting for the fighting to
spread to the fields.
	   An old woman tugged on her cream-colored headscarf and asked
rhetorically: ``How long can we hold out? How can we know? As long
as the weather is good.
	   ``We will not go back until we see the NATO troops. We could go
back now, but they would just massacre us like they did in Obrinje.
For now, we have our tea to keep us warm.''
	   A small waterfall spills over a dam built across a creek at the
foot of the camp. Despite the grimness of life here, the shouts and
occasional laughter of children still split the air, a small slice
normality in a sea of lives pulled up by the roots.
	   Zahrije Hoxha, kneaded bread dough as she squatted on the
ground. ``If we survive, we can go back and start over again,'' she
said. ``But as far as I know, we're not going back.''

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian Foreign Minister arriving in Belgrade, US
and British diplomats packing, no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff rolled out of Belgrade on Thursday, while Washington
tries to rally support for airstrikes unless Slobodan Milosevic
bows to international demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   The international pressure is expected to intensify following
three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke. The U.S. envoy will brief Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and NATO officials Thursday in Brussels, Belgium
on the results of those talks.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a meeting of the so-called
Contact Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes use force to resolve the crisis, and
Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright
in London.
	   In the Yugoslav capital, about 20 vehicles carrying diplomats
and their families from the United States, Britain and Australia
left for the Hungarian capital Budapest, where they will remain
until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to force
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   ``It's clearly a matter of great concern when the international
community feels it has got to the stage where it has to use the
threat of force as a back-up to its attempts to achieve a political
solution,'' British Ambassador Brian Donnelly told British domestic
radio.
	   ``And I think we all regret that matters have come to the stage
they have as a result of the policies which Mr. Milosevic has
pursued in recent weeks and months.''
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
international demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb
troops, and the return of refugees to their villages, Washington
lacks the international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into
compliance.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence. Milosevic launched his
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people have
been driven from their homes.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences in estimating the situation in Kosovo, which have
emerged in some parts of the international community despite the
facts on the ground.''
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
Milosevic has claimed to have fulfilled international demands.
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbian government ordered Wednesday independent media to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs or face prosecution.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors of independent Serbian media Wednesday, according to
Beta news agency. ``This is not an appeal. This is an order.''

Independent media to obey government order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Citing security reasons, an
association of Serbia's independent media on Thursday called on its
members to obey a government order not to broadcast foreign media
programs.
	   The Association of Independent Electronic Media, an umbrella
organization for most local radio and television stations in
Serbia, said the government ban presented ``the gravest form of
state censorship and direct meddling in editorial policies.''
	   Serbian government officials on Wednesday told the editors of
the independent media to stop airing Serbian-language programs by
Voice of America, BBC, Deuche Welle and Radio Free Europe or face
prosecution. The officials said an official ban will follow.
	   But ANEM said its member stations and their reporters have
received a number of threats of ``retaliation and lynch,'' and
therefore the government order should be obeyed for 48 hours. If
the government does not issue an official decree banning the
broadcast it would resume after 48 hours, ANEM said.
	   ANEM said the government decision was ``illegal.'' The
organization added it would counter it by doing its work
professionally in Serbia.
	   ANEM has warned that the government could use the public fear of
NATO intervention to clampdown on its opponents at home.

Exiles return home to Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Five leading Nigerian political exiles
returned home from Britain and offered to join ongoing efforts at
national reconciliation, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The five dissidents arrived late Wednesday in Nigeria's
commercial capital, Lagos, the Vanguard reported.
	   Among the returnees were Odige Oyegun, the former civilian
governor of the mid-western state of Edo and his former deputy
Peter Obadan.
	   Former Senator Bola Tinubu, retired air force Gen. Dan Suleiman
and political reform campaigner Tokunboh Afikuyomi also returned
with the group.
	   Missing among their ranks was Nigeria's Nobel laureate Wole
Soyinka. Many believe Soyinka, Nigeria's most influential and best
known exile, will return to his country before long.
	   A growing number of government opponents and critics who had
been in self-imposed exile for fear of persecution at home have
been returning to Nigeria since the death in June of dictator Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   The group of five exiles who returned Wednesday demanded the
withdrawal of a state decree offering virtually unchecked reach for
the government to detain people at will.
	   In a joint statement, they also called for a public inquiry into
Abacha's family fortune, which it is widely believed he amassed by
skimming away public funds.
	   Abacha's successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has introduced
sweeping reforms, released many key political prisoners and
promised elections next year to hand power over to a civilian
government.
	   He has also called on the legions of Nigerian exiles to come
home and help rebuild their country.

Cabinet hardliners warn Netanyahu against concessions to Arafat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hardliners on Thursday threatened to
topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he makes concessions to
the Palestinians in a Mideast summit in Washington next week.
	   Opponents to an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank have
enough seats in the 120-member parliament to rob Netanyahu's
coalition of its majority and force new elections.
	   However, by ousting Netanyahu, the hardliners would risk
bringing a more dovish government to power and it was not clear
whether they would go through with their threats.
	   The most vehement opponent to a troop withdrawal is the National
Religious Party, which represents the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has nine seats in parliament.
	   Netanyahu was to meet later Thursday with NRP leaders.
	   Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom of the NRP demanded that
Netanyahu coordinate his negotiating positions with the party
before the Oct. 15 summit in Washington.
	   ``Together, we will determine the red lines,'' Yahalom told
Israel radio. ``If he (Netanyahu) returns from the United States
having his positions eroded, the NRP cannot be a partner (in the
government).''
	   NRP legislator Hanan Porat said that if Netanyahu concludes an
agreement on a troop withdrawal, he will set in motion preparations
for early elections.
	   Porat is chairman of parliament's Law Committee and has the
power to determine the fate of an opposition bill to disperse
parliament and hold early elections. The bill passed a preliminary
reading before parliament went into summer recess.
	   Porat told Israel TV that he would set a date for a first
reading of the bill should Netanyahu return from Washington with an
agreement on a troop pullback. Parliament begins its winter session
Oct. 19.
	   The new threats by hardliners in Netanyahu's coalition came
after the prime minister held three-way talks Wednesday in Gaza
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright said after the meeting that substantial progress was
made and that she hoped the remaining issues could be resolved in
the Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would
dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising fears among
Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would come under
intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday briefed his so-called ``kitchen Cabinet''
_ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Infrastructures Minister
Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky _ on the talks with
Albright and Arafat. The three ministers are expected to accompany
Netanyahu to Washington.

Tung address receives mixed review in Hong Kong

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Rejecting criticism that his policy address
offered too little, Hong Kong's chief executive said Thursday his
government already had launched measures to ease the hardships of
economic recession and would continue to do so.
	   ``People have said, `Well, you said very little in the policy
speech.' Well you can't wait for the policy speech to do all these
things,'' Tung Chee-hwa told a group of business leaders. ``You
have to do it when it's necessary, when it's proper.''
	   Polls and editorials Thursday indicated that many in Hong Kong
were dissatisfied with Tung's address of Wednesday. Critics said
that while it set an ambitious blueprint for long-term economic
development, it offered no quick fixes to ease immediate pain.
	   Tung laid out detailed plans to diversify Hong Kong's economic
base and pledged special funding for high-tech industries, which he
sees as Hong Kong's future.
	   But he did not offer any new measures to ease growing
unemployment and improve social welfare, and many activists say
that most grassroots citizens will not benefit from development in
the high-tech sector.
	   ``What has he said in his policy speech to make them feel
better? People do not see an effective leader in Mr. Tung,''
lawmaker Martin Lee of the Democrats, Hong Kong's leading
opposition party, told reporters.
	   Officials have said the economic situation will likely worsen in
the coming months. Unemployment already is at a 15-year high and
the economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this year.
	   Speaking to legislators in a special briefing, Tung said Hong
Kong people must tighten their belts before his economic
development plans bear fruit.
	   ``The economy has to rebound before we can solve the
unemployment problem,'' he said.
	   He said it is not the government's policy to set salary levels
or set up unemployment welfare programs, which unionists have long
advocated.
	   A well-known activist, Leung Kwok-hung, interrupted Tung at the
briefing, chanting: ``Shame. Set up unemployment insurance.''
Security guards later dragged him from the legislative chamber.
	   About 30 Democrats also staged an overnight sit-in to protest
Tung's blueprint.
	   Hong Kong University said that in a poll it conducted, 38.2
percent of the 469 respondents said they were dissatisfied with the
address, compared with 23.5 percent who were satisfied.
	   ``You care too much about the interests of property developers.
Have you forgotten the pains of average citizens?'' a caller
surnamed Siu told Tung on a phone-in program on the
government-owned Radio Hong Kong.
	   The property sector generally welcomed Tung's address. On the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the property sub-index gained 8.3
percent, while the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed 2.5 percent
higher.
	   ``The government seems to be supporting the market even though
there were no new specific measures like last year,'' said Vincent
Cheung, an equity sales manager at Sassoon Securities.
	   Tung said Wednesday his priority was to stabilize property
prices, but he fell short of scrapping a long-term goal of
providing 85,000 new housing units a year, a target widely blamed
for the property slump.
	   Meanwhile, most newspapers were unimpressed by the address. The
South China Morning Post said: ``The government is still not ready
to face up to the full consequences of the recession on public
spending.''

China says expelled Japanese journalist stole secrets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China claimed Thursday that a Japanese journalist
it expelled stole and paid for state secrets.
	   Yukihisa Nakatsu, 39, a correspondent for the Yomiuri, Japan's
largest-circulation daily, ``made a confession on these illegal
activities'' before he was expelled, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said.
	   Nakatsu returned home Tuesday. The managing editor of his paper,
Shoichi Oikawa, has defended him, saying he was confident Nakatsu
engaged in ethical and proper reporting.
	   In a letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the New York-based
Committee to Protect Journalists said it was ``deeply disturbed''
about China's treatment of Nakatsu.
	   Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based press freedom group,
noted that the expulsion followed China's signature Monday of a key
U.N. human rights treaty that guarantees freedom of expression.
	   Chinese authorities questioned Nakatsu three times after he
returned from Tibet last month, and also searched his home and
demanded to know where he obtained certain documents they found,
according to his newspaper.
	   Nakatsu, who refused to tell Chinese authorities the source of
the documents, was ordered Sunday to leave China within three days.
	   Neither side has said what the documents contained.

Death toll revised downward to 213 in Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: in 5th graf, CORRECTS dollar amount to dlrs 1,666 &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The death toll in the Aug. 7 bombing of
the U.S. Embassy has been revised downward to 213, including 12
Americans, the head of the Bomb Blast National Funeral Committee
said Thursday.
	   Erastus Mwongera said the difference between 248 _ the most
recent official figure of deaths due to the bombing _ and 213 was
due to duplication in counting the bodies of some of the victims.
	   He said following the blast at the embassy in a heavily
congested area of downtown Nairobi, all bodies were initially taken
to the mortuary run by the city.
	   ``But families with means then found the bodies of their
relatives and took them to other, private mortuaries where they
were counted again,'' Mwongera said.
	   He said the errors became evident as the committee administering
the national disaster relief fund came across duplicated names when
it was preparing 100,000 shilling payments (dlrs 1,666) to
next-of-kin.
	   As of Oct. 5, the fund, which is managed by a committee of
leading Kenyan citizens, had collected 228 million shillings (dlrs
3.8 million).
	   Committee chairman Charles Njonjo has said some of the remaining
funds will be used to defray medical and rehabilitation costs for
those injured in the blast. Initial reports said more than 5,000
people were injured, most of them by flying glass and debris. It is
believed several hundred suffered long-term disabilities, including
blindness.
	   A nearly simultaneous blast at the U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania killed 11 people, all Africans, and injured
another 70.
	   On Wednesday, a U.S. federal district court in Manhattan
indicted four suspects in the Nairobi bombing.
	   The 48-page indictment, which supersedes previous court papers
filed in the case, marked the first time authorities have linked
the suspects in one terror plot; until Wednesday, they had been
charged separately.
	   And unlike previous indictments, it charges three of the
suspects with more than 200 counts of murder of Kenyans, Americans
and Tanzanians _ one for ``each and every victim of the embassy
bombings,'' U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said in a statement.
	   Named in the latest indictment were four alleged followers of
Saudi exile Osama bin Laden: Mohamed Sadeek Odeh, Mohamed Rashed
Daoud Al-'Owhali, Haroun Fazil and Wadih El Hage, a U.S. citizen.
	   Fazil is a fugitive, and El Hage is charged with lying to a
grand jury and the FBI about his ties to bin Laden but not with
murder.
	   A magistrate's court in Dar es Salaam has charged Tanzanian
Rashid Saleh Hemed and Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed with 11
counts of murder in the embassy bombing there.

Taiwan's exports tumble in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hurt by the regional financial crisis,
Taiwan's exports fell 12 percent to U.S. dlrs 9.51 billion in
September, the government reported Thursday.
	   The trade surplus, however, fell just 2 percent, to dlrs 1.09
billion, as imports dropped 13 percent to dlrs 8.41 billion, a
Finance Ministry report said.
	   For the year's first nine months, the surplus was dlrs 4.69
billion, a 14 percent decline from January-September last year, it
added.
	   For the nine months, exports fell 8 percent to dlrs 89.77
billion and imports fell 7.6 percent to dlrs 77.85 percent.
	   Taiwan, with its good economic fundamentals, has escaped the
regional financial crisis largely unscathed, but is feeling the
impact more as the crisis expands to other parts of the world.
	   But officials said the U.S. dollar's recent fall may spur
Taiwan's trade growth because the rising currency values in
neighboring countries may increase their buying power.
	   The effect could be felt in three months, said Hsu Kuo-chung, a
Finance Ministry official.
	   The regional crisis has led to declines in Taiwan's industrial
exports, while imports of industrial raw materials and consumer
goods also fell, Hsu said.
	   The trade surplus is expected to total only dlrs 4.8 billion
this year, compared to 1997's dlrs 7.66 billion, he said.
	   Following the U.S. dollar's dive in recent days, Taiwan's
Central Bank moved in Thursday to slow the local currency's surge
for fear it might hurt exports, traders said.
	   On Thursday, the Taiwan dollar was traded 32.967 to one U.S.
dollar, its highest level in six months, up from Wednesday's
33.346.
	   The local currency's strength also boosted confidence in the
stock market, whose benchmark index gained 4.42 percent Thursday,
closing at 6,970.23 points.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian Foreign Minister arriving in Belgrade,
U.S. and British diplomats packing, no pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff and their families rolled out of Belgrade Thursday,
while Washington tried to rally support for airstrikes unless
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bowed to international
demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   The international pressure was expected to intensify following
three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke. The U.S. envoy was to brief Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and NATO officials Thursday in Brussels,
Belgium, on the results of those talks.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to London for a meeting of the so-called Contact
Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes the use of force to resolve the crisis,
and Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets
Albright in London.
	   In the Yugoslav capital, about 20 vehicles carrying diplomats
and their families from the United States, Britain and Australia
left for the Hungarian capital Budapest, where they will remain
until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to force
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists in Kosovo.
	   ``It's clearly a matter of great concern when the international
community feels it has got to the stage where it has to use the
threat of force as a back-up to its attempts to achieve a political
solution,'' British Ambassador Brian Donnelly told British radio.
	   ``And I think we all regret that matters have come to the stage
they have as a result of the policies which Mr. Milosevic has
pursued in recent weeks and months.''
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
international demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb
troops, and the return of ethnic Albanian refugees to their
villages, Washington lacks the international consensus needed to
bomb the Serbs into compliance.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence. Milosevic launched his
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people have
been driven from their homes.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences in estimating the situation in Kosovo, which have
emerged in some parts of the international community despite the
facts on the ground.''
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
Milosevic has claimed to have fulfilled international demands.
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to a war footing. It ordered government departments
to increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing the locations of 46 main Belgrade
underground shelters were published in newspapers, including
instructions on ``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents. The
Serbian government on Wednesday ordered independent media to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs or face prosecution.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors of independent Serbian media Wednesday, according to
the Beta news agency. ``This is not an appeal. This is an order.''

Thai Muslim organizations demand justice for Malaysia's Anwar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Representatives of Thailand's Muslim
community visited Malaysia's embassy Thursday to call for the
release of detained former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and
his supporters.
	   In an open letter to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad,
three Thai Muslim organizations said the law under which they are
being held is unjust.
	   The Muslim Law Society, the Muslim Institute for Consumer
Protection and the Young Muslim Association of Thailand said they
doubted whether the sacked deputy prime minister and his supporters
would get a fair trial. The Young Muslim Association has close ties
to a Muslim youth group in Malaysia founded by Anwar in 1971.
	   The groups denounced Malaysia's Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite imprisonment without trial. They called it the
``primary cause of injustice and an excuse of limitless power used
by the government.''
	   ``Anwar probably will have no chance to defend himself as would
be provided in other, civilized countries,'' the letter said.
	   Anwar was arrested under the Internal Security Act on Sept. 20,
two weeks after he began staging rallies around Malaysia calling
for Mahathir's resignation and government reforms.
	   He was later charged with 10 counts of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts.
	   Anwar denied the charges, saying he was ousted because he posed
a challenge to Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   His trial is scheduled to begin Nov. 2.
	   About 20 people showed up at the embassy to deliver the letter.
	   There have been rallies in Thailand's southern provinces in
support of Anwar. Thailand's southernmost provinces, bordering
Malaysia, have predominantly Muslim populations, while the rest of
the country's population is mostly Buddhist.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff rolled out of Belgrade on Thursday, while Washington
tries to rally support for airstrikes unless Slobodan Milosevic
bows to international demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   The international pressure is expected to intensify following
three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke. The U.S. envoy will brief Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and NATO officials Thursday in Brussels, Belgium
on the results of those talks.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a meeting of the so-called
Contact Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes use force to resolve the crisis, and
Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright
in London.
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Milosevic was engaging in ``brinksmanship'' because he ``has
not been given a strong enough message.''
	   ``I hope the international community lives up to its
responsibility to send President Milosevic a united and strong
message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying on,'' Blair
said.

British official praises Indonesia, promises a helping hand

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A British official met Thursday with
President B.J. Habibie and praised him for releasing political
prisoners and planning a democratic election.
	   British Deputy Foreign Minister Derek John Fatchett also
discussed with Habibie the brutal effect that the Asian financial
crisis is having on Indonesia's economy.
	   ``I offered the United Kingdom's assistance toward the process
of developing its free and fair election,'' Fatchett said after
meeting with Habibie and his foreign minister, Ali Alatas.
	   Fatchett did not elaborate, but Alatas said Britain is willing
to supply the kind of technical assistance that the United Nations
Development Program will provide during the election next year.
	   Fatchett, who arrived in Jakarta Wednesday for a two-day visit
as the personal emissary of British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
praised Habibie for releasing dozens of political prisoners.
	   ``I welcome the changes that have taken place since May in
Indonesia _ the release of political prisoners, the movement toward
election, and the great freedom that exists,'' Fatchett said.
	   Habibie took power after Suharto, Indonesia's authoritarian
president, resigned May 21 in the face of widespread and violent
pro-democracy protests. Habibie promised greater democratic
freedoms for Indonesians, and scheduled a general election in May
1999 under new, more democratic electoral laws.
	   Fatchett said Britain will continue to be a partner with
Indonesia in economic development.
	   ``I told President Habibie that British business people will be
visiting Indonesia next month,'' he said.

Cabinet hard-liners warn Netanyahu against concessions to Arafat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hard-liners on Thursday threatened to
topple Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he makes concessions to
the Palestinians at a Mideast summit in Washington next week.
	   Opponents of an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank have
enough seats in the 120-member parliament to strip Netanyahu's
coalition of its majority and force new elections.
	   However, by ousting Netanyahu, the hard-liners would risk
bringing a more dovish government to power and it was not clear
whether they would go through with their threats.
	   The most vehement opponent of a troop withdrawal is the National
Religious Party, which represents the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has nine seats in parliament.
	   Netanyahu was to meet later Thursday with NRP leaders.
	   Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom of the NRP demanded that
Netanyahu coordinate his negotiating positions with the party
before the Oct. 15 summit in Washington.
	   ``Together, we will determine the red lines,'' Yahalom told
Israel radio. ``If he (Netanyahu) returns from the United States
having his positions eroded, the NRP cannot be a partner (in the
government).''
	   NRP legislator Hanan Porat said that if Netanyahu concludes an
agreement on a troop withdrawal, he will set in motion preparations
for early elections.
	   Porat is chairman of parliament's Law Committee and has the
power to determine the fate of an opposition bill to disperse
parliament and hold early elections. The bill passed a preliminary
reading before parliament went into summer recess.
	   Porat told Israel TV that he would set a date for a first
reading of the bill should Netanyahu return from Washington with an
agreement on a troop pullback. Parliament begins its winter session
Oct. 19.
	   The new threats by hard-liners in Netanyahu's coalition came
after the prime minister held three-way talks Wednesday in Gaza
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright said after the meeting that substantial progress was
made and that she hoped the remaining issues could be resolved in
the Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would
dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising fears among
Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would come under
intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday briefed his so-called ``kitchen Cabinet''
_ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Infrastructures Minister
Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky _ on the talks with
Albright and Arafat. The three ministers are expected to accompany
Netanyahu to Washington.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinians, injuring four, including a news
photographer who was in serious condition after being struck in the
head.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade on
Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in force, confining
30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes erupted Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt. Several Palestinian news
photographers and cameramen moved closer to film those injured when
troops fired more rubber bullets. Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse news agency, was struck
in the back of the head and taken to a nearby hospital.
	   Doctors said Abu Alan was in serious condition and that he
underwent emergency surgery.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Having agreed on programs to fight
unemployment, Germany's Social Democrats and Greens discuss how to
pay for them on Thursday, when taxes take center stage in coalition
talks.
	   The two parties said bringing down Germany's double-digit
jobless rate was their top goal after Wednesday's session, but put
off debate over financing.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder insisted, however, that he
plans no major tax increases despite a huge budget gap he says he
is inheriting from the outgoing government.
	   ``We're not talking about tax hikes in this economic
situation,'' he said following Wednesday's talks. ``We're saying
that we especially want tax relief for workers _ and will do it.''
	   The environmentalist Greens are pushing for higher energy taxes,
arguing they would not only encourage conservation, but also spur
the economy through ``ecological innovation.''
	   Greens co-chairman Juergen Trittin said incremental rises in the
price of fossil fuels also would finance reductions in non-wage
labor costs, which the new government wants to help create jobs.
	   Schroeder, though, has ruled out any big jump in gasoline taxes,
which he says would hurt the auto industry. His party favors
closing tax loopholes and other measures aimed more at the rich.
	   Greens leader Joschka Fischer predicted a ``difficult'' session
Thursday.
	   Even some Social Democrats are urging Schroeder to go further.
Hermann Scheer, one of the party's environmental experts, called
Thursday for raising taxes on other energy sources, such as
electrical power, too.
	   Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter told the Berliner
Morgenpost newspaper that raising gasoline taxes would be
``sensible'' if annual car licensing taxes are lowered at the same
time.

Russia seizes five military helicopters headed to N. Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's customs service confiscated five military
helicopters being shipped to North Korea without the governments's
permission, a news agency reported Thursday.
	   The state-run armaments company Rosvooruzheniye said Thursday it
had nothing to do with the shipment, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The company said the Mi-8T helicopters were seized Wednesday at
the Khasan checkpoint, on Russia's border with North Korea, after
customs agents found they were being delivered without government
authorization.
	   According to ITAR-Tass, a private Russian company that owned the
helicopters, declared their value at dlrs 20,000 each, far below
the market price. The choppers had pods to carry weapons, the
report said.
	   Large quantities of military equipment have fallen into private
hands since the Soviet collapse.
	   The Soviet Union provided economic and military aid to North
Korea, but Moscow cut back bilateral ties since the Soviet
collapse.

Hong Kong shares rally on property gains, low interest rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices rallied Thursday,
boosted largely by a surge in property stocks while investors
shrugged off a plunge in Tokyo's stock market.
	   Investors snapped up property shares in reaction to low interest
rates and to government policies introduced Wednesday to help the
property industry, traders said.
	   The Hang Seng Index gained 194.79 points, or 2.5 percent,
closing at 7,939.51. The index had climbed 2.4 percent Wednesday.
	   The Hang Seng property sub-index surged 710.04 points, or 8.3
percent, closing at 9,248.86. Other sub-indices were far more
subdued, with the financial sub-index up just 22.84 points at
9,981.98.
	   Trading grew to 5.84 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 748
million) from 3.81 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 488
million) Wednesday.
	   ``The star was just the property shares,'' said Francis Wu at
South China Securities Ltd.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's pledge Wednesday to
stabilize the property market and to be flexible about his goals
for housing construction over the next few years helped boost
property shares, traders said.
	   Fairly low local interbank interest rates are giving some hope
that rates will fall later in the year, said Samson Chau, sales
director at BNP Prime Peregrine Asia Ltd.
	   ``The whole market gained because the yen strengthened and
pressure on (China's yuan) and the Hong Kong dollar peg will be
less,'' said Chong Leong, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd.
	   ``Speculation on a further rate cut, which will weaken the U.S.
dollar, will alleviate pressure on the Hong Kong dollar and the
(yuan),'' he said.
	   Among property shares, New World Development Co. gained 1.05
Hong Kong dollars to 11.75, Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. rose 2.80
to 37.60 and Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. rose 3.20 to 31.60.
	   Market heavyweight HSBC Holdings shed 1.50, closing at 136.50,
while its affiliate Hang Seng Bank gained 2.15 to 51.25. HSBC is
being hurt by worldwide fears of a banking crisis, said BNP's Chau.
	   Meanwhile, shares in Guangdong Investment plunged 11 Hong Kong
cents to 1.36 following the shutdown of its parent, which was
overburdened with debt, by the People's Bank of China on Tuesday.

France asks for U.N. meeting on Iraqi warheads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Thursday asked the U.N. Special
Commission to convene a meeting with chemical weapons experts to
determine the results of tests on Iraqi warheads.
	   The request came a day after news reports that French experts
had detected traces of nerve gas on Iraqi warheads, but that France
had withheld the findings because it didn't want to undermine
Baghdad's attempts to get U.N. sanctions lifted.
	   The French Foreign Ministry said it wasn't aware of the
findings.
	   But on Thursday, it issued a statement requesting that the
Special Commission hold a meeting at the United Nations in the next
few days, to permit Security Council members ``to appreciate the
scientific methods used by the three chosen laboratories (in
France, Switzerland and the United States) and the results
obtained, and the scientific conclusions to be drawn.''
	   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the request
came ``out of concern for clarification and the information of the
Security Council members.''
	   The New York Times reported Wednesday that testing on samples
from the weapons show evidence of chemicals linked to VX, a drop of
which on the skin, or inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes.
The newspaper cited unidentified weapons experts.
	   Iraq, which has been the subject of seven years of U.N. weapons
inspections, has admitted it tried to make VX but denied it was
ever able to make enough, or stabilize it sufficiently to load into
weapons.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War.
	   Swiss tests on warheads turned up negative. But a U.S. Army
laboratory concluded that missile fragments contained traces of the
gas.
	   Weapons experts told the Times that the French findings would
confirm the American tests.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Blair calling for ``strong message'' to
Milosevic. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff and their families rolled out of Belgrade Thursday,
while Washington tried to rally support for airstrikes unless
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bowed to international
demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   The international pressure was expected to intensify following
three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke. The U.S. envoy was to brief Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and NATO officials Thursday in Brussels,
Belgium, on the results of those talks.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to London for a meeting of the so-called Contact
Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain, France,
Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes the use of force to resolve the crisis,
and Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets
Albright in London.
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Milosevic was engaging in ``brinksmanship'' because he ``has
not been given a strong enough message.''
	   ``I hope the international community lives up to its
responsibility to send President Milosevic a united and strong
message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying on,'' Blair
said.

Lawyers file court order demanding Anwar's release

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for the prime minister's
former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went to court
Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite
detention.
	   Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told
reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas corpus appeal that
says the dissident politician is being unjustly held.
	   She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband,
and asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?''
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security
Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two
weeks of rallies around Malaysia at which he called for government
reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation.
	   Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, after he had differed with Mahathir
on policy for escaping economic recession. But the prime minister
said the deputy was fired because he was morally unfit. Anwar said
Mahathir viewed him as a threat.
	   Anwar since has been charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded
innocent to all the charges, which he says were trumped up by his
political enemies.
	   ``We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in
court,'' said one of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He said
the lawyers had asked the High Court for an early hearing on the
request for Anwar's release.
	   When Anwar appeared in court Monday, the judge had assured
defense attorneys that they would have access to their client so
that they could prepare their arguments for the trial.
	   Azizah said authorities have spurned all her requests for family
members to visit her husband on grounds that Anwar's case was still
under police investigation.
	   ``I pleaded with the police to allow the children to see their
father,'' she told reporters at the courthouse. ``I told them that
I don't have to see my husband. But please let my son go and see
him. But the police said no.''
	   Although Anwar remains in custody at the Bukit Aman federal
police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrested
under the ISA for participating in activities and rallies organized
by Anwar have been released.
	   Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International Islamic
University, was released Wednesday after 16 days in jail.
	   ``I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during my
involvement with the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,'' Sidek was
quoted as saying by The Star daily.
	   Despite the recent protests against him, Prime Minister Mahathir
said Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and
there have been no defections from the party, which claims a
membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million.
	   He ruled out an early election to prove his popularity. A
general election is not scheduled until 2000.
	   Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. ``There is no exodus from
the party.''
	   This week, Mahathir declined to name a replacement for Anwar,
who had been Malaysia's deputy prime minister since 1993.
	   The absence of a successor could lead to a power struggle in the
event Mahathir is forced to resign or dies, because there is no
clear line of succession.
	   Mahathir, 72, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1989.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ A boat carrying 141 people sank in a lake
in northeastern Spain Thursday, and at least seven French tourists
died, an emergency services official said.
	   The boat carrying tourists from La Rochelle, France, sank at
10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) in the Lake Banyoles near the city of Girona.
It was not yet known what caused the boat to sink, said a
spokeswoman for the local emergency services, who did not give her
name according to custom.

Gardermoen takes over as Norway's new main airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUG MELLGREN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The new Gardermoen facility took over as
Norway's international airport Thursday, after a massive all-night
move from Fornebu Airport on the outskirts of Oslo.
	   Although the 12.9-billion-kroner (dlrs 1.7 billion) airport has
been in limited use for three months, the first official flight, by
the small Color Air cut-price carrier, took off early Thursday
morning.
	   The opening of Gardermoen, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of the Norwegian capital, marks the end of an intense, three-decade
debate over where to build a new international airport for the
country.
	   Gardermoen has a capacity of 17 million passengers a year,
compared to the 11 million that had stretched Fornebu to the limit.
	   The new airport was the Norway's biggest construction project on
land, rivaled only by the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. Some
of Norway's offshore oil platforms cost more.
	   Norwegians celebrated Gardermoen, with its airy terminal and
heavy use of wood and natural stone inspired by Lillehammer's
Olympic venues, with a gala opening ceremony on Wednesday evening.
In a nationally televised performance, dancers with stylized
aircraft portrayed man's many attempts to fly.
	   At the ceremony, Norway's King Harald said, ``With some of the
same team spirit and goodwill of Lillehammer, I hope the demanding
breaking-in period will be a success.''
	   Early in its first day of operation, most of Gardermoen's
flights were on schedule.
	   However, there was little traffic. The Braathens airline, a key
domestic carrier, was grounded by a pilots strike, and other
airlines reduced traffic by 20 percent during the airport startup.
	   There were some headaches. A minor electrical fire stalled a
new, high speed train at the airport terminal. International
travelers late Wednesday waited up to an hour in immigration
control lines, causing tempers to flare.
	   But fears that road traffic would become hopelessly snarled were
unfounded, with traffic moving smoothly, if sometimes slowly, to
the airport.
	   Forenbu Airport on the outskirts of Oslo closed Wednesday
evening, sending off what everyone believed would be the airport's
last fight at 7:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) Wednesday with pomp and
ceremony.
	   But in the midst of hectic packing and hundreds of trucks moving
equipment to the new airport, a small plane buzzed the darkened
runways three hours after the airport closed. It was an ambulance
plane, bringing Cato Huseby, 73, to Oslo for treatment.
	   Air-traffic controllers, who expected the plane, switched on the
runway lights one last time, giving Huseby the unexpected honor of
being the last passenger to land at Fornebu, 59 years after it
opened.
	   ``I guess it hasn't hit me yet,'' Husby was quoted as telling
the Dagbladet newspaper as he was being wheeled off the runway on a
stretcher.

Faction leader supports regionalization as way to Somali unity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A Somali faction leader who heads
the new, self-styled Puntland autonomous state in northeastern
Somalia says regionalization is the way to a unified, peaceful
Somalia.
	   ``The Somali national reconciliation process, which was based
mainly on a top-down approach has totally failed, and all efforts
of eight years of talks between faction leaders under the auspices
of the international community have failed,'' Col. Abdullahi Yusuf
Ahmed told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital Wednesday.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991 when Gen.
Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed joined forces to oust
longtime President Mohamed Siad Barre. They then turned on each
other, unleashing a civil war that fueled a devastating famine.
	   Since then, the Horn of Africa nation of an estimated 9.3
million people has been divided into clan-based fiefdoms run by
warlords.
	   Abdullahi Yusuf said the only viable option to remake Somalia
was to create autonomous regional states that would eventually form
a federal administration.
	   The late Aidid's son, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, opposes the federal
option and, along with Ali Mahdi, is the leading proponent of
recreating the unitary state through a national reconciliation
conference. But the latest conference in the central town of Baidoa
has been postponed at least three times since most of the faction
leaders backed this option after month-long peace talks in Cairo
last December.
	   Abdullahi Yusuf did not endorse the Cairo agreement and set up
Puntland in July, over the objections of other faction leaders in
the region.
	   ``Major developments have taken place in Somalia since the Cairo
agreement was signed, and the new concept which has emerged is to
form autonomous regional states which in turn would establish a
central federal system,'' Abdullahi Yusuf said.
	   He insisted that he is not seeking independence for Puntland nor
secession from Somalia.
	   He said he envisioned five regional states in Somalia, based on
five of Somalia's six major clans.
	   In 1991, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal set up the breakway state of
Somaliland in northwestern Somalia but has failed to gain
international recognition.
	   And Siad Barre's son-in-law, Gen. Mohamed Hersi, better known as
``Morgan,'' said recently he was going to set up an autonomous
Jubaland state in southern Somalia with the port of Kismayo as its
capital.
	   Ethiopia has consolidated relations with portions of Somalia and
the warlords running them, including the northwest and the
northeast. Morgan is also a frequent visitor to Addis Ababa.
	   Aidid, who retains ties with Egypt, claims Ethiopia is arming
his opponents.

Low dollar hits Dutch stocks in early trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Shares on the Amsterdam Bourse
took another beating Thursday as traders reacted nervously to the
weakening dollar and losses on other exchanges, particularly Tokyo.
	   At 0855 GMT, the 27-share AEX-index was down 28 points, or 3.3
percent, to 829.11 points.
	   The Tokyo bourse closed a sharp 5.8 percent lower Thursday,
while the Dow Jones Industrial Average also closed overnight
slightly down at 7741.69 points.
	   The dollar dipped to its lowest level against the Dutch guilder
since January 1997, trading at 1.795 in Amsterdam. The Dutch bourse
is highly sensitive to the strength of the U.S. currency as a
number of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in
dollars.

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of parliament on Thursday suggested
holding a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal appears to violate Russian law.
	   ``It would be legitimate to hold such a referendum,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower
house, the State Duma. His remarks were reported by the Interfax
news agency.
	   However, Russian law specifically states that there may not be a
referendum on the early termination of a president's term.
	   Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning
voluntarily following nationwide protests on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve out his
full term. During a meeting with senior military and security
officers, he said he would maintain personal control over the
military.
	   ``And it will be like that, at least, until the year 2000, while
I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest the
country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called for
the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his
term.
	   The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below the expectations of
Communists who organized the protest together with trade unions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to 40 million
would take part.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he won't run again. The most likely candidates include Zyuganov,
regional governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.
	   Seleznyov said Thursday that he may also consider running,
provided he has popular support.

Thai air force to dismiss officers with nothing to do
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's air force will phase out
hundreds of officers who have no clear assignments and dismiss
those found to have suspicious backgrounds, air force officials
said Thursday.
	   Of the 3,098 captains and colonels in the air force, about
one-third either have no duties or are in what are called inactive
posts. The phase-outs will start in January.
	   Officers who are suspected of wrongdoing are frequently
transferred to an inactive post as punishment.
	   Jintana Thianmanee of the air force public relations division
said the force will try find work for some officers to do so they
don't lose their jobs.

Russia's nuclear ministry seeking outside money for waste cleanup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nuclear ministry isn't expecting any more
federal money for cleaning up contamination from weapons
production, so it is planning to seek outside help, the top nuclear
official said Thursday.
	   Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov also insisted that Russia
has no plans to develop new types of nuclear arms, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   In a meeting with environmentalists, Adamov said the ministry
would try to raise funds to clean up contaminated areas because it
wasn't counting on the next federal budget to include any money for
cleanup.
	   He also discussed burying radioactive waste, reactor safety and
nuclear proliferation, Interfax said.
	   Russia's nuclear weapons plants and power plants dumped tons of
radioactive waste into rivers and lakes over several decades.
Cleanup has been slow because it is difficult and costly.

India's Bandit Queen to speak in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ India's Bandit Queen will be the
star attraction of an international conference on caste and
persecuted people in the Malaysian capital this weekend.
	   Phoolan Devi, a former Indian federal lawmaker who once spread
terror riding horseback with a rifle slung on her shoulder, will
speak about her experiences at the conference on ``A New Vision
Toward a Casteless Society,'' an organizer said.
	   At sessions Saturday and Sunday, about 650 delegates from the
United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea,
Singapore and India will discuss problems faced by persecuted
people worldwide.
	   The conference is being organized by the Indian Progressive
Front and The Dalit International Organization, both
Malaysian-based groups.
	   ``The Indian apartheid is worse than the the African
apartheid,'' said M.G. Pandithan, head of the front.
	   Devi, 36, has portrayed her criminal career as part of a
struggle between low-caste Hindus like herself and the upper
castes.
	   She was born to a poor farmer whose land was stolen by
upper-caste men. Her father sold her into marriage at age 11 to a
man who brutalized her.
	   She ran away from her husband and fell in love with a highway
robber, who was killed by upper-caste men. She formed her own gang
of bandits and is alleged to have massacred upper-caste men. She
denies it.
	   She was released in 1994 after 11 years in prison, and won an
election in 1996. She lost her seat in parliament earlier this
year.
	   During her campaign in one of the most backward regions of
India, she used her life story to appeal for votes. Upper-caste men
fired shots at her motorcade, blocked her with burning tires and
organized demonstrations by widows of the men that her gang
allegedly murdered.
	   ``She is a source of inspiration for other women who think men
are superior to them,'' said Pandithan.

Three ethnic Albanians sentenced to prison terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
were sentenced Thursday to up to four years in prison for
attempting to join the rebels fighting for independence for the
province.
	   The Serbian court in Gnjilane, some 30 kilometers (18 miles)
southeast of the capital Pristina, said the three were guilty of
anti-state activities and terrorism, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
	   The agency said one of the convicted ethnic Albanians is a minor
and would serve his two-year sentence in the prison for juvenile
delinquents. The other two were sentenced to three and a half and
four-year terms.
	   Tanjug said they were arrested last August ``during attempt to
join the Kosovo Liberation Army.'' Hundreds of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo are awaiting trial on similar charges.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ At least 19 French tourists died Thursday
when an excursion boat carrying 141 people went down in a lake in
northeastern Spain, emergency services said.
	   The reasons why the boat sank at 10.45 a.m. (0845GMT) in the
Lake Banyoles 350 miles northeast of Madrid were not yet known,
said Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman for the local emergency
services.
	   Thirteen people died in the water, and six people died once they
had been taken to local hospitals, Estefania said.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle, Estefania said.
	   Lake Banyoles is the largest lake in the northeastern region of
Catalonia. The boat was on the point of setting off on a trip
around the lake when it sank, the national news agency EFE said.

Kazak parliament chairman claims presidential poll set for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The chairman of Kazakstan's parliament claimed
Thursday that President Nursultan Nazarbayev had agreed to early
presidential elections next year, though Nazarbayev has shot down
the proposal before, news reports said.
	   The claim by Parliament Chairman Marat Ospanov came just before
Kazakstan's parliament passed a resolution Thursday setting early
presidential elections for Jan. 10, 1999, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Nazarbayev was to comment on the move later Thursday, according
to his press service. But just last month he said he would not step
down before his term expires in 2000.
	   The parliament resolution cannot be implemented without
Nazarbayev's consent.
	   Parliament leaders want to move the elections forward by a year
so they do not coincide with the 2000 presidential vote in Russia,
the reports said.
	   Meanwhile, the lower house of parliament, or Mazhilis, approved
a list of constitutional amendments earlier submitted by Nazarbayev
that allow political parties to expand their limited role before
the next legislative elections are held in December 1999, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The amendments include increasing the number of seats in the
Mazhilis, to 77 from 67, extending parliamentary term limits,
allowing candidates to indicate their political affiliation on the
ballots and dropping the requirement for a 50 percent voter turnout
to validate elections.

Palestinian security officials issue warnings to Hamas leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security agents summoned
Hamas leaders and warned them not to carry out terror attacks in
Israel at a time when an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback is
close, a Hamas official said Thursday.
	   Such warnings were delivered to leading Islamic militants
throughout the West Bank, said a senior Palestinian security
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One meeting took place on Wednesday afternoon in the office of
Col. Munir Abousheh, the head of the Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   Abousheh told 12 Hamas leaders, including Jamal Salim of Nablus,
that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was close to
agreement with Israel on a West Bank troop withdrawal, according to
a Hamas participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Abousheh complained that whenever progress was made in peace
talks, Hamas was carrying out bombings in hopes of sabotaging the
agreements. The colonel told the Hamas leaders that the Palestinian
Authority would not tolerate any more terror attacks.
	   He also said the group was being closely watched and that the
Palestinian Authority had learned that Hamas leaders abroad were
urging activists in the West Bank to try to kill Palestinian
Authority officials.
	   Last week, Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip were given similar
warnings after Palestinian security caught two Hamas activists
carrying several dozen pounds of explosives near the border with
Israel, apparently en route to carrying out a bombing.
	   Hamas is responsible for more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994. Last month, the group vowed there would be more
bombings to avenge the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli
troops.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made
substantial progress toward agreement on a West Bank troop
withdrawal. The two leaders will try to wrap up a deal during a
Washington summit that is to begin Oct. 15.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Police in northwest Poland have detained a
German man suspected of abducting and sexually abusing a 3-year-old
girl, a police spokesman said Thursday.
	   The man, identified as Heinz Dieter K., 40, of Lengerich, was
detained Wednesday night near Goleniow, 500 kilometers (300 miles)
northwest of Warsaw, with the child in his car, said police
spokesman Krzysztof Rusinowicz.
	   Witnesses who saw a stranger lead the girl away from her home in
the nearby town of Swinoujscie remembered the vehicle's license
plate number and alerted police, according to Rusinowicz.
	   A hospital examination showed the girl had been sexually abused,
Rusinowicz said.
	   The suspect, an unemployed married man with two children, could
face charges of abduction and sexual abuse of a minor, which carry
a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, Rusinowicz added.

Italy balks at NATO strikes in Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's premier said Thursday that conditions
weren't ripe for NATO strikes aimed at ending the violence in the
embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   Italy's reluctance could complicate U.S. attempts to forge a
consensus on strikes within the 16 NATO countries.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' Prodi told Parliament just a day before he
faces a vote of confidence.
	   Prodi said the U.N. Security Council should approve any strikes,
something that seems unlikely given Russian opposition.
	   The premier is fighting to gather a razor-thin majority in the
lower house before Friday's confidence vote and is relying on a
breakaway faction of the hard-line Communist party.
	   The Communists oppose the use of Italian bases for strikes
against Yugoslavia and have broken with Prodi in the past over
intervention in the Balkans and NATO expansion.
	   In another apparent concession to the Communists, Prodi told
lawmakers that his government is committed to giving Italy a
35-hour work week.
	   NATO's southern command is located in Naples and it uses several
Italian bases scattered throughout the country. The air base at
Aviano in northern Italy was used in the NATO bombing campaign in
1995 that helped bring about an end to the war in the Balkans.
	   A huge NATO naval force involving 17,000 military personnel from
11 countries is now involved in war games in the Mediterranean off
the Italian coast and could be called upon if NATO decides to
strike Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslav Serb forces have killed hundreds of people and turned
tens of thousands into refugees in Kosovo in their offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels. Ninety percent of the population of
Kosovo is ethinic Albanian.

	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ The daughter of Indonesia's founder
demanded an end to corruption and a better deal for the poor
Thursday, rallying tens of thousands of supporters in what many
regarded as her first step toward running for president.
	   Despite Bali's fierce tropical heat, the crowd turned the open
field where the rally was held into a surging wave of support for
Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno.
	   Dressed in red, the color of her Indonesian Democratic Party,
and carrying countless red signs, pictures and banners in her
support, the crowd shouted ``Mega must win!'' every time her name
was mentioned from the stage.
	   Many carried pictures of her father, a charismatic nationalist.
	   ``If the people elect us as a government, we will have the guts
to speak out for the interests of the ordinary people,'' Megawati
said in her hour-long speech.
	   Most of it focused on Indonesia's crippling economic crisis,
which has left the nation with more than 80 percent inflation, food
shortages, widespread unemployment and soaring poverty.
	   Pitching her speech at Indonesia's downtrodden, Megawati said
that life for ordinary people is getting harder and harder as the
crisis drags on.
	   Her voice wavered emotionally when she spoke of a lack of food
for the children of peasant farmers hit by soaring inflation.
	   She didn't criticize the country's current president, B.J.
Habibie, or his predecessor, Suharto, by name.
	   But Megawati said corruption had sprung up like mushrooms during
Suharto's many years in power.
	   ``This fungus has destroyed Indonesia over the past three
decades,'' she said. ``Now we must destroy the fungus.''
	   She said that if her party was elected to power next year, it
would uphold the law and punish those who have broken it.
	   The crowd on the outskirts of Sanur, estimated at around 50,000,
exploded in cheers.
	   Megawati also said that Indonesians must have more say in
electing their government and holding it accountable.
	   ``I warn the power holders that Indonesia has lost its
credibility in the eyes of the world because sovereignty doesn't
really belong to the people,'' she said.
	   Megawati's visit to Bali was being closely covered by
Indonesia's media, and it already has produced front-page stories
in newspapers and led some television news broadcasts.
	   Given all the rioting and looting that have wracked other parts
of Indonesia this year, government officials and the military had
tried to ban the gathering on the tranquil resort island.
	   But only a few dozen police appeared near the field Thursday,
and there were no signs of violence in the crowd. Most people had
walked hours down streets closed to traffic to reach the field.
	   The government deployed several thousand police, soldiers and
civilian security guards to Bali _ a Hindu enclave in
Muslim-dominated Indonesia, and a major source of foreign exchange
for a country suffering its worst economic crisis in 30 years. But
many of the soldiers were kept out of sight Thursday, in buildings
around the field where the rally was held.
	   In May, about 1,200 people died in riots on the neighboring main
island of Java, forcing President Suharto to quit 32 years after he
took power from Sukarno, Megawati's father.
	   In recent weeks, Habibie, Suharto's successor and longtime ally,
has been targeted by protests, and he has promised to hold
democratic elections next year.
	   But Habibie also appears to be intent on fending off Megawati
and other challengers for the presidency.
	   Many people believe that Indonesia's brutal economic problems
are increasing Megawati's popularity, and that appeared evident
Thursday, the first day of the three-day congress of her faction of
the Indonesian Democratic Party.
	   Megawati bitterly resents Habibie's government for not
officially recognizing her as the rightful leader of the party,
which has been wracked by squabbling and violence for years.
	   She maintains that she was deposed illegally as head of the
party in 1996, when dozens of her supporters were killed in a clash
with police and troops in Jakarta.
	   She accuses Suharto of engineering her ouster by a rival
faction.
	   Habibie's government maintains the party is rightfully
controlled by Megawati's rivals.

F.A. against Manchester United takeover bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer's governing body, the Football
Association, has opposed the takeover of Manchester United by BSkyB
in its submission to the Office of Fair Trading.
	   The F.A. submission reportedly said the proposed
623-million-pound (dlrs 1 billion) takeover by Rupert Murdoch's
satellite broadcaster is ``not welcomed'' because it is not in the
overall interests of the game.
	   The Office of Fair Trading, a government body investigating the
takeover, has extended its review deadline by 15 days after
receiving 350 complaints.
	   The OFT Thursday said the deadline for submissions had been
extended until Nov. 2 after an ``unusually high'' number of
complaints had been received about the proposed deal.
	   The OFT will then make its recommendation to the Government's
Trade and Industry Department on whether or not to refer the deal
to a Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
	   F.A. chairman Keith Wiseman said the takeover would create a
situation where the strength of one club would outweigh the others.
	   ``The overall message we have conveyed is this is not something
to be welcomed,'' Wiseman was quoted saying in the Daily Telegraph.
	   ``Our opinion has been reached on our football feelings. You
can't put a finger on the mischief but most people have a gut
feeling that the bid is not right. It will produce some
distortions.''

Paris commuters stranded as transport strike enters third day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters were stranded in maddening traffic jams
Thursday as a transport strike entered its third day, and the
government expressed sympathy with transit workers demanding
protection from juvenile crime.
	   Outside Paris, traffic jams stretched for up to 30 kilometers
(19 miles) as drivers tried to beat the strike, which left suburban
rail services virtually paralyzed. More than one million commuters
were stranded at train stations, radio reports said.
	   But there was some relief in the capital with bus services
resuming after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system
deployed two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   Also, the Metro was not affected. But only one train per hour,
if any, was running on most lines of the Regional Express Network
(RER), which is linked to the city's subway lines and provides
service to suburbs.
	   Rail services of the SNCF, the national rail network, were
particularly affected at the Montparnasse, Gare du Nord, Gare de
l'Est and Gare de Lyon stations, which serve most points of entry
into the capital.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday night on the RER C
line, where a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried to
stop youths from vandalizing a station. The escalating attacks, in
which drivers are jumped on by gangs of youths, happen mostly in
poor suburbs with especially high unemployment.
	   ``How can you not show solidarity when there has been this
aggression?'' Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot asked in an
interview Thursday on France 2 television.
	   The strikers ``are asking that there be guarantees of security
for passengers and themselves. On that point, we're behind them,''
he added.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was expected to
announce new plans to fight the violence when he appears on state
television Thursday evening.
	   Officials have deployed hundreds more police officers on public
transport in and around the capital to boost security.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area depend on public
transit daily.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other embassy
staff rolled out of Belgrade on Thursday, as Washington tried to

Milosevic bows to international demands for peace in Kosovo.
	   International pressure was expected to intensify following three
days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy Richard

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ At least 19 French tourists died Thursday
when an excursion boat carrying 141 people went down in a lake in
northeastern Spain, emergency services said.
	   The reasons why the boat sank at 10.45 a.m. (0845GMT) in the
Lake Banyoles 350 miles northeast of Madrid were not yet known,
said Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman for the local emergency
services.
	   Thirteen people died in the water, and six people died once they
had been taken to local hospitals, Estefania said.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle, Estefania said.
	   Lake Banyoles is the largest lake in the northeastern region of
Catalonia. The boat was on the point of setting off on a trip
around the lake when it sank, the national news agency EFE said.

Russia successfully test-fires ballistic missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's strategic missile forces have
successfully test-fired a ballistic missile from neighboring
Kazakstan to a designated target area in Russia's Far East,
officials said on Thursday.
	   The RS-18 inter-continental ballistic missile was launched
Wednesday from the Baikonur cosmodrome, the strategic forces said
in a statement carried by the the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia leases Baikonur from Kazakstan, which was part of the
former Soviet Union.
	   The missile hit a target near the Kamchatka Peninsula in the
Russian Far East with ``high precision,'' the statement read.
	   The launch, the 85th during the 20 years that the missile has
been in service, was undertaken to ``study a possibility of
extending the lifetime of such missiles,'' it said.
	   The RS-18, which can be equipped with up to six warheads, is
known in the West as the SS-19 or Stiletto.
	   The military considers the extension of the RS-18's duty
``especially important in current conditions,'' because Russia
needs time to replace older nuclear forces with the new Topol-M
ballistic missiles, ITAR-Tass said.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said earlier this
week that Russia must build 35 to 45 Topol-Ms a year starting in
2000 to replace its aging Soviet-era arsenals.
	   Maslyukov said that Russia would have to start taking the old
missiles out of service in large numbers in two or three years.

Taiwan's military puts four officers on trial for corruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Four officers, including a lieutenant
general, went on trial Thursday in a corruption scandal that
tainted the military just as it was rebuilding its battered
reputation.
	   In a rarely seen court-martial of high-ranking officers, Lt.
Gen. Liu Hsueh-ta, Maj. Gen. Woh Chi-kao, Woh's aide Lt. Col. Lee
Cheng, and Maj. Lee Chun-lin denied charges of leaking bid
information to contractors in exchange for bribes.
	   The four are in detention, but were allowed to wear civilian
clothes in court rather than jail uniforms, albeit with their heads
shaved as required of convicts.
	   The allegations have further harmed the reputation of the
military, sacrosanct in the past but badly damaged by the still
unsolved murder of a navy captain in 1993 that opened up
revelations of greed, crime and corruption in military procurement.
	   The most recent case has prompted measures to guard against
further scandal. The procurements wing has been brought directly
under the supervision of the Defense Ministry, rather than
functioning as a separate branch as in the past. Top officers and
those involved in procurement have been ordered to declare their
assets annually.
	   The case relates to a feud between two companies over a 420
million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 12.7 million) contract to build
steel-reinforced ammunition storage bunkers in Taitung, eastern
Taiwan, in January 1997.
	   Details of the case broke after two managers of the Sheng Pai
company, which lost the bid, kidnapped Woh and Lee and mauled them
for reneging on a promise to ensure they won. Woh and Lee also face
charges of bribery and embezzlement relating to the purchase of
Harpoon missiles for the navy.
	   Prosecutors claim Liu engineered attempts to fix the bid, aided
by the others.
	   Liu admitted knowing Sheng Pai's managers, but claimed they were
friends only and that a car presented by the company to his
girlfriend had been a loaner, according to parts of his testimony
carried in evening newspapers.
	   Nine other officers, including two-star Gen. Wei Yu-hui, have
been penalized for dereliction of duty in the bunker case and Gen.
Ting Tze-fa, a three-star general, has resigned as head of
procurement.

Lebanese government calls for constitutional amendment to elect
</HEADLINE>
president &QL; 
 &UR; By SAM F. GHATTAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's government called on Parliament
Thursday to amend the constitution to permit the election of the
army commander as president.
	   Gen. Emile Lahoud, who enjoys wide support in Lebanon, was
virtually assured the job earlier this week after he received the
backing of Syria, which dominates Lebanese politics.
	   The main barrier to Lahoud's election by the 128-member
Parliament is that the constitution bars senior civil servants from
running for the office.
	   After a Cabinet meeting Thursday, President Elias Hrawi called
on Parliament to meet Monday to amend the constitution to allow
``once and exceptionally'' senior public servants to run for
president.
	   Parliament is expected to vote for president before the Oct. 23
constitutional deadline. A new head of state will be sworn in Nov.
24, the day Hrawi leaves office.
	   Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister and a close ally of Syria,
which maintains 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon, criticized the choice
of a military man and said Wednesday that he will boycott the
election. Catholic bishops also voiced discontent with the
nomination process but welcomed the choice of Lahoud, a fellow
Catholic.
	   The leading An-Nahar newspaper and the English-language The
Daily Star on Thursday criticized the legislature for merely rubber
stamping the government and Syrian choice for president.
	   In an editorial titled ``Our Spineless Deputies,'' The Daily
Star praised the choice of Lahoud but said ``the problem with Emile
Lahoud's accession is the process ... (which) has rubbed much of
the shine from his presidency even before it begins.''
	   ``As a comedy, it might have its virtues. As a way of running a
country, it is shameful. The loser, as ever, is Lebanon; both
because the country's international reputation is tarnished and
because the political process is devalued,'' the editorial said.

Dodger GM flies to Dominican Republic to talk to Alou
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The Los Angeles Dodgers are taking their
pursuit of Montreal Expos manager Felipe Alou to his native
Dominican Republic.
	   General Manager Kevin Malone, seeking to replace Glenn Hoffman,
was flying to the Caribbean nation Thursday, and was scheduled to
meet with Alou.
	   Los Angeles-area newspapers said the Dodgers planned to make an
offer to Alou that surpasses what Montreal might spend to retain
the manager who has had a .519 winning percentage in seven seasons
_ despite one of the lowest payrolls in baseball.
	   The Daily News of Los Angeles said Alou has told members of the
Expos' organization that the Dodger job is too good to pass up.
	   ``Yes, I'm going down there to sit down with Felipe and see if
we can get something accomplished, but I wouldn't say anything is
close to being completed,'' Malone told the Los Angeles Times.
	   The Times said in Thursday's editions that the Dodgers would
offer Alou a multiyear contract, and that team officials hope to
introduce him as the team's manager early next week.
	   ``We have a lot of work to do, and bringing (Alou) on board
would complete another big piece of the puzzle,'' Malone said. ``I
hope that Felipe will view this as a good fit, because I certainly
believe it would be.''
	   ``He's looking forward to meeting with us,'' Malone told the
Orange County Register, which reported Alou also was expected to
speak Thursday with Expos' General Manager Jim Beattie.
	   While in the Dominican Republic, Malone and Dodgers president
Bob Graziano also are to tour the team's training facility, damaged
last month by Hurricane Georges.
	   The Dodgers were given permission Monday by the Expos to talk to
Alou about the managerial job, vacant since it was announced last
week that Hoffman would return as a member of the coaching staff,
not as manager. He was an in-season replacement for Bill Russell.
	   Malone was hired Sept. 11 to become the Dodgers' third GM in a
six-month period. Alou, Montreal's manager since May 22, 1992, has
one year remaining on his contract with the Expos. Malone was
general manager of the Expos during the 1994 and 1995 seasons,
before moving to Baltimore as assistant GM.
	   Alou, 63, has had success in Montreal despite the team's low
payroll, blamed for the departure of many key players through
trades or free agency.
	   Star players who have left Montreal include Alou's son, Moises,
along with Larry Walker, John Wetteland, Pedro Martinez, Andres
Galarraga, Marquis Grissom, and Mike Lansing.
	   During the strike-shortened 1994 season the Expos had a 74-40
record _ the best in baseball, and Alou was named Associated Press
Manager of the Year and NL Manager of the Year by the Baseball
Writers Association of America.
	   The Expos were 94-68 in 1993, and 88-74 in 1996.

President Estrada says Philippines will emerge first from crisis
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada claimed
successes Thursday in his first 100 days in office despite a
battering by Asia's financial crisis, and said he is determined the
Philippines will be the first country to emerge from the region's
turmoil.
	   ``We have very good prospects of getting out of the Asian crisis
soonest,'' Estrada said in a speech marking his 100th day. He noted
that the Philippines is one of the few Southeast Asian countries
expected to grow economically this year.
	   While listing his achievements, Estrada gave little indication
of what concrete programs will be adopted to achieve his campaign
promises of helping the poor and reducing crime.
	   Estrada, a former B-movie actor and college dropout, won the
presidency by one of the largest margins ever in a free Philippine
election, largely because of widespread support from the poor.
	   Estrada said his administration is giving top priority to
agriculture and food security since most poor Filipinos live in
rural areas. He said farm production is being boosted with small
irrigation projects and post-harvest facilities.
	   He reported small gains in his campaign against major crimes
such as kidnapping and drug trafficking, which he pledged to solve
within the first six months of his administration.
	   The government, he said, has lowered its projected budget
deficit from 93 billion pesos (dlrs 2.1 billion) to less than half
that amount. Legislators' ``pork barrel'' funds, often subject to
corruption, have been eliminated and tax collections increased, he
said.
	   Estrada took special pride in reviving ailing Philippine
Airlines, which reopened Wednesday after a 13-day shutdown over its
workers' refusal to accept a management-proposed rehabilitation
plan.
	   Estrada lobbied union leaders to accept the plan, in which
workers will suspend their collective bargaining agreement for 10
years in exchange for 20 percent ownership of the airline.
	   Leftist labor leaders have called Estrada anti-union and said
the agreement violates the right of workers to bargain
collectively.
	   Estrada fanned more controversy by supporting a proposed law
that would prohibit strikes in vital industries such as
telecommunications and transportation during periods of economic
crisis.
	   Critics of the proposal accused him of veering toward strong-arm
rule like that of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos by supporting
the measure.
	   Estrada was also widely criticized for agreeing to allow Marcos'
burial in a heroes' cemetery, and eventually reversed his decision.
	   However, Estrada's popularity remains high, according to the
independent Social Weather Stations survey group. It said Estrada
received 69 percent support from the public in a Sept. 11-29
survey, compared with 70 percent support for Estrada's predecessor,
Fidel Ramos, at the end of his first 100 days in 1992.
	   Ramos' predecessor, Corazon Aquino, who took office following
the ouster of Marcos in a popular revolt in 1986, received only 60
percent support at the same point in her administration.
	   The survey polled 1,200 adults nationwide and had a margin of
error of 3 percent.

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of parliament on Thursday suggested
holding a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal appears to violate Russian law.
	   ``It would be legitimate to hold such a referendum,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower
house, the State Duma. His remarks were reported by the Interfax
news agency.
	   However, Russian law specifically states that there may not be a
referendum on the early termination of a president's term.
	   Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning
voluntarily following nationwide protests on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve out his
full term. During a meeting with senior military and security
officers, he said he would maintain personal control over the
military.
	   ``And it will be like that, at least, until the year 2000, while
I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest the
country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called for
the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his
term.
	   The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below the expectations of
Communists who organized the protest together with trade unions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to 40 million
would take part.
	   Zyuganov on Thursday used the protest to renew his call on
Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``He and his clique are like a plastic bag wrapped around the
head of the nation to suffocate it, and they must be removed
immediately,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zyuganov said the Communists would begin picketing the
government buildings and launch ``actions of civil disobedience''
if Yeltsin doesn't step down. He also said the Duma is completing
preparation of the impeachment motion against the president and
would move to launch it soon.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he won't run again. The most likely candidates include Zyuganov,
regional governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.
	   Seleznyov said Thursday that he may also consider running,
provided he has popular support.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers, injuring four people,
including a news photographer who was in serious condition after
being struck in the head.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade on
Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in force, confining
30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes erupted Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt. Several Palestinian news
photographers and cameramen moved closer to film those injured when
troops fired more rubber bullets. Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France-Presse news agency, was struck
in the back of the head and taken to a nearby hospital, where
doctors said he was in serious condition.

Earl Spencer's former wife wins right to sue law firm over divorce
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The former wife of Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, won the right Thursday to sue the law firm that advised
her before her divorce.
	   High Court Judge Douglas Brown rejected an application by the
Family Law Consortium to throw out a damage claim made against it
by Countess Spencer alleging negligence.
	   The countess, who sat impassively through the hour-long hearing,
smiled and wiped away a tear as the judge announced his decision.
	   In her 1.6 million pound (dlrs 2.7 million) suit, the former
Victoria Lockwood argued that the consortium's attorneys had failed
to ``contain the distress'' of her 1997 divorce proceedings, which
became highly publicized.
	   The lawsuit also said that she could have won 3.75 million
pounds (dlrs 6.4 million) if attorney David Hodson had advised her
to sue for divorce sooner and in Britain, rather than South Africa.
	   The countess was married to Princess Diana's brother for eight
years. They have four children.
	   In December 1997, British newspapers reported that the Spencers
had agreed to a divorce settlement of 1.8 million pounds (dlrs 2.8
million).
	   The judge gave the Family Law Consortium permission to appeal
the decision.

Poland seeks large World Bank loan for coal industry reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said
Thursday he was seeking a ``large loan'' from the World Bank to
help pay for restructuring the coal mining industry.
	   Balcerowicz, on his return from attending International Monetary
Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, said he held ``very
specific and concrete'' talks with World Bank officials on the coal
loan.
	   In the past, Balcerowicz has said World Bank financing for coal
industry reform would be about dlrs 1 billion. He provided no
details Thursday on the possible size, nature or timing of a World
Bank loan.
	   Mining was the most heavily subsidized industry during the
decades of communist rule in Poland that ended in 1989. Poland's
state-owned coal mines, which employ 245,000 people, lost 3.4
billion zlotys (just under dlrs 1 billion) last year, according to
government officials.
	   A preliminary restructuring plan calls for reducing production
to 112 million tons in 2002 from 137 million tons last year, with
employment cut by 104,000 workers to 138,000 total in 2002.
	   The government estimates the program would cost 15 billion
zlotys (about dlrs 4.3 billion).

Bank of England cuts Britain's interest rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heeding heavy hints from the government and
demands from business, the Bank of England on Thursday cut
Britain's interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 7.25.
	   It was the first cut in the repo rate, the lowest rate at which
the central bank loans money to commercial banks, since Prime
Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party government took office in May
1997.
	   The rate had been at 7.50 percent since a 0.25 percentage point
hike June 4. That was the sixth rise in interest rates since Labor
won power.
	   Labor removed authority over interest rates from politicians and
gave it to the Bank of England within days of taking office. To the
dismay of manufacturers and labor unions, the bank hiked the rate
as it tightened monetary policy in line with a government target of
low 2.5 percent inflation.
	   But as world economic turbulence worsened, Britain's treasury
chief, Gordon Brown, indicated this week that recession is now a
greater risk than inflation, encouraging speculation that Britain
would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve and cut rates.
	   On Tuesday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown told international
bankers in Washington that the impact of the Asian recession has
forced him to abandon his forecast in March that the British
economy would grow by up to 2.25 percent next year. Growth is now
forecast at about 1 percent.

Opposition to fight between teenage girls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ A planned bout between two teenage
girls has been criticized by medical groups and Australian amateur
boxing officials.
	   The unsanctioned bout between a 14-year-old and 16-year-old is
scheduled for Saturday in Hobart, according to the Australian
Medical Association. The AMA says it is being promoted by the
Claremont Boxing Youth Club and an Australian dlr 10 (U.S. dlr 5.8)
entry fee will be charged.
	   The names of the fighters were not released by the AMA and
officials from the club involved were not available for comment.
	   ``The AMA opposes all forms of boxing on health grounds but
specifically recommends the prohibition of all forms of boxing for
people aged under 18,'' federal president David Brand and Tasmanian
state president Bryan Walpole said in a joint statement Thursday.
	   The AMA said young boxers exhibited early evidence of brain
damage in some studies, despite not being able to punch as hard as
older fighters.
	   ``The danger of boxing for young people was underscored by the
1987 death in the United Kingdom of a 15-year-old amateur boxer,
Joseph Sticklan, due to brain damage after his second fight,'' the
statement said.
	   ``We are also concerned that young people may not be capable of
making rational decisions about the dangers of boxing when choosing
a sport.''
	   Amateur Boxing Union of Australia secretary Arthur Tunstall said
the bout event was not sanctioned by the state or national
associations.
	   ``This is being done by a rebel organization,'' Tunstall said.
``We do not endorse female boxers. It is not sanctioned.''
	   National president of the ABU, Sol Spitalnic, said female
fighters were not recognized in Australian amateur boxing.
	   ``I believe it is wrong,'' Spitalnic said. ``I believe if women
become part of (Australian amateur boxing) that age would be too
young.''

Soft-spoken iconoclast writer is first Portuguese-language Nobel
</HEADLINE>
winner &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Saramago, who Thursday became the
first author in Portuguese to win the Nobel literature prize, is a
soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views.
	   Since the 1980s he has been one of Portugal's best-selling
contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more
than 20 languages.
	   But he has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary
prizes and his bluntness can sometimes offend.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people and trying to make friends,'' he once said.
	   In a recent interview with The Associated Press he said was
weary of the Nobel-inspired media frenzy that swirls around him
each year as the best chance at an award that has eluded writers of
a language used by some 140 million people around the world.
	   ``Let's not get into that (the Nobel). I just write,'' he
insisted in a telephone interview from his home in Spain's Canary
Islands.
	   At 75, he remains an outspoken nonconformist through his regular
newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always
inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.
	   ``Blindness,'' his most recent book to be translated into
English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an
inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.
	   ``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of
rationality,'' he said.
	   ``We're rational beings but we don't behave rationally. If we
did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''
	   Such anxiety about the skewing of priorities in modern society
is evident in all his works and also gives a clue to his resolute
sympathy toward the Communist Party.
	   Born Nov. 16, 1922 in the town of Azinhaga near Lisbon, Saramago
was raised in the capital. From a poor family, he never finished
university but continued to study part-time while supporting
himself as a metalworker.
	   His first novel published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It
sold badly but won Saramago enough recognition to allow him jump
from the welder's shop to a job on a literary magazine.
	   But for the next 18 years Saramago, then a committed communist
who opposed the 41-year rightist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar,
published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a
journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974.
	   He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel
Garcia Marquez and his writing is often described as realism tinged
with Latin-American mysticism, particularly for his technique of
confronting historical personages with fictional characters.
	   ``He has sought to reconcile the rationalism of his
materialistic world view with the richness of his baroque style.
And he has succeeded,'' said Portuguese critic Torcato Sepulveda.
	   Others disagree, saying Saramago is too intellectual and that
his storytelling pace can slow to a dreary plod.
	   He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical
fantasy ``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as
``Baltasar and Blimunda.''
	   It is set during the Inquisition and explores the war between
individuals and organized religion, picking up Saramago's recurring
theme of the loner struggling against authority.
	   The theme brings to mind a clash Saramago had with Under
Secretary of State Sousa Lara who withdrew the writer's name from
Portugal's nominees for the European Literature Prize because he
said his 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (The
Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portuguese religious
convictions and divided the country.
	   In the controversial work Saramago, an atheist, proposes a
Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and
tries to back out of his crucifixion.
	   ``I have not come to bring peace but the sword,'' Saramago, who
retreated to his Canary Island home in disgust, said at the time.
	   In his 1984 novel ``O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis,'' (The Year
of the Death of Ricardo Reis), Saramago criticizes Portuguese
passivity during Salazar's dictatorship by bringing austere
national poet Fernando Pessoa back from the dead to carouse and
profane.
	   In ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' from 1989, a Lisbon
proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on
the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors,
thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a
stroke of his pen.
	   Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks.
	   In his 1986 book, ``The Stone Raft,'' the Iberian peninsula
snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off
into the North Atlantic _ apparently in a metaphorical search for
identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union,
of which Portugal and Spain are members.

	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago is the fourth consecutive European to win the
prestigious prize.

STOCKHOLM, Sweden: prestigious prize.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office on Thursday unveiled
a logo for retailers across the EU that tells customers as of next
year they can pay their bills in euros if they wish.
	   The logo _ a smiling face above the text `payments in euros
accepted' _ is aimed at ``creating a climate of confidence for the
changeover to the euro,'' said EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner
Emma Bonino.
	   Shops displaying the logo, created jointly by EU consumer and
retail organizations, commit to list prices in euros and the
national currency, to charge no extra for euro payments and to
abide by rules on rounding off prices converted into euros.
	   All 15 EU nations except Britain, Greece, Denmark and Sweden
adopt the euro on Jan. 1. Until 2002, the euro will be in use
side-by-side with national currencies.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

 &UR; Eds: Recasts to raise Holbrooke's return; UPDATES with Italy
opposed to NATO action; trims.
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concern about a possible NATO
airstrike sent convoys of U.S. and other embassy staff out of
Belgrade on Thursday, as Washington ordered its senior Balkan envoy
back to the Yugoslav capital for new talks with President Slobodan
Milosevic.
	   International pressure was expected to intensify following three
days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke. He briefed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
NATO officials Thursday in Brussels, Belgium on the results of
those talks and was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for
another session with Milosevic. NATO officials said Holbrooke would
be in the Yugoslav capital by early afternoon.
	   Holbrooke was ordered to return amid further signs of opposition
within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic efforts.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' said Italian Premier Romano Prodi, seeking
the support of anti-interventionist Communists ahead of a Friday
confidence vote in the Italian parliament.
 &UR; Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his session with
Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said
Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a conference of the so-called
Contact Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes use force to resolve the crisis, and
Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright
in London.
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said the world must unite in telling Milosevic ``that we won't
tolerate the atrocities carrying on.''
	   In the Yugoslav capital, about 20 vehicles carrying diplomats
and their families from the United States, Britain and Australia
left for the Hungarian capital Budapest, where they will remain
until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to force
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
international demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb
troops, and the return of refugees to their villages, Washington
lacks the international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into
compliance.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence. Milosevic launched his
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people have
been driven from their homes.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences'' over Kosovo.
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
Milosevic has claimed to have fulfilled international demands.
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday with 10
family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbia's government on Wednesday ordered independent media to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs or face prosecution.
	   ``Public information services in conditions of immediate war
danger must adapt their behavior,'' deputy Premier Milovan Bojic
told editors of independent Serbian media Wednesday, according to
Beta news agency. ``This is not an appeal. This is an order.''

Most Asian markets rally on stronger yen, but Tokyo falls
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with closing figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher
Thursday, lifted by a strengthening Japanese yen, but worries about
its effect on Japan's vaunted exporters pushed Tokyo's key Nikkei
index sharply lower.
	   Markets in Hong Kong and Singapore continued their winning
streak. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 2.5 percent, closing at
7,939.51, on low interest rates and new government policies to help
the property industry.
	   Singapore's Straits Times Index gained 3.2 percent to 950.96 on
hopes of more global interest rate cuts.
	   Stock and currency markets also gained a boost from the yen's
strength, resulting from expectations that Japan was making
progress in putting its troubled banking system back on track.
	   On Wednesday, the U.S. currency fell 8 percent against the yen _
the largest one-day drop in percentage terms in a quarter-century.
	   By late Thursday in Tokyo, the dollar was down to 122.36 yen,
5.82 yen below late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York
level of 120.25 yen overnight. That brought the dollar's fall in
Tokyo to a total of 13.40 yen in three days.
	   Overseas later, the dollar dropped below 115 yen.
	   But renewed vigor in Japan's currency had the opposite effect on
Tokyo stocks. The benchmark Nikkei Average of 225 issues closed at
13,026.06, down 5.78 percent, or 799.55 points.
	   On Wednesday, the average had surged 6.17 percent, or 803.97
points _ its second-largest points gain this year.
	   The yen's sharp gains against the dollar hurt shares of major
Japanese exporters by raising fears that they may lose competitive
strength in overseas markets. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports
more expensive in dollar terms overseas.
	   ``The wild fluctuations in recent yen-dollar exchange rates also
dealt a big blow to exporting companies, dampening overall
sentiment,'' said Fumikazu Onishi of Nikko Securities in Tokyo.
	   In Thailand, the key SET index rallied 8.4 percent, closing at
285.22 points, a 2 1/2-year high, on heavy across-the-board buying
by European funds.
	   In Indonesia, the benchmark JSX index also rocketed 8.4 percent
to 288.50 points. Dealers said the stronger rupiah and speculation
that the government will ease liquidity by reducing the interest
rate encouraged investors.
	   In Hong Kong, the property sector was encouraged by Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa's policy speech late Wednesday and lower
interbank interest rates. The property sub-index rallied 8.3
percent.
	   Tung offered government support for the property market and
backed down from some of the government's earlier housing
construction targets, which were widely blamed for the property
slump.
	   In Singapore, the rally was led by the United Overseas Bank
Ltd.'s move to cut its prime lending rate, the second reduction in
less than a month. It was expected to spark another round of rate
cuts.
	   Elsewhere:
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Shares ended mixed despite Malaysia's registering
its 10th consecutive monthly trade surplus. The Composite Index
ended at 372.99 points, up 0.60 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Shares ended higher in a rally triggered by a
strengthening of the Taiwan dollar. The Weighted Price Index rose
4.42 percent to 6,970.23.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, mirroring the
regionwide advance. The PSE index rose 3.1 percent to 1,250.41.
	   WELLINGTON: Shares closed higher despite a fall in market
heavyweight Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 Capital
Index was up 0.80 percent, closing at 1,729.61.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares fell on the back of a flat finish on
Wall Street and the fall in Japan's shares. The All Ordinaries
index closed at 2,503.3, down 1.5 percent.
	   SEOUL: The key index fell 2.6 percent to 305.22 on sales of
blue-chip stocks to hedge against losses in the options market,
analysts said.

Paris commuters stranded as transport strike enters third day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 10-11 with prime minister saying attacks
warrant prison terms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters were stranded in maddening traffic jams
Thursday as a transport strike entered its third day, and the
government expressed sympathy with transit workers demanding
protection from juvenile crime.
	   Outside Paris, traffic jams stretched for up to 30 kilometers
(19 miles) as drivers tried to beat the strike, which left suburban
rail services virtually paralyzed. More than one million commuters
were stranded at train stations, radio reports said.
	   But there was some relief in the capital with bus services
resuming after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system
deployed two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   Also, the Metro was not affected. But only one train per hour,
if any, was running on most lines of the Regional Express Network
(RER), which is linked to the city's subway lines and provides
service to suburbs.
	   Rail services of the SNCF, the national rail network, were
particularly affected at the Montparnasse, Gare du Nord, Gare de
l'Est and Gare de Lyon stations, which serve most points of entry
into the capital.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday night on the RER C
line, where a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried to
stop youths from vandalizing a station. The escalating attacks, in
which drivers are jumped on by gangs of youths, happen mostly in
poor suburbs with especially high unemployment.
	   ``How can you not show solidarity when there has been this
aggression?'' Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot asked in an
interview Thursday on France 2 television.
	   The strikers ``are asking that there be guarantees of security
for passengers and themselves. On that point, we're behind them,''
he added.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was expected to
announce new plans to fight the violence when he appears on state
television Thursday evening.
	   Jospin told reporters Thursday that attacks on transport workers
should be punished with prison terms.
	   ``We need to assure that the right conditions are in place so
that the transport system can work properly,'' Jospin said.
	   Officials have deployed hundreds more police officers on public
transport in and around the capital to boost security.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area depend on public
transit daily.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ At least 20 people, all believed to be
French tourists, died Thursday when an excursion boat carrying 141
people sank in a lake in northeastern Spain, emergency services
said.
	   The reasons why the boat sank at 10.45 a.m. (0845 gmt) in the
Lake Banyoles, just north of Barcelona and some 350 miles northeast
of Madrid, were not yet known, said Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman
for the local emergency services.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals, Estefania said. It was not
immediately known how many people were being treated in hospital.
	   ``The problem is that the passengers are old folk and that makes
it difficult for them to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the La
Carpa firm that owned the vessel told the ,national news agency
Efe.
	   The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying the boat split in two in
waters described as being between two and 15 meters (yards) deep.
	   The motor-powered vessel, launched a year ago, made some 50
trips daily on the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who was not
identified, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle, Estefania said.
	   Lake Banyoles is the largest lake in the northeastern region of
Catalonia. The boat was on the point of setting off on a trip
around the lake when it sank, Efe said.

Babies of international cricket battle it out in Nepal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Japan's scoring rate was fantastic, but
the rest of the score card didn't look so impressive: the whole
team was bowled out in 15 balls for 19 runs by Hong Kong, which had
to bat for just 2.3 overs to win.
	   Away from the sound and fury of international cricket, Asia's
cricket babies are at play, and they are loving every moment of it.
	   Ten national teams from across the continent _ Malaysia,
Bangladesh, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, the Maldives, Singapore,
United Arab Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan and Nepal _ are playing out
a keen tournament in preparation for their entry into international
cricket.
	   Play began last Saturday and the winner of next Tuesday's final
will get a chance to play at the Asian Cup against other cricket
giants in Bangladesh later this year.
	   The Asian Cricket Council, organizers of the ACC Trophy matches,
believe the effort will provide international experience to less
experienced and younger cricket teams, and develop Asia as the best
cricket playing region in the world by the year 2002.
	   The ACC was formed in 1983 by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore joined soon after, and the
association now has 16 member nations.
	   ``This is a great tournament and has certainly helped promote
the game in Asia,'' said Numa Alu _ Papua New Guinea's team manager
who is also sports editor of the island nation's most popular daily
Post Courier.
	   Papua New Guinea first made its debut in international cricket
in 1979 though the game was introduced to the country over a
century ago by the British. During the ACC Tournament in Malaysia
in 1996, they surprised all by qualifying for the semis.
	   ``This tournament has given countries like Nepal the opportunity
to show the talents that we have in store,'' said Vijoy Dugar,
executive member of Nepal Cricket Association which organized this
year's ACC tournament in Katmandu.
	   In the Maldives, a tiny Indian Ocean island nation, cricket is
second only to soccer in popularity. Interest in cricket is fast
catching up.
	   ``Apart from eight months training, we played friendly games in
Sri Lanka, Singapore, India and Pakistan,'' said Maldivian manager
Abdul Sattar.
	   A cricket control board was established to govern and promote
the game in the country in 1978 and the team is now coached by
former Indian test player Abid Ali.
	   Malaysia hosted the first ACC Tournament in 1996 and the
Commonwealth Games last month gave the game a much needed push in
the country. The country's sports council has allocated 22.4
million ringgit (dlrs 5.8 million) to develop cricket, coach and
manager V. Vijayalingam said.

	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the clash,
which occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in the Saleh
Abad region.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban and wants the
culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.'' It also has accused Iran of arming and financing
its northern-based opposition.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed higher
Thursday, lifted by a strengthening Japanese yen, but worries about
its effect on Japan's vaunted exporters pushed Tokyo's key Nikkei
index sharply lower. The benchmark Nikkei Average of 225 issues
closed at 13,026.06, down 5.78 percent, or 799.55 points. But
markets in Hong Kong and Singapore continued their winning streak
Thursday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 2.5 percent at
7,939.51 on low interest rates and new government policies to help
the property industry. Singapore's Straits Times Index gained 3.2
percent to close at 950.96 on hopes of more global interest rate
cuts. The yen's strength on Wednesday, resulting from expectations
that Japan was making progress in putting its troubled banking
system back on track, boosted stock and currency markets. In Tokyo,
the dollar bought 122.36 yen late Thursday, down 5.82 yen from late
Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 120.25 yen
overnight. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The meeting of the IMF and the World Bank ends
Thursday with final assessments by IMF President Michel Camdessus
and World Bank President James Wolfensohn. India's Finance Minister
Yashwant Sinha bluntly said ``The brute fact is that after five
days of intense discussions and debate we are still at a loss as to
why contagion has continued to spread'' from Asia to Russia and is
now threatening Latin America. While little emerged from the
meetings to cheer financial markets, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicated in a speech Wednesday that a growing threat to
the U.S. economy from the foreign economic turmoil could lead to
another cut in interest rates. (US-ECONOMIC CRISIS)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian countries have been
alarmed by a sharp drop in foreign investment in the region,
prompting them to hasten plans to demolish barriers to trade,
officials said Thursday. The officials said foreign investment has
fallen by 33.6 percent for the nine members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations since Asia's financial crisis erupted in
July 1997. The alarm over the sharp decline prompted ASEAN trade
ministers to agree in meetings in Manila this week to take bold
steps to boost investment and tourism, they said. Some ASEAN
countries said the plans would need to be studied and approved by
their respective governments. If specific steps are approved, they
will be announced at a summit of ASEAN heads of state in December
to give them impact, said an ASEAN official who spoke on condition
of anonymity. (ASEAN-TRADE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund doesn't plan to
give Russia a new loan installment until the country implements an
economic reform program to deal with the current crisis, the
finance minister said Thursday. ``They expect practical steps
first,'' Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said after returning
from Washington, where he sought the release of loans from the IMF
and other international lenders. ``If these steps help to stabilize
the situation and are based on free-market instruments, then they
will receive understanding and support,'' Zadornov said, according
to the Interfax news agency. The cash-strapped Russian government
badly needs foreign loans to help pay its many debts, including
overdue wages owed to many state workers. But Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's government has yet to finalize an economic plan
to address the economic crisis that hit in August. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Rejecting criticism that his policy address
offered too little, Hong Kong's chief executive said Thursday his
government already had launched measures to ease the hardships of
economic recession and would continue to do so. Polls and
editorials Thursday indicated that many in Hong Kong were
dissatisfied with Tung Chee-hwa's address of Wednesday. Critics
said that while it set an ambitious blueprint for long-term
economic development, it offered no quick fixes to ease immediate
pain. Tung laid out detailed plans to diversify Hong Kong's
economic base and pledged special funding for high-tech industries,
which he sees as Hong Kong's future. But he did not offer any new
measures to ease growing unemployment and improve social welfare,
and many activists say that most grassroots citizens will not
benefit from development in the high-tech sector. (HONG KONG-POLICY

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright directed U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke on Thursday to
return to Belgrade to try again to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to remove all Serbian troops from Kosovo. Only
some of the troops have been pulled back from a confrontation with
ethnic Albanians, who are trying to gain self-rule, and Albright
will urge NATO foreign ministers to ``go to the next stage'' in
planning an air attack on the Serbs, her spokesman said. The U.S.
strategy, at this point, is ``to ratchet the pressure up'' on
Milosevic, the U.S. spokesman said. (US-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House votes Thursday whether to launch an
impeachment inquiry that would make Bill Clinton the third U.S.
president to face the prospect of removal from office. Democratic
leaders were nervous before the historic vote, knowing that
conservatives in their party and those with tough election races
were defecting to support the open-ended inquiry demanded by
Republicans. In last-minute maneuvering, the White House refused
the requests of some moderate Democrats to stop opposing a broad
inquiry not limited by time or subject matter. But the president
advised lawmakers to cast ``a vote of principle and conscience.''
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to move beyond its past, Japan offered its
fullest apology yet for its 35-year colonization of South Korea in
a pact Thursday heralding a ``new partnership'' between the two
countries. The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, outlined fresh
areas of cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability
in North Korea. ``It is my conviction that this joint declaration
will be a new start,'' Obuchi told reporters after a morning
meeting and signing ceremony with Kim. Before looking to the
future, Japan and South Korea addressed some of the unpleasant
past: Japan's harsh 1910-1945 rule over the Korean Peninsula _ a
period still deeply resented in South Korea. The phrasing of the
apology was negotiated between the two sides, written in a document
and signed, putting down Japan's recognition of past misdeeds in
black and white. (JAPAN-SKOREA)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers, injuring four people,
including a news photographer who was in serious condition after
being struck in the head. Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed
a general strike to protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the
divided West Bank town and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel
lifted the blockade on Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in
force, confining 30,000 Palestinians to their homes. During the
clashes, several Palestinian photographers moved closer to film
those injured when troops fired more rubber bullets. A photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse news agency, was struck
in the forehead. (ISRAEL-HEBRON)
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ The daughter of Indonesia's founder
demanded an end to corruption and a better deal for the poor
Thursday, rallying tens of thousands of supporters in what many
regarded as her first step toward running for president. Despite
Bali's fierce tropical heat, the crowd turned the open field where
the rally was held into a surging wave of support for Megawati,
daughter of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno. Most of her
speech focused on Indonesia's crippling economic crisis, which has
left the nation with more than 80 percent inflation, food
shortages, widespread unemployment and soaring poverty. She didn't
criticize the country's current president, B.J. Habibie, or his
predecessor, Suharto, by name. But Megawati said corruption had
sprung up like mushrooms during Suharto's many years in power.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, restores byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago,
whose vision includes a section of Europe breaking off and floating
out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the 1998 Nobel
Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to
Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an
illusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago is the fourth consecutive European to win the
prestigious prize.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ''in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.

Soft-spoken iconoclast writer is first Portuguese-language Nobel
</HEADLINE>
winner &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Saramago, who became the first
Portuguese author on Thursday to win the Nobel literature prize, is
a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and iconoclastic views.
	   Since the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling
contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more
than 20 languages.
	   But he has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary
prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people and trying to make friends,'' he once said.
	   In a recent interview with The Associated Press, he said was
weary of the Nobel-inspired media frenzy that swirls around him
each year as the best chance at an award that has eluded writers of
a language used by some 140 million people around the world.
	   ``Let's not get into that (the Nobel). I just write,'' he
insisted in a telephone interview from his home in Spain's Canary
Islands.
	   At 75, he remains an outspoken nonconformist through his regular
newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always
inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.
	   ``Blindness,'' his most recent book to be translated into
English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an
inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.
	   ``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of
rationality,'' he said. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave
rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''
	   Such anxiety about the skewing of priorities in modern society
is evident in all his works and also gives a clue to his resolute
sympathy toward the Communist Party.
	   Born Nov. 16, 1922, in the town of Azinhaga near Lisbon,
Saramago was raised in the capital. From a poor family, he never
finished university but continued to study part-time while
supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   His first novel published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It
sold badly but won Saramago enough recognition to allow him jump
from the welder's shop to a job on a literary magazine.
	   But for the next 18 years, Saramago, then a committed communist
who opposed the 41-year rightist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar,
published only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a
journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974.
	   He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel
Garcia Marquez, and his writing is often described as realism
tinged with Latin-American mysticism, particularly for his
technique of confronting historical personages with fictional
characters.
	   ``He has sought to reconcile the rationalism of his
materialistic world view with the richness of his baroque style.
And he has succeeded,'' said Portuguese critic Torcato Sepulveda.
	   Others disagree, saying Saramago is too intellectual and that
his storytelling pace can slow to a dreary plod.
	   He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical
fantasy ``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as
``Baltasar and Blimunda.''
	   It is set during the Inquisition and explores the war between
individuals and organized religion, picking up Saramago's recurring
theme of the loner struggling against authority.
	   The theme brings to mind a clash Saramago had with
Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara who withdrew the writer's name
from Portugal's nominees for the European Literature Prize because
he said his 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (The
Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portuguese religious
convictions and divided the country.
	   In the controversial work Saramago, an atheist, proposes a
Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and
tries to back out of his crucifixion.
	   ``I have not come to bring peace but the sword,'' Saramago, who
retreated to his Canary Island home in disgust, said at the time.
	   In his 1984 novel ``O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis,'' (The Year
of the Death of Ricardo Reis), Saramago criticizes Portuguese
passivity during Salazar's dictatorship by bringing austere
national poet Fernando Pessoa back from the dead to carouse and
profane.
	   In ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' from 1989, a Lisbon
proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on
the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors,
thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a
stroke of his pen.
	   Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks.
	   In his 1986 book, ``The Stone Raft,'' the Iberian peninsula
snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off
into the North Atlantic _ apparently in a metaphorical search for
identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union,
of which Portugal and Spain are members.

Lawyers file court order demanding Anwar's release

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for the prime minister's
former deputy, now his most prominent opponent, went to court
Thursday to demand their client's release from indefinite
detention.
	   Azizah Ismail, the wife of jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim, told
reporters that the lawyers had filed a habeas corpus appeal that
says the dissident politician is being unjustly held.
	   She said authorities have denied lawyers access to her husband,
and asked: ``How are they going to prepare for his defense?''
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security
Act, which allows indefinite detention without trial, after two
weeks of rallies around Malaysia at which he called for government
reform and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's resignation.
	   Anwar was sacked on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, after he had differed with Mahathir
on policy for escaping economic recession. But the prime minister
said the deputy was fired because he was morally unfit. Anwar said
Mahathir viewed him as a threat.
	   Anwar since has been charged with corruption and illegal
homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. He has pleaded
innocent to all the charges, which he says were trumped up by his
political enemies.
	   ``We claim that his detention is illegal and we'll prove that in
court,'' said one of Anwar's lawyers, Pawancheek Marican. He said
the lawyers had asked the High Court for an early hearing on the
request for Anwar's release.
	   When Anwar appeared in court Monday, the judge had assured
defense attorneys that they would have access to their client so
that they could prepare their arguments for the trial.
	   Azizah said authorities have spurned all her requests for family
members to visit her husband on grounds that Anwar's case was still
under police investigation.
	   ``I pleaded with the police to allow the children to see their
father,'' she told reporters at the courthouse. ``I told them that
I don't have to see my husband. But please let my son go and see
him. But the police said no.''
	   Although Anwar remains in custody at the Bukit Aman federal
police headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, all but five of those arrested
under the ISA for participating in activities and rallies organized
by Anwar have been released.
	   Sidek Baba, deputy rector of the International Islamic
University, was released Wednesday after 16 days in jail.
	   ``I may have been detained because I knew Anwar during my
involvement with the Malaysian Islamic Youth Movement,'' Sidek was
quoted as saying by The Star daily.
	   Meanwhile, opposition activists planned more demonstrations
nationwide over the next few weeks.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of opposition parties and private groups, expected 15,000 people at
a rally late Friday in the southern town of Batu Pahat in Johor
state.
	   Demonstrations calling for political reform and abolition of the
security act also will be held in several states in northern
Malaysia, said a spokesman for the coalition.
	   Despite the recent protests against him, Prime Minister Mahathir
said Wednesday that support for his ruling party remains strong and
there have been no defections from the party, which claims a
membership of 2.4 million in a nation of 22 million.
	   He ruled out an early election to prove his popularity. A
general election is not scheduled until 2000.
	   Support ``is solid,'' said Mahathir. ``There is no exodus from
the party.''
	   This week, Mahathir declined to name a replacement for Anwar,
who had been Malaysia's deputy prime minister since 1993.
	   The absence of a successor could lead to a power struggle in the
event Mahathir is forced to resign or dies, because there is no
clear line of succession.
	   Mahathir, 72, underwent heart bypass surgery in 1989.

NATO ships to visit Russia, despite tensions over Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Seven ships from NATO's Permanent Naval Group were
to arrive in St. Petersburg on Thursday, despite growing tension
between the alliance and Russia over conflict in Yugoslavia, a news
agency said.
	   The vessels from Germany, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands,
Spain, Great Britain and the United States will stay until Oct. 12,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The visit comes at a time of increasing tensions between NATO
and Russia. Western governments have warned that NATO is
considering airstrikes on Yugoslavia because of alleged atrocities
by Serbian forces against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Russia, which
has been sharply critical of NATO in the past, opposes the attack.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian forces clashed with Afghanistan's
Taliban militia Thursday on Iran's northeastern border, Iranian
television reported. But the Taliban denied any clash occurred.
	   Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in northeastern
Khorasan province with machine guns early Thursday and Iranian
border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to retreat,
the Iranian broadcast said.
	   Iran gave no immediate reports of casualties from the clash,
which it said occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in
the Saleh Abad region. The areas is about 180 kilometers (110
miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place.
	   ``We received this information and we checked from our people
and it is wrong,'' he said.
	   Contacted at the Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar,
Shakeel said, ``There is no truth in this report and it is
propaganda against the Taliban.''
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban and wants the
culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.'' It also has accused Iran of arming and financing
its northern-based opposition.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its eastern border with Iran.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details on other novels, prize
presentation, citation quote. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, who
once envisioned a section of Europe breaking off and floating out
to sea, on Thursday won the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it awarded Saramago
for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion
and irony continually enables us to apprehend an illusory
reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   In his 1991 novel ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God
and the devil negotiate over evil, and Jesus questions his own
role.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing. ... He invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago is the fourth consecutive European to win the prize.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Rejecting criticism that his policy address
offered too little, Hong Kong's chief executive said Thursday his
government already had launched measures to ease the hardships of
economic recession and would continue to do so.
	   ``People have said, `Well, you said very little in the policy
speech.' Well you can't wait for the policy speech to do all these
things,'' Tung Chee-hwa told a group of business leaders. ``You
have to do it when it's necessary, when it's proper.''
	   He also hinted that the economy may contract by more than the
government's previous estimate of 4 percent this year.
	   ``Hong Kong's economy is expected to shrink by at least 4
percent,'' Tung said.
	   Polls and editorials Thursday indicated that many in Hong Kong
were dissatisfied with Tung's address of Wednesday. Critics said
that while it set an ambitious blueprint for long-term economic
development, it offered no quick fixes to ease immediate pain.
	   Tung laid out detailed plans to diversify Hong Kong's economic
base and pledged special funding for high-tech industries, which he
sees as Hong Kong's future.
	   But he did not offer any new measures to ease growing
unemployment, which is at a 15 percent high, and improve social
welfare. Many activists say that most grassroots citizens will not
benefit from development in the high-tech sector.
	   ``What has he said in his policy speech to make them feel
better? People do not see an effective leader in Mr. Tung,''
lawmaker Martin Lee of the Democrats, Hong Kong's leading
opposition party, told reporters.
	   Lawmaker Christine Loh of the Citizens Party said, ``He's still
talking about vocational training and retraining, but everyone
knows those are the measures that don't work very well.''
	   Speaking to legislators in a special briefing, Tung said Hong
Kong people must tighten their belts before his economic
development plans bear fruit.
	   ``The economy has to rebound before we can solve the
unemployment problem,'' he said.
	   He said it is not the government's policy to set salary levels
or set up unemployment welfare programs, which unionists have long
advocated.
	   A well-known activist, Leung Kwok-hung, interrupted Tung at the
briefing, chanting: ``Shame. Set up unemployment insurance.''
Security guards later dragged him from the legislative chamber.
	   About 30 Democrats also staged an overnight sit-in to protest
Tung's blueprint.
	   Hong Kong University said that in a poll it conducted, 38.2
percent of the 469 respondents said they were dissatisfied with the
address, compared with 23.5 percent who were satisfied.
	   ``You care too much about the interests of property developers.
Have you forgotten the pains of average citizens?'' a caller
surnamed Siu told Tung on a phone-in program on the
government-owned Radio Hong Kong.
	   The property sector generally welcomed Tung's address. On the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the property sub-index gained 8.3
percent, while the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed 2.5 percent
higher.
	   ``The government seems to be supporting the market even though
there were no new specific measures like last year,'' said Vincent
Cheung, an equity sales manager at Sassoon Securities.
	   Tung said Wednesday his priority was to stabilize property
prices, but he fell short of scrapping a long-term goal of
providing 85,000 new housing units a year, a target widely blamed
for the property slump.
	   Meanwhile, most newspapers were unimpressed by the address. The
South China Morning Post said: ``The government is still not ready
to face up to the full consequences of the recession on public
spending.''

Fergie's TV debut draws 100,000 viewers, channel says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York's debut talk show replaced
Oprah Winfrey's program in an afternoon time slot this week and
took the American chat queen to the mat, her new network said
Thursday.
	   ``Sarah ... Surviving Life,'' on cable and satellite channel Sky
One, drew more than 100,000 viewers in two screenings Monday, the
network said. The 4 p.m. (1500 GMT) show outpaced average numbers
for Oprah Winfrey's program, which it replaced in the time slot,
Sky One said.
	   Following her much-publicized debut on the Rupert Murdoch-owned
channel, the former Sarah Ferguson _ known as ``Fergie'' _ drew
much ridicule but also earned approval from some surprised critics,
who praised her polished performance and ``real skill'' at
discussing life's crises.
	   In a front-page story Thursday, however, London's Mirror tabloid
_ archrival of the Murdoch-owned Sun _ called Ferguson's debut
numbers ``dismal,'' noting that her show was trounced Monday by
several programs in the 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) slot.
	   The 38-year-old duchess said she is giving her 50,000 pound
(dlrs 86,000) fee for the 10 one-hour programs to charity, but will
keep the money from the foreign rights.

Tendulkar seeking to turn Zimbabwe cricket test India's way
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar was the first India
batsman to impose any authority over the Zimbabwe bowlers Thursday,
leaving India with 49-3 at lunch time on the second day of their
five day cricket Test.
	   He was 17 not out but hit three imperious boundaries during his
short stay. With colleague Rahul Dravid, Tendulkar prised India out
of immediate trouble.
	   Zimbabwe skipper Alastair Campbell stuck with his pace attack of
Henry Olonga, Heath Streak and Neil Johnson throughout the session,
except for one over from leg spinner Adam Huckle.
	   Until the speed attack tired and lost length, this proved good
tactics. Streak got night watchman Anil Kumble for 29 and Olonga,
who had bowled Nayan Mongia overnight, nicked Navjot Sidhu's glove
on the way through to wicketkeeper Andy Flower, dismissing him for
six.
	   India, already troubled with their score on 6-1 overnight, had
quickly lost two more wickets. Suddenly, with India struggling on
49-3, Zimbabwe's modest first innings total of 221 did not look so
bad after all.
	   Their position was also strengthened by Johnson striking Rahul
Dravid a nasty blow on the right hand, which needed lengthy
attention.
	   Zimbabwe tails were high but Tendulkar soon asserted himself and
changed the tone. He hooked Olonga twice in successive balls, drove
Johnson and dabbed Streak past gully. Tendulkar is quite clearly
bent, not only on giving India the upper hand by close of play, but
also of taking his own Test average from 54.8 to over 55 with a big
score.

Kosovo expected to dominate Clinton-Schroeder talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Not even sworn in as chancellor yet,
Gerhard Schroeder faces tough talks over Kosovo and global economic
woes when he meets with U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday.
	   Germany's chancellor-elect, who leaves Thursday night for the
24-hour Washington visit, met first for two hours with outgoing
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Neither side would comment on what was discussed.
	   But with NATO debating whether to attack Serbia over the
violence in Kosovo, and Clinton floating new proposals to calm the
world's turbulent financial markets, the two were presumed to be
coordinating on Germany's positions for the transition period.
	   Schroeder has stressed his support for continuity in German
foreign policy and maintaining strong trans-Atlantic ties.
	   Kohl's government remains in power until Schroeder is sworn in
Oct. 27.
	   Accompanying Schroeder is a team that includes two lawmakers
expected to be named as his foreign and defense ministers: Greens
leader Joschka Fischer and Social Democrat Guenter Verheugen.
	   Michael Donnermeyer, spokesman for Schroeder's Social Democratic
Party, said Kosovo was expected to dominate the meeting with
Clinton, the third this year.
	   ``Schroeder is chancellor-elect now, and the talks will be more
substantive,'' Donnermeyer said.
	   Despite Washington's efforts to rally a united front, NATO
allies are divided over whether military action without a U.N.
mandate can be justified.
	   Kohl has already offered 14 German Tornado jets, which would be
the vanguard of any NATO attack because of their role in taking out
anti-aircraft defenses.
	   But even his center-right government has been divided over
whether they should actually be deployed without an explicit U.N.
mandate.
	   Clinton is expected to try to bring Germany's new leaders around
to supporting Washington's position that no new U.N. Security
Council resolution is needed.
	   Schroeder's center-left coalition has generally argued that that
would be a violation of international law.
	   But in Paris last week, Schroeder also left open that ``if the
situation modifies, we may have to take a new position.''
	   Verheugen told German television late Wednesday he believed ``a
legal basis can be found'' on humanitarian grounds for intervening
without a U.N. mandate.
	   The Greens, with their strong pacifist streak, have insisted on
an explicit U.N. resolution for any NATO action.
	   Schroeder's inclusion of Fischer, considered a pragmatist, and a
representative of the party's anti-NATO wing, Ludger Volmer, on the
trip was seen as a move to rope them into taking responsibility for
any decision as well.
	   The Greens have never held national office in Germany, and no
one in Schroeder's team _ himself included _ has much hands-on
foreign policy experience.
	   Before going to the White House, Schroeder was to meet with
World Bank president James Wolfensohn. Donnermeyer said the global
economic crisis also was expected to be a major topic in talks with
Clinton as well.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD quote from Saramago, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago,
whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off
and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the
1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to
Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an
illusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languagaes.
	   In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God and the
devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus questions his own role.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   At the time the prize was announced, Saramago reportedly was on
an airplane headed to his home in the Canary Islands from the
international book fair in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

Palestinian strike, clashes in Hebron to protest Israeli blockade
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with army statement, doctors saying one
Palestinian critically injured and on life support. &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
Palestinians during clashes Thursday in the volatile town of
Hebron, seriously injuring a news photographer and a Palestinian
protester who were both struck in the head.
	   The protester, 20-year-old Amjad Natche, was unconscious and on
life support. Photographer Hussam Abu Alan, who covered the clashes
for the Agence France Presse news agency, suffered a skull fracture
and was in surgery, doctors at Ahli Hospital said.
	   Three other Palestinians suffered light injuries.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade
Thursday morning, but the curfew remained in force, confining
30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes erupted Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt. Several Palestinian news
photographers and cameramen moved closer to film those injured when
troops fired more rubber bullets. Abu Alan, an AFP photographer,
was struck in the back of the head and taken to a nearby hospital.
	   Doctors said he was in serious condition and underwent emergency
surgery.
	   The army said in a statement it was investigating the incident.
It said soldiers are under orders not to target journalists, but
that journalists take certain risks when mingling with stone
throwers during clashes.
	   Later in the day, Natche was critically injured in the head by a
rubber bullet.
	   Throughout Hebron, shops, restaurants and schools were closed in
observance of a general strike called by Palestinian Yasser
Arafat's Fatah movement to protest the closure and curfew.
	   The restrictions had been imposed Sept. 30 after two dozen
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians were injured by two hand
grenades thrown by a man who apparently escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   Several dozen Palestinians wearing black ski masks staged a
march in the Palestinian-run area of Hebron Thursday morning,
chanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great'' and ``We don't want
to see settlers in the city.''
	   About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in downtown
Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and protected by
large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

Shell helicopters, oil rig seized by protesters in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Mobs of angry protesters in southern
Nigeria seized two Shell Oil helicopters and took control of an oil
rig, Shell's Nigerian joint venture said in a statement Thursday.
	   The helicopters were seized Wednesday from a Shell-owned helipad
in the oil-rich Niger River delta after the aircraft landed there
on a routine flight, Shell said.
	   The demonstrators also seized a nearby oil rig belonging to a
foreign contractor working for Shell.
	   In its statement, Shell also announced the immediate evacuation
of all its staff from the area.
	   The latest troubles come just days after groups of demonstrators
in the same region took control of nine oil relay stations in the
same area over the past few days.
	   The relay stations are an important link in Nigeria's oil
industry and are used to pump oil into holding tanks, where they
then are shipped out for exports.
	   The flow of crude oil through a number of pipeline relay
facilities has been shut down, halting the transfer of about
250,000 barrels a day.
	   Youth groups in the Niger River region say the attacks are aimed
at drawing attention to what they call their exclusion from their
country's political process.
	   Although rich in oil, the Niger River delta states are among the
poorest and most neglected in Nigeria.
	   Basic infrastructure in towns and villages is often provided by
foreign oil companies operating in the area, because the government
has failed to provide paved roads, electricity and clean water.
	   The youths, many from the Ijaw ethnic group, say they do not
want to participate in voter registration for next year's
presidential elections which began Monday throughout the country.
	   They also insist that the government release the results of an
enquiry into bloody confrontations between two rival ethnic groups
in the area last year.

EU Commission president visits Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The president of the European
Commission, Jacques Santer, was due to leave late Thursday for a
two-day visit to Russia and talks with the new Russian premier,
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Santer's spokeswoman Martine Reicherts said the trip was planned
in response to a visit Russia's former premier Viktor Tchernomyrdin
made to the European Union's executive body last year.
	   She refused to say what issues the two sides will discuss. ``I
think we would like the Russians to be the first to hear anything
we have to say,'' she said.
	   Santer will be traveling with the EU's Foreign Affairs
Commissioner Hans Van den Broek, and the EU's Commissioner for
Economic and Monetary Affairs Yves-Thibault de Silguy.
	   During his visit, Santer will meet with Primakov and several
other ministers, including Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and
Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants.
	   He will also meet with business representatives.
	   The EU has repeatedly pledged support for Moscow but says it
sees no point in pouring extra funds into Russia until it has dealt
with its structural problems.
	   The Commission believes the best kind of support it can give is
by sending legal and financial experts to the region.

Kimura takes one-stroke first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANBU, Japan (AP) _ Toshimi Kimura shot three consecutive
birdies and an eagle on the back nine Thursday for a 3-under-par 69
that gave her a one-stroke first-round lead in the 80 million yen
(dlrs 650,000) Takara World Invitational.
	   Kimura had two bogeys on the front nine, but then hit a
four-hole hot streak that included an eagle on the par-5 15th hole.
	   ``Since I had a chip-in birdie on the 12th hole (par-3), I could
play well,'' said the 29-year-old Kimura, seeking her first JPGA
Tour victory this season and sixth overall.
	   Fuki Kido, seeking her second tour victory this season and
fourth overall, was alone in second with a 70 on the 6,226-yard,
par-72 Caledonian Golf Club course, east of Tokyo.
	   South Korea's Ku Ok-hee of South Korea, Taiwan's Cheng Mei-chi
and Japan's Yuri Fudoh shot 71s.
	   Tied for sixth at 72 were Hiromi Takamura, Aki Takamura and
Michiko Hattori, who leads the Japan LPGA money rankings with three
victories this season.
	   A total of 108 golfers, including 19 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather.
	   The winner will collect 14.4 million yen (dlrs 117,000).

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ___
	   From ``Blindness,'' published in English last month.
	   ``Words are like that, they deceive, they pile up, it seems they
do not know where to go, and, suddenly, because of two or three or
four that suddenly come out, simple in themselves, a personal
pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an adjective, we have the excitement of
seeing them coming irresistibly to the surface through the skin and
the eyes and upsetting the composure of our feelings.''
	   From ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' published in English
in 1997.
	   ``My problem in this situation is to know whether I should have
blushed before or if I should be blushing now, I can recall having
seen you blush once, When, When I touched the rose in your office,
Women blush more easily than men, we're the weaker sex, Both sexes
are weak, I was also blushing, How come you know so much about the
weakness of the sexes, I know my own weakness, and something about
the weakness of others.''
	   An excerpt from ``The Stone Raft'' published in English in 1995.
	   ``The morning awoke overcast and drizzly, a familiar figure of
speech but one that is incorrect, because mornings do not awaken,
it is we who awaken in the mornings, and then, going to the window,
see that the sky is covered with low clouds and the rain is
drizzling down, tiresome for anyone caught in it, but such is the
power of tradition that if there were a ship's log book on this
journey of ours, the clerk would inscribe his first paean as
follows, The morning awoke overcast and drizzly, as if the skies
were gazing down with disapproval on this adventure, the skies are
always invoked in these instances, whether it rains or shines.''
	   From ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'' published in
English in 1990.
	   ``Name, Ricardo Reis, age, 48, place of birth, Oporto, marital
status, bachelor, profession, doctor, last place of residence, Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil... It reads like the beginning of a confession,
an intimate autobiography, all that is hidden is contained in these
handwritten lines, the only problem is to interpret them.''
	   (...)
	   ``Nations struggle against each other on behalf of interests
that are not those of Jack or Pierre or Hans or Manolo or Giuseppe,
all masculine names to simplify matters, yet these and other men
innocently consider those interests to be theirs, or which will be
theirs at considerable cost, when the time arrives to settle
accounts. The rule is that some eat figs while others watch.''
	   From ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' published in English in 1987.
	   ``The flagellants move forward, unable to speak yet roaring like
rutting bulls, and if the women and mistresses feel that the
penitents are not flogging themselves with enough force to inflict
open wounds and draw blood for everyone to see, then the female
choir erupts into a hideous wailing, as if possessed, inciting the
men to greater violence. They want to hear the whips crack and see
the blood flow as it flowed from the Divine Saviour. Only then will
their bodies throb under their petticoats.''

Unemployment on the rise again in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Two million more Indonesians are
expected to lose their jobs by the end of 1998, raising the number
of unemployed to 20 million, a government minister said Thursday.
	   That would raise unemployment from 20 percent of the work force
of 92 million people to 22 percent, said Manpower Minister Fahmi
Idris. The percentage could grow even worse during the rest of the
year if the country's rupiah currency falls further against the
U.S. dollar, he said.
	   As Fahmi spoke to reporters at the presidential palace, the
rupiah was rising in value against the dollar, like many other
Asian currencies, especially the Japanese yen.
	   Predicting the number of unemployed in Indonesia with any degree
of accuracy has always been difficult.
	   Indonesia's huge black market makes it difficult to keep
reliable unemployment statistics, and that has been especially true
during Asia's 15-month-old economic crisis.
	   But a recent report by the International Labor Organization in
Geneva gave similar figures. As far as unemployment is concerned,
the hardest hit areas of the economy are the service, manufacturing
and construction sectors, it said.
	   The report urged the Indonesian government to focus on
agricultural development and public works programs, as well as
labor relations, in a bid to get the economy moving again.
	   The ILO also predicted that 140 million people, or two out of
every three Indonesians, are likely to be living in poverty by the
year 1999 because of the economic turmoil.

Kurt Vonnegut recalls time as WWII POW in Dresden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DRESDEN, Germany (AP) _ For Kurt Vonnegut, Dresden was not just
another stop on his book tour.
	   The 75-year-old author was visibly shaken Wednesday as he
revisited the eastern German city where he was held by the Nazis as
a U.S. Army prisoner of war in 1944-45.
	   Standing in the slaughterhouse where he was incarcerated,
Vonnegut pointed to the spots on the walls where warning signs
hung.
	   The smallest infraction of the rules, they read, was
``punishable by death,'' Vonnegut recalled, repeating the phrase
several times in German.
	   The slaughterhouse became the title of ``Slaughterhouse-Five,''
the 1969 novel that made Vonnegut famous. The book describes the
Allied firebombing of Dresden on Feb. 13-14, 1945, which killed
nearly 100,000 people.
	   Vonnegut, who survived by hiding in a cellar, was detailed along
with other prisoners to carry the dead out of the rubble all over
the city after the bombing stopped.
	   His visit to Dresden was part of a four-day German tour for his
new book ``Timequake.''

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concern about a possible NATO
airstrike sent convoys of U.S. and diplomats out of Belgrade
Thursday, as Washington ordered its senior Balkan envoy back to the
Yugoslav capital for new talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was ordered to return by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright after briefing her and
NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of three days
of talks with Milosevic. NATO officials said Holbrooke would be in
the Yugoslav capital by early afternoon.
	   Holbrooke's new attempt to persuade Milosevic to heed world
demands by ending the anti-separatist offensive and sharply
curtailing troops and police in Kosovo came amid new signs of
opposition from some NATO members to an attack without further
diplomatic efforts.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' said Italian Premier Romano Prodi. His
comments were apparently meant to gain the support of
anti-interventionist Communists ahead of a Friday confidence vote
in the Italian parliament.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his session with
Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said
Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a conference of the so-called
Contact Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes use force to resolve the crisis, and
Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright
in London. A joint statement after the Ivanov-Milosevic meeting
said ``military threats against Yugoslavia are unacceptable.''
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said the world must unite in telling Milosevic ``that we won't
tolerate the atrocities carrying on.''
	   In the Yugoslav capital, about 20 vehicles carrying diplomats
and their families from the United States, Britain and Australia
left for the Hungarian capital Budapest, where they will remain
until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to force
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
international demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb
troops, and the return of refugees to their villages, Washington
lacks the international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into
compliance.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence. Milosevic launched his
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army. Hundreds have been killed and more than 270,000 people have
been driven from their homes.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences'' over Kosovo.
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
Milosevic has claimed to have fulfilled international demands.
	   But on Thursday, reporters near Malisevo, a former stronghold of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, heard the sounds of mortar and heavy
machine-gun fire, indicating continued fighting. Villagers in the
region said they were also at threat from snipers.
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday with 10
family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia on Wednesday announced measures that brought the country
nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbia's government on Wednesday ordered independent media to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs or face prosecution.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to RECAST lead, ADD quote from Saramago,
other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago, an
outspoken nonconformist who has a soft spot for the common man, was
named the winner Thursday of the 1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to
Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an
illusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   He uses the device to comment ironically ``about the authorities
and politicians, perhaps especially about the major players in
power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God and the
devil negotiate about evil, and Jesus questions his own role.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   At the time the prize was announced, Saramago reportedly was on
an airplane headed to his home in the Canary Islands from the
international book fair in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

Six countries lay plans for using local currencies in regional
</HEADLINE>
trade &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Six Southeast Asian countries plan to
have a framework in place for using each others' currencies for the
settlement of trade payments within six months, a business official
said Thursday.
	   Jose Concepcion, chairman of a committee representing the
chambers of commerce and industry in the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations, said the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Singapore and Brunei plan to have a framework ready for bilateral
trade payments using local currencies by the end of the second
quarter of 1999.
	   The scheme is aimed at conserving foreign exchange by reducing
the region's reliance on U.S. dollars to settle trade payments and
also at strengthening ASEAN's process of economic and financial
integration.
	   In a report to ASEAN trade ministers meeting in Manila, ASEAN
secretary-general Rodolfo Severino said the group recognized the
initiative isn't a ``cure-all'' for the continued volatility of
regional currencies.
	   But, the report added, there was good reason to hope the
bilateral payments would help, given the magnitude of inter-ASEAN
trade, which totaled dlrs 86 billion in 1997.
	   Concepcion stressed that only a framework and not the completion
of bilateral payment arrangements is expected to be ready by the
end of the second quarter of 1999.
	   Severino's report noted that bilateral talks are already under
way between Malaysia and the Philippines; Malaysia and Indonesia;
Malaysia and Thailand; and Indonesia and Thailand.
	   Concepcion said the less developed members of ASEAN _ Myanmar,
Laos and Vietnam _ aren't expected to participate in the scheme for
some time.
	   He said the ASEAN ministers agreed that to get the plan
launched, it would require the cooperation of central banks and
numerous government agencies.

Russian official: IMF remains `wary,' holds off on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 9-13 with economic plan to be announced by Oct. 20,
results of Thursday's Cabinet meeting, additional new material in
two final grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund doesn't plan to
give Russia a new loan installment until the country implements an
economic reform program to deal with the current crisis, the
finance minister said Thursday.
	   ``They expect practical steps first,'' Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov said after returning from Washington, where he sought the
release of loans from the IMF and other international lenders.
	   ``If these steps help to stabilize the situation and are based
on free-market instruments, then they will receive understanding
and support,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The cash-strapped Russian government badly needs foreign loans
to help pay its many debts, including overdue wages owed to many
state workers. But Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government has
yet to finalize an economic plan to address the economic crisis
that hit in August.
	   Zadornov said that the government had already factored into its
fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 billion in loans that it hasn't yet
received from the IMF.
	   The IMF helped arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion international loan
package for Russia in July, but had disbursed only dlrs 4.7 billion
of that sum before the crisis hit in August, freezing further
installments.
	   The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia
is ``very wary,'' Zadornov added.
	   Primakov says he will continue with market reforms in Russia,
but a draft economic plan published by the Russian media last week
called for a number of Soviet-style administrative controls. The
prime minister said the plan was purely preliminary and only
contained proposals.
	   The government plans to announce its economic program before
Oct. 20, Russian news agencies reported Thursday.
	   Speaking at the Cabinet session on Thursday, Primakov reiterated
that the government's top priority is to pay off wage and pension
debts, which sparked a day of nationwide demonstrations on
Wednesday.
	   ``We must draw lessons from that, since the people have mostly
been driven by the dissatisfaction with economic conditions,''
Primakov said.
	   The Cabinet discussed a plan to reduce the debts of Russian
companies that have been piling up over recent years, and now total
the staggering sum of 1.2 trillion rubles (dlrs 75 billion), or
about 40 percent of the country's gross domestic product, Russian
news reports said.
	   In the first stage, which would last until mid-December, the
government would help solve debts of state-owned companies and
organizations that account for up to 20 percent of the total.
Economics Minister Andrei Shapovalyants provided no specifics on
how the government would achieve this.
	   In another developments Thursday:

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of parliament on Thursday suggested
holding a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal appears to violate Russian law.
	   ``It would be legitimate to hold such a referendum,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower
house, the State Duma. His remarks were reported by the Interfax
news agency.
	   However, Russian law specifically states that there may not be a
referendum on the early termination of a president's term.
	   Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning
voluntarily following nationwide protests on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve out his
full term. During a meeting with senior military and security
officers, he said he would maintain personal control over the
military.
	   ``And it will be like that, at least, until the year 2000, while
I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest the
country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called for
the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his
term.
	   The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below the expectations of
Communists who organized the protest together with trade unions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to 40 million
would take part.
	   Zyuganov on Thursday used the protest to renew his call on
Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``He and his clique are like a plastic bag wrapped around the
head of the nation to suffocate it, and they must be removed
immediately,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zyuganov said the Communists would begin picketing the
government buildings and launch ``actions of civil disobedience''
if Yeltsin doesn't step down. He also said the Duma is completing
preparation of the impeachment motion against the president and
would move to launch it soon.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president
``expressed regret'' over Seleznyov's referendum call.
	   Wednesday's protest showed that ``people are mostly concerned
with concrete problems such as wages, pensions and other social
payments, and the government is working to solve them,'' Yakushkin
said on Russia's ORT television.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he won't run again. The most likely candidates include Zyuganov,
regional governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.

Former Slovak president ready to stand for re-election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Former Slovak President Michal
Kovac said Thursday he is ready to run for re-election, provided
parliament changes the election system so the president is chosen
by the people.
	   ``If the parliament installs a direct vote of the president, I'm
ready to stand for re-election,'' Kovac said after talks with Czech
President Vaclav Havel.
	   Under the current law, the president is elected by parliament
and has to gain a three-fifth majority of votes.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since early March, after
Kovac's term ended and the deeply divided parliament failed to
elect a successor. The cabinet of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar
has assumed most of the presidential powers.
	   In the general election Sept. 25-26, the opposition gained 93
seats in the 150-seat parliament. A new governing coalition is
expected to be formed within a month.
	   ``The opposition would very much like to form a new government
before local elections in November,'' Kovac said.

China to let private companies make direct exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ To help boost waning export growth, China will
allow private companies to directly conduct foreign trade starting
next year, a government newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The new policy reflects growing government support for the
private sector, which traditionally has been neglected under
policies that favored state companies. Officials hope that private
companies can help absorb increasing numbers of workers laid off
from defunct state factories.
	   Privately owned manufacturing companies and science and research
institutes will be allowed to export their products beginning Jan.
1, 1999, said the International Business Daily, a newspaper
published by the Foreign Trade Ministry.
	   Under present policy, private companies must sell exports
through state-run trading companies.
	   The newspaper said that under the new policy, companies
intending to engage in direct exports must meet minimum capital
requirements.
	   Private companies should have registered capital and net assets
totaling at least 8.5 million yuan (dlrs 1.03 million), the report
said. They must also, for two consecutive years, have had annual
sales revenues above 50 million yuan (dlrs 6.05 million) and
revenues from exports conducted through trading companies totaling
at least dlrs 1 million.
	   Machinery and electronics makers must have had yearly revenues
of at least 30 million yuan (dlrs 3.63 million) and annual export
revenues of dlrs 500,000.
	   The Asian crisis has eroded demand for Chinese products, slowing
China's export growth to 5.5 percent in the first eight months of
this year compared with 21 percent growth in all of 1997.
	   China had 1 million privately owned companies at the end of June
this year, employing 14.6 million workers, according to government
figures.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ___
	   From ``Blindness,'' published in English last month.
	   ``Words are like that, they deceive, they pile up, it seems they
do not know where to go, and, suddenly, because of two or three or
four that suddenly come out, simple in themselves, a personal
pronoun, an adverb, a verb, an adjective, we have the excitement of
seeing them coming irresistibly to the surface through the skin and
the eyes and upsetting the composure of our feelings.''
	   From ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' published in English
in 1997.
	   ``My problem in this situation is to know whether I should have
blushed before or if I should be blushing now, I can recall having
seen you blush once, When, When I touched the rose in your office,
Women blush more easily than men, we're the weaker sex, Both sexes
are weak, I was also blushing, How come you know so much about the
weakness of the sexes, I know my own weakness, and something about
the weakness of others.''
	   An excerpt from ``The Stone Raft'' published in English in 1995.
	   ``The morning awoke overcast and drizzly, a familiar figure of
speech but one that is incorrect, because mornings do not awaken,
it is we who awaken in the mornings, and then, going to the window,
see that the sky is covered with low clouds and the rain is
drizzling down, tiresome for anyone caught in it, but such is the
power of tradition that if there were a ship's log book on this
journey of ours, the clerk would inscribe his first paean as
follows, The morning awoke overcast and drizzly, as if the skies
were gazing down with disapproval on this adventure, the skies are
always invoked in these instances, whether it rains or shines.''
	   From ``The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis'' published in
English in 1990.
	   ``Name, Ricardo Reis, age, 48, place of birth, Oporto, marital
status, bachelor, profession, doctor, last place of residence, Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil... It reads like the beginning of a confession,
an intimate autobiography, all that is hidden is contained in these
handwritten lines, the only problem is to interpret them.''
	   ``Nations struggle against each other on behalf of interests
that are not those of Jack or Pierre or Hans or Manolo or Giuseppe,
all masculine names to simplify matters, yet these and other men
innocently consider those interests to be theirs, or which will be
theirs at considerable cost, when the time arrives to settle
accounts. The rule is that some eat figs while others watch.''
	   From ``Baltasar and Blimunda'' published in English in 1987.
	   ``The flagellants move forward, unable to speak yet roaring like
rutting bulls, and if the women and mistresses feel that the
penitents are not flogging themselves with enough force to inflict
open wounds and draw blood for everyone to see, then the female
choir erupts into a hideous wailing, as if possessed, inciting the
men to greater violence. They want to hear the whips crack and see
the blood flow as it flowed from the Divine Saviour. Only then will
their bodies throb under their petticoats.''

Austrian skier to compete for Grenada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Jamaica has its bobsled team, Grenada now
has its one-woman skiing team.
	   Elfi Eder, the Austrian slalom star, has decided to compete for
Grenada after leaving the Austrian team in a dispute with the
country's skiing federation.
	   ``I want to become No. 1 again,'' said Eder, Olympic silver
medalist in 1994 in Lillehammer.
	   Eder also won the World Cup slalom title in the 1995-96 season
and was a bronze medalist at the 1993 World Championship in
Morioka, Japan.
	   But she missed last winter's World Cup season and the Nagano
Olympics because of her dispute with the Austrian Skiing
Federation, which objected to Eder's choice of a personal coach.
	   ``I had to find a new country so that I could continue doing my
job,'' Eder said. ``Otherwise, I would have had to give up my
sport.''
	   Eder suffered a knee injury in August and had to miss six weeks
of practice. She won't be ready for the World Cup season start on
Oct. 24 in Austria.
	   ``That's too early for me. I am concentrating on trying to
become fit in time for the November races,'' Eder told the Austrian
media this week.
	   Eder said her goal was to compete through the 2002 Olympics in
Salt Lake City.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT word to 'elusory' sted 'illusory' &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago,
whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off
and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the
1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to
Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory
reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languagaes.
	   In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God and the
devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus questions his own role.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   At the time the prize was announced, Saramago reportedly was on
an airplane headed to his home in the Canary Islands from the
international book fair in Frankfurt, Germany.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin held talks Thursday with
visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on the prospects for a
breakthrough in Middle East peace negotiations, officials said.
	   Arafat is on a two-day visit to Moscow in the wake of his
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Those talks raised hopes
that the stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   ``I welcome you and your comrades in arms and hope your visit
will be successful,'' Yeltsin told Arafat at the start of their
talks in the Kremlin.
	   Russian and Palestinian ministers also signed a
Russian-Palestinian agreement on trade and economic cooperation.
	   Arafat was also scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and other government officials, and with Russian Orthodox
Church leader Patriarch Alexy II.
	   ``Russian-Palestinian talks assume a special meaning in the
light of the difficult situation in the Middle East,'' Russian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said, according to
the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Arafat's meeting with Netanyahu on Wednesday made ``substantial
progress,'' according to Albright.
	   Palestinians were less optimistic, saying no agreements were
reached Wednesday except to continue talks in Washington on Oct.
15.
	   During the meeting with Yeltsin, Arafat invited Russia to take
part in the talks in Washington, and generally play a more active
role in the peace process, the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies
reported.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the Washington talks, but first wants to know the views of
Israel and the United States on the plan, Interfax reported, citing
Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko.

	   The peso closed higher against the U.S. dollar, buoyed by the
stronger yen and overall positive sentiment toward regional
currencies, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 37.66 points,
or 3.1 percent, to 1,250.41 following its 42.59-point surge
Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was 10.15 points higher at 414.26
after Wednesday's 11.46-point rise.
	   Kim Eng Securities research director Ricardo Puig said the stock
market was drawing strength from an apparent improvement in
investor sentiment following the yen's dramatic surge against the
dollar.
	   Major blue chips continued to rake in gains, with Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co. cornering more than a third of the
day's trades.
	   Overall, gainers beat losers 70 to 22, with 34 issues unchanged.
	   Wednesday's dollar free fall, according to currency dealers, was
triggered by positive market reaction to reports that Japan's
ruling party would be able to pass legislation in the current
session of Parliament to pump public money into ailing banks.
	   Puig said the direction of the yen and other regional currencies
in coming days will continue to influence the local stock market's
movements.
	   Nicholas Ty, analyst for Capital Securities One, said
businessmen's encouraging rating of President Joseph Estrada's
performance in office in the first 100 days of his term also helped
shares extend their gains.
	   Ty warned, however, that a sharp correction in the stock market
could ensue if Japan again fails to pass needed legislation to cure
its ailing banks.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.406 pesos for the
day, down half a percent from Wednesday's average of 43.643 pesos.
	   The dollar traded in a thin range of 43.300 pesos to 43.570
pesos and was last traded at 43.385 pesos.
	   The dollar lost 7.4 percent of its value against the yen
overnight Wednesday in its largest one-day decline since 1974.
	   Traders attributed the yen's gains to a confluence of factors,
including a possible new economic stimulus in Japan, nervousness
over U.S. financial markets and a realignment of funds toward Asia
due to uncertainties over the U.S. economy.
	   Traders expect the peso to continue to appreciate with the
strengthening of the yen.
	   The Philippine Central Bank was not active in the spot market
and held its overnight borrowing and lending rates at 14 percent
and 16 percent, respectively.

Tajik president, opposition leaders make progress in peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS deputy premier appointment in grafs 3-4.

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president and the
country's main opposition leader held talks on speeding up the
reconciliation process in the war-torn Central Asian nation, a
presidential spokesman said Thursday.
	   The meeting between President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition
leader Said Abdullo Nuri on Wednesday was ``fruitful and held in a
constructive atmosphere,'' said presidential spokesman Zafar
Saidov.
	   After lengthy negotiations during the meeting, Rakhmonov
appointed opposition member Zokir Vazirov to the post of deputy
prime minister for social issues and local governments, Saidov
said.
	   The appointment falls under a peace agreement that calls for 30
percent of government and local executive bodies be filled by
opposition members.
	   Rakhmonov and Nuri also discussed the investigation into the
September killing of a prominent opposition leader, as wells as
solidifying peace agreements in this poor, mountainous Central
Asian country.
	   In addition, they debated the peaceful disarmament of
independent bands of gunmen, who periodically launch attacks
outside Dushanbe. A deadline for them to turn over their weapons
expired Wednesday, but many have not done so.
	   Outbreaks of violence between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition still occur periodically in Tajikistan,
despite a peace agreement last year that ended five years of civil
war.

Iran reports clash with Taliban, Taliban denies it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background, CORRECTS that Afghan fighters on their
western border &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian forces clashed with Afghanistan's
Taliban militia Thursday on Iran's northeastern border, Iranian
television reported. But the Taliban denied any clash occurred.
	   Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in northeastern
Khorasan province with machine guns early Thursday and Iranian
border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to retreat,
the Iranian broadcast said.
	   Iran gave no immediate reports of casualties from the clash,
which it said occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in
the Saleh Abad region. The areas is about 180 kilometers (110
miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place.
	   ``We received this information and we checked from our people
and it is wrong,'' he said.
	   Contacted at the Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar,
Shakeel said, ``There is no truth in this report and it is
propaganda against the Taliban.''
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban and wants the
culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.''
	   It also has accused Iran of arming and financing its
northern-based opposition, which includes the country's minority
Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns, who are
mostly Sunni Muslims.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its western border with Iran.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

Westwood closes in on Montgomerie in Euro money title race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Lee Westwood ensured the battle
for European golf supremacy will go down to the last tournament
with a win at the Belgacom Open in Belgium on Oct. 4.
	   Westwood collected the 66,660 (dlrs 113,322) winners' purse to
narrow Colin Montgomerie's tour lead to 45,266 pounds (dlrs 76,951)
with only the 1 million pound (dlrs 1.7 million) Volvo Masters to
play.
	   With a 166,660 (dlrs 283,322) winners' purse up for Grabs at the
Volvo Masters in Spain starting Oct. 29, the European No. 1 title
is still wide open.
	   Montgomerie, European No. 1 for the last five years, holds the
record for prize money in a single season with 875,146 (dlrs
1,489,448) set in 1996.
	   He leads the tour with 760,077 (dlrs 1,292,131), with Westwood
in No. 2 spot on 714,812 (dlrs 1,215,180) and Darren Clarke in
third with 616,867 (dlrs 1,048,674).

	    &UR; Plane carrying defense minister makes emergency landing
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The plane carrying Bulgaria's defense
minister made an emergency landing after one of the aircraft's two
engines went out, an official said Thursday.
	   The accident occurred Tuesday, shortly after the two-propeller
Antonov-24 military aircraft took off from Sofia en route to
France, where Defense Minister Georgi Ananiev was to pay a visit.
	   After noticing the malfunction, the pilots circled Sofia for 1{
hours, using up the fuel on the plane. After the aircraft landed,
Ananiev boarded another plane for France.
	   ``Only the skill of the air force pilots prevented a crash,''
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Col. Miho Mihov said when announcing the
incident. He didn't say why it had not been reported earlier.
	   ``The equipment with which the Defense Ministry uses is too
outdated and there are no funds for repairs,'' Ananiev told the
state radio.
	   Emerging from an unprecedented economic crisis, Bulgaria has
implemented severe spending cuts that have eroded the army's
ability to replace or maintain its equipment.

90 percent of Singapore litterers nabbed for cigarette butts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Ninety percent of litterbugs apprehended in
clean-conscious Singapore are nabbed for tossing away cigarette
butts, the public health commissioner said Thursday.
	   The maximum fine is 1,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 610) for the
first littering offense, and twice that for subsequent infractions.
Litterers are also subjected to the somewhat humiliating experience
of cleaning public areas in brightly colored vests.
	   But the punishments don't seem to be much of a deterrent.
	   The Environment Ministry said in August that 5,858 people were
caught littering in the first half of 1998, nearly triple the
number from the same period last year.
	   Public Health Commissioner Wang Nan Chee suggested that smokers
carry small pill boxes for their used butts, to save themselves
money and keep the streets clean.
	   Of course, the Singapore government aims to make the
island-state cigarette-free someday. According to Wang's
statistics, that would also solve most of the littering problem.

Greece seeks to expand drug tests in basketball leagues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Drug testing in Greece's basketball
leagues may be expanded to include pre-season analyses and players
outside the top division, the head the Greek Basketball Federation
said Thursday.
	   Giorgos Vassilokopoulos told a planning meeting that the
proposals are intended to widen the scope of drug testing to Greek
and younger players.
	   Under the proposal, which will be discussed by the sport's
governing body later this year, all players in the 14-team A-1
league would be tested for illegal drugs at the beginning of the
season. Currently, only non-Greeks face pre-season testing in order
to obtain work permits.
	   Random testing would remain unchanged in the top division at
eight players per week. But the proposals call for random tests in
the lower A-2 division, Vassilokopoulos said.
	   The Greek top division is among the most competitive in Europe
with perennial powerhouses Panathinaikos and Olympiakos.
	   On Monday, a Puerto Rican national team member, Jose Ortiz, 35,
was banned for two years for testing positive for the steroid
Stanozolol. Ortiz, who played for PAOK Salonica, was tested during
the World Championships in August in Athens.

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid
started to move India out of early trouble Wednesday, leaving it at
87 for three at lunch on the second day of its one-off test against
Zimbabwe.
	   Dravid was unbeaten on 23 and Tendulkar was 17 not out,
including three boundaries in a short period, to creep India from
49 for three after 25.1 overs.
	   Zimbabwe captain Alastair Campbell stayed with his pace attack
of Henry Olonga, Heath Streak and Neil Johnson throughout the
session, except for one over from leg spinner Adam Huckle.
	   The strategy worked early, with Streak removing night watchman
Anil Kumble for 29 and Olonga, who had bowled Nayan Mongia on
Wednesday, nicked Navjot Sidhu's glove on the way through to
wicketkeeper Andy Flower, dismissing him for six.
	   India, which started the day resuming at six for one and chasing
Zimbabwe's first innings total of 221, was 22 for two when Sidhu
was eliminated, and then at 49 when Kumble went down.
	   India was furthered hampered when Johnson struck Dravid on the
right hand, which needed lengthy attention.
	   But Tendulkar arrived for the fourth wicket and changed the
tone. He hooked Olonga twice on successive balls, drove Johnson and
dabbed Streak past gully.

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank
Thursday in a lake in northeastern Spain, killing at least 20
people, most believed to be French retirees.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals, said Monica Estefania, a
spokeswoman for the local emergency services. It was not
immediately known how many people were hospitalized.
	   ``The problem is that the passengers are old folk and that makes
it difficult for them to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the
vessel's owners, La Carpa, told the national news agency Efe.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning as it set off to circle Lake
Banyoles, just north of Barcelona and some 350 miles (565
kilometers) northeast of Madrid, Efe said. Lake Banyoles is the
largest lake in the northeastern region of Catalonia.
	   The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying the boat split in two in
waters described as being between two and 15 meters (yards) deep.
	   The motor-powered vessel, launched a year ago, made some 50
trips daily on the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who was not
identified, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle, Estefania said.

ASEAN urges Japan to take bolder steps to revive economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations is urging Japan to take stronger steps to pull its economy
out of its worst recession in 50 years so it can help Southeast
Asian countries recover from the region's financial crisis.
	   ASEAN also urged major industrialized countries, particularly
the United States and Europe, to keep their markets open to exports
from the region to help its recovery.
	   In a report to ASEAN economic ministers, who finished two days
of meetings in Manila Thursday, ASEAN secretary-general Rodolfo
Severino said they should remind major industrialized nations ``of
their responsibilities'' to boost economies worldwide.
	   A copy of the report was obtained by The Associated Press.
	   ``Japan must take stronger steps to stimulate its economy and
provide economic leadership in Asia during this turbulent time,''
Severino said in the report.
	   ``Ministers must take every opportunity to convey to major
industrialized countries what their responsibilities are and what
our expectations are of how they can pull the global economy back
from this precipice,'' he said.
	   Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, who attended
the meetings, earlier said Southeast Asian nations' exports to
Japan fell sharply after the Japanese economy slipped into
recession.
	   He was unable to give exact figures on the region's overall
export decline but said Thailand's exports to Japan shrank by 16 to
17 percent in the first half of 1998.
	   Japan's economic troubles and the export decline were discussed
by ASEAN officials Tuesday. ASEAN countries were discussing the
drop in exports with Japan individually, Supachai said.
	   In their meetings, ASEAN trade officials also agreed to hasten
plans to demolish trade barriers in the region to encourage
business and investment and help Asia recover.

Iran reports clash with Afghanistan militia, Taliban denies it

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian forces clashed Thursday with
Afghanistan's Taliban militia on Iran's northeastern border,
Iranian television reported. But the Taliban denied that the
tensions between the forces had escalated into a battle.
	   Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in northeastern
Khorasan province with machine guns early Thursday and Iranian
border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to retreat,
the Iranian broadcast said.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban and wants the
culprits handed over for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.'' It also has accused Iran of supporting its
opposition.
	   Iran gave no immediate reports of casualties from the clash,
which it said occurred at 6:30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in
the Saleh Abad region. The areas is about 180 kilometers (110
miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place.
	   ``We received this information and we checked from our people
and it is wrong,'' he said.
	   Contacted at the Taliban headquarters in southern Kandahar,
Shakeel said, ``There is no truth in this report and it is
propaganda against the Taliban.''
	   The Taliban religious militia, made up largely of Sunni Muslims,
has accused Iran's Shiite clerical regime of arming and financing
its northern-based opposition, which includes the country's
minority Shiite Muslims.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its western border with Iran.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of parliament on Thursday suggested
holding a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal appears to violate Russian law.
	   ``It would be legitimate to hold such a referendum,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who serves as speaker of the lower
house, the State Duma. His remarks were reported by the Interfax
news agency.
	   However, Russian law specifically states that there may not be a
referendum on the early termination of a president's term.
	   Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning
voluntarily following nationwide protests on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve out his
full term. During a meeting with senior military and security
officers, he said he would maintain personal control over the
military.
	   ``And it will be like that, at least, until the year 2000, while
I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest the
country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called for
the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his
term.
	   The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below the expectations of
Communists who organized the protest together with trade unions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to 40 million
would take part.
	   Zyuganov on Thursday used the protest to renew his call on
Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``He and his constitution are like a plastic bag wrapped around
the head of the nation to suffocate it, and they must be removed
immediately,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zyuganov said the Communists would begin picketing the
government buildings and launch ``actions of civil disobedience''
if Yeltsin doesn't step down. He also said the Duma is completing
preparation of the impeachment motion against the president and
would move to launch it soon.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president
``expressed regret'' over Seleznyov's referendum call.
	   Wednesday's protest showed that ``people are mostly concerned
with concrete problems such as wages, pensions and other social
payments, and the government is working to solve them,'' Yakushkin
said on Russia's ORT television.
	   ``Calls for referendums ... will only excessively politicize
society and distract us from dealing with concrete tasks,'' he
said.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he won't run again. The most likely candidates include Zyuganov,
regional governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concern about a possible NATO
airstrike sent convoys of U.S. and diplomats out of Belgrade on
Thursday, as Washington ordered its senior Balkan envoy back to the
Yugoslav capital for new talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke to return after briefing her and NATO
officials in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of three days of
talks with Milosevic. NATO officials said Holbrooke would be in the
Yugoslav capital by Thursday afternoon.
	   Holbrooke's new attempt to persuade Milosevic to heed world
demands by ending the anti-separatist offensive and sharply
curtailing troops and police in Kosovo came amid new signs of
opposition from some NATO members to an attack without further
diplomatic efforts.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' said Italian Premier Romano Prodi. His
comments were apparently meant to gain the support of
anti-interventionist Communists ahead of a Friday confidence vote
in the Italian parliament.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his session with
Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said
Milosevic warned that threats of NATO airstrikes only dim the
chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a conference of the so-called
Contact Group countries: the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   Russia strongly opposes use force to resolve the crisis, and
Ivanov is expected to deliver that message when he meets Albright
in London. A joint statement after the Ivanov-Milosevic meeting
said ``military threats against Yugoslavia are unacceptable.''
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said the world must unite in telling Milosevic ``that we won't
tolerate the atrocities carrying on.''
	   In the Yugoslav capital, about 20 vehicles carrying diplomats
and their families from the United States, Britain and Australia
left for the Hungarian capital Budapest, where they will remain
until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to force
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
international demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb
troops, and the return of refugees to their villages, Washington
lacks the international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into
compliance.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence. Hundreds have been killed
and more than 270,000 people have been driven from their homes
since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 against the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Following the Wednesday meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic's
office issued a statement saying ``attempts were made to overcome
the differences'' over Kosovo.
	   ``The threats, which are delivered to our country, jeopardize
the continuation of the political process,'' the statement added.
Milosevic has claimed to have fulfilled international demands to
withdraw troops and end the fighting.
	   But on Thursday, reporters near Malisevo, a former stronghold of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, heard the sounds of mortar and heavy
machine-gun fire, indicating continued fighting. Villagers in the
region said they were also at threat from snipers.
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage out of the
country for Selman Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last
week in which 13 other ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot
and killed by Serb police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, wounded in the leg, left Wednesday with 10 family
members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes investigators in
The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S. official speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia on Wednesday announced measures that brought the country
nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbia's government on Wednesday ordered independent media to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs or face prosecution.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian forces clashed with Afghanistan's

media reported. But the Taliban denied any clash occurred.
	   Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in northeastern
Khorasan province with mortars and machine guns early Thursday and
Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to

	   The Taliban suffered heavy casualties during the three hour
clash and three of the militia's border posts were destroyed, Brig.
Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground forces of Iran's
elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said. His remarks were
carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   ``The situation in the area is currently calm,'' Jaafari said.
	   There were no immediate reports of any Iranian casualties.
	   The clash occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in
the Saleh Abad region. The area is about 180 kilometers (110 miles)

ASEAN ministers propose `bold' measures to counter financial

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian trade ministers
proposed a set of ``bold new measures'' Thursday aimed at restoring
economic confidence in the region, saying the sharp cuts in trade
and investment barriers they approved a day earlier were not
enough.
	   The measures must still be studied and accepted by each
government. If approved, they would be announced at a summit of
leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in
December, the ministers said.
	   On Wednesday, the ASEAN trade ministers had set targets for
reducing regional trade and investment barriers to help Asia
recover from its 15-month-old financial storm.
	   But they decided that additional measures were needed because of
alarm over a sharp drop in foreign investment in the region, an
ASEAN official said. The ministers realized they needed to respond
quickly because of strong international competition for investors,
he added.
	   Foreign investment has fallen by 33.6 percent for the nine ASEAN
countries since Asia's financial crisis erupted in July 1997, he
said.
	   Philippine trade secretary Jose Pardo said the ministers hope
the new measures can convince investors ``to return to the ASEAN
investment scene as soon as possible.''
	   He said the measures would cover trade, tourism and investment,
and could include new incentives and a further acceleration of
liberalization.
	   Asked if they were really bold, Malaysian trade minister Rafidah
Aziz replied: ``Under normal circumstances not all of us would be
moved to accept them. In that sense they're certainly bold.''
	   The trade ministers also urged Japan to reform and resuscitate
its economy and provide leadership for an economic recovery in the
region. They asked rich countries in North America and Europe to
keep their markets open to Asian exports.
	   Earlier in the week, ASEAN set a goal of completely eliminating
tariffs for many products traded in the region by the year 2003,
instead of the previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5
percent by that year.
	   As a result, average tariffs will fall from 5.37 percent this
year to 2.68 percent in 2003, it said.
	   ASEAN also agreed to accelerate tariff cuts for some sensitive
agricultural products, such as rice and sugar, after Indonesia
offered to eliminate all tariffs on rice by the year 2010 within
the region.
	   On Wednesday, the trade ministers signed an agreement creating
an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove barriers to investment
from ASEAN countries by the year 2010 and by 2020 for investment
from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country will be
granted the same investment rights as local citizens in other ASEAN
countries in which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions if a country's
constitution limits equal treatment.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN officials had earlier said that foreign investment in the
region had dropped by 50 percent from the first half of 1997 to the
first half of this year, but later revised the figure to 33.6
percent after Vietnam submitted new trade figures.

Has the shooting stopped? It's hard to verify
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; UPDATES with sounds of fighting near Malisevo
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government says the fighting has
stopped in Kosovo. But the ethnic Albanians driven into the hills
from this village 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, say otherwise.
	   The shelling and shooting comes morning and evening, they say.
Serb police maintain a heavy presence throughout the area. Their
main purpose appears to be to intimidate the refugees and prevent
them from returning to their homes.
	   Police, on the other hand, claim it is the Kosovo Liberation
Army, loosely organized bands of ethnic Albanian guerrillas
fighting for independence, that is shooting at them, keeping the
situation tense in the area of the government's most recent
offensive.
	   Hundreds of people have died in seven months of open conflict in
this largely Albanian province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.
	   There is no way to check out the conflicting claims of fighting,
no fighting, and who started what, where. But clearly, some clashes
continue.
	   Reporters near Malisevo on Friday heard the thud of mortar
rounds and the chatter of heavy machine-gun fire, and villagers in
the area about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) southwest of
Pristina, the provincial capital, said they were at threat by
nearby snipers.

Dutch approve Air Force participation in NATO strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The government Thursday approved
the use of 16 Air Force F-16 fighter planes in possible NATO
airstrikes, removing the last hurdle to Dutch participation in the
Kosovo crisis.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok's coalition had already told NATO the
fighters and a refueling plane would be made available. Thursday's
approval _ given after a special Cabinet meeting _ formalized that
decision.
	   NATO is preparing to strike at strategic Serb targets if
diplomatic efforts fail to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanian
secessionists in Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in the province and more
than 270,000 driven from their homes since Milosevic launched his
offensive in late February.

Rescue services say 20 tourists killed as boat sinks in lake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; UPDATES with French consulate saying some 40
injured; ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank
in a lake in northeastern Spain, and at least 20 French tourists
died, an emergency services official said.
	   The boat sank at 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) in Lake Banyoles near the
city of Girona, 350 miles (560 kilometers) northeast of Madrid,
said Monica Estefania, a spokeswoman for the local emergency
services.
	   It was not yet known what caused the boat to sink, she said.
With weather clear and the lake water apparently calm, the vessel
was just setting off on a trip around the lake when it sank, news
reports said.
	   As marine and firefighting units scoured the water and the
wreckage of the boat for more bodies, the French consulate in the
nearby regional captial of Barcelona said their reports indicated
more than 40 people were being treated in hospital while over 70
were uninjured in the accident.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled out of the water into small rowing boats.
	   The injured were reported to have been taken to Josepa Trueta
hospital in the nearby city of Girona.
	   French Consul General in Barcelona Pierre Charasse went
immediately to Banyoles to help coordinate the rescue operation and
deal with survivors and relatives.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals, Estefania, the rescue
services spokeswoman, said.
	   ``The problem is that the passengers are old folk and that makes
it difficult for them to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the La
Carpa firm that owned the vessel told the national news agency Efe.
	   The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying the boat split in two in
waters described as being between two and 15 meters (yards) deep.
	   The electrically-powered vessel, launched earlier this year,
made some 50 trips daily on the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who
was not identified, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle and were staying at the
seaside resort town of Lloret de Mar.
	   Lake Banyoles, is 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) long and is up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with report that Saramago taken off
plane before departure from Germany, ADD details on latest
translated novel, ADD that he is first laureate to write in
Portuguese. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago,
whose capricious vision includes a section of Europe breaking off
and floating out to sea, on Thursday was named the winner of the
1998 Nobel Literature Prize.
	   In its citation, the Swedish Academy said it gave the award to
Saramago for work that ``with parables sustained by imagination,
compassion and irony continually enables us to apprehend an elusory
reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into
English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind,
and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale
of social collapse.
	   In 1991's ``The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,'' God and the
devli negotiate about evil, and Jesus tries to back out of his
crucifixion.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to
write in Portuguese.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _
where he was attending the international book fair _ for his home
in the Canary Islands. But Portuguese state radio said he was taken
off the plane before departure and driven back to the fair, where a
crowd wa waiting for him.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate and Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Occt. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

Malaysian official: Anwar's arrest won't scare investors away
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The arrest of former Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim won't lead to massive social unrest or
frighten away investors, Malaysia's trade minister said Thursday.
	   Anwar was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2
after the two differed on economic policy. He then began speaking
out against Mahathir and was arrested Sept. 20.
	   ``Frankly speaking there is no reason to say that just because
one man was arrested for something ... that it should bring any
unrest,'' trade minister Rafidah Aziz said.
	   ``Leaders come and go. ... They even get sacked in all countries
of the world. They even die,'' she told a news conference in
Manila, where she attended a meeting of Association of Southeast
Asian Nations economic ministers.
	   Rafidah said there have only been a few demonstrations in
Malaysia over Anwar's arrest, all of them ``orchestrated.''
	   In recent visits to Chicago, New York, Houston and Boston, she
said potential investors asked her about Anwar's arrest but were
still interested in investing in Malaysia.
	   Anwar said police beat him in custody. In recent appearances in
court, where he is facing charges of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts, he was seen with a black eye and a neck brace.
	   At least two ASEAN leaders, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
and Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, have spoken out against
Anwar's treatment.
	   The Philippine leader said he was considering skipping a summit
of Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November to protest the
arrest of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
	   He later said he would attend the summit and had only made the
earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar.
	   The Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia are founding member
countries of ASEAN, which also includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Athens race: mayor versus political machine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY102,121 &QL; 
 &UR; By THEODORA TONGAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ There are a few more trees in Athens, some
stretches of smooth sidewalk, a car-free shopping zone and one
quite comfortable mayor.
	   Dimitris Avramopoulos, a former diplomat now running city hall,
has built a wide base of support by doing what his predecessors
could not: appear to tame Greece's unruly capital.
	   Now there's another giant challenge. The powerful Socialist
party wants him out.
	   The outcome of the mayoral race _ part of nationwide municipal
elections on Sunday _ is being closely watched as a possible
bellwether for even bigger stakes in the future.
	   The expected Avramopoulos victory could be his final stepping
stone to a shot at the leadership of the main opposition New
Democracy party. New Democracy, which has been in power only three
of the past 17 years, is presently led by the less charismatic
Costas Caramanlis.
	   But an upset victory by challenger Maria Damanaki, of the
governing Socialist party, could prove a crippling blow to
Avramopoulos' image, turning him from potential savior to pariah
among conservatives.
	   ``In these four years, Athens has begun to regain its lost
appearance, to obtain an identity, to strengthen its international
authority, to undertake initiatives, to be more clean,''
Avramopoulos as he campaigned for a second four-year term under the
slogan ``The Battle for Athens.''
	   Ms. Damanaki, a well-known political activist, says Avramopoulos
is trying to turn Athens into ``Disneyland,'' and his politics lack
true depth.
	   Avramopoulos ignores ``the wounds of the capital,'' Ms. Damanaki
cried at a rally in central Athens.
	   Ms. Damanaki has canvassed far-flung neighborhoods and made
rounds of speeches. But she's yet to confront Avramopoulos face to
face.
	   The mayor has chosen to make no public campaign appearances and
has erected only a few banners. A massive sign in Athens' main
square promises to give the homeless the money saved by not
campaigning.
	   In the homestretch, Avramopoulos seems unstoppable. Some voter
polls give him a more than 3-to-1 edge over Ms. Damanaki, who first
emerged as the voice of the student uprising against the 1967-74
military dictatorship.
	   The poll figures also offer a possible lesson to other
politicians in Greece, where scant attention has been paid to
quality-of-life issues in the frenzy to modernize.
	   Athens has grown five-fold in the past 30 years _ mushrooming
from a cozy city around the Acropolis to a smog-choked metropolis
that is home to half the country's 10.2 million people.
	   Across the country in the 900 mayoral and 187 other local
government elections Sunday, the outcome will serve as a litmus
test for Premier Costas Simitis' harsh austerity policies aimed at
getting Greece into the European Union single currency group by
2001.
	   Conservatives have waged strong mayoral campaigns in key cities
such as Pireaus and could unseat Socialist incumbents.
	   But Simitis has weathered the brunt of anti-belt tightening
protests so far and the Socialists still seem capable of easily
winning national elections in 2000. This could set up a chance for
Avramopoulos to grab the opposition leadership and challenge the
Socialists in 2004, when Athens hosts the summer Olympic Games.
	   Avramopoulos refuses to publicly discuss his long-range
political goals, preferring instead to concentrate on pushing
visible changes.
	   He created a new flag for the city, hired municipal police with
bright uniforms, built nearly 20 water fountains, planted trees and
replaced nearly 95,000 square meters (342,000 square feet) of
sidewalk. A pedestrian shopping district opened this year and plans
are also under way to build garages to alleviate the city's chronic
traffic problems.
	   He has erected Europe's tallest Christmas ``tree'' _ actually
strings of lights attached to a pole _ and hosted hundreds of
cultural events.
	   But critics accuse him attempting to make cosmetic changes
without first dealing with the underlying problems of a city grown
too big too fast.
	   ``Surely the changes are impressive,'' said Athens historian
Sarantos Kargakos. ``They remind me of the ornaments we put on
graves in cemeteries ... the real Athens is sinking and this mayor
is preparing an appropriate funeral.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's chief military commander in
Europe said Thursday the alliance was still leaving Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic a window of opportunity to change his
mind and withdraw troops from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes.
	   In an intense round of talks, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, NATO Secretary Javier Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark, were in
Brussels to asses the chances of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
	   NATO's military officials have repeatedly said it is ready to
launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green light. In the
meantime the alliance kept looking Thursday for a belated change of
mind on Milosevic's part.
	   ``This is a period in which we are still assessing compliance,
and President Milosevic is obviously making up his mind whether he
is going to fully comply,'' said Clark.
	   Albright sent Holbrooke back to Belgrade Thursday and the envoy
canceled a meeting with the NATO council.
	   NATO has said that troop and special police levels in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo's province had decreased from 36,000 10 days
ago to some 25,000 by Wednesday, but such levels were still
unacceptable. There was also evidence many were hunkering down for
the winter.
	   If there is no swift and irreversible change in the pace of
withdrawal, NATO officials said, airstrikes will become inevitable.
	   By Thursday noon, NATO had had no new reports on withdrawals,
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   NATO has been preparing plans for months to launch airstrikes
and is now awaiting member approval to put them into operation.
	   ``All plans are still ready to go,'' said Clark.
	   Solana has stressed the 16-nation Alliance did not need the
backing from the United Nations to launch air strikes against
Yugoslavia and had enough legal backing for such an operation.

Palestinian killed in clashes with Israeli troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Palestinian removed from life support and
declared dead, army comment; EDITS throughout to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes Thursday, killing a
20-year-old man and seriously injuring a news photographer.
	   The death raised the specter of new violence at a time when the
United States is trying to conclude an agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Schools and shops were closed.
	   Israel lifted the blockade on Thursday morning, but the curfew
remained in force, confining 30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes broke out Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector.
	   Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt.
	   Several Palestinian news photographers and cameramen moved
closer to film those injured when troops fired more rubber bullets.
	   Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer on assignment for the Agence
France Presse news agency, was struck in the forehead and was taken
to a nearby hospital. Doctors said Abu Alan suffered a skull
fracture and was in serious condition.
	   An Israeli army captain, who could only be identified by his
first name, Simon, told reporters that Israeli soldiers do not
target journalists. Capt. Simon said that he was told by soldiers
that Abu Alan was not recognizable as a photographer.
	   Abu Alan wore a photographer's vest and had a camera slung
around his neck when he was hit.
	   In later clashes, a 20-year-old Palestinian, Amjad Natche, was
struck in the head by a rubber bullet. He was put on life support,
but was removed several hours later and declared dead, said Dr.
Jihad Bader of Hebron's Ahli Hospital.
	   Natche lived in Jordan and had been in Hebron for several weeks
to visit relatives. It was not immediately clear whether Natche was
throwing stones or watching the clashes when he was hit.
	   After he was pronounced dead, dozens of relatives and friends
carried his body, wrapped in a white sheet and draped with
Palestinian flags, to the morgue of nearby Alia Hospital. The
funeral was only to be held once his family arrives from Jordan.
	   Thursday's general strike was called by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement to protest the closure and curfew
imposed Sept. 30 when two dozen Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were injured by two hand grenades.
	   A Fatah leaflet distributed in Hebron this week also urged
activists to throw stones at Israeli soldiers on Friday.
	   About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in downtown
Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and protected by
large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

No sign of Kurdish rebels in eastern Lebanon camp site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ A training camp that was once used as a
base for Kurdish rebels in eastern Lebanon is now nothing but a
barn, residents and news reports said Thursday.
	   Turkey contends that Kurdish Turkish rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's
Kurdistan Workers' Party (or PKK) have training camps here and also
accuses Syria of aiding the Kurds.
	   It has sent troops to its border with Syria to press its case,
prompting fears of a military confrontation. Syria denies the
charge.
	   Turkish news reports have speculated that Ankara could attack
alleged Kuridsh bases in Lebanon's Syrian-controlled eastern Bekaa
Valley.
	   Residents of the Bekaa villages of Yanta and Halwa, about four
kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Syrian border on the northern
foothills of Mount Hermon, said Thursday that there had been no
sign of Kurdish rebel presence in the area for several years.
	   The villagers, all speaking on condition of anonymity, did not
rule out that the Kurds moved elsewhere in the barren mountains of
Anti-Lebanon that form the border with Syria.
	   A reporter for the leading An-Nahar newspaper who managed to
visit the camp said outgrown weeds were the only sign of life
there. A portrait of Ocalan lay covered with dust.
	   Part of the camp has been turned into a barn used for cattle,
said the An-Nahar report Thursday.
	   Another report in the same paper said Ocalan was last seen at
the camp in 1992 when he spoke to reporters and took part in a
Kurdish folk dance as he clutched an automatic rifle.
	   The camp, which at its peak graduated up to 400 fighters every
four months, has since been abandoned and the Lebanese army used it
briefly, An-Nahar said.
	   Villagers said Palestinians of the radical Syrian-backed Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command were at one
point seen in the area after the Kurds had left.
	   On Monday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz said Lebanon
and Syria took measures more than 1 1/2 years ago to stop the
activities of Ocalan's PKK.

	   NISHIKAMO, Japan (AP) _ Second-year pro Takeo Nogami fired a
4-under-par 68 Thursday, taking a one-stroke first-round lead in
the 110 million yen (dlrs 894,000) Tokai Classic.
	   The 27-year-old Nogami, seeking his first victory on the pro

	   Kaname Yokoo and Nobumitsu Yuhara both shot 69.
	   Shigeki Maruyama, seeking his second PGA Tour victory this
season, shot a 70 and was tied for fourth with three other Japanese
_ Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, Hideki Kase and Masao Suzuki.
	   At 71, British Open runner-up Brian Watts of the United States
shared eighth place with Taiwan's Yeh Chang-ting and three Japanese
_ Shinichi Yokota, Koki Idoki and Yasunori Ida.
	   Hidemichi Tanaka, who won the Japan Open last week, shot a 73
and shared 18th place with Mark Calcavecchia of the United States
and 10 other Japanese.
	   A total of 120 players, including 18 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather.
	   The winner will receive 19.8 million yen (dlrs 161,000).

Singapore unions prepare for wage, pension fund cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Union leaders indicated Thursday that
across-the-board wage cuts and a 50 percent reduction in the amount
of money employers and workers pay into government-controlled
pension funds could be in the cards for Singaporeans.
	   The aim is reduce wage costs 15 to 20 percent, government
television quoted union leaders as saying.
	   Lim Boon Heng, head of the National Trades Union Council and a
member of the Cabinet, said that a 10 percentage point cut in the
amount of money employers are required to pay into their workers'
Central Provident Fund pension accounts would save dlrs 4 billion.
	   Employees now pay 20 percent of their wages into the
government-managed funds, and the employers match that amount.
Under discussion is a proposal to cut both contributions by half.
	   No firm announcements were made. But in line with Singapore
tradition, officials made comments intended to prepare workers for
changes.
	   They are expected at the end of October, when a national
committee on competitiveness makes a report on how the country of
3.2 million can weather the regional economic crisis.
	   Singapore's unions cooperate with the government and businesses.
	   Hawazi Daipi, director of international affairs for the union
council, said on government television that workers who had
questioned the policy of ``wage restraint,'' adopted earlier this
year, now agree that the only way to save jobs is to accept cuts in
wages and pension fund contributions.
	   ``A package of wage sacrifices is needed to save jobs in the
economic downturn, to contribute to Singapore's overall
competitiveness,'' government television quoted the union officials
as saying.

Ukraine's government to consider new monetary policies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma criticized Thursday
the central bank's efforts to overcome Ukraine's growing financial
crisis and said the government would soon consider possible changes
to its monetary policies.
	   Kuchma said the Cabinet and the National Bank must come up with
new measures to support the national hryvna currency when a
government delegation returns from talks with the International
Monetary Fund on Friday.
	   The delegation, led by Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko, was
in Washington to participate in the annual meeting of the IMF and
the World Bank.
	   Ukraine, whose economy suffered following the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union, was dealt a new blow recently by the economic
crisis in neighboring Russia, its main trading partner.
	   The crisis has hurt Ukrainian exports, led to a withdrawal of
investors and caused the hryvna to lose more than 50 percent of its
value in September alone.
	   The hryvna, which traded at about 2.1 to the U.S. dollar before
the crisis hit in mid-August, slipped to 3.4 on Wednesday, nearly
breaching the lower limit of a government-set trading band.
	   Many analysts believe the hryvna is being artificially supported
by regulations forcing exporters to sell half of their foreign
currency earnings on the currency exchange.
	   Some recently predicted the hryvna is bound to fall as low as 6
to the dollar, which led Ukrainians to start stocking up on food,
clothing and household goods.
	   Many commercial banks have also complained that the National
Bank was not selling them all the dollars they wanted.
	   Kuchma said the National Bank's pre-crisis policy of spending
reserves to support the hryvna was ``not far-sighted.''
	   ``Many people wanted to show that Ukraine's hryvna could be more
stable than the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen,'' Kuchma told a
meeting of regional authorities.
	   Kuchma said the government should think of new anti-crisis
steps, given the sharp devaluation of the hryvna and payment
problems many Ukrainian enterprises have encountered because of the
crisis.
	   He suggested a decrease in government spending and less of the
foreign borrowing to which the government has resorted in recent
years to finance the budget deficit.
	   Kuchma said Ukraine owes dlrs 10.24 billion to its foreign
creditors, including dlrs 2.4 billion for natural gas from
Turkmenistan and Russia.

Former sex slaves criticize results of Japan-South Korea summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A civic group representing South
Korean women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military
during World War II rejected Japan's latest apology Thursday.
	   The apology was contained in an agreement signed in Tokyo by
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi.
	   While the agreement apologized for Japan's 35-year colonial rule
of South Korea, it didn't satisfy the Korean Council for the Women
Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan.
	   ``We are seriously disappointed, because the joint announcement
doesn't even mention the issue of comfort women,'' the council said
in a statement.
	   Comfort women is a euphemistic term for hundreds of thousands of
Asian women forced into sexual slavery for Japanese soldiers at
front-line brothels during World War II.
	   ``The Japanese government has apologized several times, and it
was all lip service,'' the statement said. ``An apology without
government compensation is not a true apology.''
	   Activist groups want the Japanese government to compensate the
former sex slaves. Japan set up the private Asia Women's Fund in
1995 to dole out financial assistance to the women.
	   But the fund's offer of dlrs 17,000 to each surviving victim was
rejected by most South Koreans, who demand that any compensation
come directly from the Japanese government.
	   South Korea was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.
	   Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 women from Korea and
other Asian nations were taken to Japanese army brothels during
World War II. Some 150 South Koreans are registered as former sex
slaves.

German Greens split over NATO strikes in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Greens party, which is about to
enter the national government, argued publicly Thursday about
conditions for NATO strikes in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   The rift between pragmatists and pacifists in the small party
presents the first major test for Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder, who meets U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington on
Friday.
	   Greens defense expert Angelika Beer demanded a clear U.N.
mandate for German warplanes to take part in any airstrikes.
	   ``We want to keep NATO from giving itself a mandate,'' she told
the Flensburger Tageblatt newspaper.
	   Germany faces ``enormous international pressure'' to take part
in an attack, but the priority should be to join with Russia in
stepping up diplomatic pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, she said.
	   Another Greens lawmaker, Helmut Lippelt, took a tougher
approach. Warning of a looming ``humanitarian disaster'' in Kosovo,
he urged the party to take a stand now that they're getting into
government.
	   ``We have to avoid a split vote as in earlier times, when we
debated until midnight,'' he said.
	   Joschka Fischer, the leading Greens moderate and probably
Germany's new foreign minister, has avoided commenting on Kosovo in
recent days. He was joining Schroeder on the visit to Washington.
	   Schroeder has said he wants a new U.N. mandate for NATO strikes
in Kosovo, but he has left open the possibility that Germany would
take part under the existing mandate if the crisis worsens.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, invited the Greens to join his
government as junior partner after his victory in Sept. 27
elections.

Rescue services say 20 tourists killed as boat sinks in lake

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank
Thursday in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain, killing at least
20 people, most believed to be French retirees.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals, said Monica Estefania, a
spokeswoman for the local emergency services. It was not
immediately known how many people were hospitalized.
	   ``The problem is that the passengers are old folk and that makes
it difficult for them to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the
vessel's owners, La Carpa, told the national news agency Efe.
	   As rescuers units scoured the water and the wreckage for more
bodies, the French consulate in nearby Barcelona said more than 40
people were hospitalized. Another 70 people escaped without injury.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled into small rowing boats.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of
Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid,
Efe said.
	   The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying the boat split in two.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips daily on
the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who was not identified, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from La Rochelle and were staying at the
seaside resort town of Lloret de Mar.
	   Lake Banyoles, is 2 kilometers (1.5 miles) long and is up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Outrage in Israel over soccer star's kick in the jaw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ There were plenty of news in Israel, as usual _
a record dollar rate, Mideast summit plans. But outrage over
Israeli soccer star Eyal Berkovic getting kicked in the jaw by a
West Ham team mate relegated everything else to the sidelines
Thursday.
	   The Maariv daily's front-page was covered by a photo of Berkovic
kneeling and cringing in pain as West Ham player John Hartson's
left foot struck his jaw.
	   ``The scream of pain,'' read the Maariv caption.
	   ``It's shocking to see such a thing, especially if it's your own
son,'' said Berkovic' father, Zeev.
	   ``At first I felt Hartson should be prosecuted, but Eyal decided
not to complain to the police. He wasn't so badly hurt. He's
alright now, and that's the main thing for me,'' Berkovic told The
Associated Press.
	   The Israeli national team gave Berkovic a warm welcome as he
arrived in San Marino for a game that pitches Israel against the
tiny European nation in a qualifying round for the European
Championships.
	   Angriest was Israeli midfielder Haim Revivo. ``Hartson is lucky
he didn't do it to me,'' Revivo told the Haaretz daily. ``He
wouldn't be playing football by now. Believe me.''
	   Israeli media quoted Berkovic was saying he would not submit a
complaint to the police against Hartson.
	   ``Believe me he would go to jail, but I don't want a player from
my team sent to prison,'' Haaretz quoted Berkovic as saying.
	   The Israeli player accused West Ham of trying to cover up the
incident and said he would have to consider whether to remain with
the club.
	   However, he rejected Hartson's claim that he was merely using
the incident as a pretext for leaving the English club, Haaretz
said. Berkovic told the daily he would return to West Ham as soon
as the San Marino event was over.
	   The English Football Association has asked West Ham for the
video tape with a view to studying it and considering measures
against Hartson. West Ham reportedly prefers to settle the issue
internally on the grounds that the incident occurred in training,
not in a match.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government has agreed to immediate
increases of 22 percent in the price of bread and 17 percent in
that of maize meal, setting the stage for further unrest in
Zimbabwe.
	   In January, a temporary 30 percent increase in the price of
maize meal, triggered by increases in prices charged millers by the
para-statal Grain Marketing Board, led to three days of food riots
in which at least eight people died.
	   Isidore Zindoga, acting secretary general of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trades Unions, said the country's 1.2 million formal
sector workers would demand immediate 20 percent increments to
compensate for ``such massive increases as have been advised to
us.''
	   The state-controlled daily, the Herald, reported the latest
increases on Thursday. They include a 18.6 percent increase on the
price of another staple, cooking oil.
	   They came amid talks Wednesday between officials and
industrialists. Industrialists said they were on the verge of
ceasing production due to 20 percent increases in electricity
prices, 41.5 minimum interest charges, and at least 60 percent
increases in the cost of all imported goods, which came because of
the collapse of the local currency.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos is to visit China from Oct. 12-16, according to a report
here Thursday.
	   His last official visit to Beijing was in 1988, 5 years after
the former Portuguese colony established diplomatic relations with
China, the Portuguese
	   news agency Lusa said.
	   Dos Santos was to travel to Beijing and other parts of China,
accompanied
	   by a dozen members of the Angolan government, according to Lusa.
	   --
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Three Peruvians were arrested in
Cape Town as suspects in a 2.5 million rand (dlrs 417,000) diamond
heist at a jewelry store, police said Thursday.
	   The men, from Lima, Peru, were arrested shortly before midnight
Tuesday, 12 hours after the theft in Cape Town's trendy Victoria
and Alfred Waterfront, said police Capt. Andre Traut.
	   Traut identified the suspects as Manuel Masse, 44; and Carlos
Paz and Cesar Velasco, both 42.
	   They were arrested near the scene of the crime and after police
and Waterfront security staff scanned all video footage in the
complex and its entrances.
	   Traut said the men would appear in court later Thursday.
	   Five thieves robbed the store in broad daylight Tuesday. They
forced the staff to open the safe but did not display weapons,
police have said.
	   Traut said detectives hope to make two additional arrests soon.
	   The diamonds have not been recovered.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Trees will be used to reinvigorate
infertile farmland in a project run by an international
agroforestry institute and a humanitarian organization, the
institute's chairman said Thursday.
	   The project in Zambia aims to introduce about 12,000 smallholder
farmers to improved tree and shrub fallows, which hold nitrogen in
the soil, solving the problem of soil fertility and increasing the
availability of fuel wood, said Pedro Sanchez, head of the
International Center for Research in Agroforestry.
	   World Vision International helped design the project.
	   Sanchez said the first project is being implemented in Zambia in
an area where declining fertility has been resulting in poor yields
and food shortages.
	   Sanchez spoke to reporters at the end of a five-day meeting of
agricultural researchers and development specialists to look into
ways to improve food security and income among poor farmers in
Africa.

Report: Dong devaluation would do more harm than good
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Any large devaluation of Vietnam's dong
currency should be considered only as a short-term measure because
it would do harm in the long run, the newspaper Investment said
Thursday.
	   The paper cited a roughly 6.5 percent devaluation in August,
taken by the government to spur exports and curb imports. But it
put more pressure on inflation and some local industries, while
creating a heavy burden on dollar-denominated debts.
	   Vietnam has devalued the dong by about 20 percent since March
1997, less that the steep falls in the currencies of other Asian
countries, thereby cutting the country's competitive edge.
	   Vietnam's export revenue has increased by only 4.1 percent in
the first nine months and is expected to reach dlrs 9.3 billion by
the end of the year, equivalent to 1997's figure.
	   The country's exports had maintained annual growth of about 25
percent since the early 1990s.
	   Any major devaluation also would hit some 3 million people on
the state payroll and pensioners.

WHO chief: Bid to rid world of polio may fail without more cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The international effort to rid the world of polio
early in the new millennium may fail unless governments give it a
fresh injection of cash, the World Health Organization has warned.
	   Independent experts have told the WHO an extra dlrs 600-700
million is needed until the end of 2000 to keep immunization and
surveillance programs going, according to a press release issued
Thursday.
	   ``The eradication campaign may be running critically short of
funding and we ask donors and governments to go the extra mile with
us,'' the release quotes WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland
as saying. Failure is not acceptable, the former Norwegian premier
added. ``This is a combat we simply cannot afford to lose.''
	   Wild polio has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere since
1991 and most of Europe and the Western Pacific also is polio-free.
Polio cases have dropped by nearly 90 percent since the campaign
began 10 years ago.
	   But doctors still are fighting to stamp out the virus in the
Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa, where war and poverty
have hindered vaccination attempts.
	   All children, even in polio-free countries like the United
States, must continue to be vaccinated until the virus is wiped out
worldwide, because infected travelers can spread it.

EU warns nine countries over violation of wildlife laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission on Thursday
warned nine European Union countries they must comply with EU rules
on endangered animals and plants or face possible court action.
	   The Commission, the EU's executive body, said Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Portugal are three years late in
submitting reports on their implementation of an EU law on the
protection of wild birds.
	   These five countries are also two years late in submitting
reports to the Commission under the EU's law on habitats, which
deals with the protection of other animal and plant species.
	   Four other countries have failed to provide information under
the habitats law. These are Ireland, Denmark, Germany and Spain.
	   Under both the wild bird law and the habitats law, EU countries
must report regularly to the Commission - every three and two
years, respectively - on the measures they take to protect
endangered animals and plants.
	   These reports help the Commission monitor the efforts made by
the 15 EU countries to preserve wildlife on their territory.
	   Under EU procedure, the nine countries have two months to
respond to the Commission warning and comply. If they fail to do
so, they receive a second warning, again with a two-month deadline.
If they ignore the second warning, the Commission can take them to
court.

Thai man kills child after wife, who is his sister, runs away
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai man savagely beat his two infant
children, killing one, after he learned that his wife, who was also
his sister, was committing adultery.
	   Two-year-old Marker Kraithip was beaten to death earlier this
week, but four-month-old Tiger Wood Kraithip was released from a
hospital into the care of relatives Thursday, said police in Nakhon
Sri Thammarat, 590 kilometers (366 miles) south of Bangkok.
	   The father, Charan Kraithip, has been arrested. Police said they
will charge him with murder.
	   Charan became enraged after he learned his wife, Charee, had
become involved with another man.
	   Charee, however, was also Charan's sister. The two were
separated as infants when their parent's marriage broke up and
Charee was sent to live with another family in another province.
	   In a twist of fate, they met again as teen-agers, unaware they
were brother and sister, and quickly fell in love and married.
	   They realized their true identities only recently when the
family visited their mother, who had gone to live in another
province.
	   The mother questioned Charee about her family history, and then
the truth came out.

Turkish delinquent who became political symbol goes on trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A Turkish boy who became an election-year
symbol for Germans demanding action against ``criminal foreigners''
went on trial Thursday for a robbery that could result in his
deportation.
	   The 14-year-old boy, who was born in Munich but because of
German citizenship laws is still Turkish, is charged with three
other German youths of robbery and causing bodily harm.
	   They allegedly beat a 19-year-old student with a slat July 3
after a fight over cigarettes, then took his money and a radio
before fleeing.
	   The Turkish boy, known only as Mehmet, had a long history of
run-ins with the law, but this was the first since he turned 14,
the age at which a juvenile can be prosecuted.
	   Conservative officials in Bavaria created a nationwide stir by
seeking this summer to deport not only Mehmet, but his law-abiding
parents, who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   Bavarian officials charged them with endangering public safety
by failing to properly raise their son. Mehmet's lawyer, pointing
to September's elections, accused the government of making a
campaign issue out of a family tragedy.
	   A state court has since blocked the deportation of the parents,
but Mehmet could theoretically be sent back to Turkey alone,
depending on the outcome of his trial and other appeals by his
lawyer.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to RECAST lede, CORRECT 'and' to 'as' in 17th
graf, fix typo in 'Oct.' in graf 19 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ With a lively imagination that
envisions events such as a section of Europe floating out to sea
and apen-stroke that changes the world, Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
	   The Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work
that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into
English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind,
and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale
of social collapse.
	   ''The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' tells of a proofreader
who miscievously inserts the word ''not'' in a manuscript, thereby
reversing historical events.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to
write in Portuguese.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _
where he was attending the international book fair _ for his home
in the Canary Islands. But Portuguese state radio said he was taken
off the plane before departure and driven back to the fair, where a
crowd was waiting for him.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate as Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

Dengue fever cases keep rising in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Despite a government spraying campaign and
doubling of fines for those who allow mosquitoes to breed on their
property, there were 4,200 dengue fever cases in this year's first
nine months, the Environment Ministry said Thursday.
	   That is an increase of 900 cases, or 27 percent, from the same
period last year.
	   The Environment Ministry said the Aedes mosquitoes, which can
carry the dengue virus, have spread to eight new areas on the
island. The disease causes fever, joint pains, chills and in some
strains, brain hemorrhaging and death.
	   Malaria cases, caused by the Anopheles mosquito, were also
higher this year, but figures for the full nine months were not
given. From January to July, there were 236 malaria cases in
Singapore, compared with 207 in the same period last year. One
person died of malaria in June.
	   Fines of 200 Singapore dollars (dlrs 122) for households and
2,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 1,220) for construction companies
found to have mosquitoes breeding on their property or work sites
are twice the previous rate. The fines were increased earlier this
year when the Environment Ministry noted a sharper increase in
mosquito-borne diseases.
	   One explanation is that there has been an unusual amount of
rain, which increases standing water. Also, some construction
sites, where water gathers, may be sitting idle because of the
economic downturn.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reaction to Britain cutting key interest rate &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against most other major
currencies in early European trading Thursday. Gold rose.
	   Also Thursday, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate _ the
repo rate, the lowest rate at which the central bank loans money to
commercial banks _ by a quarter-point to 7.25 percent.
	   Analysts said it was too early to determine the impact of the
announcement on the dollar and other European currencies against
the pound. Typically, lower interest rates can weaken a currency by
making it less attractive to investors.
	   Jonathan Griggs, a currency analyst for Barings Plc in London,
noted that new fiscal measures and the prospect of new banking
reform laws in Japan have encouraged a large buyback of yen, which
caused subsequent reverberations across European financial markets.
	   The dollar's plummet against most other currencies is a
``general knock on the effect of the yen's movement,'' he said.
	   Another possible contributor, he said, is that ``the perception
that the U.S. economy will remain strong relative to other
economies is changing.''
	   Dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
	   _1.5928 German marks, down from 1.6168
	   _115.89 Japanese yen, down from 124.25
	   _1.2812 Swiss francs, down from 1.3220
	   _5.3418 French francs, down from 5.4213
	   _1.7962 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8227
	   _1,575.77 Italian lire, down from 1,597.90
	   _1.5130 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5290
	   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.7243, up from dlrs
1.6926.
	   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of dlrs 302.35
bid per troy ounce at midmorning, up from dlrs 298.50 on Wednesday.
	   In Zurich, the bid price was dlrs 302.25, up from dlrs 298.50.
	   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose dlrs 2.80 to close at dlrs
301.15.
	   Silver opened in London at dlrs 5.14 bid per troy ounce, up from
dlrs 5.10.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Concern about a possible NATO
airstrike sent convoys of U.S. and other diplomats out of Belgrade
Thursday, as Washington ordered its senior Balkan envoy back to the
Yugoslav capital for new talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was ordered to return by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright after briefing her and
NATO officials in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of three days
of talks with Milosevic. NATO officials said Holbrooke would be in
the Yugoslav capital by early afternoon.
	   Also participating in the Brussels meeting was Allied Commander
Wesley K. Clark. The general said that ``NATO is fully ready,'' if
it gets the order to strike.

rights office confirmed Thursday.
	   Abdelfattah Amor of Tunisia will go to Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City,
Thay-Ninh and ``other relevant places'' during a 10-day visit
starting Oct. 19, the office said in a statement.
	   In July, the Vietnamese government announced it would allow Amor
to visit, three years after he first asked to come.
	   Amor will meet government officials, religious figures and
representatives of different religious communities, traveling to
religious sites and institutions, the U.N. statement said.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, but an estimated 8
million of its 78 million people are Catholics. Other officially
sanctioned religions, including the indigenous Cao Dai and Hoa Hao,
also have strong backing.
	   But any religion not officially sanctioned by the government is
considered superstition that must be eliminated.
	   As well as allowing Amor to visit, the government has made a
series of recent moves to improve relations with the Vatican.
	   It bristles at any suggestion that it detains people for
political or religious beliefs, as Amnesty International and other
human-rights groups claim, and insists that the only people in its
jails are there because they broke the law.

Drug-testing lab to be shut; homes searched
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with allegations of covered-up and improper
doping tests in soccer, the Italian Olympic Committee's medical
federation said Thursday it will temporarily shut its drug-testing
laboratory.
	   The decision came after an International Olympic Committee (IOC)
inspection of the Acqua Acetosa lab and as investigators from the
Rome prosecutor's office searched the homes of five current or
former employees of the facility.
	   Emilio Gasbarrone, fired last week after 10 years as chief of
Acqua Acetosa, and four others were told they are being
investigated for abuse of office and concealing evidence.
	   Investigators looking into charges of doping in Italian League
soccer have reportedly discovered that some tests were not fully
carried out and the results of others may have been hidden.
Documentation on anti-doping tests was being discarded after two
months, while the lab is required to keep it at least two years,
five in the case of positive tests.
	   Jordi Segura, the president of an IOC subcommittee on
biochemistry and doping, met with Acqua Acetosa and Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) officials Thursday. He said he would recommend a
``moratorium'' for two or three months on tests at the
IOC-accredited facility.
	   The lab will close Friday. Tests that would have been conducted
at Acqua Acetosa will now be done at labs in Barcelona, Spain;
Cologne, Germany, or Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   The shutdown is meant to give CONI a chance to get its cards in
order and save the facility's accreditation.
	   The ever-widening scandal _ which also led to CONI president
Mario Pescante's resignation _ was sparked in July, when AS Roma
coach Zdenek Zeman said he was ``amazed'' at the sudden muscular
development of certain players.
	   Since then, there have been four separate inquiries into the use
of performance-enhancing substances in the Italian League.
	   The head of the players union has threatened to call a six-month
strike to protest the handling of the investigations. The union
will meet Monday to discuss the possibility of a walkout.

Small Israeli town wants biological institute removed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NES TSIONA, Israel (AP) _ After stopping the government's plan
to expand a shadowy research facility, this town said Thursday it
would go one step further and seek the removal of the complex where
Israel allegedly manufactures chemical and biological weapons.
	   Attorney Shay Segal said that when Nes Tsiona officials appear
before an Israeli government panel that oversees defense
facilities, they will restate their objections to expanding the
Israel Institute for Biological Research and will also explain why
they believe it should not be in this Tel Aviv suburb.
	   Confronted with a suit filed by Nes Tsiona, the Israeli
government last month backed down from plans to expand the research
institute.
	   Segal said that because Israel faces enemies with biological and
chemical weapons, it needs such a research center, ``but far away
from here, not in a residential area where people live.''
	   The Israeli government refuses to comment on the military
aspects of the facility, though it acknowledges that besides
researching medicine and biology, it is a defense-related
institution.
	   Last month Israel confirmed that a shipment aboard an El Al
Israel Airlines cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam six years ago
was addressed to the institute here. It contained DMMP, a chemical
that can be used to manufacture sarin, a deadly nerve gas.
	   In a statement, the Israeli government claimed that the chemical
was intended for a non-military testing project at the institute.

Singapore opens Internet service market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government announced a completely open
market Thursday for providing public access to the Internet.
	   With immediate effect, anyone who meets the Telecommunication
Authority's minimum requirements can obtain a five-year license,
renewable for three-year terms, the authority said.
	   Singapore, an island nation of 3.2 million people that serves as
a regional financial and service hub, now has three Internet
service providers, all divisions of local companies.
	   The initial license fee will be 450,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
274,390), and the annual fee will be 10,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
6,100) or 1 percent of the annual gross turnover.
	   The Telecommunication Authority said those rates were similar to
the license fees paid by the existing providers.

Iraq releases detained journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A prominent Iraqi journalist, who was
detained in Baghdad after writing columns critical of the
government, has been released after nearly two months in detention,
witnesses and Egyptian editors said Thursday.
	   Dawoud al-Farhan, who worked closely with President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son Odai, was detained in Baghdad in early August
after writing articles that hinted at government corruption.
	   Witness in Baghdad said they saw al-Farahan Wednesday night at a
meeting of the Iraqi Journalists Union of which he is deputy
chairman. The gathering was chaired by Odai Hussein.
	   Al-Farhan's columns are published in the daily Al-Iraq and in
the weekly Al-Mousawar Al-Arabi.
	   Al-Farhan also worked as a reporter in Baghdad for Egypt's
Middle East News Agency. MENA editors in Cairo confirmed that
al-Farhan had been released but said he has not returned to his job
with the agency.
	   Iraq has not announced al-Farhan's detention or release. He was
apparently released last week.
	   Western human rights groups had demanded al-Farhan's freedom.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying 141 people sank
Thursday in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain, killing at least
20 people, most believed to be French retirees.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals, said Monica Estefania, a
spokeswoman for the local emergency services.
	   ``The problem is that the passengers are old folk and that makes
it difficult for them to swim ashore,'' a spokesman for the
vessel's owners, La Carpa, told the national news agency Efe.
	   As rescuers units scoured the water and the wreckage for more
bodies, the French consulate in nearby Barcelona said more than 40
people were hospitalized. Another 70 people escaped without injury.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled into small rowing boats.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of
Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid,
Efe said.
	   The agency cited eyewitnesses as saying the boat split in two.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips daily on
the lake, the La Carpa spokesman, who was not identified, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from the western coastal town of La
Rochelle, 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Paris.
	   Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long and up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

British official meets with jailed rebel leader in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Fatchett meeting with jailed rebel
leader and discussing U.N. talks regarding East Timor &QL; 
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A British official met with a jailed
rebel leader from East Timor on Thursday and discussed
U.N.-sponsored talks about the future of the troubled province.
	   British Deputy Foreign Minister Derek John Fatchett said he and
rebel leader Jose Alexandre Xanana Gusmao are both encouraged by
the talks between Indonesia and Portugal about a U.N. proposal to
grant East Timor limited autonomy.
	   ``We had a very good talk about the United Nations process,''
Fatchett said at a news conference at the end of his two-day
official visit to Indonesia, during which he also met with
President B.J. Habibie and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
	   Fatchett said he could not compromise Gusmao's position by
discussing details of his reaction to the U.N. proposal.
	   ``I would not be a friend of Gusmao's if I closed down his
options, and he wants to keep all of his options open, which is
very understandable,'' Fatchett said.
	   Gusmao, 52, was arrested in 1992, and is serving a 20-year
prison term at a penitentiary in eastern Jakarta.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
annexed it the next year. The United Nations has never recognized
Indonesia's sovereignty. East Timor has endured decades of
guerrilla warfare since Indonesia took control of the territory,
1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta. A small band of
rebels regularly attacks Indonesian troops, who have been accused
of widespread human rights violations.
	   The talks in New York this week were the first high-level
negotiations on East Timor at the United Nations since August, when
the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal agreed to discuss
granting limited autonomy to the island.
	   Habibie took power in Indonesia after Suharto, its authoritarian
president, resigned May 21 in the face of widespread and violent
pro-democracy protests.
	   Habibie has promised greater democratic freedoms for
Indonesians, and scheduled an election in May 1999 under new, more
democratic laws. His moves have raised the hopes of many people
that the East Timor turmoil can be stopped, too.
	   ``The United Kingdom government is keen to help, keen to assist,
keen to see the settlement to the East Timor question,'' said
Fatchett, who arrived in Jakarta Wednesday as a personal emissary
of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   In his meeting with Habibie, Fatchett discussed Indonesia's
economy, one of the worst casualties of the Asian financial crisis,
and the forthcoming ballot.
	   Fatchett said Britain has offered to provide any assistance that
Indonesia needs to hold free and fair elections.
	   ``I welcome the changes that have taken place since May in
Indonesia: the release of political prisoners, the movement toward
election, and the great freedom that exists,'' he said.
	   Fatchett said Britain will continue to be a partner with
Indonesia in economic development.
	   ``I told President Habibie that British business people will be
visiting Indonesia next month,'' he said.

Commonwealth meets over next step on suspended Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commonwealth foreign ministers began a two-day
meeting Thursday on Nigeria, which is seeking international
rehabilitation as a reward for its promise to return to civilian
rule next May.
	   Nigerian Foreign Minister Ignatius Olisemeka planned to lunch
Friday with members of a eight-nation committee at Marlborough
House, the London headquarters of the Commonwealth, the 54-nation
association of Britain and its former colonies.
	   Nigeria was suspended from the association in 1995.
	   The committee had tried unsuccessfully to prod Nigeria's late
military dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, into holding democratic
elections by threatening expulsion, a mandatory oil embargo and
cutting air links.
	   The committee is made up of three of Nigeria's fellow African
nations _ South Africa, Zimbabwe and Ghana _ as well as Britain,
Canada, Malaysia, Jamaica and New Zealand.
	   Nigerian leader Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took over when
Abacha died in June, has set elections for May 29 and says he has
restored fundamental human rights.
	   He has appealed at the United Nations for the international
community to lift economic sanctions.
	   Britain says it expects the 15-nation European Union, which
imposed an arms sale ban, a sports boycott and blocks on some
development aid in November 1995, to lift all embargoes soon,
except on arms.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Abacha's regime hanged nine
dissidents, including playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa.

American arrested for trafficking in organs on the Internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian police have arrested an American citizen for
allegedly selling human organs over the Internet, newspapers, radio
and TV reports said Thursday.
	   They said the man is believed to be part of a U.S.-based ring
with a far-flung operation that stretches to India, China, Cambodia
and Latin America, the alleged source of the organs.
	   The reports said the website included a price list for various
organs, including kidneys, heart, pancreases.
	   A spokeman for the carabinieri police in Rome, Guido Bramante,
refused to discuss the case, saying the investigation was still
under way.
	   The newspaper reports did not identify the man by name but said
he is a 48-year-old Los Angeles native.
	   The reports said he was arrested in a sting operation after a
six-month investigation triggered by a call from someone who saw
the website. The FBI cooperated in the investigation, they said.
	   Police, posing as organ buyers, lured the man to a Rome hotel by
offering him dlrs 20,000 for a kidney, the reports said. When he
showed up for the meeting, he was arrested.
	   The man has been charged with trafficking in organs and criminal
association. Police are looking for other members of the ring, the
reports said.

Italian premier says stronger coaltion will emerge from confidence
</HEADLINE>
vote &QL; 
 &UR; With Italy-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Premier Romano Prodi said Thursday his center-left
government will emerge from Friday's confidence vote with a new,
stronger coalition.
	   Bolstered by 21 votes from a breakaway faction of the hard-line
Communist party, Prodi is within reach of a razor-thin majority in
the lower house.
	   In apparent concessions to his Communist backers, Prodi said he
was committed to giving Italy a 35-hour work week and balked at
NATO strikes in Yugoslavia.
	   Prodi first promised the shorter work week to save his
government a year ago in a clash with the Communist over budget
cuts. The current crisis also stems from a battle with Communists
over the budget.
	   In a speech to the lower house, Prodi also said he did not
believe conditions were right for NATO strikes at Yugoslavia over
Kosovo. He said more negotations were needed.
	   If Italy balks, it could mean that NATO would not be able to use
its bases on Italian soil.
	   The Communists have repeatedly clashed with Prodi over foreign
policy issues, opposing the use of Italian air bases for past
strikes against Yugoslavia, and voting against NATO enlargement.
	   With the rebel votes from the wing of the Communist Refoundation
party led by Armando Cossuta, Prodi can now count on 313 votes in
Friday's confidence vote in the lower house, two short of a
majority.
	   Prodi might pick up the two votes he still needs from centrists.
Another possibility is that absences could lower the number of
votes he'll need for an absolute majority
	   He said the combined strength of his Olive Tree coalition and
Cossuta's followers will enable the government to muster ``the
enthusiasm necessary to move our great project of reform forward.''

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said its forces on the border fought a
three-hour gunbattle Thursday with the Taliban militia, inflicting
heavy casualties, but the Taliban denied any fighting occurred.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
religious militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan,
admitted that its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Early Thursday, Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in
northeastern Khorasan province with mortars and machine guns and
Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to
retreat, Iranian television said.
	   The Taliban suffered heavy casualties during the three-hour
clash and three of the militia's border posts were destroyed, Brig.
Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground forces of Iran's
elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, told the official Islamic
Republic News Agency. He did not report any Iranian casualties.
	   ``The situation in the area is currently calm,'' Jaafari said.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place.
	   ``There is no truth in this report and it is propaganda against
the Taliban,'' said the spokesman, who was contacted at Taliban
headquarters in southern Kandahar. ``We received this information
and we checked from our people and it is wrong.''
	   The alleged clash occurred early Thursday in Torbat-e Jam in the
Saleh Abad region. The area is about 180 kilometers (110 miles)
southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its western border with Iran.
	   Iran has demanded an apology from the Taliban for the killings
of its diplomats and wants the culprits handed over for trial in
Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.''
	   It also has accused Iran of arming and financing its
northern-based opposition, which includes the country's minority
Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns, who are
mostly Sunni Muslims.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS 'a en' to 'a pen' in lede, spelling of
'mischievously' in 7th graf  &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ With a lively imagination that
envisions events such as a section of Europe floating out to sea
and a pen-stroke that changes the world, Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
	   The Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work
that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into
English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind,
and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale
of social collapse.
	   ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' tells of a proofreader
who mischievously inserts the word ``not'' in a manuscript, thereby
reversing historical events.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to
write in Portuguese.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his quiet personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _
where he was attending the international book fair _ for his home
in the Canary Islands. But Portuguese state radio said he was taken
off the plane before departure and driven back to the fair, where a
crowd was waiting for him.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate as Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

France asks for U.N. meeting on Iraqi warheads

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with French source saying tests were negative, Aziz in
Paris for meetings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Thursday asked the U.N. Special
Commission investigating Iraq's weapons to convene a meeting with
weapons experts over whether nerve gas has been found on Iraqi
warheads.
	   The request came a day after news reports that French experts
had detected traces of the nerve gas VX, but that France withheld
the findings because it didn't want to undermine Baghdad's attempts
to get U.N. sanctions lifted.
	   A French official said Thursday the tests for nerve gas were
negative, and called the report on France's withholding results a
politically motivated leak.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting France was demanding at the United Nations would show the
tests were negative.
	   In a statement, the Foreign Ministry called for a meeting in the
next few days, to permit Security Council members ``to appreciate
the scientific methods used by the three chosen laboratories (in
France, Switzerland and the United States) and the results
obtained, and the scientific conclusions to be drawn.''
	   The controversy came as Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, arrived in France after his trip to the United Nations.
He was to meet Friday with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.

Has the shooting stopped? It's hard to verify

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with sounds of fighting near
Malisevo. Pick up 6th graf pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DRAGOBIL, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government says the fighting has
stopped in Kosovo. But the ethnic Albanians driven into the hills
from this village 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the
provincial capital, Pristina, say otherwise.
	   The shelling and shooting comes morning and evening, they say.
Serb police maintain a heavy presence throughout the area. Their
main purpose appears to be to intimidate the refugees and prevent
them from returning to their homes.
	   Police, on the other hand, claim it is the Kosovo Liberation
Army, loosely organized bands of ethnic Albanian guerrillas
fighting for independence, that is shooting at them, keeping the
situation tense in the area of the government's most recent
offensive.
	   Hundreds of people have died in seven months of open conflict in
this largely Albanian province of Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia. Hundreds of thousands have fled their homes.
	   There is no way to check out the conflicting claims of fighting,
no fighting, and who started what, where. But clearly, some clashes
continue.
	   Reporters near Malisevo on Friday heard the thud of mortar
rounds and the chatter of heavy machine-gun fire, and villagers in
the area about 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) southwest of
Pristina, the provincial capital, said they were at threat by
nearby snipers.

Arab publishers ask Israel's ambassador to leave book display
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab publishers demanded that Israel's
ambassador and his staff leave a book fair in Amman this week,
reflecting growing opposition to normalizing ties with Israel.
	   Fathi el-Biss, president of the Jordanian Publishers'
Association, said Thursday the incident occurred when Ambassador
Oded Eran went to the book fair two days earlier. It was not the
first time Israeli diplomats were banned from a public event in
Jordan.
	   Despite the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, many in
Jordan's predominantly Palestinian population hold Israel
responsible for displacing them in the 1948 and 1967 Middle East
wars.
	   Roughly two thirds of Jordan's 3.8 million people are of
Palestinian extraction. Opposition to peace with Israel has
escalated since Israeli-Palestinian peace talks began to break down
in 1996.
	   El-Biss said Eran was asked to leave the book display on after
participants ``were enraged by his presence.''
	   ``In line with a ban on contacts with Israel, I asked the
ambassador to leave the premises of the exposition because Arab
publishers threatened to leave if he stayed,'' el-Biss said.
	   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad said el-Biss had approached
diplomats accompanying the ambassador, but not Eran himself.
	   ``His excellency spent two hours uninterrupted by anyone,'' he
said. ``He enjoyed the books on display and even purchased one.''
	   But, he admitted that Eran was disturbed by the action. ``He's
not very happy that there are some people that acted in a way that
does not go along with the well-known Jordanian hospitality,'' he
said.
	   ``At the end of the day, he does not think this is the feeling
of the majority of the people of Jordan,'' he added.
	   Since diplomatic ties were established four years ago, Israeli
diplomats have been banned from several public events. The last was
in spring 1997 when officials in the northern city of Irbid
canceled a luncheon for Israel's ambassador when he came under fire
from Irbid residents.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO's chief military commander in
Europe said Thursday the alliance was still leaving Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic a window of opportunity to change his
mind and withdraw troops from Kosovo to avoid airstrikes.
	   In an intense round of talks, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, NATO Secretary Javier Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark, were in
Brussels to asses the chances of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
	   NATO's military officials have repeatedly said it is ready to
launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green light. In the
meantime the alliance kept looking Thursday for a belated change of
mind on Milosevic's part.
	   ``This is a period in which we are still assessing compliance,
and President Milosevic is obviously making up his mind whether he
is going to fully comply,'' said Clark.
	   Albright sent Holbrooke back to Belgrade on Thursday and the
envoy canceled a meeting with the NATO council.
	   NATO has said that troop and special police levels in
Yugoslavia's Kosovo's province had decreased from 36,000 10 days
ago to some 25,000 by Wednesday, but such levels were still
unacceptable. There was also evidence many were hunkering down for
the winter.
	   If there is no swift and irreversible change in the pace of
withdrawal, NATO officials said, airstrikes will become inevitable.
	   By Thursday noon, NATO had had no new reports on withdrawals,
said a NATO official, who demanded anonymity.
	   NATO has been preparing plans for months to launch airstrikes
and is now awaiting member approval to put them into operation.
	   ``All plans are still ready to go,'' said Clark.
	   Solana has stressed the 16-nation Alliance did not need the
backing from the United Nations to launch air strikes against
Yugoslavia and had enough legal backing for such an operation.

Bulgarian premier meets Santer to discuss enlargement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The president of the European
Commission, Jacques Santer, said Thursday Bulgaria has made
``considerable'' progress in meeting criteria for joining the
European Union but there is still work to be done.
	   ``There are still problems, and that is why it is necessary that
we hold regular meetings to discuss them,'' Santer told a news
conference.
	   He was speaking after talks with Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov on the state of reforms in the former Communist state, one
of 11 candidate countries to the European Union.
	   Bulgaria, like Romania, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania, is on a
slow track to EU membership.
	   Another batch of countries - Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Estonia and Slovenia - begins detailed negotiations with
the EU next month and can hope to join the 15-nation bloc sometime
in the middle of the next decade.
	   The EU says Bulgaria must focus on reforming its administrative,
judicial and police systems, combat illegal immigration and adopt a
long-term strategy to reform the energy sector and make it more
efficient.
	   Kostov noted that the inflation rate in his country had not
exceeded one percent since the beginning of the year, whereas last
year the inflation rate soared to 670 percent.
	   In a report last month, the EU Commission noted that growth of
Bulgaria's Gross Domestic Product resumed in the second half of
1997, after a deep recession which started in 1996.
	   The core of Bulgaria's successful stabilization was the
operation from July 1, 1997 of a fixed exchange rate regime under a
currency board system.
	   On Wednesday, Kostov met with Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene and visited NATO headquarters.

Cabinet hardliners warn Netanyahu against concessions to Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu assuring hardliners that he will not
buckle under U.S. pressure, EDITS to TRIM; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday
assured hardliners in his coalition that he would not buckle under
U.S. pressure during next week's Mideast summit in Washington.
	   Netanyahu also said he would offer no more than 1 percent of the
West Bank in a final Israeli troop pullback before the start of
talks on a permanent peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Coalition members are threatening to topple Netanyahu if he
makes concessions to the Palestinians in the U.S.-hosted summit.
	   Opponents to a West Bank pullback have enough seats in the
120-member parliament to rob Netanyahu's coalition of its majority
and force new elections.
	   However, by ousting Netanyahu, the hardliners would risk
bringing a more dovish government to power and it was not clear
whether they would go through with their threats.
	   The most vehement opponent to a troop withdrawal is the National
Religious Party, which represents the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has nine seats in parliament.
	   Netanyahu met with NRP leaders on Thursday and told them that
``I have no intention to face the negotiating partners with shaking
knees,'' according to a statement by his office.
	   Netanyahu also promised to hold a Cabinet meeting before his
departure for Washington to discuss the agenda for the
negotiations.
	   Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom of the NRP said before his
meeting with Netanyahu that the prime minister must coordiante his
negotiating positions with the party before the Oct. 15 summit.
	   ``Together, we will determine the red lines,'' Yahalom told
Israel radio. ``If he (Netanyahu) returns from the United States
having his positions eroded, the NRP cannot be a partner (in the
government).''
	   NRP legislator Hanan Porat said that if Netanyahu concludes an
agreement on a troop withdrawal, he will set in motion preparations
for early elections.
	   The new threats came after the prime minister held three-way
talks Wednesday in Gaza with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright said after the meeting that substantial progress was
made and that she hoped the remaining issues could be resolved in
the Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would
dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising fears among
Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would come under
intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday briefed his so-called ``kitchen Cabinet''
_ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Infrastructures Minister
Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky _ on the talks with
Albright and Arafat. The three ministers are expected to accompany
Netanyahu to Washington.

Nobel Literature Prize winner greeted with roses at book fair
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago was
already at the airport, heading home from the Frankfurt Book Fair,
when learned he had won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
	   His publisher told him to go back to the fair, where he was
greeted with cheers and countless roses.
	   ``I'm personally very happy for myself,'' he said. ``I'm also
happy for my country.''
	   Saramago said he felt a special responsibility being the first
winner from Portugal. ``Therefore it's a patriotic reason as
well,'' he said through a translator, adding he hoped ``more people
will read Portuguese'' now.
	   Asked why his works are important, he said: ``That's not for me
to decide. That's for my readers to decide.''
	   Saramago, 75, is one of Portugal's most popular contemporary
novelists, and his works have been translated into more than 20
languages.
	   He is perhaps best known for the fanciful novel ``The Stone
Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe and
floats into the Atlantic. It contains what's described as ironic
commentary on ``major players in power politics.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ The United States, bounced from this year's Davis
Cup using its third team, hopes to line up its top players for next
year's first-round tie against Britain, one of eight pairing
selected in Thursday's 1999 Davis Cup draw.
	   The Americans, who have won more Davis Cup titles (31) than
anyone else, lost last month to Italy in the semifinals in
Milwaukee with a team absent its top three players _ Pete Sampras,
Michael Chang and Andre Agassi.
	   ``The question of the top three players is a difficult one,''
U.S. Tennis Association president Harry Marmion said Thursday.
``We'll do the best we can to get them.''
	   ``We shall do our level best to get our best team,'' he added.
``We'll need our best team to play with Britain, but I think we'll
be all right.''
	   Marmion, who leaves his post Jan. 1 and is expected to be
replaced by Judy Levering, has been engaged in a war of words with
Agassi. Agassi last month termed him ``pathetic,'' criticized
Milwaukee as the site, but said he might consider playing the Davis
Cup for a new president.
	   Asked if he would try to make up with Agassi, Marmion said, ``I
doubt it, although I will be urged to so by some.''
	   Marmion said he would prefer that Tom Gullikson stay on as U.S.
Davis captain, but he said that decision would be Levering's.
	   Britain, returning to the elite 16 of the World Group for the
first time since 1992, will field a team headed by Tim Henman and
Canadian-born Greg Rusedski.
	   ``It should be a feast of tennis for the fans. What a tie,''
said Lawn Tennis Association chief executive John Crowther.
	   The probable sites for the tie include Wembley in London,
Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester or Glasgow.
	   In other interesting pairings for the April 2-4 World Group
first round, Australia plays at Zimbabwe and Brazil goes to Spain.
	   Zimbabwe beat Australia earlier this year in the first round.
Spain and Brazil also met in the first round of this year's Davis
Cup with Spain winning.
	   Sweden and Italy, which meet in the 1998 final next month in
Italy, were given the joint top seeds. Spain and the United States
were seeded joint third and fourth followed by France and Australia
(joint fifth-sixth) and the Czech Republic and Germany (joint
seventh-eighth).
	   The second-round matches are July 16-18, semifinals (Sept.
24-26) and the final (Dec. 3-5).
	   The 1999 World Group pairings for the first round, home team
listed first, are as follows:
	   Sweden vs. Slovakia, Germany vs. Russia, Britain vs. United
States, Zimbabwe vs. Australia, France vs. Netherlands, Spain vs.
Brazil, Belgium vs. Czech Republic and Switzerland vs. Italy.
	   Next year's Davis Cup will be the 100th. The event was begun in
1900 between the United States and the British Isles.
	   The International Tennis Federation, which runs the competition,
hopes to have a 100th anniversary celebration next year at the
Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, where the first Davis Cup was
played.
	   The ITF is also planning other events next year ``to lift the
profile and image of the Davis Cup,'' said ITF president Brian
Tobin.
	   This year's field includes a record 129 teams with Fiji the only
new addition.
	   ``We already heard from about seven people who would like to
play in Fiji next year,'' Tobin said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright directed U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke on Thursday to
return to Belgrade to try again to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to remove all Serbian troops from Kosovo. Only
some of the troops have been pulled back from a confrontation with
ethnic Albanians, who are trying to gain self-rule, and Albright
will urge NATO foreign ministers to ``go to the next stage'' in
planning an air attack on the Serbs, her spokesman said. The U.S.
strategy, at this point, is ``to ratchet the pressure up'' on
Milosevic, the U.S. spokesman said. (US-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. House votes Thursday whether to launch an
impeachment inquiry that would make Bill Clinton the third U.S.
president to face the prospect of removal from office. Democratic
leaders were nervous before the historic vote, knowing that
conservatives in their party and those with tough election races
were defecting to support the open-ended inquiry demanded by
Republicans. In last-minute maneuvering, the White House refused
the requests of some moderate Democrats to stop opposing a broad
inquiry not limited by time or subject matter. But the president
advised lawmakers to cast ``a vote of principle and conscience.''
(US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pledging to move beyond its past, Japan offered its
fullest apology yet for its 35-year colonization of South Korea in
a pact Thursday heralding a ``new partnership'' between the two
countries. The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, outlined fresh
areas of cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability
in North Korea. ``It is my conviction that this joint declaration
will be a new start,'' Obuchi told reporters after a morning
meeting and signing ceremony with Kim. Before looking to the
future, Japan and South Korea addressed some of the unpleasant
past: Japan's harsh 1910-1945 rule over the Korean Peninsula _ a
period still deeply resented in South Korea. The phrasing of the
apology was negotiated between the two sides, written in a document
and signed, putting down Japan's recognition of past misdeeds in
black and white. (JAPAN-SKOREA)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops on Thursday fired rubber
bullets at Palestinian stone throwers, killing a Palestinian and
seriously injuring a news photographer. Throughout Hebron,
Palestinians observed a general strike to protest Israel's
eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town and a curfew in
the downtown area. Israel lifted the blockade on Thursday morning,
but the curfew remained in force, confining 30,000 Palestinians to
their homes. During the clashes, several Palestinian photographers
moved closer to film those injured when troops fired more rubber
bullets. A photographer on assignment for the Agence France Presse
news agency was struck in the head. (ISRAEL-HEBRON)
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ The daughter of Indonesia's founder
demanded an end to corruption and a better deal for the poor
Thursday, rallying tens of thousands of supporters in what many
regarded as her first step toward running for president. Despite
Bali's fierce tropical heat, the crowd turned the open field where
the rally was held into a surging wave of support for Megawati,
daughter of Indonesia's first president, Sukarno. Most of her
speech focused on Indonesia's crippling economic crisis, which has
left the nation with more than 80 percent inflation, food
shortages, widespread unemployment and soaring poverty. She didn't
criticize the country's current president, B.J. Habibie, or his
predecessor, Suharto, by name. But Megawati said corruption had
sprung up like mushrooms during Suharto's many years in power.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Calgary Flames right wing Theoren Fleury knows
something about combating trans-Pacific jet leg to play hockey in
Japan.
	   He was here for the Olympics in February. Now he is back for his
team's National Hockey League season-opening two games against the
San Jose Sharks in Tokyo this weekend.
	   ``I never expected to be here twice in the same year,'' said
Fleury, who played for Canada in the Nagano Olympics.
	   He said he has been advising teammates on how to minimize jet
lag and adjust their body clocks for the games Saturday and Sunday.
	   ``We've had good practices, and we're looking forward to the
weekend and the start of the season,'' Fleury said.
	   Before leaving for Japan, players of both teams complained about
traveling so far from home for their season openers.
	   Since their arrival, however, the time change has not seemed
such a major problem, said Calgary defenseman Todd Simpson, the
team captain.
	   ``To be honest, I haven't really thought about (jet lag),'' he
said, adding that the team will have five days off after returning
home and that should be enough to readjust.
	   ``We're just going to focus on the weekend and worry about it
later if we need to,'' Simpson said.
	   This is the second year of NHL season-opening games in Japan.
	   Last year's series between the Anaheim Mighty Ducks and the
Vancouver Canucks, with such stars as Mark Messier, Pavel Bure and
Teemu Selanne, made more of a splash.
	   Except possibly for Fleury, the players this time are less well
known in Japan. So the strategy and game philosophies of the two
head coaches, the Sutter brothers, have become a focus for local
attention.
	   Calgary head coach Brian Sutter and his younger brother Darryl
of San Jose are two of six brothers who have played in the NHL. The
oldest, Brian, has coached in St. Louis and Boston.
	   ``We're used to (being compared),'' Darryl Sutter said, after
his elder brother jokingly ordered him to answer the question from
the floor. He said the two have always stayed competitive in ice
hockey.
	   But there was a moment of truce.
	   ``Can I interrupt you briefly just to say happy birthday to
Brian?'' Darryl Sutter asked, marking his brother's 40th birthday.
	   Seats for the weekend series cost up to 25,000 yen (dlrs 200).

Palestinian security officials issue warnings to Hamas leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian security agents summoned
Hamas leaders and warned them not to carry out terror attacks in
Israel at a time when an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback is
close, a Hamas official said Thursday.
	   The warnings were delivered to leading Islamic militants
throughout the West Bank, said a senior Palestinian security
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In one meeting Wednesday afternoon, the Palestinian security
chief in the West Bank town of Nablus told 12 Hamas leaders that
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat was close to
agreement with Israel on a West Bank troop withdrawal, according to
a Hamas participant who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The security head, Col. Munir Abousheh, complained that whenever
progress was made in peace talks, Hamas sabotaged the agreements
with bombings. The colonel told the Hamas leaders that the
Palestinian Authority would not tolerate any more terror attacks.
	   He also said the group was being closely watched and that the
Palestinian Authority had learned that Hamas leaders abroad were
urging activists in the West Bank to try to kill Palestinian
Authority officials, according to the participant.
	   Last week, Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip were given similar
warnings after Palestinian security caught two Hamas activists
carrying several dozen pounds (kilos) of explosives near the border
with Israel, apparently en route to carrying out a bombing.
	   Hamas is responsible for more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994. Last month, the group vowed there would be more
bombings to avenge the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli
troops.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made
substantial progress toward agreement on a West Bank troop
withdrawal. The two leaders will try to wrap up a deal during a
Washington summit that is to begin Oct. 15.

Official: Russia may use nuclear weapons if threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia believes it has the legal right to use its
nuclear weapons to defend itself from an external threat,
especially given the weakened state of the country's conventional
forces, the defense minister said Thursday.
	   ``We frankly admit that at a time of reform of the entire
military organization of the country, and of certain reduction in
the combat ability of the conventional forces, the role of the
nuclear deterrent factor is increasing,'' Igor Sergeyev said.
	   Sergeyev's comments, in a speech at the Greek Academy of
National Defense in Athens, were carried by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   However, Sergeyev said Russia is aware of the dangers of nuclear
weapons and remains committed to the principles of nuclear
deterrence.
	   Many Russian officials have said that the country's army _
plagued by chronic underfunding, hazing among conscripts and
miserable living conditions _ has lost much of its combat ability.
	   President Boris Yeltsin wants to create a leaner, profession
force. Many defense experts say the reform has made little
progress, but Yeltsin said Thursday ``military reform is
underway.''
	   ``I have personally seen that, including my meetings with
members of the missile forces and sailors,'' he said at a ceremony
where he was being introduced to new military appointees.
	   ITAR-Tass gave no other details of Sergeyev's comments on the
use of nuclear weapons, which is consistent with previous Kremlin
statements although it was unclear why he was reiterating it now.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, when he was foreign minister,
said in May 1997 that Russia had embraced the concept of using
nuclear weapons first in a war _ a policy the United States has
long maintained but that Russia had never before stated publicly.
	   Sergeyev also reiterated in his speech to the Greek cadets that
Russia will not support NATO's plans for airstrikes in Yugoslavia
to end fighting in Kosovo province because it believes that
diplomatic efforts have not been exhausted.
	   Sergeyev insisted Thursday that without Security Council
approval, NATO strikes would be illegal, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia has for months opposed the use of force against Serbs,
their long-time allies and Orthodox Slavic brethren. Moscow has
intensified efforts to find a peaceful solution to fighting in
Kosovo as the United States and its NATO allies appear to be moving
toward the use of airstrikes.
	   ``Despite the difficult times that Russia is going through, we
continue to play an active role on the international arena,''
Primakov said Thursday, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov met with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade on Thursday, ITAR-Tass reported,
citing Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin. No details of
the talks were released.
	   Ivanov was en route to London for a meeting of the Contact Group
of Russia, the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Italy,
which was to discuss the situation in Kosovo.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Saramago in Frankfurt &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ With a lively imagination that
envisions events such as a section of Europe floating out to sea
and a pen-stroke that changes the world, Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
	   The Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work
that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into
English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind,
and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale
of social collapse.
	   ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' tells of a proofreader
who mischievously inserts the word ``not'' in a manuscript, thereby
reversing historical events.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to
write in Portuguese.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _
where he was attending the international book fair _ for his home
in the Canary Islands. But as he waited in the airport, his
publisher told him to go back to the fair, where a cheering
rose-bearing crowd awaited him.
	   ''I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my
country,'' he said through a translator.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate as Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

WHO chief: Bid to rid world of polio may fail without more cash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The international effort to rid the world of polio
early in the new millennium may fail unless governments give it a
fresh injection of cash, the World Health Organization has warned.
	   Independent experts have told the WHO that an extra dlrs 600-700
million is needed by the end of 2000 to keep immunization and
surveillance programs going, according to a news release issued
Thursday.
	   ``The eradication campaign may be running critically short of
funding and we ask donors and governments to go the extra mile with
us,'' WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland said in the
release. ``This is a combat we simply cannot afford to lose,'' the
former Norwegian premier added.
	   Polio has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere since
1991, and most of Europe and the Western Pacific also is
polio-free. Polio cases have dropped by nearly 90 percent since the
campaign began 10 years ago.
	   But doctors still are fighting to stamp out the virus in the
Indian sub-continent and sub-Saharan Africa, where war and poverty
have hindered vaccination attempts.
	   All children, even in polio-free countries like the United
States, must continue to be vaccinated until the virus is wiped out
worldwide, because infected travelers can spread it.

Rescue services say 20 tourists killed as boat sinks in lake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with authorities saying overloading may have caused
the accident; FIXES number injured at 38; ADDS that two people
still missing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying some 140 people
_ apparently nearly double its capacity _ sank Thursday in a
tranquil lake in northeastern Spain, killing at least 20 French
retirees.
	   ``Police are working on the theory that the boat was
overloaded,'' said a spokeswoman for the regional government's
rescue operation center in Barcelona. ``Initial reports suggest the
boat had a maximum capacity of 80.''
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals. Another two people were
reported missing and it was not known whether they had been on the
boat trip or not, said the spokeswoman, who declined to be
identified in keeping with custom.
	   A total of 38 people were treated in hospital following the
accident and 81 others, including the boat's Spanish captain, were
said to be uninjured.
	   The spokeswoman said initial rescue service estimates that the
boat was carrying 141 people and that 44 were injured had to be
readjusted as more information came in.
	   Rescues units scoured the water and the wreckage of the
electrically-powered catamaran craft for more bodies.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled into small rowing boats.
	   Most of those who drowned were believed to have been on the
lower deck of the vessel.
	   ''We could see old people up to their necks in water shouting
for help and other people crying,'' an unidentified schoolgirl told
national television.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of
Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid.
	   The national new agency Efe cited eyewitnesses as saying the
boat split in two. In another report it said the captain of the
boat realized he had problems shortly after setting off and was
trying to return to the pier when the vessel sank rapidly.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips daily on
the lake, a spokesman for the firm that owned it, La Carpa
spokesman, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from the western coastal town of La
Rochelle, 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Paris. They were
said to be on a hold
	   Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long and up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Small Israeli town wants biological institute removed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NES TSIONA, Israel (AP) _ After stopping the government's plan
to expand a shadowy research facility, the town of Nes Tsiona said
Thursday it would go one step further and seek the removal of the
complex where Israel is accused of manufacturing chemical and
biological weapons.
	   Attorney Shay Segal said that when Nes Tsiona officials appear
before an Israeli government panel that oversees defense
facilities, they will restate their objections to expanding the
Israel Institute for Biological Research and will also explain why
they believe it should not be in this Tel Aviv suburb.
	   Confronted with a suit filed by Nes Tsiona, the Israeli
government last month backed down from plans to expand the research
institute.
	   Segal said that because Israel faces enemies with biological and
chemical weapons, it needs such a research center, ``but far away
from here, not in a residential area where people live.''
	   The Israeli government refuses to comment on the military
aspects of the facility, though it acknowledges that besides
researching medicine and biology, it is a defense-related
institution.
	   Last month Israel confirmed that a shipment aboard an El Al
Israel Airlines cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam six years ago
was addressed to the institute here. It contained DMMP, a chemical
that can be used to manufacture sarin, a deadly nerve gas.
	   In a statement, the Israeli government claimed that the chemical
was intended for a nonmilitary testing project at the institute.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will set up a commercial office in
Algiers in a bid to bolster trade ties with the North African
country, the trade and industry minister said Thursday.
	   ``The launching of the office is in line with government efforts
to activate and develop cooperation with brotherly Arab states,''
said the minister, Saleh Hourani.
	   He said the office will be set up soon, but declined to disclose
a date.
	   Among other things, the commercial office will promote Jordanian
products and assist Algerian businessmen by providing them with
information on Jordanian trade and investment laws, Hourani said.
	   Official figures show that trade exchange with Algiers in 1997
totaled dlrs 32 million, the bulk of it is Jordanian exports.
	   Jordan has commercial offices in several Arab countries,
including Gulf Arab states.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover further slipped
on the stock exchange this week because of regional political
uncertainty.
	   Brokers said Thursday that tension between Syria and Turkey and
a peace stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians were behind
the sluggish activity.
	   A stock market report said the 60-company general share prices
index declined by 4.76 percent to 163.09 points. The report
reflected activity in five business days ending Thursday.
	   It said shares of commercial banks dropped by 5.97 percent,
industrial firms by 2.20 percent, services companies by 0.91
percent. But shares of insurance firms increased by 0.33 percent.
	   Turnover also declined by 20 percent to 3.6 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 5 million), the report said.
	   It said stocks of 90 firms were traded during the week.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Yemen, one of the Middle East's most
impoverished countries, will supply Iraqi markets with food,
medicine and other goods under the U.N-approved oil program, an
official magazine reported Thursday.
	   Al-Zawra said under a deal the two countries signed last month,
Yemen will ferry to Iraq cooking oil, sugar detergents and
household utensils.
	   Yemeni exports to Iraq will also include coffee, wheat, barley
and agricultural machinery, the weekly said.
	   The value of Yemeni exports to Iraq, since the start of the oil
program in December 1996, has been in the range of dlrs 3 million,
according to U.N. figures.
	   Al-Zawra said Iraq was determined to boost the value of
bilateral trade. Yemen was among the few Arab states that took a
sympathetic stand during Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which
touched off the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The oil deal skirts U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq to help it
offset their impact on its 22 million people.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Trading levels declined at Baghdad Stock
exchange but turnover surged as investors turned to high-value
shares of industrial and service sector companies.
	   The market's bulletin released Thursday said the number of

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - Iraq has raised its oil output to 2.5
million barrels per day from 2.4 million in a bid to take advantage
of firmer prices on international markets, a senior oil official
said Thursday.
	   The official said Iraq intended to boost production to 2.7
million for the remainder of the U.N.-approved oil program, now in
its fourth phase which is expected to expire by November 29.
	   The official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, did
not make clear how Iraq will attain the hikes in output at a time
none of the spare parts it has contracted for have reached the
country.
	   He said Iraq wanted to increase exports from the current 1.8
million barrels daily to two million.
	   The six-month oil plan which started in December 1996 is
designed to offset the adverse impact of sanctions, imposed for
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Cabinet on Thursday endorsed the
launch of a new dlrs 550 million bond issue, two days after the
launch of a dlrs 100 million Eurobond issue in London that was
over-subscribed.
	   Information Minister Bassem al-Sabei did not say when the next
issue will be.
	   The dlrs 550 million bond issue will be the last in a plan
approved by Parliament this year to borrow dlrs 2 billion to
restructure part of the country's dlrs 14 billion national debt.
	   In addition to the bond issues, Lebanon has been borrowing
heavily on international markets to finance the rebuilding of
Lebanon's infrastructure, which was devastated during the 1975-90
civil war.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
slipped 56.6 points, or 2.62 percent, this week, closing at 2,102.9
points, the National Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report, the NIC said 52 companies closed lower, some
reaching their lowest prices for the year. Portfolio managers were
reluctant to buy and speculation was strong on Gulf shares, the
company said.
	   Around 197.90 million shares changed hands, down by 13.98
percent from the previous week. The value of these shares also fell
by 31.67 percent to 44.70 million dinars (dlrs 146.07 million).
	   The exchange, which is considered one of the most active in Arab
countries, lists 76 local and Gulf companies. The stocks of 73 were
traded this week, with only nine closing higher, and 12 unchanged.

Congolese rebels turn empty town into rear base for key battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ When Congolese rebels marched into Kalima
last week, they found a ghost town of stone houses and a small
alley lined with crumbling red brick villas dating back to the
heyday of the Belgian Congo.
	   It seemed as though time has stopped in the former tin-mining
town where hardly anyone or anything moves in the scorching sun,
and the only sound that pierces the veil of silence is the
twittering of birds.
	   Most of the 10,000 residents, fearing for their lives, fled with
Congolese government troops 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest to
Kindu, where a battle is raging for control of a strategic eastern
air base.
	   On Thursday, there was little news of the battle for Kindu,
which both the rebels and the government claimed to be winning.
	   In his two-month war with the rebels, President Laurent Kabila
has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counter-offensive
against rebel-held towns in the east.
	   The rebels see Kindu as the prize in their two-month campaign to
topple Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and
warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   Tangles of green creepers wind through the red brick houses
built for Belgian colonial administrators as the jungle damp slowly
eats away at the foundations. The doors are locked, but the windows
are broken.
	   Before 1996, Kalima was a major tin-producing center in the
heart of Maniema Province. Electricity came from a power plant 15
kilometers (9 miles) away, and the tin was shipped by truck over a
tarmac road southeast to Bukavu on the southern tip of Lake Kivu.
	   Income from tin built a high school and a large hospital in
Kalima, but both have been closed for two years.
	   Tin production stopped in late 1996 when Rwandan-backed rebels
under Kabila's command captured the former Zaire in an eight-month
rebellion and ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   When he took power in May 1997, Kabila awarded the mining
concessions to Victor Ngezayo, a local businessman.
	   Less than a year later, Kabila scrapped the contract and chased
Ngezayo out of Kalima. He has now sided with the new rebels, hoping
to win back his mining business.
	   Villas that used to be home to the owners and managers of the
mines and smelter now house rebels.
	   On the verandah of a large, hilltop villa, commander Richard
Mondo, barefoot and dressed in a flourescent green sleeveless shirt
and khaki army trousers, listens to instructions on a field radio
about the arrival of another aircraft carrying food and munition
from the rebel stronghold in Goma.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, mutinous Congolese
soldiers and Rwandan officers _ have set up a rear base in Kalima
from where they are directing supplies to their 2,000 comrades
fighting for Kindu.
	   Spindly 11-year-olds and ragtag former Congolese soldiers, a
sort of impromptu squad that guards Mondo, have also camped out
among the leather armchairs, fragile glasstop tables and weapons
and ammuniton littered across the marble floor.
	   Barechested fighters kill time playing darts on the verandah. A
boy soldier watches satellite TV inside the cool living room. He is
dwarfed by his assault rifle that leans against the wall.
	   Only a few residents were on hand to greet the rebels who
trudged 240 kilometers (150 miles) through thick tropical forest to
capture the town with little difficulty Saturday.
	   Government soldiers, reportedly reinforced by Sudanese troops,
had commandeered all the vehicles in town and shipped supplies and
ammunition to Kindu.

Palestinian killed in clashes with Israeli troops

 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution on army statement, army holding
Palestinian police responsible for the violence &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes Thursday, killing a
20-year-old man and seriously injuring a news photographer.
	   The death raised the specter of new violence at a time when the
United States is trying to conclude an agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Schools and shops were closed.
	   Israel lifted the blockade on Thursday morning, but the curfew
remained in force, confining 30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes broke out Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt.
	   Several Palestinian news photographers and cameramen moved
closer to film those injured when troops fired more rubber bullets.
	   Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer on assignment for the Agence
France Presse news agency, was struck in the back of the head and
was taken to a nearby hospital. Doctors said Abu Alan suffered a
skull fracture and was in serious condition.
	   The top Israeli army commander in Hebron, Col. Yigal Sharon,
held Palestinian police responsible for the violence, saying they
had done nothing to restrain the stone throwers.
	   The colonel said in a statement that when troops fired rubber
bullets at the stone throwers, they were not aware that a
photographer was among them.
	   Abu Alan wore a photographer's vest and had a camera slung
around his neck when he was hit.

Swiss clear way for extended drug distribution program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's experimental
drug-distribution program is set to be extended after Swiss
lawmakers on Thursday gave the go-ahead for doctors to prescribe
heroin to long-term addicts on a permanent basis.
	   The upper house of parliament approved the measure by 30 votes
to four, following approval yesterday by the lower house.
	   The move is expected to increase from 800 to some 2,000 or more
the number of addicts who can receive controlled distribution. It
comes into effect Saturday.
	   Until now, the daily supply of nominally priced heroin to
addicts who had rejected all forms of therapy was on an
experimental basis.
	   Switzerland's experiment with drug distribution began in 1994
with the first government-authorized distribution of heroin,
morphine and methadone.
	   A three-year study last year said the project had slashed crime,
misery and death associated with the hard-core drug scene.
	   In September 1997, voters overwhelmingly endorsed the
government's liberal drug policies, including the distribution
program.
	   In a referendum, nearly 71 percent threw out a proposal which
would have clamped down on drugs use.
	   Immediately after the vote, the Health Ministry immediately
announced plans to put state provision of heroin to long-term
addicts on a permanent legal footing.
	   On Wednesday, Interior Minister Ruth Dreifuss told lawmakers
that passing the measure to extend the program could help save
lives. Some 150 addicts are on the waiting list, she said.

Arab publishers ask Israel's ambassador to leave book display
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Arab publishers demanded that Israel's
ambassador and his staff leave a book fair in Amman this week,
reflecting growing opposition to normalizing ties with Israel.
	   Fathi el-Biss, president of the Jordanian Publishers'
Association, said Thursday the incident occurred when Ambassador
Oded Eran went to the book fair two days earlier. It was not the
first time Israeli diplomats were banned from a public event in
Jordan.
	   Despite the 1994 Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty, many in
Jordan's predominantly Palestinian population hold Israel
responsible for displacing them in the 1948 and 1967 Middle East
wars.
	   El-Biss said Eran was asked to leave the book display after
participants ``were enraged by his presence.''
	   ``In line with a ban on contacts with Israel, I asked the
ambassador to leave the premises of the exposition because Arab
publishers threatened to leave if he stayed,'' el-Biss said.
	   Israeli Embassy spokesman Roey Gilad said el-Biss had approached
diplomats accompanying the ambassador, but not Eran himself.
	   ``His excellency spent two hours uninterrupted by anyone,'' he
said. ``He enjoyed the books on display and even purchased one.''
	   But, he admitted that Eran was disturbed by the action. ``He's
not very happy that there are some people that acted in a way that
does not go along with the well-known Jordanian hospitality,'' he
said.

Israel outraged over kick to the jaw of West Ham international
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Has moved to some news lines as Israel-Kick in the Face &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Neither Mideast summit plans nor a record
dollar rate were a match in Israel on Thursday for the news
generated by the image of West Ham midfielder and Israeli
international Eyal Berkovic cringing in pain.
	   The Maariv daily's front-page was covered by a photo of Berkovic
kneeling as West Ham teammate John Hartson's left foot struck his
jaw.
	   ``The scream of pain,'' read the Maariv caption.
	   ``It's shocking to see such a thing, especially if it's your own
son,'' said Berkovic' father, Zeev.
	   ``At first I felt Hartson should be prosecuted, but Eyal decided
not to complain to the police. He wasn't so badly hurt. He's
alright now, and that's the main thing for me,'' Berkovic told The
Associated Press.
	   In England on Wednesday, Berkovic told the Mirror the incident
occured in a training session before West Ham's Sept. 28 clash with
Southampton and accused West Ham management of trying to cover it
up.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic was quoted saying in the Mirror.
	   The Israeli national team gave Berkovic a warm welcome as he
arrived in San Marino for a European Championship qualifier that
pits Israel against the tiny European nation.
	   Angriest was Israeli midfielder Haim Revivo.
	   ``Hartson is lucky he didn't do it to me,'' Revivo told the
Haaretz daily. ``He wouldn't be playing football by now. Believe
me.''
	   The incident followed a tackle by Hartson which left Berkovic on
the ground.
	   Hartson later went to help Berkovic to his feet but the Israeli
midfielder waved his arms at the gesture. Hartson allegedly
retaliated with a kick and was led away by trainers as Berkovic
slumped back to the ground.
	   Israeli media quoted Berkovic was saying he would not submit a
complaint to the police against Hartson.
	   ``Believe me he would go to jail, but I don't want a player from
my team sent to prison,'' Haaretz quoted Berkovic as saying.
	   The Israeli midfielder has said he would have to consider
whether to remain with the club.
	   However, he rejected Hartson's claim that he was merely using
the incident as a pretext for leaving the English club, Haaretz
said. Berkovic told the daily he would return to West Ham as soon
as the San Marino event was over.
	   Berkovic told the daily he would return to West Ham as soon as
the San Marino match was over.
	   The English Football Association has asked West Ham for a copy
of the amateur videotape of the incident, which generated the still
photographs, for the possibility of considering measures against
Hartson. West Ham reportedly prefers to settle the issue internally
on the grounds that the incident occurred in training, not in a
match.

Iraq releases detained journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A prominent Iraqi journalist, who was
detained in Baghdad after writing columns critical of the
government, has been released after nearly two months in detention,
witnesses and Egyptian editors said Thursday.
	   Dawoud al-Farhan, who worked closely with President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son Odai, was detained in Baghdad in early August
after writing articles that hinted at government corruption.
	   Witness in Baghdad said they saw al-Farahan Wednesday night at a
meeting of the Iraqi Journalists Union of which he is deputy
chairman. The gathering was chaired by Odai Hussein.
	   Al-Farhan's columns are published in the daily Al-Iraq and in
the weekly Al-Mousawar Al-Arabi.
	   Al-Farhan also worked as a reporter in Baghdad for Egypt's
Middle East News Agency. MENA editors in Cairo confirmed that
al-Farhan had been released but said he has not returned to his job
with the agency.
	   Iraq has not announced al-Farhan's detention or release. He was
apparently released last week.
	   Western human rights groups had demanded al-Farhan's freedom.

Taylor flops yet again, injures right hand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australian captain Mark Taylor's poor
run of form continued but Darren Lehmann hit a fine century on the
first day of a four-day side match against Rawalpindi Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   Lehmann, who made 98 in tourists historic first Test victory
over Pakistan earlier this week, hit a brilliant 103 to cement his
place for the second Test, beginning at Peshawar Oct. 15.
	   Lehmann struck two big sixes and 10 fours in his flawless
century before he was out off a tiring shot in the last session.
Australia marched to 328 for seven when stumps were drawn for the
day with Gavin Robertson unbeaten 33 and Michael Kasprowicz
unbeaten 5.
	   After the Australian skipper was out for unlucky 13, he hurt his
right hand in an attempt to jump over the iron fence on his way to
nets at the Khan Research Laboratories Stadium Ground.
	   Taylor found the iron bar gate closed and he tried to jump over
the iron fence. But he rushed back to the dressing room as he found
a cut in his right hand with blood gushing from it. He got no
stitches but his right hand was bandaged.
	   Ricky Ponting, who sit out in his team's historic innings and
99-run win over Pakistan in the first Test this week, strengthened
his Test claim with a fine innings of 88.
	   In company of Lehmann, Ponting put on 107 runs for the fifth
wicket. However, Mark Waugh, first Test century-maker Michael
Slater and captain Taylor all were out cheaply in the first
session.
	   Slater got a top edge off Azhar Mahmood's third over to deep
fine leg while Waugh lasted for only 15 minutes before giving
Jaffar Nazir his second catch at the same position.
	   Taylor, desperately needing a big innings, miscued a pull shot
off paceman Nazir and was caught at midwicket as Australia
struggled at 50 for three in the first hour.
	   But left-handed Justin Langer's 42 and later Ponting's
boundary-filled 88 retrieved Australian position. Ponting hit 14
fours, mostly in front of the wicket before he was caught at close
in position by Muhammad Naveed.
	   Left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed took three wickets for 97 off 29
overs while two wickets each were shared by paceman Jaffar Nazir
and medium fast Azhar Mahmood.
	   Rawalpindi included four Test players -- Ijaz Ahmed, Inzamamul
Haq, Muhammad Wasim and all-rounder Azhar Mahmood -- in their
line-up while Australia rested leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, Steve
Waugh and Glenn McGrath.

Iran joins mediation efforts between Turkey and Syria

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kharrazi meeting Assad, Indyk comments, Turkish
press reports

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
met with Syrian President Hafez Assad on Thursday as part of
efforts to mediate the escalating dispute between Turkey and Syria.
	   ``We are convinced that the two countries can solve their
problems through peaceful means,'' the official Syrian News Agency
quoted Kharrazi as saying.
	   Kharrazi will fly to Turkey later Thursday for talks with
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Turkish officials said.
	   Iran is mediating as the current head of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that includes Syria and
Turkey.
	   Turkey issued an ultimatum to Syria on Wednesday, demanding that
Damascus expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory or ``face
the consequences.'
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told private NTV television on
Thursday that the government took no decision as to a deadline but
added that ``it is obvious that we can not wait for a long time.''
	   ``In the meantime, we will step up diplomatic efforts with Arab
and Muslim countries to explain Syria's attitude, which is not
linked with humanity and Islam,'' Ecevit said.
	   The Turkish newspaper Yeniyuzyil reported Thursday that Ankara
was prepared to stage pinpoint attacks against rebel camps if the
ultimatum was not honored within 10 days.
	   The Hurriyet newspaper, however, said Turkey would grant Syria
45 days to prove that it has ended its support for the rebels.
	   Syria denies sheltering the rebels.
	   In Cairo, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk urged
Syria Thursday to ``take seriously'' Ankara's concerns. He also
called on Turkey to show restraint.
	   On Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between
Syria and Turkey in an attempt to reduce tensions.

BayStars clinch Central League Pennant in 38 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Yokohama BayStars clinched their first Central
League pennant in 38 years and only their second ever Thursday as
Tatsuya Shindo's two-run single in the eighth inning gave the
BayStars a 4-3 victory over the Hanshin Tigers.
	   The victory at Koshien Stadium gave the BayStars an
insurmountable six-game lead over the second-place Chunichi
Dragons, who beat the Yakult Swallows 7-1 at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium.
	   Both teams have five games remaining in the regular season.
	   The BayStars will meet the Pacific League champion Seibu Lions
in the best-of-seven Japan Series starting Oct. 17 at Yokohama
Stadium.
	   Former California Angels player Robert Rose doubled home the
BayStars' first run in the first inning, but the Tigers went ahead
3-2 before Shindo's eight-inning single with the bases loaded.
	   For the Dragons, Leo Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs,
smashed his 25th homer of the season, a three-run shot, in the
third inning.
	   The Yomiuri Giants have completed all their 135 games this
season, while the Hiroshima Toyo Carp were idle Thursday.
	   In the Pacific League, Harvey Jerome Pulliam hit a home run in
the fifth inning and Troy Neel belted a two-run shot in the sixth
as the Orix BlueWave edged the Lions 6-5 at Seibu Dome and moved
into second place.
	   The BlueWave were .0001 percentage point ahead of the Nippon Ham
Fighters, who have completed all their games.
	   Pulliam, formerly with the Colorado Rockies, has 18 homers and
Neel, formerly with the Oakland Athletics, has 28.
	   No other games were scheduled Thursday.

Ukrainian president complains about trade relations with Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma complained Thursday
that Russia is stalling on a trade treaty and doesn't want to work
on joint projects with Ukraine, a news agency reported.
	   Although Ukraine proposes ``a most liberalized system of
economic relations'' with Russia, Moscow isn't responding, Kuchma
said at a meeting with regional officials, according to Interfax.
	   ``We have to live as friends. People will not allow us anything
else,'' he said.
	   Russia is Ukraine's main trade partner, and receives about a
third of its total exports. But exports have been shrinking this
year because of Russia's economic crisis, which has shaken
Ukraine's economy and its currency, the hryvna.
	   Kuchma criticized the Russian parliament's failure to ratify a
trade zone treaty signed by both countries and ratified by
Ukraine's parliament.
	   He also lashed out at Russian hard-liners who want to include
Ukraine in a union treaty already concluded between Russia and
Belarus. He said the union is ``absolutely failing to work, from
the legal point of view.''
	   ``Why declare such things when the simplest and most necessary
things are not working,'' he said.
	   Trade disputes have long complicated relations between the two
former Soviet republics. Kuchma said Ukraine is now buying Russian
oil at ``old world prices,'' even though oil prices have fallen in
world markets.
	   And he criticized the 1996 introduction of a punishing
value-added tax on Ukrainian goods coming to Russia, as well as
disputes over importing Ukrainian sugar.

Lebanese government calls for constitutional amendment to elect
</HEADLINE>
president &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's government called on Parliament
Thursday to amend the constitution to permit the election of the
army commander as president.
	   Gen. Emile Lahoud, who enjoys wide support in Lebanon, was
virtually assured the job earlier this week after he received the
backing of Syria, which dominates Lebanese politics.
	   The main barrier to Lahoud's election by the 128-member
Parliament is that the constitution bars senior civil servants from
running for the office.
	   After a Cabinet meeting Thursday, President Elias Hrawi called
on Parliament to meet Monday to amend the constitution to allow
``once and exceptionally'' senior public servants to run for
president.
	   Parliament is expected to vote for president before the Oct. 23
constitutional deadline. A new head of state will be sworn in Nov.
24, the day Hrawi leaves office.
	   Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet minister and a close ally of Syria,
which maintains 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon, criticized the choice
of a military man and said Wednesday that he will boycott the
election. Catholic bishops also voiced discontent with the
nomination process but welcomed the choice of Lahoud, a fellow
Catholic.

ASEAN ministers propose `bold' measures to counter financial

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian trade ministers
proposed a set of ``bold new measures'' Thursday aimed at restoring
economic confidence in the region, saying the sharp cuts in trade
and investment barriers they approved a day earlier were not
enough.
	   The measures must still be studied and accepted by each
government. If approved, they would be announced at a summit of
leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in
December, the ministers said.
	   On Wednesday, the ASEAN trade ministers had set targets for
reducing regional trade and investment barriers to help Asia
recover from its 15-month-old financial storm.
	   But they decided that additional measures were needed because of
alarm over a sharp drop in foreign investment in the region, an
ASEAN official said. The ministers realized they needed to respond
quickly because of strong international competition for investors,
he added.
	   Foreign investment has fallen by 33.6 percent for the nine ASEAN
countries since Asia's financial crisis erupted in July 1997, he
said.
	   Philippine trade secretary Jose Pardo said the ministers hope
the new measures can convince investors ``to return to the ASEAN
investment scene as soon as possible.''
	   He said the measures, to be finalized by the end of this month,
would cover trade, tourism and investment, and could include new
incentives and a further acceleration of liberalization.
	   Asked if they were really bold, Malaysian trade minister Rafidah
Aziz replied: ``Under normal circumstances not all of us would be
moved to accept them. In that sense they're certainly bold.''
	   The trade ministers also urged Japan to reform and resuscitate
its economy and provide leadership for an economic recovery in the
region. They asked rich countries in North America and Europe to
keep their markets open to Asian exports.
	   Earlier in the week, ASEAN set a goal of completely eliminating
tariffs for many products traded in the region by the year 2003,
instead of the previous goal of only bringing tariffs below 5
percent by that year.
	   As a result, average tariffs will fall from 5.37 percent this
year to 2.68 percent in 2003, it said.
	   ASEAN also agreed to accelerate tariff cuts for some sensitive
agricultural products, such as rice and sugar, after Indonesia
offered to eliminate all tariffs on rice by the year 2010 within
the region.
	   On Wednesday, the trade ministers signed an agreement creating
an ASEAN Investment Area that would remove barriers to investment
from ASEAN countries by the year 2010 and by 2020 for investment
from non-ASEAN nations.
	   Under the agreement, businessmen from one ASEAN country will be
granted the same investment rights as local citizens in other ASEAN
countries in which they wish to invest.
	   However, the agreement is subject to exemptions if a country's
constitution limits equal treatment.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   ASEAN officials had earlier said that foreign investment in the
region had dropped by 50 percent from the first half of 1997 to the
first half of this year, but later revised the figure to 33.6
percent after Vietnam submitted new trade figures.

Defiant Milosevic says NATO threats only make Kosovo situation

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff rolled out of Belgrade on Thursday, while support
within NATO for airstrikes to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatists in Kosovo appeared to
hit a snag.
	   Tensions between Yugoslavia and NATO nations were intensifying
following three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The diplomat briefed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
NATO officials today in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of those
talks and was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for another
session with Milosevic.
	   Albright said Holbrooke would be delivering a message that the
time for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo was ``all but gone.''
She demanded full compliance with U.N. orders to end the crackdown
and said ``half measures'' would not be enough.
	   In Kosovo, reporters heard three or four bursts of mortar fire
Thursday in the Malisevo area about 50 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. The firing indicated
some military action was continuing, although U.S. officials have
conceded there has been no significant fighting for about a week.
	   Holbrooke was ordered to return amid further signs of opposition
within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic efforts.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' said Italian Premier Romano Prodi, seeking
the support of anti-interventionist Communists ahead of a Friday
confidence vote in the Italian parliament.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned him that threats of NATO airstrikes only
dimmed the chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a meeting of the major powers
most deeply involved in the negotiations. Russia strongly opposes
use force to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is expected to deliver
that message when he meets Albright in London.
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Milosevic was engaging in ``brinksmanship'' because he ``has
not been given a strong enough message.''
	   ``I hope the international community lives up to its
responsibility to send President Milosevic a united and strong
message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying on,'' Blair
said.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against the ethnic
Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army. The operation
killed hundreds of ethnic Albanians and drove more than 270,000
people from their homes.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, about 20 vehicles carrying
diplomats and their families from the United States, Britain and
Australia left for the Hungarian capital of Budapest. The diplomats
will remain in Budapest until it becomes clearer whether NATO will
strike to force Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
U.N. demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops, and
the return of refugees to their villages, Washington lacks the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into action.
	   Milosevic says he has fulfilled those demands and his office
issued a statement Wednesday saying that ``threats, which are
delivered to our country, jeopardize the continuation of the
political process.''
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbian government ordered independent media Wednesday to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs _ or face prosecution.

Commission advises plan to counter vote-stealing in Northern
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Voters should be issued
high-tech identification cards to stamp out chronic electoral fraud
in future Northern Ireland elections, a British government
commission advised Thursday.
	   The report from the government's Electoral Review followed
persistent accusations that political activists, particularly from
the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, have exploited loopholes in the
voting system.
	   All parties have denied organizing the fraudulent filing of
ballots to boost their own support. But Thursday's report concluded
there had been ``a high level of malpractice'' in postal voting.
	   The report added that it had proved ``impossible to quantify''
the practice of using forged IDs at polling stations.
	   Accusations of corruption have chiefly involved the two rival
parties within the north's growing Catholic community _ Sinn Fein
and the moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party, which attracts
the most voters.
	   The SDLP contends Sinn Fein activists entered polling booths
using forged IDs of known SDLP voters to try to close the gap
between the two parties.
	   Without assigning blame, the report recommended that all
prospective voters be issued a credit card-sized ID with a
computer-generated signature unique to the holder.
	   The report also recommended making postal ballots more difficult
to forge by bar-coding or watermarking them, and establishing an
investigation team to detect fraudulent names on the electoral
register.
	   Voters in Northern Ireland have gone to the polls five times
since 1996, most recently in June to elect a legislative Assembly
as part of this year's compromise accord on how Protestants and
Catholics should govern Northern Ireland together.
	   Meanwhile, the latest victim of Northern Ireland's conflict was
buried Thursday.
	   Policeman Frank O'Reilly died Tuesday, one month after suffering
head wounds from a grenade thrown by Protestant extremists.
	   O'Reilly, 30, who came from a Catholic family, was buried after
services at his in-laws' Presbyterian church in rural Waringstown.
	   Northern Ireland's police commander, Chief Constable Ronnie
Flanagan, comforted O'Reilly's widow, Janice, who gave birth to the
couple's third child 15 weeks ago.

	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying some 140 people
sank Thursday in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain, killing at
least 20 French retirees.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals. A total of 38 people were
treated in hospital following the accident and 81 others, including
the boat's Spanish captain, escaped without injury.
	   Rescue units scoured the water and the wreckage of the
electrically-powered catamaran craft for more bodies.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled from the water into small rowing boats.
	   Another two people were reported missing and it was not known
whether they were on the boat, said a spokeswoman for the rescue
operation, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
Initially, the rescue service said the boat was carrying 141 people
and that 44 were injured, she said.
	   Police suspect the boat was overloaded by 80 people, since it
was believed to have a maximum capacity of 80, said the spokeswoman
for the Barcelona-based rescue center.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of
Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid.
	   The national new agency Efe cited eyewitnesses as saying the
boat split in two. In another report it said the captain of the
boat realized he had problems shortly after setting off and was
trying to return to the pier when the vessel sank rapidly.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips daily on
the lake, a spokesman for the firm that owned it, La Carpa
spokesman, told Efe.
	   Initial reports indicated that most of the passengers were
retired French tourists from the western coastal town of La
Rochelle, 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Paris. They were
said to be on a hold
	   Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long and up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Report: Kurdish rebels down Turkish helicopter in southeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Kurdish rebels fighting for autonomy in
Turkey's southeast shot down a Turkish military helicopter, killing
13 soldiers, a report said Thursday.
	   Pro-Kurdish daily Ulkede Gundem said rebels fired on a U.S.-made
Sikorsky transport helicopter on Saturday, killing everyone aboard.
	   The operation took place in the province of Hakkari, where the
borders of Turkey, Iran and Iraq meet.
	   Ulkede Gundem said Turkish air raids against rebel hideouts in
the mountain were continuing.
	   Military officials were not available to comment.
	   The rebels are currently a source of tension between Syria and
Turkey, which accuses Damascus of sheltering and supporting them.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, who has been fighting Ankara since
1984, called a unilateral cease-fire on Sept. 1, but said they
would respond if attacked by the Turkish army.
	   Both the army and government rejected the truce call.
	   Some 37,000 people have died in the Turkish-Kurdish war.

Swissair pulls advertising campaign in wake of crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair has withdrawn its
advertising campaign in the wake of last month's crash of Flight
111 off Nova Scotia, an airline newsletter said Thursday.
	   The campaign, with the slogan ``The Refreshing Airline,'' is
being dropped and will be replaced by a new one with a stronger
emphasis on the theme of passenger care, according to the SAirGroup
News magazine.
	   The new campaign will likely be ready next month, the magazine
said. Until then, Swissair will use only its logo. New television
commercials are expected next year.
	   All 229 passengers and crew on board were killed in the Sept. 2
crash of the MD-11 aircraft flying from New York to Geneva.

Palestinian killed in clashes with Israeli troops

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at
Palestinians during stone-throwing clashes Thursday, killing a
20-year-old man and seriously injuring a news photographer.
	   The death raised the specter of new violence at a time when the
United States is trying to conclude an agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike to
protest Israel's eight-day blockade of the divided West Bank town
and a curfew in the downtown area. Schools and shops were closed.
	   Israel lifted the blockade on Thursday morning, but the curfew
remained in force, confining 30,000 Palestinians to their homes.
	   The clashes broke out Thursday morning, with dozens of
Palestinians throwing stones at Israeli soldiers guarding Jewish
enclaves in the Israeli-run downtown sector. Israeli soldiers fired
rubber-coated steel pellets.
	   Initially, two Palestinians were hurt.
	   Several Palestinian news photographers and cameramen moved
closer to film those injured when troops fired more rubber bullets.
	   Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer on assignment for the Agence
France Presse news agency, was struck in the back of the head and
was taken to a nearby hospital. Doctors said Abu Alan suffered a
skull fracture and was in serious condition.
	   The top Israeli army commander in Hebron, Col. Yigal Sharon,
held Palestinian police responsible for the violence, saying they
had done nothing to restrain the stone throwers.
	   The colonel said in a statement that when troops fired rubber
bullets at the stone throwers, they were not aware that a
photographer was among them.
	   Abu Alan wore a photographer's vest and had a camera slung
around his neck when he was hit.
	   In later clashes, a 20-year-old Palestinian, Amjad Natche, was
struck in the head by a rubber bullet. He was put on life support,
but was removed several hours later and declared dead, said Dr.
Jihad Bader of Hebron's Ahli Hospital.
	   Natche lived in Jordan and had been in Hebron for several weeks
to visit relatives. It was not immediately clear whether Natche was
throwing stones or watching the clashes when he was hit.
	   After he was pronounced dead, dozens of relatives and friends
carried his body, wrapped in a white sheet and draped with
Palestinian flags, to the morgue of nearby Alia Hospital. The
funeral was only to be held once his family arrives from Jordan.
	   Thursday's general strike was called by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement to protest the closure and curfew
imposed Sept. 30 when two dozen Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
civilians were injured by two hand grenades.
	   A Fatah leaflet distributed in Hebron this week also urged
activists to throw stones at Israeli soldiers on Friday.
	   About 450 settlers live in a number of enclaves in downtown
Hebron, surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians and protected by
large numbers of Israeli soldiers and police.
	   Meanwhile, a blanket closure of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
remained in force, barring more than 2.5 million Palestinians from
entering Israel. The closure has been in force almost continuously
since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period on Sept. 20.
	   The closure was imposed after the Islamic militant group Hamas
threatened to take revenge for the killing of two Hamas fugitives
by Israeli special forces. Hamas has killed scores of Israelis in
recent years in suicide bomb attacks.

France asks for U.N. meeting on Iraqi warheads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RAISES French official saying tests were negative, edits,
ADDS byline.
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Thursday asked the U.N. commission
investigating Iraq's weapons to convene a meeting with weapons
experts over whether nerve gas has been found on Iraqi warheads.
	   A French official, meanwhile, denied a published report that
French experts had detected traces of the nerve gas VX on Iraqi
warheads, and also that France withheld the findings because it
didn't want to undermine Baghdad's attempts to get U.N. sanctions
lifted.
	   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the tests
for nerve gas were negative, and called the report in Wednesday's
New York Times a politically motivated leak.
	   The official said the meeting France was demanding at the United
Nations would show the tests were negative.
	   In a statement, the Foreign Ministry called for a meeting in the
next few days, to permit Security Council members ``to appreciate
the scientific methods used by the three chosen laboratories (in
France, Switzerland and the United States) and the results
obtained, and the scientific conclusions to be drawn.''
	   The controversy came as Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, arrived in France after his trip to the United Nations.
He was to meet Friday with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said the request
for a meeting came ``out of concern for clarification and the
information of the Security Council members.''
	   The New York Times reported Wednesday that testing on samples
from the weapons show evidence of chemicals linked to VX, a drop of
which on the skin, or inhaled, can kill an adult within minutes.
The newspaper cited unidentified weapons experts.
	   Iraq, which has been the subject of seven years of U.N. weapons
inspections, has admitted it tried to make VX but denied it was
ever able to make enough, or stabilize it sufficiently to load into
weapons.
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the Security Council will lift
crippling sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War.
	   Swiss tests on warheads turned up negative. But a U.S. Army
laboratory concluded that missile fragments contained traces of the
gas.
	   Weapons experts told the Times that the French findings would
confirm the American tests.

Bucharest official suggests corpses share graves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Bucharest cemeteries are running out
of space, and the city's deputy mayor is recommending that corpses
double up in graves.
	   ``The only chance for the future is for us to build cemeteries
out of the capital,'' Deputy Mayor Alexandru Malliu said by
telephone Thursday. ``Until then, I recommend ... for two or three
people to share the same grave.''
	   Each month, about 10,000 people die in Romania's capital, and
the city's cemeteries are unable to cope with the growing demand,
Malliu said.
	   Two cemeteries have just closed after running out of space, he
said. Their closure follows that of five other graveyards that have
filled up in recent years.
	   Bucharest has a population of 3 million, about 1 million more
than at the end of communism in 1989.
	   The Romanian Orthodox Church, to which 90 percent of Romanians
belong, believes cremation is wrong, adding to the lack of space.
	   People unofficially sell spaces in the capital's overcrowded
cemeteries for millions of lei (hundreds of dollars), a small
fortune for Romanians whose average monthly salary is 1.2 million
lei (dlrs 129).

<TEXT>
	   GIRONA, Spain (AP) _ An excursion boat carrying some 140 people
sank Thursday in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain, killing at
least 20 French retirees.
	   Thirteen people drowned in the water, and seven people died
after being taken to local hospitals. A total of 38 people were
treated in hospital following the accident and 81 others, including
the boat's Spanish captain, escaped without injury.
	   Rescue units scoured the water and the wreckage of the
electrically-powered catamaran craft for more bodies.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake. Other shots showed bodies being
pulled from the water into small rowing boats.
	   Another two people were reported missing and it was not known
whether they were on the boat, said a spokeswoman for the rescue
operation, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
Initially, the rescue service said the boat was carrying 141 people
and that 44 were injured, she said.
	   Police suspect the boat was overloaded by 60 people, since it
was believed to have a maximum capacity of 80, said the spokeswoman
for the Barcelona-based rescue center.

Muslim leader shot at home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Unknown attackers shot and
wounded a leading Muslim imam at his home in one of Cape Town's
most crime-infested slums, police said Thursday.
	   A group of unidentified men called at Sheikh Abdurahman
Gafieldien's house on Wednesday night in Manenburg, an area that is
the base for the infamous Hard Livings drug gang. When the imam
opened the door he was shot in the face and the men fled, said
police Capt. Anine de Beer.
	   Gafieldien was rushed to a hospital where he is in a critical
but stable condition.
	   A prominent figure in Cape Town's small but vocal Muslim
community, Gafieldien has campaigned against drugs and violence,
even brokering peace deals between feuding crime gangs.
	   Gafieldien has also criticized a Muslim vigilante group, People
Against Gangsterism and Drugs, that police believe is behind a wave
of bombings and shootings in the squalid Cape Flats townships.
	   Muslim-related violence in Cape Town made international
headlines recently after an August bomb attack on a Planet
Hollywood restaurant killed two people.
	   A caller to a local radio station claimed reponsibility for the
attack on behalf of a small Islamic group called Muslims Against
Global Oppression. The organization later denied any involvement.

Olano wins elite men's time trial: Armstrong fourth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - Abraham Olano of Spain won the
elite men's time trial Thursday at the World Cycling Championhips
overpowering the field by more than a half-minute.
	   On a cool, wet day in southern Netherlands, Olano covered the
43.5-kilometer (27-mile) course in 54 minutes, 32.13 seconds,
adding to his advantage at the checkpoints throughout the race.
	   Melchior Mauri, another Spanish rider, was second almost 38
seconds behind, with Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine third, 47 second
back.
	   American Lance Armstrong, in a comeback from cancer, finished
fourth, 56 seconds behind Olano.
	   Early starters began in the rain but the drizzle had stopped by
the end of the race. However conditions were slick throughout the
route from Maastricht to Valkenbug that ended with a short but
steep climb.
	   Olano, the 1995 road champion, nearly caught 1994 champion Chris
Boardman of Britain, who started two minutes ahead, at the finish.
	   Olano took the silver medal in the 1996 Olympic time trial and
recently won the Tour of Spain.
	   Armstrong, who announced he had testicular cancer just before
the world championships two years ago, continued his remarkable
return to the top level of cycling.
	   The Austin, Texas took the 1997 season off to battle his cancer
with chemotheraphy and operations. His cancer is in remission now.

Drug-testing lab to be shut; homes searched
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Segura quotes, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Faced with allegations of covered-up and improper
doping tests in soccer, the Italian Olympic Committee's medical
panel said Thursday it will temporarily shut its drug-testing
laboratory.
	   The decision came after an International Olympic Committee (IOC)
official deemed the Acqua Acetosa lab unsatisfactory.
	   ``Right now, the Rome laboratory does not have a chance of being
re-accredited by the IOC,'' said the official, Jordi Segura. ``For
the IOC, the most important thing is guaranteeing the quality and
trustworthiness of labs where analyses are done.''
	   Meanwhile, investigators from the Rome prosecutor's office
searched the homes of five current or former employees of the
facility. Emilio Gasbarrone, fired last week after 10 years as
chief of Acqua Acetosa, and four others were told they are being
investigated for abuse of office and concealing evidence.
	   Investigators looking into charges of doping in Italian League
soccer have reportedly discovered that some tests were not complete
and the results of others may have been hidden. Documentation on
anti-doping tests was being discarded after two months, while the
lab is required to keep it at least two years, five in the case of
positive tests.
	   Segura, president of an IOC subcommittee on biochemistry and
doping, met with Acqua Acetosa and Italian Olympic Committee (CONI)
officials Thursday. He recommended a ``moratorium'' for two or
three months on tests at the facility.
	   The lab will close Friday. Tests that would have been conducted
at Acqua Acetosa will now be done at labs in Barcelona, Spain;
Cologne, Germany, or Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   The shutdown is meant to give CONI a chance to get its house in
order and save the facility's accreditation.
	   The ever-widening scandal _ which also led to CONI president
Mario Pescante's resignation _ began in July after AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman raised questions about the sudden muscular development
of certain players.
	   Since then, there have been four separate inquiries into the use
of performance-enhancing substances in the Italian League.
	   The head of the players union has threatened to call a six-month
strike to protest the handling of the investigations. The union
will meet Monday to discuss a walkout.

Israel outraged over kick to the jaw of West Ham international
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: DELETES ``allegedly'' from 12th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Neither Mideast summit plans nor a record
dollar rate were a match in Israel on Thursday for the news
generated by the image of West Ham midfielder and Israeli
international Eyal Berkovic cringing in pain.
	   The Maariv daily's front-page was covered by a photo of Berkovic
kneeling as West Ham teammate John Hartson's left foot struck his
jaw.
	   ``The scream of pain,'' read the Maariv caption.
	   ``It's shocking to see such a thing, especially if it's your own
son,'' said Berkovic' father, Zeev.
	   ``At first I felt Hartson should be prosecuted, but Eyal decided
not to complain to the police. He wasn't so badly hurt. He's
alright now, and that's the main thing for me,'' Berkovic told The
Associated Press.
	   In England on Wednesday, Berkovic told the Mirror the incident
occured in a training session before West Ham's Sept. 28 clash with
Southampton and accused West Ham management of trying to cover it
up.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic was quoted saying in the Mirror.
	   The Israeli national team gave Berkovic a warm welcome as he
arrived in San Marino for a European Championship qualifier that
pits Israel against the tiny European nation.
	   Angriest was Israeli midfielder Haim Revivo.
	   ``Hartson is lucky he didn't do it to me,'' Revivo told the
Haaretz daily. ``He wouldn't be playing football by now. Believe
me.''
	   The incident followed a tackle by Hartson which left Berkovic on
the ground.
	   Hartson later went to help Berkovic to his feet but the Israeli
midfielder waved his arms at the gesture. Hartson then kicked his
teammate and was led away by trainers as Berkovic slumped back to
the ground.
	   Israeli media quoted Berkovic was saying he would not submit a
complaint to the police against Hartson.
	   ``Believe me he would go to jail, but I don't want a player from
my team sent to prison,'' Haaretz quoted Berkovic as saying.
	   The Israeli midfielder has said he would have to consider
whether to remain with the club.
	   However, he rejected Hartson's claim that he was merely using
the incident as a pretext for leaving the English club, Haaretz
said. Berkovic told the daily he would return to West Ham as soon
as the San Marino event was over.
	   Berkovic told the daily he would return to West Ham as soon as
the San Marino match was over.
	   The English Football Association has asked West Ham for a copy
of the amateur videotape of the incident, which generated the still
photographs, for the possibility of considering measures against
Hartson. West Ham reportedly prefers to settle the issue internally
on the grounds that the incident occurred in training, not in a
match.

Portugal's Jose Saramago wins Nobel Literature Prize

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ With a lively imagination that
envisions events such as a section of Europe floating out to sea
and a pen-stroke that changes the world, Portuguese novelist Jose
Saramago won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday.
	   The Swedish Academy said it gave the award to Saramago for work
that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago, 75, wrote his breakthrough novel in 1982, ``Baltasar
and Blimunda.'' Perhaps his best-known work is ``The Stone Raft,''
in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe for
supernatural reasons and floats off into the Atlantic.
	   That device allows him to comment ironically ``about the
authorities and politicians, perhaps especially about the major
players in power politics.''
	   Saramago's exuberant imagination and playfulness have made him
one of Portugal's most popular contemporary novelists, and his
works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
	   In ``Blindness,'' his most recent work to be translated into
English, a nameless man in a nameless country suddenly goes blind,
and the affliction quickly spreads through the country _ grim tale
of social collapse.
	   ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' tells of a proofreader
who mischievously inserts the word ``not'' in a manuscript, thereby
reversing historical events.
	   ``Saramago's idiosyncratic development of his own resonant style
of fiction gives him a high standing ... he invokes tradition in a
way that in the current state of things can be described as
radical,'' the Academy said in the citation for the 7.6-million
kronor (dlrs 978,000 prize).
	   Saramago (pronounced sah-rah-MAH-go) is the fourth consecutive
European to win the prestigious prize, and the first laureate to
write in Portuguese.
	   He had long been seen as one of the strongest potential
candidates for the prize and the frequent media queries about his
prospects contrasted with his personality.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people, trying to make friends,'' he told The
Associated Press in a recent interview. ``I just write.''
	   Saramago on Thursday had planned to leave Frankfurt, Germany, _
where he was attending the international book fair _ for his home
in the Canary Islands. But as he waited in the airport, his
publisher told him to go back to the fair, where a cheering
rose-bearing crowd awaited him.
	   ``I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my
country,'' he said through a translator.
	   He worked as a journalist until the dictatorship of Antonio
Salazar was toppled in 1974, when he returned to writing fiction.
	   The literature prize is one of five established by Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The prizes have
been awarded since 1901; a sixth prize, in economics, was started
in 1969.
	   According to the terms of Nobel's will, the literature prize is
to recognize writing that works ``in an ideal direction.''
	   How to interpret that term has been widely debated. The Nobel
Prize over the years has been given to writers with world-views
stretching from the bleak futility of Samuel Beckett's works to the
vivid epics of Iceland's Halldor Laxness.
	   The prize even has gone occasionally to writers who did not work
in fiction or poetry, notably Winston Churchill and Bertrand
Russell.
	   Last year's prize went to Dario Fo, the Italian playwright whose
work combines gut-busting comedy with acid social and political
commentary. The 1996 winner was the Polish poet Wislawa Szymborska,
as shy and delicate as Fo is boisterous.
	   The Swedish Academy does not reveal who was nominated or who it
considered on its shortlist. Nominations can be made by previous
laureates, professors of history and literature, members of the
Academy and presidents of some national authors' organizations.
	   The Nobel Prize in Medicine winner will be announced Oct. 12,
the physics and chemistry winners on Oct. 13, the economics
laureate on Oct. 14 and the peace prize on Oct. 16. All the prize
announcements are in Stockholm, except for the peace prize which is
given in Oslo, Norway.
	   All the prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of
Nobel's death.

Ukrainian boy dies after climbing into refrigerator
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A 3-year-old Ukrainian boy suffocated after
climbing into a refrigerator at his home, newspapers said Thursday.
	   The boy, named Pavlyk, had been left alone after his mother went
to work and his father fell asleep after returning from a night
shift in the southeastern town of Zaporizhia.
	   He climbed into an old refrigerator and could not open its door
after it shut, the dailies Fakty and Segodnya said.
	   The father later found Pavlyk's body in the refrigerator and
called emergency medics, who could not resuscitate the boy. Medics
said there was only enough air inside the refrigerator to last the
child for 20 minutes, the reports said.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The EU head office on Thursday unveiled
a logo for retailers across the EU that tells customers as of next
year they can pay their bills in euros if they wish.
	   The logo _ a smiling face above the text `payments in euros
accepted' _ is aimed at ``creating a climate of confidence for the
changeover to the euro,'' said EU Consumer Affairs Commissioner
Emma Bonino.
	   Shops displaying the logo, created jointly by EU consumer and
retail organizations, commit to list prices in euros and the
national currency, to charge no extra for euro payments and to
abide by rules on rounding off prices converted into euros.
	   All 15 EU nations except Britain, Greece, Denmark and Sweden
adopt the euro on Jan. 1. Until 2002, the euro will be in use
side-by-side with national currencies.

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation
</HEADLINE>

editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of parliament suggested Thursday
holding a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal violates Russian law.
	   ``It would be legitimate to hold such a referendum,'' said
Gennady Seleznyov, a Communist who is speaker of the lower house,
the State Duma. His remarks were reported by the Interfax news
agency.
	   However, Russian law specifically states that there cannot be a
referendum on the early termination of a president's term.
	   Vladimir Platonov, a deputy speaker of the parliament's upper
chamber, the Federation Council, confirmed that Seleznyov's
proposal violates the law.
	   ``I realize that some people are angry and want the president to
step down immediately, but there is no law allowing us to dismiss
the head of state by referendum,'' Platonov said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Seleznyov added that Yeltsin should consider resigning
voluntarily following nationwide protests on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve out his
full term. During a meeting with senior military and security
officers, he said he would maintain personal control over the
military.
	   ``And it will be like that, at least, until the year 2000, while
I'm here,'' Yeltsin said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest the
country's economic woes. Many of the demonstrators also called for
the resignation of Yeltsin, who still has two years left in his
term.
	   The government on Wednesday evening estimated that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised the estimate to 1.3 million on Thursday.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below the expectations of
Communists who organized the protest together with trade unions.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to 40 million
would take part.
	   Zyuganov on Thursday used the protest to renew his call on
Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``He and his constitution are like a plastic bag wrapped around
the head of the nation to suffocate it, and they must be removed
immediately,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zyuganov said the Communists would begin picketing the
government buildings and launch ``actions of civil disobedience''
if Yeltsin doesn't step down. He also said the Duma is completing
preparation of the impeachment motion against the president and
would move to launch it soon.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the president
``expressed regret'' over Seleznyov's referendum call.
	   Wednesday's protest showed that ``people are mostly concerned
with concrete problems such as wages, pensions and other social
payments, and the government is working to solve them,'' Yakushkin
said on Russia's ORT television.
	   ``Calls for referendums ... will only excessively politicize
society and distract us from dealing with concrete tasks,'' he
said.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he won't run again. The most likely candidates include Zyuganov,
regional governor Alexander Lebed, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and
liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky.

Iran reports clash with Taliban, Taliban denies it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Taliban accusing Iran of firing artillery this
week in new 11th graf; RAISES background &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian forces clashed with Afghanistan's
Taliban militia Thursday on Iran's northeastern border, Iran's
official media reported. But the Taliban denied any clash occurred.
	   Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in northeastern
Khorasan province with mortars and machine guns early Thursday and
Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to
retreat, Iranian television said.
	   The Taliban suffered heavy casualties during the three hour
clash and three of the militia's border posts were destroyed, Brig.
Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground forces of Iran's
elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said. His remarks were
carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   ``The situation in the area is currently calm,'' Jaafari said.
	   There were no immediate reports of any Iranian casualties.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   Thursday's reported clash occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300 GMT) in
Torbat-e Jam in the Saleh Abad region. The area is about 180
kilometers (110 miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place, and branded the Iranian report as propaganda
against Taliban.
	   ``We received this information and we checked from our people
and it is wrong,'' he said when contacted at the Taliban
headquarters in southern Kandahar.
	   Another Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said the
Iranians have fired artillery into Afghanistan during the past
three days. But Taliban leader Mullah Omar ordered his border
commanders to ``show restraint and not retaliate,'' Muttawakil said
when contacted by telephone from neighboring Pakistan.
	   Iran wants an apology from the Taliban for the August slaying of
its citizens and wants the culprits handed over for trial in
Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the diplomats
``conspirators.''
	   It also has accused Iran of arming and financing its
northern-based opposition, which includes the country's minority
Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are Shiite Muslims.
	   The Taliban is made up largely of ethnic Pashtuns, who are
mostly Sunni Muslims.
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its western border with Iran.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

McCaffrey lauds Jamaica drug effort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
applauded Jamaica's efforts to fight drug smuggling and said the
United States is doing what it can to stem demand.
	   McCaffrey told a news conference Wednesday that in Latin America
and the Caribbean, Jamaica and Chile ``have the most coherent and
sensible anti-drug strategies ... although much more work needs to
be done.''
	   In a one-day trip to Jamaica, McCaffrey said the Clinton
administration was committed to fighting exports of weapons from
the United States to the region _ including Jamaica.
	   Citing efforts to stem U.S. demand, McCaffrey said U.S. drug
abuse has declined by 50 percent over the past 15 years. ``Our
cocaine use has come down by 70 percent, but having said that it
still remains a problem among 6 percent of the population, doing
enormous damage,'' he said.
	   In 1997, Jamaica signed an agreement with the United States
allowing U.S. law enforcement, under certain conditions, to enter
Jamaican waters and airspace in pursuit of suspected drug
traffickers.
	   This year, the two countries signed a treaty providing for legal
cooperation in anti-drug and arms smuggling matters.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan offered its fullest apology ever for its
35-year colonial rule of South Korea in a pact Thursday aimed at
putting behind the two neighbors' painful past and building a ``new
partnership.''
	   The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, also outlined new areas of
cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability on the
Korean Peninsula.
	   ``What a long period of time we needed to state the common
resolutions,'' Obuchi said later at a state banquet, referring to
the lengthy estrangement resulting from the 1910-45 colonial period
and Japan's wartime brutality in South Korea. ``Now it's time for
us to make our commitment come true.''
	   Japan's apology Thursday did not sound all that different from
its statements of remorse in recent years, which South Koreans have
criticized as lacking in sincerity.
	   But this time, the wording of the apology was negotiated between
the two sides, written in a document and signed, clarifying Japan's
recognition of past misdeeds.
	   ``I feel acute remorse and offer an apology from my heart,''
Obuchi said. ``I have made our country's position clear.''
	   He also expressed hopes that Japan's position was clearly
understood by his Cabinet members so they would not spark outrage
as some of their predecessors have done in the past by defending
Japan's wartime actions.
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the Japanese statement. The
``form and feeling'' of the apology were more sincere than in the
past, he said.
	   In a speech to Japan's Parliament, Kim said South Korea and
Japan should not forget their 1,500-year history of exchanges just
because of Japan's decades-long aggression.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said.
	   Kim announced plans to lift a ban on Japanese songs, films and
other culture in his country, while urging Japan to give its South
Korean residents _ many of them descendants of Koreans brought here
as forced laborers _ the right to vote in local elections.
	   Thursday's pact signing came a day after Kim arrived in Tokyo
for a four-day visit, his first since becoming president earlier
this year. He met the emperor on Wednesday and spoke at a gala
banquet at the Imperial Palace.
	   After paying a farewell visit to the emperor and attending a
luncheon with Japanese lawmakers Friday, he will fly to Osaka in
western Japan to meet South Korean groups.
	   A key topic in his talks here has been the economy.
	   Obuchi offered Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South
Korea overcome its severe downturn. Seoul is struggling to
restructure its economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   At a luncheon given by economic and business leaders Thursday,
Kim urged Japanese businesses to increase investment in South Korea
and called for the two countries to work together to boost
bilateral trade.
	   As a sign of closer ties, Tokyo and Seoul are considering a
visit to South Korea by Emperor Akihito. Such a trip is a touchy
subject, since it was in the name of the late Emperor Hirohito _
Akihito's father _ that Japan conquered much of Asia before and
during World War II.
	   Kim said such a trip could come before the two nations jointly
stage the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   ``We're neighbors and it's been 33 years since we've established
diplomatic relations,'' Kim said. ``So I think the fact that the
emperor hasn't visited yet is extremely unnatural.''

Holyfield-Lewis unification title fight in the cards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A heavyweight unification title fight between IBF
and WBA champion Evander Holyfield and WBC belt-holder Lennox Lewis
could become a reality.
	   According to Britain's domestic news association Press
Association, Don King was expected to meet next week in London with
Lewis' promoter Panos Eliades and manager Frank Maloney.
	   ``Everybody is talking, that's the main thing,'' Maloney said
Thursday. ``He (King) is quite happy to put the fight on, but
obviously the financial terms have to be met.''
	   Maloney, who has managed Lewis for nine years, also said he was
considering an offer to manage King's interests in Britain.
	   ``Don does not see the deal being in conflict with my management
of Lennox, or any of my fighters,'' he said.
	   ``He believes I've done a good job with Lewis. Maybe our
relationship will bring a unification with Holyfield that much
nearer.''
	   Lewis last week won a points decision over Croatian challenger
Zeljko Mavrovic in a WBC title defense.
	   The workmanlike, but disappointing performance by Lewis came one
week after Holyfield scored an equally uninspiring points win over
unheralded Vaughn Bean in an IBF mandatory title defense.
	   The Lewis camp has been seeking a title unification fight with
Holyfield, however, the WBA and IBF champion has indicated he wants
to make a WBA mandatory defense against Henry Akinwande before
fighting Lewis.
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from the
Home Box Office cable television network to put his two world
heavyweight belts on the line against Lewis.

Prime minister says Russia trying to help in Turkey-Syria standoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday that
Russia is trying to help defuse a tense standoff between Turkey and
Syria, a news agency said.
	   ``We are watching the situation attentively and are doing
everything through diplomatic channels to ease tensions,'' Primakov
said after a meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``We are in constant contact with Turkey and Syria ... and are
ready to help bring their positions closer,'' he said.
	   Turkey alleges that Syria is harboring Kurdish rebels, who carry
out cross-border attacks into Turkey and are seeking more autonomy
for the Kurdish population in southeastern Turkey. Syria denies the
accusation.
	   Primakov also praised the work of Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who shuttled between Turkey and Syria on Tuesday trying to
find a peaceful solution.
	   Mubarak ``removed tension as a result of his trip to Turkey,''
ITAR-Tass quoted Primakov as saying.

Soldiers sent to area of Indonesia hit by serial killings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ After meeting with President B.J.
Habibie, Indonesia's military commander sent a military team
Thursday to an area of the country that has recently suffered more
than 100 bizarre slayings.
	   The murders _ many of which have targeted Muslim clerics or
people suspected of practicing black magic _ began two months ago
in and around the town of Banyuwangi in East Java, about 830
kilometers (520 miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.
	   Witnesses have said the killers wear ninja-like black clothing
and attack at night with knives. Many victims were found mutilated.
Some people have theorized that political and religious rivalries
might be behind the killings.
	   ``I ordered a military team to East Java to investigate and to
prevent the further spread of killings,'' Armed Forces Commander
Gen. Wiranto told reporters after his meeting with Habibie.
	   Wiranto declined to say how many soldiers were being sent.
	   East Java's police chief, Maj. Gen. Moech Dayat, reportedly has
said the carnage might be the work of organized crime or the result
of personal feuds or disputes over money.
	   ``Those having feuds have paid others to kill (their rivals),''
Dayat said. ``That is what we know so far.''
	   But other police officers have said they can't established a
clear motive behind the killings.
	   Police already are protecting more than 200 people who fear they
might be targeted by the murderers, and many other frightened
people have taken refuge in nearby villages.
	   The official Antara news agency reported Thursday that police
have arrested 139 suspects, and that 148 people are under
investigation in the case.
	   Many of the dead belonged to the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, which recently set
up its own political party. Other victims were reportedly sorcerers
who dabbled in black magic that predates the arrival of Islam in
Indonesia hundreds of years ago.
	   Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights, which is now
investigating the killings, said at least 105 people have been
killed and an estimated 35 people are missing.

President's party: Tudjman should make 14 times average salary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Trying to dent public outrage, President
Franjo Tudjman's party on Thursday acknowledged it was wrong to
suggest that he be paid 20 times more than the average wage.
Instead, the party said 14 times more would do.
	   The new suggestion would give Tudjman an annual salary of
420,000 kuna (dlrs 70,000),
	   Tudjman's party, which controls parliament, in July secured
approval of a bill giving the president the annual equivalent of
dlrs 96,000. Parliament deputies were to get a 300 percent
increase, or dlrs 3,125 a month.
	   The decision prompted outrage among Croats who suffer increasing
economic hardships on an average monthly wage of dlrs 400.
Pensioners get half that figure.
	   With elections due late next year, Tudjman ordered the
government to scrap the bill and review it five days after its
passage.
	   On Thursday, party spokesman Vladimir Seks acknowledged that
``we were wrong'' to suggest such a high salary.
	   Parliament is expected to vote on the new recommendation later
this month.

U.S. envoy arrives in Ethiopia on peace mission
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A senior U.S. envoy on Thursday
made a renewed attempt to resolve a 5-month border conflict between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Although fighting has subsided, both sides have steadily massed
troops and weapons along their border, bracing for battles that
erode stability throughout northeast Africa.
	   Anthony Lake, a former U.S. national security adviser, and four
other negotiators arrived in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa,
from Asmara, Eritrea.
	   The team met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
following two days of discussions with Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki.
	   No details on the U.S. peace initiative, nor on the progress of
negotiations have been released by any of the three governments
involved.
	   ``Mr. Lake shared with the Eritrean president his initial ideas
on a peaceful solution to the conflict,'' an Eritrean government
statement said.
	   ``He has no intention of issuing public pronouncements on the
U.S. initiative as he was convinced that this would not be helpful.
President Isaias assured him that Eritrea shared his views on the
merits of a quiet approach.''
	   The United States and Rwanda advanced a peace proposal in June,
which required both sides to withdraw to positions held before
hostilities broke out in May.
	   Eritrea has rejected that agreement. Several diplomats have said
Eritrea objected because the details of the plan were released
before its officials were advised.
	   Lake and his delegation planned to return to Asmara on Friday
for more meetings with Isaias.
	   Eritrea, a former Italian colony, became independent from
Ethiopia in 1993 after a 30-year war for independence.

Italy balks at NATO strikes in Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from Communists, Greens, right; ADDS

 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In a concession to his Communist allies, Italy's
premier said Thursday that conditions weren't ripe for NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, complicating efforts for an alliance
consensus on how to deal with the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' Premier Romano Prodi told the Chamber of
Deputies, where he was battling for political survival a day ahead
of a confidence vote.
	   Prodi said the U.N. Security Council should approve any strikes,
an doubtful prospect in the face of Russian opposition.
	   As they did in the 1995 NATO bombing campaign that helped end
the war in Bosnia, air bases on Italian soil could play an
important role in a new campaign of NATO air strikes.
	   Even without the air bases, however, NATO can turn to the sea.
It currently has 17,000 military personnel from 11 countries
involved in naval war games in the Mediterranean off the Italian
coast.
	   But before logistics would come into play, NATO would need
unanimous political backing from its 16 members for military
intervention.
	   There was no immediate reaction to Prodi's comments from NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
	   His stance appeared to be part of the price Prodi's center-left
coalition is paying for crucial support in Friday's vote of
confidence. The premier is relying on a breakaway Communist faction
to squeak by.
	   The faction opposes NATO strikes, as does the tiny Greens party,
which is part of Prodi's coalition.
	   Both parties praised Prodi's comments. But he was blasted from
the right.
	   ``Comrade Cossutta saves the government to the tune of the `Red
Flag' and, thus, for the first time in its history, Italy breaks
ranks with the Atlantic Alliance,'' complained Gianfranco Fini,
whose right-wing party is part of the opposition coalition.
	   Prodi's comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was heading for Brussels to meet with NATO officials.
Albright is trying to build a NATO consensus for air strikes.
	   Yugoslav Serb forces have killed hundreds of people and turned
tens of thousands into refugees in Kosovo in their offensive
against ethnic Albanian rebels. Ninety percent of the population of
Kosovo is ethnic Albanian.

27 injured in explosions in Indian Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim militants lobbed
grenades at Indian troops and exploded a bomb near a government
office Thursday in troubled Kashmir state, wounding at least 27
people, police said.
	   Six soldiers and nine civilians were injured in three grenade
blasts in Srinagar, the center of a Muslim separatist insurgency,
police said.
	   A few hours later, a motor scooter apparently rigged with a bomb
exploded and wounded 12 more people.
	   Most of the injuries were minor but five people were
hospitalized, police said.
	   The rebels are fighting for an independent Kashmir or to join
neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state. Kashmir is the only Muslim
majority state in predominantly Hindu India.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
control of Kashmir. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and
Pakistan the rest.

Ronaldo close to return to Inter Milan lineup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ After another long layoff, this time because
of nagging knee injuries, Ronaldo is nearing a return to
Internazionale of Milan's lineup.
	   The Brazilian has played just twice since the disastrous World
Cup final in July but said in an interview published Thursday he
could be fit for his Serie A club's Oct. 18 game against fellow
title contender Lazio of Rome.
	   ``I have finally started running again, and run well. If things
continue like this, I'll start practicing soon with the ball, and
that is what I miss the most,'' the striker told the Gazzetta dello
Sport newspaper. ``I know I need to go slowly, but nobody is in
more of a hurry than I am.''
	   Ronaldo has appeared in just one Italian Cup game and one league
game for Inter this season. His last outing was a 1-0 Serie A
victory over Piacenza Sept. 20, when he tallied the winner from the
penalty spot.
	   Since then, the 22-year-old has been working to overcome chronic
tendinitis in both knees.
	   ``I don't like to play unless I am at my best and I don't think
I have a right to play just because my name is Ronaldo,'' he said.
``If I go on the field, it's because I really can help Inter by
playing.''
	   Inter team doctor Piero Volpi said Ronaldo's therapy, which has
included hours of swimming to strengthen the knees, is ``all going
according to plan.''
	   The club gave its star more than a month off after the World
Cup, where Ronaldo was off-form and suffered a fit of convulsions
before Brazil's title game loss to France.
	   ``I am happy because I was feeling like a fish instead of a
soccer player,'' Ronaldo told Gazzetta dello Sport. ``I couldn't
take that pool any more. I belong on a field and I want to smell
grass not chlorine.''

Iran joins mediation efforts between Turkey and Syria

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The problems between Turkey and Syria can
be solved without violence, Iran's foreign minister said Thursday
after meeting with Syrian President Hafez Assad.
	   Turkish leaders accuse Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
carry out cross-border attacks into Turkey. Syria denies the
accusation, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has raised fears of a
regional conflict.
	   ``We are convinced that the two countries can solve their
problems through peaceful means,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi told the official Syrian News Agency.
	   Kharrazi was expected to fly to Turkey later Thursday for talks
with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem.
	   Iran enters mediation efforts as head of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that includes Syria and
Turkey. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak also has shuttled between
the two countries in an attempt to reduce tensions.
	   On Wednesday, Turkey's Parliament issued an ultimatum to Syria,
demanding that it expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory
or ``face the consequences.'' It did not spell out what actions it
might take.
	   The tone in the Turkish capital of Ankara was softer Thursday,
with government spokesman Haldun Otman saying that Turkey ``hopes
that the tension with the Syrian regime can be solved through
diplomatic channels,''
	   In Cairo, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk urged
Syria to ``take seriously'' Ankara's concerns. He also called on
Turkey to show restraint.
	   Turkey also contends that the rebels have training camps in
Lebanon near its border with Syria. Turkish news reports have
speculated that Ankara could attack alleged the bases in Lebanon's
Syrian-controlled eastern Bekaa Valley.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The secretary_general of the Arab League has
been hospitalized in Brussels, suffering from sever exhaustion
during a trip to the European Union headquarters, an officials said
Thursday.

tired.''

foreign minister before he was chosen as the League's head in 1990.

Japanese, South Korean leaders hold `new partnership' summit

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan offered its fullest apology ever for its
35-year colonial rule of South Korea in a pact Thursday aimed at
putting behind the two neighbors' painful past and building a ``new
partnership.''
	   The agreement, signed by Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, also outlined new areas of
cooperation, from the Asian financial crisis to stability on the
Korean Peninsula.
	   ``What a long period of time we needed to state the common
resolutions,'' Obuchi said later at a state banquet, referring to
the lengthy estrangement resulting from the 1910-45 colonial period
and Japan's wartime brutality in South Korea. ``Now it's time for
us to make our commitment come true.''
	   Japan's apology Thursday did not sound all that different from
its statements of remorse in recent years, which South Koreans have
criticized as lacking in sincerity.
	   But this time, the wording of the apology was negotiated between
the two sides, written in a document and signed, clarifying Japan's
recognition of past misdeeds.
	   ``I feel acute remorse and offer an apology from my heart,''
Obuchi said. ``I have made our country's position clear.''
	   He also expressed hopes that Japan's position was clearly
understood by his Cabinet members so they would not spark outrage
as some of their predecessors have done in the past by defending
Japan's wartime actions.
	   Kim said he was satisfied with the Japanese statement. The
``form and feeling'' of the apology were more sincere than in the
past, he said.
	   But in Seoul, a civic group representing South Korean women
forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World
War II said in a statement: ``We are seriously disappointed,
because the joint announcement doesn't even mention the issue of
comfort women'' _ Japan's euphemism for the sex slaves.
	   The Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual
Slavery by Japan reiterated its insistence that Japan's government
pay compensation to the women.
	   Historians estimate that as many as 200,000 women from Korea and
other Asian nations were taken to Japanese army brothels during
World War II. Some 150 South Koreans are registered as former sex
slaves.
	   In a speech to Japan's Parliament, Kim said South Korea and
Japan should not forget their 1,500-year history of exchanges just
because of Japan's decades-long aggression.
	   ``We must settle the accounts of the 20th century ... as we
enter the 21st century,'' Kim said.
	   Kim announced plans to lift a ban on Japanese songs, films and
other culture in his country, while urging Japan to give its South
Korean residents _ many of them descendants of Koreans brought here
as forced laborers _ the right to vote in local elections.
	   Thursday's pact signing came a day after Kim arrived in Tokyo
for a four-day visit, his first since becoming president earlier
this year. He met the emperor on Wednesday and spoke at a gala
banquet at the Imperial Palace.
	   After paying a farewell visit to the emperor and attending a
luncheon with Japanese lawmakers Friday, he will fly to Osaka in
western Japan to meet South Korean groups.
	   A key topic in his talks here has been the economy.
	   Obuchi offered Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help South
Korea overcome its severe downturn. Seoul is struggling to
restructure its economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The loans to South Korea are part of a broader dlrs 30 billion
aid deal for Asia that Obuchi is putting together in response to
international demands that Japan do more to ease the region's
financial crisis.
	   At a luncheon given by economic and business leaders Thursday,
Kim urged Japanese businesses to increase investment in South Korea
and called for the two countries to work together to boost
bilateral trade.
	   As a sign of closer ties, Tokyo and Seoul are considering a
visit to South Korea by Emperor Akihito. Such a trip is a touchy
subject, since it was in the name of the late Emperor Hirohito _
Akihito's father _ that Japan conquered much of Asia before and
during World War II.
	   Kim said such a trip could come before the two nations jointly
stage the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament.
	   ``We're neighbors and it's been 33 years since we've established
diplomatic relations,'' Kim said. ``So I think the fact that the
emperor hasn't visited yet is extremely unnatural.''

Portuguese thrilled with Nobel literature prize _ at last
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ After decades of waiting for a
Portuguese-language writer to win the Nobel literature prize,
Portugal's leaders on Thursday went into a fit of national pride
that almost overshadowed their exuberance for the work of Jose
Saramago.
	   ``At last!'' exclaimed Mario Soares, a former two-term president
and prime minister who now promotes Portuguese culture abroad. ``I
think it is finally an act of justice,'' he told reporters.
	   Current President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause for
``great collective satisfaction'' for Portugal. ``The awarding of
this prize distinguishes the Portuguese language.''
	   Sampaio, at least, did refer to the Nobel winner's writing: ``We
all look at that great craftsman of the Portuguese language and
that great creator. We salute him and thank him for the millions of
magnificent pages he has given us.''
	   Portugal, a country of fewer than 10 million people at the end
of Europe's Iberian peninsula, resents the common view that it is a
European hinterland.
	   ``It was about time they acknowledged Portuguese literature,''
Saramago's daughter, Violante Matos, said from her home in
Portugal's Madeira islands.
	   Portuguese is spoken by some 140 million, most of them in
Brazil, a Portuguese colony up to independence in 1822. It is also
the official language of five African countries that were
Portuguese colonies until 1975.
	   Brazilian writer Jorge Amado, a close friend of Saramago who is
himself favored to win a Nobel, praised the award as a victory for
the language and the author.
	   ``If anyone deserves the Nobel, it's Jose Saramago,'' he said in
a written statement from Brazil. ``By awarding Jose Saramago, one
of the most expressive writers of the contemporary world, the Nobel
Prize does justice to Portuguese literature.''
	   Other Portuguese-speakers have received Nobel prizes, but not
for literature.
	   Portugal's Egas Moniz won the Nobel prize for medicine in 1949,
and the 1996 peace prize went jointly to Jose Ramos-Horta and Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony in southeast Asia which Lisbon disputes with Indonesia.
	   The Nobel prize capped a distinguished year for tiny Portugal.
The economy made the grade for next year's launch of the new
European currency, the euro, and the Expo 98 world's fair in Lisbon
drew rare international attention.
	   Saramago himself gave a glimpse of his wry humor: ``The prize is
everybody's, but let me keep the money, eh?'' he joked on
Portuguese state radio Antena 1.

Arafat invites Yeltsin to take part in Middle East peace talks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
invited Russian President Boris Yeltsin to take part in Middle East
peace talks in Washington next week and to play a bigger role in
the peace process.
	   Arafat is on a two-day visit to Moscow following talks in the
Gaza Strip on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Those
talks raised hopes that the stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia was an active player
on the world stage, despite its current hardships.
	   ``We do not shut ourselves up in our own shell,'' Primakov said
after his talks with Arafat. ``Russia does not always advertise its
involvement in the peace process, but even when it stays in the
shadow, it plays a positive role.''
	   Russian and Palestinian ministers also signed a
Russian-Palestinian agreement on trade and economic cooperation.
	   Arafat was scheduled to meet with other government officials and
with Russian Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Alexy II before
traveling to Finland on Friday.

	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
defending champion Greg Rusedski toppled out in second round play
of the Swiss Indoors, further depleting the dwindling pool of
seeded players.
	   The two players join world No. 1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2
Patrick Rafter as early round casualties, leaving just two seeded
players in Basel midway through the second round.
	   Rusedski was toppled 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 by German qualifier David
Prinosil, bringing the defence of his crown to an abrupt halt,
while Kafelnikov was upset 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
	   In an apocalyptic first round, the tournment's top three seeds
and the three Grand Slam champions present crashed out, leaving the
draw sadly diminished.
	   Tournament organisers watched in horror as Wimbledon champion
Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and Australian Open titlist Petr
Korda, seeded third, all exited the tournament within 24 hours of
each other.
	   ``I have a lot of company,'' shrugged Rusedski. ``There have
been a lot of upsets. I guess it's not good to be a seed this
week.''
	   The lanky British power-server showed signs of weakness from the
start, narrowly saving two break points at 3-2 to remain on serve.
	   But Rusedski Q]Zf+Er:?5[Ez'S HBy/-|sjA;e, sending a fierce
backhand into the net, and allowing Prinosil to jump ahead 4-3. The
Briton broke back at 5-6 to avoid surrendering the set, but then
lost the tiebreak.
	   The two players traded serves early in the second set, before
the German qualifier used a pair of match points at 6-5 to clinch
the win.
	   Kafelnikov, ranked 10th in the world and 12th on the ``Road to
Hannover'' standings, was hoping to use the tournament as a
springboard into the top eight rankings in order to earn a berth at
the ATP Tour World Championship next month.
	   The Russian got off to a strong start in the first set, breaking
Gustafsson to jump ahead 3-1, but then appeared to yield control of
the match.
	   Gustafsson broke early in the second set, then held onto his
lead to even the score.
	   In the final set, the two held serve until 5-5, when Gustafsson
used two break points to seal the match.
	   The devastation leaves American Andre Agassi, seeded fourth, and
sixth-seed Tim Henman of Britain as the only remaining seeds.
	   Agassi played Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger in second round play
later Thursday, while Henman was scheduled to meet Morocco's Hicham
Arazi.
	   Boris Becker, always a top-draw, also made an early exit,
eliminated in the first round. The semi-retired veteran said he was
pulling out of Vienna next week, and offered his wildcard to
Sampras, who'd been disappointed Austrian organizers had no room
left for him after his elimination.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens began
talks on overhauling the tax system Thursday, the most contentious
topic so far facing the future government partners.
	   A day after agreeing on measures to fight unemployment, the two
parties discussed financing those plans as well as campaign
promises such as a boost in aid for families with children.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder chaired the talks only hours
before he was due to depart for Washington to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Friday for talks expected to focus on Kosovo and
global financial turmoil.
	   Schroeder has insisted he plans no major tax increases despite a
big budget gap he says he is inheriting from Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's outgoing government.
	   But hours before Thursday's talks began, Greens co-chairman
Juergen Trittin renewed his side's call for a broad increase in the
price of oil, natural gas and coal.
	   The Greens say that would promote conservation and finance cuts
in social security payments by employers, which the government
wants to help create jobs.
	   Schroeder, who sits on the supervisory board of Volkswagen, has
rejected Greens demands for a sharp hike in gasoline prices, saying
it would hurt the auto industry. His offer is a 6-pfennig
(3.75-cent) increase.
	   His party favors closing tax loopholes and other measures aimed
more at the rich.
	   ``We're not going to get very far with 6 pfennigs,'' Greens
negotiator Kerstin Mueller said heading into the talks.
	   But Schroeder has made clear that the Social Democrats, the
dominant party after Sept. 27 elections, have limited room for
accomodating the Greens.
	   At the same time, both parties largely agree on a modest income
tax cut, also a topic Thursday.
	   Mueller said negotiators would first discuss an outline of tax
policy for the new government's four-year term. She indicated the
nitty-gritty numbers would be left for later sessions.
	   A major business lobby, the Federation of German Industry, spoke
out against higher energy taxes Thursday, saying they would cost
jobs.
	   But Deutsche Bank chief economist Norbert Walter said in a
newspaper interview that raising gasoline taxes would be
``sensible'' if annual car licensing taxes were lowered at the same
time.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats, regrouping after their stinging
election defeat, denied that their budget had left Schroeder with a
hole of more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 12.5 billion) he claims.
	   ``New holes are being fabricated in the coalition talks,
apparently as a discreet way to dump election promises,'' said
Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is in line to replace Kohl as party
chairman.
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end.

Designer who invented stiletto heel dead at 90
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Roger Vivier, the shoe designer who created the
stiletto heel and clad the feet of movie stars and royalty, has
died at 90, former colleagues said Thursday.
	   Vivier died Oct. 2 at his home in the southwestern city of
Toulouse, the Le Monde daily said.
	   Besides the stiletto, his most noted designs included the
``comma,'' a steel creation designed in part by aeronautical
engineers, and the ``choc,'' with a heel curved dramatically into
the arch of the foot.
	   Enthusiasts praised his ability to give even the most radical
designs simplicity and elegance, revolutionizing women's tastes in
shoes from the 1930s to the 1960s.
	   Vivier once said he sought to merge ``the greatest extravagance
with the greatest classicism.''
	   His clients included Elizabeth Taylor, Marlene Dietrich and
Sophia Loren. At her 1953 coronation, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II
wore a pair of Vivier's gold, kid-leather shoes encrusted with
3,000 garnets, Le Monde said.
	   The empress of Iran also ordered 100 pairs every year during the
1950s, the newspaper said.
	   As a young man, Vivier worked as an extra at Paris' Theatre de
Belleville. His first dabblings in shoe design were so successful
they landed in Josephine Baker's closet.
	   Vivier opened his first workshop in 1937, designing for Bally
and Elsa Schiaparelli. After spending a few years in New York, he
returned to Paris to work for Christian Dior from 1953 to 1963.
During his 60-year career, he also worked with Nina Ricci, Pierre
Balmain, Guy Laroche and Yves Saint-Laurent.
	   Both the Yves Saint-Laurent and the Christian Dior fashion
houses confirmed his death in telephone calls Thursday.
	   Vivier worked in Paris until the 1970s, when he moved to the
French countryside. He continued his work until his death, always
taking on new challenges: last year, he designed sandals with a
plastic sole and heel for an inexpensive, popular shoe chain in
France.
	   Vivier is survived by his companion, Gerard Benoit-Vivier. No
funeral details were available.

Serb hard-liner removed from office for threats against NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnia's top international
mediator removed a Bosnian Serb hard-liner from office for
threatening retaliation against possible NATO airstrikes in
neighboring Yugoslavia, officials said Thursday.
	   The mediator, Carlos Westendorp of Spain, also banned the
ultranationalist Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj
both from entering Bosnia and interfering with implementation of
the Dayton peace accord.
	   The move came because some Western officials fear Serb
repercussions if NATO launches airstrikes against Yugoslavia in
response to its military actions in the province of Kosovo.
	   The Westerners fear retaliation could spill over and lead to
attacks by hard-liners on thousands of foreign soldiers and
officials working in Bosnia.
	   A final decision on whether NATO will conduct airstrikes is
expected in the next few days.
	   Earlier this week, Dragan Cavic, vice president of the strongest
Bosnian Serb hard-line party, warned Western powers that any attack
against Yugoslavia would be perceived as an attack against all
Serbs across former Yugoslavia.
	   Promising solidarity with Serbs in Yugoslavia, Cavic said
airstrikes or any NATO military action would endanger the 1995
peace accord that stopped the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   Cavic, a leading member of the Serb Democratic Party, won a seat
last month in the parliament that governs the Serb-held half of
Bosnia.
	   His statement prompted Westendorp to remove Cavic from
parliament and ban him from holding any other government position.
	   Westendorp sent a letter to Cavic warning him that his
statements were ``incitement to violence and a deliberate threat to
the security of the international community and to the Dayton peace
implementation process.''
	   In another letter, Westendorp demanded the newly elected
president of the Serb-held half of Bosnia, Nikola Poplasen, to ban
Yugoslav Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj from entering Bosnia or
interfering with the peace process.
	   The letter is likely to be a test for Poplasen, who won the
presidency as the leader of an ultranationalist Bosnian Serb party
with close links with Seselj. Poplasen's election victory delivered
a blow to Western powers in Bosnia, who now are looking for ways to
sideline him or remove him from office.
	   Last week, Seselj warned that in case of airstrikes, NATO
soldiers would be targeted ``no matter where they are, if reachable
to us.''
	   In the letter to Poplasen, Westendorp said Seselj's behaviors
``are in violation of the peace process and elementary standards of
international law.
	   ``As the elected president of Republika Srpska, we would ask
that you inform Mr. Seselj that his presence on the territory of
Bosnia-Herzegovina is unacceptable and that his participation in
electoral matters remains banned,'' it said.

Adviser to Netanyahu proposes pulling Generali award
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
on Thursday proposed withholding a prize from an Italian insurance
company that has refused to release information on Holocaust era
policies.
	   Bobby Brown, an adviser on diaspora affairs, asked the
organizers of an international business conference in Israel to
reconsider awarding Assicurazioni Generali a prize for contributing
to the Israeli economy.
	   Brown said he has written two letters to Generali asking the
company to release information on 337,000 World War II policies.
	   ``We're not asking them to admit responsibility. We're not
asking them for any kind of financial commitment,'' Brown said.
``We're asking for one thing and one thing only: to place the
policy information in the hands of the public.''
	   Generali, Italy's largest insurer, had provided that information
about six months ago to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust memorial and
research institute. Under the terms of the agreement, Yad Vashem is
not allowed to publish the information, but only to use it for its
own research.
	   The chairman of the Yad Vashem, Avner Shalev, said last month
that at least 100,000 of those policies were taken out by Jews.
	   Generali President Antoine Bernheim is among dozens of
international business leaders who are to receive the ``Jubilee
Award'' on Wednesday. Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to
acquire a majority position in Midgal, an Israeli insurance
company.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The secretary_general of the Arab League has
been hospitalized in Brussels, suffering from severe exhaustion
during a trip to the European Union headquarters, officials said
Thursday.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, 75, had a heavy schedule in New York and in
the Belgian capital, which led to fatigue, league spokesman Talaat
Hamid said.
	   A spokeswoman for the Egyptian Embassy in Brussels said
Abdel-Meguid is in stable condition and will leave the hospital to
return to Cairo in a few days.
	   ``The doctors have decided to keep him under observation,'' said
the spokeswoman, who did not want to be named.
	   She said Abdel-Meguid arrived from the United States ``very
tired.''
	   Abdel-Meguid, a veteran Egyptian diplomat, served as foreign
minister before he was chosen as the league's head in 1990.

Iguanas' accidental Caribbean cruise catches the eye of biologists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At least 15 iguanas went on an island-hopping Caribbean cruise
on a mat of logs, showing that land animals can migrate between
islands through such accidental voyages, researchers reported
today.
	   The iguanas apparently traveled about 150 miles (240 kilometers)
from Guadeloupe to Anguilla after Hurricanes Luis and Marilyn blew
through the region in September 1995.
	   There had been a few previous accounts of backboned animals
found on natural rafts but no convincing evidence that the voyagers
could start a new population when they reach land, researchers
said. But the iguanas that reached Anguilla in October 1995
included males and females, and since then they've appeared to be
healthy, the researchers said.
	   The animals are green iguanas, a species that hadn't lived on
the island, Ellen Censky of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History
in Pittsburgh and other scientists report in today's issue of the
journal Nature.
	   Local fishermen reported seeing the animals on the beach and on
logs in the bay after the huge raft washed up on Anguilla, the
report said. The researchers concluded the animals came from
Guadaleloupe because of the location of previous green iguana
populations, the tracks of the hurricanes and the direction of
ocean currents.
	   The researchers captured eight of the animals between December
1995 and last March. Three others were spotted on nearby Scrub
Island and more were reported on the northeast coast of Barbuda,
about 90 miles (140 kilometers) southeast of Anguilla, the
researchers said.
	   The new report is ``a spectacular observation,'' James H. Brown,
an ecologist and biogeographer at the University of New Mexico,
told The New York Times. ``Some of the things nature can do are
pretty incredible.''

Arena likely to be offered U.S. national team job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ D.C. United coach Bruce Arena is the leading
candidate for the U.S. national team job and likely will be offered
the position after the Major League Soccer championship game, U.S.
federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said Thursday.
	   ``We will not do anything during MLS,'' Steinbrecher said from
the USSF's Chicago headquarters. ``Bruce is certainly the leading
candidate with Carlos Queiroz having pulled out.
	   ``After the (MLS) Cup, we'll approach Bruce perhaps about
coaching our team. We intend to continue our discussions with
Bruce. I expect an offer will come at the end of MLS.''
	   The MLS Cup is scheduled for Oct. 25 in the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, California, but the United States has friendly against
Australia Nov. 6 in San Jose, California.
	   Steinbrecher said he wasn't sure who would coach the U.S. team
for the Australia match.
	   ``We don't know yet,'' Steinbrecher said. ``If Bruce takes the
job, we believe everything can be worked out. If not, a
player-coach or an assistant coach will take the team.''
	   Arena could not be reached Thursday morning but repeatedly has
refused to comment on media reports.
	   ``I am not concerned about any other job right now,'' Arena was
quoted in Thursday's editions of the Washington Post. ``I'm just
preparing for the playoffs.''
	   D.C. United finished off the Miami Fusion on Sunday in their
first-round playoff series and begins its best-of-3 Eastern
Conference semifinal series against the Columbus Crew on Sunday.
	   Arena and Queiroz, the former Portuguese national team and
current United Arab Emirates coach, were the leading candidates for
the U.S. job. Earlier this week, USSF president Bob Contigulia was
to fly to the United Arab Emirates to meet with Queiroz for an
interview, but reportedly was told by Queiroz not to come if he
didn't have an offer in hand.
	   Steinbrecher said he spoke to Arena earlier this week.
	   ``In general, we had conversations about philosophy, what the
job is, what direction the national teams and the federation are
going in,'' said Steinbrecher, who said he would prefer a long-term
contract through the next World Cup.
	   D.C. United general manager Kevin Payne has said he wants Arena,
who has coached the club to MLS' first two league titles, through
the Interamerican Cup, scheduled for Nov. 14 and Dec. 5.
	   The Interamerican Cup pits the CONCACAF club champion, D.C.
United, against the South American Copa Libertadores champion,
Brazil's Vasco da Gama, and a victory would be a major credibility
boost for both United and the three-year-old MLS.
	   Both sides have said they were willing to compromise to allow
Arena to coach both the U.S. team and D.C. United through the end
of the Interamerican Cup.
	   ``We won't do anything until the playoffs are over,''
Steinbrecher said. ``This is the day the MLS needs to shine. We're
not going to do anything to take away from that.''

Gardermoen takes over as Norway's new main airport

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The new Gardermoen facility took over as
Norway's international airport Thursday, after a massive all-night
move from Fornebu Airport on the outskirts of Oslo.
	   Although the 12.9-billion-kroner (dlrs 1.7 billion) airport has
been in limited use for three months, the first official flight, by
the small Color Air cut-price carrier, took off early Thursday
morning.
	   The opening of Gardermoen, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north
of the Norwegian capital, marks the end of an intense, three-decade
debate over where to build a new international airport for the
country.
	   Gardermoen has a capacity of 17 million passengers a year,
compared to the 11 million that had stretched Fornebu to the limit.
	   The new airport was the Norway's biggest construction project on
land, rivaled only by the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. Some
of Norway's offshore oil platforms cost more.
	   Norwegians celebrated Gardermoen, with its airy terminal and
heavy use of wood and natural stone inspired by Lillehammer's
Olympic venues, with a gala opening ceremony on Wednesday evening.
In a nationally televised performance, dancers with stylized
aircraft portrayed man's many attempts to fly.
	   At the ceremony, Norway's King Harald said, ``With some of the
same team spirit and goodwill of Lillehammer, I hope the demanding
breaking-in period will be a success.''
	   Early in its first day of operation, most of Gardermoen's
flights were on schedule.
	   However, there was little traffic. The Braathens airline, a key
domestic carrier, was grounded by a pilots strike, and other
airlines reduced traffic by 20 percent during the airport startup.
	   There were some headaches. A minor electrical fire stalled a
new, high speed train at the airport terminal. International
travelers late Wednesday waited up to an hour in immigration
control lines, causing tempers to flare.
	   But fears that road traffic would become hopelessly snarled were
unfounded, with traffic moving smoothly, if sometimes slowly, to
the airport.

Russian official: IMF remains `wary,' holds off on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with more on fourth-quarter budget,
ruble falling. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is already factoring into its
fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 billion in international loans,
despite signs that lenders are reluctant to hand over the money,
the finance minister said Thursday.
	   Mikhail Zadornov also said the budget to go to parliament next
week forecasts another sharp drop in the ruble rate, which has
plummeted since the currency was devalued in August.
	   Zadornov and other Russian officials tried and failed to win a
new loan installment from the International Monetary Fund during a
visit to Washington this week. Zadornov said the IMF won't issue
the funds until Russia takes a definitive stab at overcoming its
current troubles.
	   The Russian government has yet to finalize a plan to tackle the
economic crisis _ even though the country desperately needs the
foreign aid to help pay its many debts. Wage and pension arrears
sparked a day of nationwide protests Wednesday.
	   The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia
is ``very wary,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``They expect practical steps first,'' he said. ``If these steps
help to stabilize the situation and are based on free-market
instruments, then they will receive understanding and support.''
	   The IMF helped arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion international loan
package for Russia in July, but had disbursed only dlrs 4.7 billion
before the crisis hit in August and froze further installments.
	   Zadornov said he and the IMF discussed the fourth-quarter budget
in detail and focused on one that includes dlrs 2.4 billion in
as-yet-undisbursed loans. Without that money, Russia would have to
print money to cover its shortfalls, which the IMF has strongly
opposed.
	   The budget will foresee a ruble rate of 20 to 23 to the dollar,
or 4.3 to 5 cents. That was much lower than Thursday's rate, which
fell slightly to 16.2 to the dollar, or about 6.2 cents, from 15.8
to the dollar Wednesday, or 6.3 cents.
	   The government said Thursday it would send a draft
fourth-quarter budget to parliament on Oct. 14 or 15. It said it
would announce an economic program before Oct. 20.
	   The only sign of a crisis-attacking plan from Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's government so far has been a draft published by
the Russian media last week that called for a number of
Soviet-style administrative controls. Primakov, however, insists he
supports continued market reforms.
	   Primakov reiterated in a Cabinet session Thursday that the top
priority is to pay overdue wages and pensions.
	   ``We must draw lessons from (Wednesday's protests), since the
people have mostly been driven by the dissatisfaction with economic
conditions,'' Primakov said.
	   The Cabinet discussed a plan to reduce the debts of Russian
companies, which have piled up in recent years to a staggering 1.2
trillion rubles (dlrs 75 billion), or about 40 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, Russian media said.

Iran reports clash with Taliban, Taliban denies it

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran said its forces on the border fought a
three-hour gunbattle Thursday with the Taliban militia, inflicting
heavy casualties, but the Taliban denied any fighting occurred.
	   Early Thursday, Taliban forces attacked Iranian border posts in
northeastern Khorasan province with mortars and machine guns and
Iranian border guards returned fire, forcing Taliban fighters to
retreat, Iranian television said.
	   The Taliban suffered heavy casualties during the three-hour
clash and three of the militia's border posts were destroyed, Brig.
Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground forces of Iran's
elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, told the official Islamic
Republic News Agency. He did not report any Iranian casualties.
	   ``The situation in the area is currently calm,'' Jaafari said.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, said no
clash had taken place, and branded the Iranian report as propaganda
against Taliban.
	   ``We received this information and we checked from our people
and it is wrong,'' he said when contacted at the Taliban
headquarters in southern Kandahar.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have been high since the
militia, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted that
its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist in
northern Afghanistan in August.
	   The Taliban religious militia, made up largely of Sunni Muslims,
has accused Iran's Shiite clerical regime of arming and financing
its northern-based opposition, which includes the country's
minority Shiite Muslims.
	   Thursday's reported clash occurred Thursday morning in Torbat-e
Jam in the Saleh Abad region. The area is about 180 kilometers (110
miles) southeast of the Iranian city of Mashhad.
	   ``The attack was confronted with responses by the forces
stationed at our country's border posts, and as a result the
Taliban forces were forced to ... retreat,'' the television
reported, quoting an army statement.
	   Another Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said the
Iranians have fired artillery into Afghanistan during the past
three days. But Taliban leader Mullah Omar ordered his border
commanders to ``show restraint and not retaliate,'' Muttawakil said
when contacted by telephone from neighboring Pakistan.
	   Iran wants an apology from the Taliban for the August slaying of
its citizens and wants the culprits handed over for trial in
Tehran. Taliban leaders have refused both demands, calling the
diplomats ``conspirators.''
	   Iran has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern border
with Afghanistan and has conducted several large-scale military
exercises during the past few weeks. Afghanistan's Taliban army has
sent an estimated 10,000 troops to its western border with Iran.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said Wednesday that
Tehran wants a peaceful settlement with the Taliban, but warned
that his country was running out of patience.

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods experienced his first
Dunhill Cup team golf championship Thursday and took a swipe at the
attitudes that surround the high-pressure, nerve-wracking Ryder
Cup.
	   ``You don't get the boos, the hissing and the moaning that you
get at the Ryder Cup,'' said Woods, who has teamed up with Mark
O'Meara and John Daly as the United States trio in this 1 million
pound (dlrs 1.67 million) 16-nation championship.
	   ``The fans here are more appreciative. There are a lot of good
golfing fans out here. It's just a completely different
environment. It's not life or death.
	   ``When the Ryder Cup started out it was a friendly match _ now
it's not like that any more,'' Woods said after his 6-under 66 at
the home of golf overwhelmed England's David Carter by eight
strokes.
	   ``This tournament is not the same and that's one of the good
things about it. The guys go out and play head to head and it's
fun.''
	   Woods, who was on the United States Ryder Cup 12 beaten by
Europe at Valderrama last year, recalled how the match was spoiled
by the huge buildup of hype which effectively kept the rival
players away from each other.
	   ``These guys on the European side, I know them. Some are good
friends of mine,'' he said. ``Unfortunately I wasn't able to spend
time with my friends.
	   ``We were told that Marbella was a great city. We really
wouldn't know. We drove by it. We saw the hotel, the golf course
and that's it.''
	   Mark O'Meara, the American team captain here, has repeatedly hit
out at the hype that surrounds the Ryder Cup and also at the lack
of time the players are allowed to spend to together off the
course.
	   ``Everyone needs to lighten up a little bit,'' said O'Meara who
has played four Ryder Cups. ``It's a very nerve-wracking situation.
	   ``It's a tremendous honor to represent your country and I'm not
denying that the Ryder Cup has become a special event.''
	   ``But sometimes you win, sometimes you lose and, when I lose, I
don't think I'm a failure because of that,'' said O'Meara, winner
of this year's Masters and British Open. ``There is always
tomorrow.
	   ``There are a lot more countries represented here and more
atmosphere here,'' O'Meara said. ``It's very competitive but more
gentlemany out here.''

Four executed in Yemen for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Four men convicted of murder were publicly
executed in Yemen, the daily Al-Thawra reported Thursday.
	   Mohammed Qasim al-Shami and Ahmed Ali al-Shami were shot to
death by firing squad in the southern province of Ibb on Tuesday
after they were convicted of murdering Finda Zaid al-Shami, the
Arabic-language paper said.
	   The three men were from the same tribe and were involved in
dispute over an inheritance claim. It was not immediately known if
they were related but many members of one tribe often have the same
last name.
	   The victim's family, court officials and a crowd of onlookers
witnessed the execution in a public square, Al-Thawra said.
	   It said the other two executions occurred Sunday: Saeed Saleh
Ahmed was shot to death, also in Ibb, for the murder of Saleh Saeed
Hamadi; Qaed Hussein Sharafi was executed in the western province
of Heja for killing Shadad Ali Abdullah.
	   There was no explanation why the executions were reported
Thursday.
	   Yemen, an impoverished country at the tip of the Arabian
Peninsula, imposes the death penalty for rape and murder. Most
executions are carried out in public to set an example and are
usually carried out by firing squad.

Dutch stocks close sharply lower after nervous day's trading

that dollar hit lowest level since June 1997 sted January 1997. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange closed sharply lower Thursday, as a nervous market was
dragged down by a weakening dollar and losses on key international
bourses, particularly Tokyo.
	   The 27-share AEX-index closed down 29.44 points, or 3.4 percent,
at 827.67 points, but slightly up from its lowest level of 807.83
points earlier today.
	   Most major European bourses suffered losses Thursday, partially
due to the Tokyo exchange closing lower earlier in the day.
	   But the overriding negative influence for Dutch traders came
from the sharp worldwide slide of the dollar. In Amsterdam, the
U.S. currency, at 1455 GMT, stood at 1.81 guilders, down from 1.82
guilders late Wednesday.
	   Earlier in the session, the dollar fell as low as 1.79, the
first time since June 1997 that it had fallen below the
1.80-guilder mark.
	   The Dutch stock market is highly dollar-sensitive, as a number
of index companies derive much of their overseas revenues in
dollars.

Five new nonpermanent members being elected to Security Council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Canada, the Netherlands and Greece were in
a hotly contested campaign Thursday to win two of the nonpermanent
seats on the Security Council, the most powerful decision-making
organ of the United Nations.
	   The three countries were competing for two seats allotted to the
regional group of Western Europe and other nations on the 15-member
council for the next two years, replacing Portugal and Sweden,
whose terms expire.
	   The council, effectivly the U.N. board of directors, has 10
nonpermanent seats and five permanent ones: the United States,
Britain, China, France and Russia.
	   Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats go up for election by
a secret ballot before the 185-member General Assembly. The ballots
were being counted Thursday morning.
	   In addition to the two contested seats, three other seats being
vacated went uncontested: Malaysia, representing Asia, Namibia for
Africa and Argentina representing Latin America.
	   They will replace Kenya, Costa Rica and Japan. The nonpermanent
members Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia will be
replaced next year.
	   The campaign for the two seats in the Western Europe group
caught some attention over the summer after Greece invited U.N.
delegates for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip _
dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was
related to the council bid.
	   Canada and the Netherlands as well did some heavy campaigning,
with the former inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's
``Cirque du Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise,
albeit down New York's East River.
	   On Tuesday, Greece made a final bid to join the council, arguing
that it was only fair that Greece be allowed to assume one of the
nonpermanent seats up for grabs this year.
	   The Greek deputy foreign minister, Yannos Kranidiotis, told
reporters that Greece's strategic position, the fact that it has
only been on the council once before, and its record of
contributing both money and resources to the United Nations makes
it the perfect candidate.
	   Greece was on the council in 1952-53. Canada has held the seat
five times, most recently in 1989-90, and the Netherlands on four
previous occasions, the last one being 1983-84.

Tory leader urges party to consider a parliament for England
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout, updating with Hague's speech &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) _ After unsuccessfully opposing new
legislatures for Scotland and Wales, the opposition Conservative
Party should consider proposing a separate Parliament for England,
party leader William Hague said Thursday.
	   Hague's suggestion, made only in the broadest terms in a speech
to the party's annual conference, marked a sharp departure for a
party that has always defended the integrity of the United Kingdom.
	   In effect, he accepted that Prime Minister Tony Blair's
government had changed the political landscape after a year in
power, and that Conservatives would have to deal with new
realities.
	   After winning a landslide victory over the Conservatives last
year, Blair moved quickly to establish legislatures in Scotland and
Wales, and promoted a peace agreement that gave Northern Ireland a
new assembly.
	   All three of those legislatures will be limited to dealing with
specific domestic matters, while defense and foreign relations will
be controlled by the Parliament in London.
	   However, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish lawmakers will
continue to vote on purely domestic matters involving England, by
far the largest part of the United Kingdom.
	   ``We are not going to be English nationalists, but we are going
to see that the voters of England are fairly represented,'' Hague
said.
	   ``For the first time, we will have to become the advocates of
major constitutional change, he said, adding ``it may be an English
Parliament in some form.''
	   There are calculations of self-interest for both Labor and
Conservatives in a possible English Parliament.
	   So long as the Parliament in London is drawn from the whole
United Kingdom, it is that much harder for Conservatives to regain
power. They won no seats in Scotland or Wales in 1997 and, like
Labor, made no serious effort to win seats in Northern Ireland.
	   Through 18 years of Conservative government from 1979 to 1997,
the party's position was secured by its dominance in England, while
the other parts of the United Kingdom remained opposition
strongholds.
	   Hague said Conservatives would strongly oppose Labor's apparent
intention to adopt some form of proportional voting. Conservatives
fear that such a system would keep them permanently out of power,
and saddle the country with a succession of coalition governments.
	   ``If you want to know what is at stake, just look at New
Zealand,'' Hague said. ``They agandoned our system in favor of
(proportional representation). And they ended up with two parties
who swore they would never work with each other. In other words,
the one government that not a single voter had wanted.''
	   Though opinion polls have shown no signs of a Conservative
resurgence from the depths of their defeat last year, Hague
predicted that the party would regain control of some local
councils in elections next year, and then would fight for seats in
the Welsh and Scottish legislatures.
	   ``We are not going to leave the battleground to nationalist
parties who want to destroy our country and a Labor Party which has
played into their hands,'' Hague said.

Five new nonpermanent members elected to Security Council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Canada and the Netherlands beat out Greece
on Thursday in a hotly contested campaign for two of the
nonpermanent seats on the Security Council, the most powerful
decision-making organ of the United Nations.
	   The two countries will represent the regional group of Western
Europe and North America on the 15-member council for the next two
years, replacing Portugal and Sweden, whose two-year terms expired.
	   The council, effectively the U.N. board of directors, has 10
nonpermanent seats and five permanent ones: the United States,
Britain, China, France and Russia.
	   Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats go up for election by
a secret ballot before the 185-member General Assembly.
	   In addition to the two contested seats, three other seats went
uncontested in Thursday's vote: Malaysia, representing Asia,
Namibia for Africa and Argentina representing Latin America.

Rebels force Sudanese refugees to return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Sudanese rebels burned down the huts and
villages of countrymen living in exile in northeastern Congo, and
forced them to return home, aid officials said Thursday.
	   World Vision said 8,000 Sudanese had trekked in the past week
from Congo to southern Sudan, where a 15-year civil war is being
fought.
	   Sudanese rebels on Saturday told 41,000 refugees in camps near
Dungu, Congo to go home, then ransacked U.N. refugee offices in
Dungu and Doruma, where radios and vehicles were stolen, agency
said.
	   ``The security of refugee camps must be respected and refugees
themselves allowed to decide when it is safe to return home,''
Dennis McNamara, a UNHCR director, said in Geneva.
	   The United Nations withdrew its staff from northeastern Congo
when fighting broke out Aug. 2 between the Congolese government and
rebellious forces in the east.
	   The violence apparently provided an opportunity for Sudanese
rebels to cross into Congo and begin intimidating refugees, the
U.N. refugee agency said.
	   Southern Sudanese leaders have expressed concerns that tens of
thousands of Sudanese refugees may stream back into Yambio, which
so far has avoided a famine besetting the region.
	   The U.N. World Food Program sent 40 tons of food, enough for
10,000 people for one week, to Yambio to relieve the pressure on
local supplies.
	   More than 374,000 Sudanese have fled their homeland's civil war
to eight African countries _ Uganda, Ethiopia, Congo, Kenya,
Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea and Egypt.

Chief of Bucharest soccer club resigns after allegations of
</HEADLINE>
smuggling &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The chairman of Bucharest's Dinamo
soccer club submitted his resignation Thursday after allegations
that he was involved in a huge cigarette smuggling case.
	   Petre Buduru, who works for the interior ministry, said he was
offering his resignation to avoid tarnishing the team's name. He
denied allegations that he was connected to a dlrs 1 million
cigarette smuggling scandal.
	   ``I have replied to every single one of the accusations made
against me,'' Buduru said by telephone. The club's board of
directors will decide on Monday whether to accept his resignation,
he said.
	   The interior ministry will study the allegations over the next
few weeks, a statement said, carried by national news agency
Rompres.
	   Col. Gheorghe Trutulescu, a state security officer on trial for
masterminding the smuggling operation, identified Buduru as one of
his partners.
	   Dinamo is is second place in the Romanian premier soccer league.
The club belongs to the interior ministry and Buduru has been
chairman since 1996.

	   They will replace Kenya, Costa Rica and Japan. Nonpermanent
members Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia will be
replaced next year.
	   The campaign for the two seats in the Western Europe group
caught some attention over the summer after Greece invited U.N.
delegates for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip _
dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was
related to the council bid.
	   Canada and the Netherlands also campaigned heavily, with the
former inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's ``Cirque du
Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise, albeit down
New York's East River.
	   On Tuesday, Greece made a final bid to join the council, arguing
that it was only fair that Greece be allowed to assume one of the
nonpermanent seats up for grabs this year.
	   ``Greece would not do better than any other country in the
Security Council but it would certainly not do worse than any other
country, and I think it has to be given this chance,'' the deputy
Greek foreign minister, Yannos Kranidiotis told reporters.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, the last one being
1983-84.
	   Canada and the Netherlands were believed to have had the best
shot at landing the seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the
Mediterranean island divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Having Greece on the council could further politicize the issue at
the United Nations.

peacekeeping forces as well as the continued Dutch influence over

Wynton Marsalis praises President Clinton for his taste in music
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - American jazz trumpet player
Wynton Marsalis on Thursday praised the U.S. President Bill Clinton
for his refined taste in music.
	   ``The President knows about jazz,'' Marsalis told journalist at
a press conference prior to his concert in Prague. ``It's almost
unimaginable for anybody to think ...that America would have a
President with that type of consciousness, a President who would
...listen to Thelonious Monk.''
	   Commenting on Clinton's dinner with Czech President Vaclav Havel
last month, to which he was invited, Marsalis said:
	   ``It's always an honor to be invited to the White House.
Everybody was there to swing.''
	   Marsalis, who was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his epic
oratorio Blood on the Fields last year, will perform in Prague's
Lucerna Hall Friday with his Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra in a
special concert the organizers call ``The Longest Jazz Night.''
	   The concert, sold out long in advance, will be broadcast live on
a huge screen in Prague's ancient Old Town Square.

Ex-inspector warns former boss against trying to silence him
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A former U.N. arms inspector for Iraq has
demanded his onetime boss retract statements that he broke the law
by speaking out to the media about Iraq's weapons capabilities.
	   The lawyer for the former inspector, Scott Ritter, said in a
letter that the claims by the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, could be considered defamatory, even though Ritter may be a
public figure.
	   ``If you wish to avoid assuming personal liability, we require
your prompt retraction of your accusation,'' the lawyer wrote to
Butler.
	   The letter, dated Oct. 7, said Butler told the television show
``Charlie Rose'' in an Oct. 1 interview that Ritter broke the law.
	   According to a transcript of the show, Butler said he told
Ritter ```You have broken the law in speaking in public about
things that you obtained while on official duty, and I demand that
you desist from doing that.'''
	   Ritter's lawyer, Matthew L. Lifflander, said Ritter broke no
law. ``Unless you can tell us otherwise, you owe him a public
apology,'' his letter said.
	   The lawyer also criticized Butler's attempt to quiet Ritter.
Butler sent his former colleague a letter Sept. 30, saying he had
violated the U.N. contract by making public confidential
information about weapons capabilities.
	   ``You must know that the Constitution of the United States
affords Mr. Ritter the precious guarantee of free speech,''
Lifflander wrote. ``Nothing in the United Nations Charter, its
rules or its unenforceable agreements supersedes Mr. Ritter's
rights as an American citizen.''
	   Since he resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken out several times
on Iraq's weapons programs and on what he said was the failure of
the United States and Britain to back up their stated claims of
wanting to disarm Baghdad.
	   Last week, he told the Israeli daily Haaretz that he had sought
and received Israel's help in tracking down Iraq's nonconventional
arms program.
	   The United Nations imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded
Kuwait in 1990 and has said it will not lift them until Baghdad
eliminates its weapons of mass destruction. Butler's U.N. Special
Commission must make that certification.

Torturers need counseling too, conference hears
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Torturers and bombers who carried
out atrocities defending or fighting apartheid need counseling to
ensure they do not repeat their crimes, an expert for South
Africa's reconciliation body said Thursday.
	   Addressing local and international experts, Charles
Villa-Vicencio, research head of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, said ignoring the psychological needs of those who
carried out human rights abuses could alienate a potentially
dangerous sector of society.
	   ``We must give attention to the healing of perpetrators, not
just for the sake of perpetrators, but for the sake of the nation
as a whole,'' he said.
	   The conference, organized by the Medical Research Council, is
examining mental health issues raised by the Truth Commission,
which is charged with probing crimes committed by all sides in the
anti-apartheid struggle.
	   As the commission prepares to hand over its final report at the
end of the month, South Africans are examining its painful and
traumatic exploration of their bloody past.
	   With the power to grant amnesty to many who tortured, bombed or
maimed innocent civilians, the process has at some stage angered
people in nearly all walks of life.
	   Many whites see the panel as favoring the black liberation
movements, while many blacks accuse it of being too soft on former
state officials, especially top ranking ministers.
	   However, Villa-Vicencio appealed for tolerance in dealing with
all those who have committed crimes, saying that the potential for
wrongdoing existed in everyone.
	   ``We all, the entire human race, carry with us the capacity for
evil,'' he said.
	   Many of Thursday's speakers touched on the figure of police
death squad leader Eugene de Kock, who was given jail terms
totaling more than 200 years after a killing spree that costs
dozens of lives. De Kock has applied for amnesty for his crimes.
	   Dan Stein, a specialist in neurobiology and stress disorders,
said de Kock typified many killers from all sides in the conflict
by his sheer ``banality of evil''.
	   ``Many people have found him in interviews to be an ordinary,
even likeable person,'' he said about the man whom subordinates
dubbed ``Prime Evil.''
	   Ginn Fourie, a physiotherapist whose student daughter was gunned
down by black activists in a 1993 attack on a Cape Town bar, said
it was necessary to help those whose circumstances compelled them
to do wrong.
	   Struggling to control her tears, Fourie told delegates she had
attended the amnesty hearings of her daughter's killers and
supported their successful bid to be freed from long jail
sentences.
	   After describing how she hugged the three members of the black
nationalist Pan-Africanist Congress and urged them to seek
counseling together with their victims, Fourie earned a standing
ovation from the 50-strong audience.
	   ``We must take the initiative in understanding others and start
the process of reconciliation and healing our broken land,'' she
said, her voice shaking with emotion.

German diplomat skeptical about reports that Germans on crashed
</HEADLINE>
plane

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ A German diplomat expressed skepticism
Thursday over reports that two Germans were aboard a plane that
crashed mysteriously in western Uganda and that one of them died.
	   Ugandan officials have said that two Germans were on the
chartered twin-engine aircraft that took off from Entebbe airport
Sept. 25 and crashed in the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains
some time later, killing at least four of those on board, including
a senior army officer and the pilot.
	   There have been varying figures on the number of passengers on
board the plane when it crashed.
	   The Ugandan military has identified one of the dead men as
German Andrew Gore and said another German survived but had not
been found.
	   ``The reports are mysterious. Press reports are confusing, and
there is no transparent information policy on the part of the
Ugandan authorities,'' Beck told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   He said Andrew Gore is not even a German name.
	   There were conflicting reports on the destination of the plane.
A military spokesman said it was heading towards the western town
of Kasese. But Army chief of staff Gen. James Kazini said his
brother, Lt. Col. Jet Mwebaze who perished, was flying to visit him
at his bush headquarters in northeastern Congo.
	   Uganda has at least two army batallions in northeastern Congo to
protect its borders from attacks by Ugandan rebels of the Allied
Democratic Forces.
	   But President Yoweri Museveni denies that his troops are
fighting alongside Congolese rebels trying to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Civil Aviation Authority spokesman Jim Bitwire said no
information on the crash would be released until a report by an
investigating team from the transport ministry was completed.
	   ``what is happening is that once a commission has been set up,
you cannot tell anything to journalists,'' he said. ``The minister
for transport has set up a team to investigate the crash, and it
would be prejudicial to release any information. Findings will come
out by Oct. 23.''

Five new nonpermanent members elected to Security Council

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Canada and the Netherlands beat out Greece
on Thursday in a hotly contested campaign for two of the
nonpermanent seats on the Security Council, the most powerful
decision-making organ of the United Nations.
	   The two countries will represent the regional group of Western
Europe and other countries on the 15-member council for the next
two years, replacing Portugal and Sweden, whose two-year terms
expired.
	   Each got more than the two-thirds majority required, 117 votes.
Canada garnered 131, the Netherlands 122, and Greece 87.
	   The council, effectivly the U.N. board of directors, has 10
nonpermanent seats and five permanent ones: the United States,
Britain, China, France and Russia.
	   Every year, five of the nonpermanent seats go up for election by
a secret ballot before the 185-member General Assembly.
	   In addition to the two contested seats, three other went
uncontested in Thursday's vote: Malaysia, representing Asia,
Namibia for Africa and Argentina representing Latin America.
	   They will replace Kenya, Costa Rica and Japan. The nonpermanent
members Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon, Gambia and Slovenia will be
replaced next year.
	   The campaign for the two seats in the Western Europe group
became controversial over the summer after Greece invited U.N.
delegates for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied the trip _
dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get votes _ was
related to the council bid.
	   Canada and the Netherlands as well did some heavy campaigning,
with the former inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's
``Cirque du Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise,
albeit down New York's East River.
	   Canada garnered 131 votes, the Netherlands 122, and Greece 87. A
required two-thirds majority was required.
	   On Tuesday, Greece made a final bid to join the council, arguing
that it was only fair that Greece be allowed to assume one of the
nonpermanent seats up for grabs this year.
	   ``Greece would not do better than any other country in the
Security Council but it would certainly not do worse than any other
country, and I think it has to be given this chance,'' the deputy
Greek foreign minister, Yannos Kranidiotis told reporters.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, most recently 1983-84.
	   Canada and the Netherlands were believed to have had the best
shot at landing seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the
Mediterranean island divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Having Greece on the council could further politicize the issue at
the United Nations.
	   Others cited the prominent Dutch and Canadian presence on
peacekeeping forces as well as the continued Dutch influence over
its former colonies who voted Thursday.

Suspected Colombian cartel leader sentenced to jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A suspected leader of Colombia's
Cali drug cartel was sentenced to six years in a Dutch jail
Thursday for his involvement in cocaine smuggling.
	   Quiceno Botero was convicted of assisting in the transport of
240 kilos of cocaine from South America to the Netherlands in 1991
and 1992, Dutch prosecutor Elizabeth Horstink said.
	   A district court also fined Botero 100,000 guilders (dlrs
55,000).
	   Although authorities believe Botero _ still wanted by U.S.
authorities _ was a top leader of the notorious drug cartel, there
was only enough evidence to connect him to the three failed drug
shipments, Horstink said.
	   ``We do think we have arrested and sentenced an important person
in the criminal organization,'' Horstink said.
	   Botero was arrested on the island of Curacao in the Netherlands
Antilles last Dec. 23 while on vacation with his family.
	   The three shipments, which were intercepted outside the country,
were intended for the Dutch market, Horstink said.
	   The United States has requested Botero's extradition because he
also is suspected of smuggling cocaine to the United States, but
the Dutch court has not yet made a decision, she said.

Milosevic defiant, says NATO threats make Kosovo situation worse

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Convoys of U.S. and other foreign
embassy staff rolled out of Belgrade on Thursday, while support
within NATO for airstrikes to force Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end his crackdown on separatists in Kosovo appeared to
hit a snag.
	   Tensions between Yugoslavia and NATO nations were intensifying
following three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The diplomat briefed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and NATO officials Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of
those talks and was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for
another session with Milosevic.
	   Albright said Holbrooke would be delivering a message that the
time for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo was ``all but gone.''
She demanded full compliance with U.N. orders to end the crackdown
and said ``half measures'' would not be enough.
	   In Kosovo, reporters heard three or four bursts of mortar fire
Thursday in the Malisevo area about 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina. The firing indicated
some military action was continuing, although U.S. officials have
conceded there has been no significant fighting for about a week.
	   Holbrooke was ordered to return amid further signs of opposition
within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic efforts.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' said Italian Premier Romano Prodi, seeking
the support of anti-interventionist Communists ahead of a Friday
confidence vote in the Italian parliament.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
Wednesday with Milosevic. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said
Milosevic warned him that threats of NATO airstrikes only dimmed
the chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a meeting of the major powers
most deeply involved in the negotiations. Russia strongly opposes
use force to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is expected to deliver
that message when he meets Albright in London.
	   In Shanghai, China, however, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Milosevic was engaging in ``brinksmanship'' because he ``has
not been given a strong enough message.''
	   ``I hope the international community lives up to its
responsibility to send President Milosevic a united and strong
message that we won't tolerate the atrocities carrying on,'' Blair
said.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Milosevic launched a crackdown in February against the ethnic
Albanian separatists in the Kosovo Liberation Army. The operation
killed hundreds of ethnic Albanians and drove more than 270,000
people from their homes.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, about 20 vehicles carrying
diplomats and their families from the United States, Britain and
Australia left Thursday for the Hungarian capital of Budapest. The
diplomats will remain in Budapest until it becomes clearer whether
NATO will strike to force Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
U.N. demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops, and
the return of refugees to their villages, Washington lacks the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into action.
	   Milosevic says he has fulfilled those demands and his office
issued a statement Wednesday saying that ``threats, which are
delivered to our country, jeopardize the continuation of the
political process.''
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina, who was wounded in the leg, left the country Wednesday
with 10 family members and will be interviewed by U.N. war crimes
investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a senior U.S.
official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to war. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.
	   Milosevic is also using the crisis to silence his opponents.
Serbian government ordered independent media Wednesday to stop
broadcasting foreign media programs _ or face prosecution.

Oman may raise duties on luxuries to counter falling oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Oman's government is considering increasing
customs duties on imports of luxury goods to compensate for the
recent sharp drop in oil prices, its trade and industry minister
has said.
	   The price fall has highlighted the revenue importance of customs
duties to the oil-producing country, Maqbool Ali Sultan told the
World Trade Organization in a statement released Thursday.
	   Oil accounts for nearly 80 percent of Oman's exports and about
75 percent of government revenues. Crude oil prices have stayed in
the doldrums recently because of a world supply glut that has
persisted despite producers' cutbacks.
	   Sultan told a meeting on Friday of a WTO working party
discussing Oman's entry to the global trade body that the country
is taking a range of trade liberalization measures to bring it into
line with WTO rules.
	   Oman will reduce the general binding rate for most farm and
industrial products to 20 percent from 25 percent. It also plans to
replace restrictions on imports of agricultural products with
tariffs from the date of its WTO accession.
	   While not giving details, Sultan told the meeting that Oman's
``very substantial and meaningful'' revised offer on services
includes commitments on banking, financial and other services.
	   Oman has gone a long way in accepting other countries' demands
for concessions in exchange for WTO membership, the minister said.
They should take into account its dependence on a single
exhaustible resource.
	   Governments said Oman had made good progress with its latest
offers, but they will have to be looked at again, a trade official
said.
	   European Union representatives told the meeting they wanted more
market opening commitments from Oman in telecommunications, the
official said. U.S. officials called Oman's statement
``remarkable'' and said the United States was ready to give
technical assistance.
	   It is the third meeting of the working group since it first met
in June 1996. The date of the next meet hasn't yet been determined.
	   The country, on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula,
has a population of around 1.7 million Omanis and hosts 800,000
foreign nationals.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Abraham Olano led a Spanish
one-two finish by capturing the elite men's time trial Thursday at
the World Cycling Championhips by more than a half-minute.
	   On a cool, wet day in southern Netherlands, Olano beat teammate
Melchior Mauri by almost 38 seconds.
	   Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine was third, 47 second back.
	   American Lance Armstrong, in a comeback from cancer, finished
fourth, 56 seconds behind Olano.
	   Olano covered the 43.5-kilometer (27-mile) course in 54 minutes,
32.13 seconds, adding to his advantage at the checkpoints
throughout the race.
	   Olano said his knee was hurting since arriving in the
Netherlands earlier in the week and may not race in Sunday's road
event.
	   ``I really didn't think I could finish. But I thought to myself
`It's the end of the season so I have to give everything today and
not worry about the next race.' ''
	   ``On Tuesday it was really bad and it got better on Wednesday
but thw weather didn't help,'' Olano said.``As of now I would say
it would be impossible to race of Sunday but I'll talk with the
doctor and trainer and see what happens over the next days.''
	   The 29-year-old Olano had won the 1995 world road title.
	   ``The two events are so different -- the time trial and the raod
but it is still two times gold,'' Olano said. ``Yet both are
equally important.''
	   Early starters began in the rain but the drizzle had stopped by
the end of the race. However conditions were slick throughout the
route from Maastricht to Valkenbug that ended with a short but
steep climb.
	   Despite his knee problem, Olano was dominant throughout the race
increasing his advantage by seconds after the first check point. He
nearly caught 1994 champion Chris Boardman of Britain, who started
two minutes ahead, at the finish.
	   Olano took the silver medal in the 1996 Olympic time trial and
recently won the Tour of Spain but dropped out of the Tour de
France in July.
	   ``Te beginning of the season was not so good,'' Olano said.
``But it's a good finish.''
	   Olano has often been labeled as the successor to five-time Tour
de France champion Miguel Indurain, but has never come close to the
titles.
	   ``It's true I don't have all the results, but I've won a world
title in Colombia, the Tour of Spain, second in another year,''
Olano said. ``So if you look at the ressults, I am there every
year, maybe not all the year, but something every year.''
	   Armstrong, who announced he had testicular cancer just before
the world championships two years ago, continued his remarkable
return to the top level of cycling.
	   ``Every race is a special victory,'' Armstrong said. ``To do
well in the world championship is something I would have never
believed possible.''
	   The Austin, Texas took the 1997 season off to battle his cancer
with chemotheraphy and operations. His cancer is in remission now.
	   ``In my situation certain things have not been easy,'' he said.
``You need the resiliency to come back.''
	   He hopes to do better in the race on Sunday. He won the 1993
road title.
	   ``Anything can happen. The race is a little like a lottery,''
Armstrong said. ``I think I'll be a factor but anybody can win in a
one-day race.''

UAE reaches semifinals of ACC trophy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ The United Arab Emirates on Thursday
quashed host Nepal's hopes of qualifying for the semifinals of the
Asian Cricket Council tournament being held in the Nepalese
capital.
	   The AU put up a good total of 222 runs with opener Naseer
Siddiqui hitting 61 runs off 102 balls.
	   Its bowlers then overawed Nepalese batsmen and bowled them out
for 128 runs. M. Taqeer took five wickets and was declared man of
the match.
	   Thailand also entered the semifinals defeating Japan by 45 runs.
Facing a target of 131 runs, the Japanese batsmen were bundled out
for 85 runs off 33.3 overs.
	   In the third match, Malaysia beat Singapore by five wickets.
Needing to score 128 runs, Malaysia comfortably reached the target
in 34.2 overs losing five wickets. Captain Ramesh Menon sparkled
with an unbeaten half century.
	   Favorites Bangladesh also advanced to the semifinals beating the
Maldives by 102 runs in its third win in the tournament. Moist
grounds delayed the start of the play and the match was reduced to
41 overs a side.
	   Batting first, Bangladesh hit 206 runs for the loss of nine
wickets. The Maldivians were never in the race and were dismissed
for 104 runs in the 29.3 overs.

Army chief's resignation sends stock market into tailspin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Two top generals in Pakistan's powerful
military resigned Thursday, according to army sources.
	   Gen. Ali Quli Khan, the general next in line to be Pakistan's
army chief of staff resigned after he was passed over for
promotion. Gen. Khalid Nawaz, another senior general, also
submitted his resignation, they said.
	   There was no official reason given for either resignations,
which followed Wednesday's surprise resignation of Army Chief of
Staff Gen. Jehangir Karamat and the appointment of Gen. Pervaiz
Mushraf as his successor.
	   Karamat's resignation caused jitters in the stock market sending
the Karachi Stock Exchange into a tailspin. By the close of trading
on Thursday the stock market had plunged 34.02 points to close at
962.47.
	   ``There is total panic,'' said Yasin Lakhani. ``There is chaos
in the market. . . it is as if people think the country is going
under.''
	   The stock exchange was shut down early on Wednesday by violent
protests throughout the southern port city of Karachi as heavily
armed young men mourned the death earlier this week of their
political leaders.
	   The last full day of trading was Tuesday.
	   ``Because of the constant rumors from Islamabad the market is
nervous ... there are rumors of a military takeover and more
generals resigning,'' said Osama bin Shaoib of ABM Amro Equities in
the southern Karachi, the industrial and manufacturing heart of the
country.
	   ``The stock market is just filled with rumors and that's making
everyone nervous,'' he said.
	   Karamat handed in his resignation Wednesday, just two days after
advocating the establishment of a National Security Council.
	   Opposition politicians said the resignation had generated
``uncertainty and fear'' and warned of a possible backlash by the
military, which has ruled Pakistan for 25 years of the country's
50-year history.
	   The security council being advocated by Karamat would have given
the army a constitutional role in policy-making decisions.
	   When Karamat issued the call for the National Security Council
he strongly criticized Pakistan's political leadership for
indulging in politics laced with vendettas and polarization.
	   He warned that the country was passing through a difficult time
beset with a deteriorating economy, relentless violence between
rival sectarian and ethnic groups and increasing disenchantment
among the electorate.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif apparently reacted strongly to
Karamat's statements and opposition leaders accused the prime
minister of trying to muzzle the army chief by forcing his
resignation.

Oman may raise duties on luxuries to counter falling oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REPLACES 7th graf with quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Oman's government is considering increasing
customs duties on imports of luxury goods to compensate for the
recent sharp drop in oil prices, its trade and industry minister
has said.
	   The price fall has highlighted the revenue importance of customs
duties to the oil-producing country, Maqbool Ali Sultan told the
World Trade Organization in a statement released Thursday.
	   Oil accounts for nearly 80 percent of Oman's exports and about
75 percent of government revenues. Crude oil prices have stayed in
the doldrums recently because of a world supply glut that has
persisted despite producers' cutbacks.
	   Sultan told a meeting on Friday of a WTO working party
discussing Oman's entry to the global trade body that the country
is taking a range of trade liberalization measures to bring it into
line with WTO rules.
	   Oman will reduce the general binding rate for most farm and
industrial products to 20 percent from 25 percent. It also plans to
replace restrictions on imports of agricultural products with
tariffs from the date of its WTO accession.
	   While not giving details, Sultan told the meeting that Oman's
``very substantial and meaningful'' revised offer on services
includes commitments on banking, financial and other services.
	   ``Oman has gone a long way in accepting the demands of our
trading partners,'' the minister said. ``Please do not push us into
accepting commitments that we cannot live with.''
	   Governments should take into account Oman's dependence on the
single exhaustible resource of oil, Sultan added.
	   Governments said Oman had made good progress with its latest
offers, but they will have to be looked at again, a trade official
said.
	   European Union representatives told the meeting they wanted more
market opening commitments from Oman in telecommunications, the
official said. U.S. officials called Oman's statement
``remarkable'' and said the United States was ready to give
technical assistance.
	   It is the third meeting of the working group since it first met
in June 1996. The date of the next meet hasn't yet been determined.
	   The country, on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula,
has a population of around 1.7 million Omanis and hosts 800,000
foreign nationals.

Cabinet hard-liners warn Netanyahu against concessions to Arafat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu assuring hard-liners that he will not
buckle under U.S. pressure, EDITS throughout; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday
assured hard-liners in his coalition that he would not buckle under
U.S. pressure during next week's Mideast summit in Washington.
	   Netanyahu also said he would offer no more than 1 percent of the
West Bank in a final Israeli troop pullback before the start of
talks on a permanent peace accord with the Palestinians.
	   Coalition members are threatening to topple Netanyahu if he
makes concessions to the Palestinians in the U.S.-hosted summit.
	   Opponents of a West Bank pullback have enough seats in the
120-member parliament to rob Netanyahu's coalition of its majority
and force new elections.
	   However, by ousting Netanyahu, the hard-liners would risk
bringing a more dovish government to power and it was not clear
whether they would go through with their threats.
	   The most vehement opponent to a troop withdrawal is the National
Religious Party, which represents the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip and has nine seats in parliament.
	   Netanyahu met with NRP leaders on Thursday and told them that
``I have no intention to face the negotiating partners with shaking
knees,'' according to a statement by his office.
	   Netanyahu also promised to hold a Cabinet meeting before his
departure for Washington to discuss the agenda for the
negotiations.
	   Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom of the NRP said before his
meeting with Netanyahu that the prime minister must coordiante his
negotiating positions with the party before the Oct. 15 summit.
	   ``Together, we will determine the red lines,'' Yahalom told
Israel radio. ``If he (Netanyahu) returns from the United States
having his positions eroded, the NRP cannot be a partner (in the
government).''
	   NRP legislator Hanan Porat said that if Netanyahu concludes an
agreement on a troop withdrawal, he will set in motion preparations
for early elections.
	   The new threats came after the prime minister held three-way
talks Wednesday in Gaza with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   Albright said that she hoped the remaining issues could be
resolved in the Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said
he would dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising
fears among Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would
come under intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.

Scientists say politicians stifling research
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MONIKA SCISLOWSKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ A group of Poland's leading scientists
said Thursday their work and the nation's progress will be hurt if
the government refuses to increase spending on science.
	   Though enjoying intellectual freedom and new international
contacts in research work since the end of communist rule in 1989,
the scientists blame Poland's subsequent governments _ rightist and
ex-communist alike _ for neglecting the role of science in the
nation's development.
	   ``We are very much concerned over the future of Polish science.
We cannot remain silent any longer,'' sociologist Edward
Wnuk-Lipinski told a news conference a few weeks prior to
parliament debate on next year's budget.
	   ``Politicians disregard us and deem it more profitable to pump
huge money into other social groups who loudly demand special
treatment,'' neurologist Dr. Witold Karczewski said, referring to
strikes and other protests by farmers, miners, railway workers and
others.
	   Under communist rule, many scientists worked in state-sponsored
laboratories and had their research fully subsidized, as long as it
was approved by governing authorities.
	   In the transformation of Poland's economy from central control
toward a market-led system, such state subsidies have vanished.
Unlike Western countries, Poland still lacks multinational
conglomerates and private foundations that sponsor major research.
	   The Polish scientists appealed to Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek to
increase spending on science, citing Poland's plans to join the
European Union in five years as a challenge for the country's
researchers to keep pace with the West.
	   They said state spending on science has fallen dramatically in
the 1990s, causing the abandonment of research programs such as a
study of Alzheimer's disease and shutting down the Balkan Studies
Institute at the Polish Academy of Science.
	   The scientists also said low pay discouraged young people from
joining the profession. They said a university graduate makes up to
700 zlotys (about dlrs 200) a month and a professor makes no more
than 1,400 zlotys (about dlrs 400) a month.
	   According to the scientists, the government headed by the
rightist Solidarity-led alliance plans to spend 2.5 billion zlotys
(about dlrs 700 million) on science in 1999, which they called much
less than amounts in Western nations.
	   ``When we join the European Union, Polish scientists will go to
Western countries, where researchers are considered and treated as
elite,'' warned Krzysztof Gawlikowski of the Polish Academy of
Science.
	   Some of Poland's best-known scientists worked abroad, such as
Warsaw-born Nobel laureate Marie Curie, who with her French husband
discovered and researched radioactive substances in Paris at the
turn of the century.
	   More recently, astronomer Aleksander Wolszczan, working in
Arecibo, Puerto Rico, discovered planets outside the solar system
in 1992.

Swedish government survives vote of no-confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Prime Minister Goeran Persson's new
minority government easily survived a Thursday vote of
no-confidence called by the main opposition party.
	   The vote was 186 in support of the government and 82 against,
with 74 abstentions. All those voting against the government were
deputies from the conservative Moderates party, Sweden's
second-largest after Persson's Social Democrats.
	   In Sept. 20 national elections, the governing Social Democrats
got less than 37 percent of the vote, down from 45 percent in
1994's elections. It was the party's worst-ever result and the
Social Democrats' decline was the biggest by any party that got
parliamentary seats.
	   Moderates leader Carl Bildt, in calling for the no-confidence
vote, said the Social Democrats' poor performance undermined their
authority to continue in government.
	   Persson has remained prime minister by working out a cooperation
with the ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens. It is an
apparently awkward alliance and observers have predicted it will
quickly collapse.
	   The abstaining votes were cast by three non-socialist parties.

Prison babies given new area in women's detention center

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Yianni has lived behind bars all his life.
	   On Thursday, he was shown around his new spot in the prison _
complete with new cribs, toys, a puppet theater and bright curtains
covering the barricaded windows.
	   Cornelia gave birth to Yianni in the women's wing of Athens'
Korydallos prison six months ago. Next week, her son will have his
first taste of freedom when his mother is released after serving a
10-month sentence.
	   She declined to give her surname and did not reveal what she was
convicted for.
	   There are currently another six children like Yianni living with
their mothers in the Korydallos jail.
	   Under Greek law, women who give birth in prison or have children
up to 3 years old are allowed to keep them in jail.
	   Until Thursday, when the government opened the new area, the
children were cared for at a local nursery school during the day.
	   Now, two specially trained staff members will care for the
infants and toddlers from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in brightly colored
surroundings matching any day care center or nursery school.
	   Their mothers can volunteer to keep the area clean and learn
basic child-rearing skills such as correct nutrition and education,
the health ministry said.
	   The area is the first of its kind in Greek prisons, and has a
capacity for up to a dozen children, the justice and health
ministries say.
	   The two ministries had signed an agreement in 1995 ``to solve
the problem of the detention, entertainment and education of
infants and mothers held in the women's prison,'' Justice Minister
Evangelos Yiannopoulos said during the inauguration ceremony.
	   Women with babies in Korydallos live in a separate part of the
prison. Their cell doors open onto a communal play area, and they
also have access to a small kitchen where they can prepare meals
for their children.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Oman's government is considering increasing
customs duties on imports of luxury goods to compensate for the
recent sharp drop in oil prices, its trade and industry minister
has said.
	   The price fall has highlighted the revenue importance of customs
duties to the oil-producing country, Maqbool Ali Sultan told the
World Trade Organization in a statement released Thursday. The
minister didn't state the type of luxury goods to which he was

Suspected attacker killed by his own bomb in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A bomb exploded under a car in the eastern
Ukrainian city of Dnipropetrovsk, killing the unidentified man who
was trying to it, police said Thursday.
	   Police said the man apparently was a hired killer, the Interfax
news agency said, without further explanation. The car belonged to
the director of a commercial company, it said.
	   Violent settling of accounts among business people and criminals
is common in the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine. Many of
these contract killings go unsolved for years.

Swissair pulls advertising campaign in wake of crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair has withdrawn its
advertising campaign in the wake of last month's crash of Flight
111 off Nova Scotia, an airline newsletter said Thursday.
	   The campaign, with the slogan ``The Refreshing Airline,'' is
being dropped and will be replaced by a new one with a stronger
emphasis on the theme of passenger care, according to the SAirGroup
News magazine.
	   The new campaign will likely be ready next month, the magazine
said. Until then, Swissair will use only its logo. New television
commercials are expected next year.
	   All 229 passengers and crew on board were killed in the Sept. 2
crash of the MD-11 aircraft flying from New York to Geneva.

Sri Lanka Military admits heavy losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ More than 1,000 Sri Lankan soldiers
were killed or presumed killed in fighting last week along a key
northern highway.
	   Military spokesman Maj. Kumar Dewage said Thursday that a total
of 186 soldiers have been officially listed as killed after the
rebels attacked the town of Kilinochchi on Sept. 27, and another
789 are missing in action. The missing are likely among the
hundreds of bodies the military has recovered but has yet to
identify.
	   The military said earlier that another 92 soldiers were killed
in the battle for nearby town of Mankulam, which government forces
captured from Tamil rebels.
	   The military claimed that it killed at least 717 rebels in
Kilinochchi and another 100 in the battle for Mankulam. The
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said last week that they lost 300
fighters.
	   Although smaller than Kilinochchi, Mankulam sits astride a vital
junction of an east-west road. Kilinochchi is 170 miles (275
kilometers) north of Colombo, and Mankulam is 30 kilometers (18
miles) south of Kilinochchi.
	   The military also claimed that it captured 26 rebels, including
18 under 18 years old, at Mankulam.
	   Mankulam and Kilinochchi are strategically located along the
only road linking the military-held northern Jaffna Peninsula to
the mainland. The military has wrested from the rebels two-thirds
of 77-kilometer (47 miles) the jungle highway in an offensive it
launched in May 1997.
	   Military experts say that as the rebels lose ground, they will
fight all the harder. During last week's three-day battle, the
guerrillas armed with relatively low-tech weaponry _ grenades,
mortars and machine guns _ fought 3,500 government soldiers armed
with Israeli-built Kfir warplanes and Russian MI-24 armored
helicopter gunships.
	   Last week's fighting was the deadliest since the guerrillas
wiped out an entire 1,240-man garrison at the northeastern coastal
town of Mullaittivu more than two years ago. The rebels lost 700
fighters at Mullaittivu.
	   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   The fighting has killed more than 55,000 people since 1983.

Iran assures all help to resolve Turkey-Syria dispute

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Syrian and Iranian foreign ministers'
comments, Kharrazi to leave to Turkey Friday; CHANGES overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Iran promised Thursday to do its best to
help resolve a military dispute between Turkey and Syria, and
warned that the escalating crisis could harm the Islamic world.
	   At part of the Iranian effort, the country's foreign minister,
Kamal Kharrazi, flew to Damascus and met with Syrian President
Hafez Assad for 75 minutes Thursday, presidential spokesman Jubran
Kourieh said.
	   Syrian officials said Kharrazi will fly to Turkey on Friday.
	   Iran is mediating in its capacity as the current head of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that
includes Syria and Turkey.
	   ``OIC can play an important role in solving the present crisis
and tension between Damascus and Ankara,'' Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa told reporters. He added that Syria is ready,
along with Iran, to find a solution.
	   The row is over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring and
helping Turkish Kurdish rebels. Syria denies that. On Wednesday,
Turkey told Syria to expel the rebels from its territory or ``face
the consequences.''
	   Talking to reporters after his meeting with Assad, Kharrazi said
``expanding the crisis would not be in the interest of the region
and the Islamic world.''
	   ``Iran would exert all efforts to eliminate tension between
Damascus and Ankara through diplomatic and peaceful means,'' he
said.
	   The Turkish newspaper Yeniyuzyil reported Thursday that Ankara
was prepared to stage pinpoint attacks against alleged rebel camps
if Syria did not honor its ultimatum within 10 days.
	   Turkey's Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit, however, told private NTV
television on Thursday that the government has taken no decision on
a deadline. But he added: ``It is obvious that we can not wait for
a long time.''
	   ``In the meantime, we will step up diplomatic efforts with Arab
and Muslim countries to explain Syria's attitude, which is not
linked with humanity and Islam,'' Ecevit said.
	   Meanwhile, the Hurriyet newspaper said Turkey would grant Syria
45 days to prove that it has ended its support for the rebels.
	   In Cairo, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk urged
Syria Thursday to ``take seriously'' Ankara's concerns. He also
called on Turkey to show restraint.
	   On Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between
Syria and Turkey in an attempt to reduce tensions.

Nations pledge cooperation in fighting child sexual exploitation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Child welfare experts and government officials
from 25 European and Asian countries pledged Thursday to share
expertise and resources to battle the commercial sexual
exploitation of children.
	   A three-day conference of the Asia-Europe Meeting, organized by
the British Foreign Office, addressed the worldwide problems of
child prostitution and child pornography, and sought to further
develop a network among member countries to share ideas and
solutions.
	   Initiatives resulting from the conference included plans for an
Internet site to be used as a clearinghouse for such information as
laws governing prosecution of child-sex offenders in member
countries.
	   In addition, a meeting of police agencies of the 25 nations will
be held late next year to discuss enforcement strategies and
cooperation, and child welfare workers will participate in
exchanges to see how their counterparts in other countries operate.
	   An estimated 1 million children worldwide are lured or forced
into the sex market every year, experts say. The problem is
especially serious in Asia, where pedophiles from Europe often
travel to take advantage of the many street children there.
	   ``We need to work more closely together to combat child sex
tourism,'' Derek Fatchett, a minister in Britain's Foreign Office
told the 120 participants in the conference, which concluded
Thursday.
	   ``We need to strengthen our exchange of information and
intelligence. We need to understand our differing systems of
justice. We need to work more closely to pursue and prosecute the
offender,'' he said.
	   During the conference, Britain announced new guidelines that
would treat child prostitutes at home as victims rather than
offenders.
	   Participating were the 15 member countries of the European
Union, along with Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Parliament speaker proposes referendum on Yeltsin's resignation
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of the Russian parliament called
Thursday for a referendum on whether President Boris Yeltsin should
resign, but the proposal was largely political grandstanding since
such a vote would be illegal.
	   The Communist-led opposition has been waging a campaign for
years to oust Yeltsin, from impeachment motions to suggestions he
resign.
	   Speaker Gennady Seleznyov's referendum call appeared to be just
the latest volley, since Russian law specifically states that there
cannot be a referendum on the early termination of a president's
term.
	   ``Following such a massive protest action that took place
yesterday, it would be legitimate to call a referendum in Russia on
whether society trusts or distrusts the president, whether he
should or should not resign,'' said Seleznyov, a Communist who is
speaker of the State Duma lower house of parliament.
	   Seleznyov was referring to nationwide protests Wednesday, which
did not draw nearly as many people as the Communist and trade union
organizers had hoped.
	   But Seleznyov's appeal still drew a quick response from
Yeltsin's office, where spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the
president ``expressed regret'' over the proposal.
	   Meanwhile, Yeltsin reiterated his intention to serve his full
term, which ends in 2000. During a meeting with senior military and
security officers, he said he would maintain personal control over
the military.
	   ``And it will be like that at least while I'm here, that is
until the year 2000,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Wednesday's demonstrations were held mainly to protest Russia's
economic woes, although many of the demonstrators also called for
Yeltsin's resignation.
	   The Interior Ministry estimated Wednesday evening that 615,000
people took part in street demonstrations in nearly 500 cities, but
raised that to 1.3 million people on Thursday.
	   The Justice Ministry estimated Thursday that the number of
people who took part in all forms of protests _ including those who
attended events at work _ was about 6 million.
	   By either count, the turnout was far below organizers'
expectations. Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov forecast that up to
40 million would take part.
	   Zyuganov renewed his call Thursday for Yeltsin to resign.
	   ``He and his constitution are like a plastic bag wrapped around
the head of the nation to suffocate it, and they must be removed
immediately,'' he said on Echo Moscow radio.
	   Zyuganov said the Communists would begin picketing government
buildings and launch acts of civil disobedience if Yeltsin doesn't
step down. He also said the Duma is completing an impeachment
motion against the president and would move to launch it soon.
Previous impeachment efforts have failed.
	   Vladimir Platonov, deputy speaker of parliament's upper chamber,
the Federation Council, confirmed that Seleznyov's referendum
proposal violates the law.
	   ``I understand the anger of some people who think that the
president must step down immediately, but there is no law allowing
the dismissal of the head of state by referendum,'' Platonov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Yeltsin, who is 67 and has had serious health problems, has said
he would not run again.

Author under death threat afraid to appear in court

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Embattled Bangladeshi author Taslima
Nasrin said Thursday she can't appear in court to answer charges
since she fears assassination by Islamic extremists who accuse her
of blaspheming Islam.
	   Nasrin, 36, faces an arrest warrant for allegedly offending
religious sentiments of Muslims in a civil suit that requires her
to appear in court.
	   ``I fear I'll be killed by the extremists if I appear in
public,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
from her hideout.
	   She returned home last month after a four-year self-imposed
exile in Europe and America to be beside her mother, who is
suffering from colon cancer.
	   ``I'm definitely going to stay here until my mother dies,''
Nasrin said in the telephone interview.
	   The author's Islamic foes have offered 200,000 takas (dlrs
5,000) to anyone who kills her.
	   Thousands of extremists have been holding noisy street protests
in Bangladesh calling for her death by hanging in public.
	   ``None is above law and Taslima Nasrin will have to seek legal
course,'' Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad told reporters on
Thursday. She will get the court protection.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Nasrin should
surrender to the court.
	   Denouncing Nasrin's writings as ``vulgar,'' Hasina at the same
time warned the extremists that her government will not tolerate
violence against the writer.
	   Earlier this week, riot police fired tear gas at 2,000
protesters and arrested 12 of them, whipping up more street
protests in the Bangladesh capital and a general strike in
northeastern Sylhet town.
	   The protests began in 1994 after a newspaper quoted Nasrin as
saying that the Koran, Islamic holy book, should be rewritten. She
denied she had made the remarks, but admitted to calling for
changes in Islamic laws to give more rights to women in this
male-dominated society.
	   After returning home last month, a Dhaka magistrate revived an
arrest warrant in a civil suit in a second blasphemy case. The case
was in addition to similar charges brought by the government
against her in 1994.
	   Though she was freed on bail in 1994 and permitted to leave the
country, she must seek bail in the second case. If convicted of
blasphemy, the author can be jailed for two years.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The secretary_general of the Arab League has
been hospitalized in Brussels, suffering from severe exhaustion
during a trip to the European Union headquarters, officials said
Thursday.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, 75, had a heavy schedule in New York and in
the Belgian capital, which led to fatigue, league spokesman Talaat
Hamid said.
	   A spokeswoman for the Egyptian Embassy in Brussels said
Abdel-Meguid is in stable condition and will leave the hospital to
return to Cairo in a few days.
	   ``The doctors have decided to keep him under observation,'' said
the spokeswoman, who did not want to be named.
	   She said Abdel-Meguid arrived from the United States ``very
tired.''
	   Abdel-Meguid, a veteran Egyptian diplomat, served as foreign
minister before he was chosen as the league's head in 1990.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A suspected leader of Colombia's
Cali drug cartel was sentenced to six years in a Dutch jail
Thursday for his involvement in cocaine smuggling.
	   Luis Arnaldo Quiceno Botero was convicted of assisting in the
transport of 240 kilos of cocaine from South America to the
Netherlands in 1991 and 1992, Dutch prosecutor Elizabeth Horstink
said.
	   A district court also fined Quiceno Botero 100,000 guilders
(dlrs 55,000).
	   Although authorities believe Quiceno Botero _ still wanted by
U.S. authorities _ was a top leader of the notorious drug cartel,
there was only enough evidence to connect him to the three failed
drug shipments, Horstink said.
	   ``We do think we have arrested and sentenced an important person
in the criminal organization,'' Horstink said.
	   Quiceno Botero was arrested on the island of Curacao in the
Netherlands Antilles last Dec. 23 while on vacation with his
family.
	   The three shipments, which were intercepted outside the country,
were intended for the Dutch market, Horstink said.
	   The United States has requested Quiceno Botero's extradition
because he also is suspected of smuggling cocaine to the United
States, but the Dutch court has not yet made a decision, she said.

New series could revive prototypes in U.S., involve Indianapolis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVE HERMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Indy cars, American stock cars, maybe
Formula One. The Indianapolis Motor Speedway already has strayed
far from its traditional one-race-a-year roots.
	   It also could be part of a revial of prototype sports car racing
in America.
	   While Speedway president Tony George is still trying to bring
Formula One to the United States' most famous race track, the
American Le Mans Series is making its debut this weekend in Atlanta
with a 10-hour version of the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans.
	   The series is the brainchild of car builder Don Panoz, who
modeled the series of endurance races after the 24 Hours of Le Mans
and negotiated rights to use the name on this side of the Atlantic.
By next season, he hopes to run a schedule of up to 11 races.
	   ``This form of racing is a bit unique. It hits a niche
audience,'' said Bill Donaldson, a former Indianapolis Motor
Speedway vice president hired by Panoz to be executive director of
the new series. ``It's an audience that likes sports cars, they
like endurance racing, they like road racing.''
	   Prototype sports car racing in the United States has degenerated
into a mess since the late 1980s, when factory teams stopped
running in American races, even the high-profile 24 Hours of
Daytona. European teams still run at Daytona, but only as
privateers.
	   The International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) was an
International Automobile Federation's (FIA) sanctioned series, the
forerunner to today's Professional Sportscar Racing (PSR).
	   But it lost that designation and now fights with the U.S. Road
Racing Association for viability.
	   Panos, inventor of the Nicorette gum stop smoking aid, has been
building speciality cars and running a team on the USRRA circuit
with the intent of becoming the first American team to win Le Mans
since the mid-1960s.
	   He has been buying tracks, aligning himself with FIA and looking
to revive the sport in the United States.
	   His series' first race has been dubbed the ``Petit Le Mans,''
and will be 10 hours or 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) _ whichever
comes first _ on the newly refurbished 4.09-kilometer (2.54-mile)
Road Atlanta course on Saturday.
	   Road Atlanta is one of three tracks Panoz recently bought. The
others are in Sebring, Florida, and Mosport, Ontario, in Canada. A
12-hour race in Sebring is planned for next year, although the
complete schedule has not been finalized.
	   George, who took the Indianapolis 500 away from Championship
Auto Racing Teams (CART) when he founded the rival Indy Racing
League, is trying to return Formula One racing to the United States
_ at Indianapolis. Reports say it could happen as early as 2000.
	   The U.S. Le Mans series also might be interested in Indy,
Donaldson said. He concedes that there have been sanctioning body
debates and controversy, but says there is motivation to solve
them.
	   ``I think where the sport is today, there's a number of
constituents, whether it's promoters, sponsors, manufacturers, race
fans, that are all really thirsty for sports car racing to come
back,'' he said. ``There's a need to rebuild the confidence of all
these constituents in the sport today.''
	   Donaldson said the new series, based in Indianapolis, is not
connected with George's Formula One effort. He has not talked to
his former boss about bringing sports cars to the Indianapolis
speedway.
	   ``We're waiting to see if there's actually a road course being
built,'' Donaldson said. ``But I guess I'd say if the track is
built and there's interest, we would certainly be interested in
that as a venue.''
	   The entry list for the race at Road Atlanta includes several
Formula One and nine Indianapolis 500 veterans.
	   Among them, American Hurley Haywood, Italian Michele Alboreto
and Sweden's Stefan Johansson have won in the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
Haywood, American Scott Pruett and Belgian Didier Theys were on
winning teams in the 24 Hours of Daytona, America's premier
endurance race.
	   ``It tends to be a more upscale demographic of fans, which is
good from a marketing standpoint,'' Donaldson said of endurance
races. ``There are some companies that would like to be involved in
motorsports that I think would prefer to be in this environment as
opposed to other forms of motorsports, and our job is really just
to create the right marketing platform for them.''
	   Donaldson also is president of Premier Management Group of
Indianapolis, a motorsports consulting firm hired by Panoz to run
the new Le Mans series. Among his group's plans for attracting fans
is a Women's Global GT Series as a support series, with Indy driver
Lyn St. James as executive director.

Novotna retires against Serena Williams with back pain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Third-seeded Jana Novotna, the
Wimbledon champion, twisted her back in the match against Serena
Williams and had to retire Thursday from the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   Novotna hurt her back at the end of the second set. She tried to
play on but quit three games later.
	   Williams was ahead 2-6, 6-3, 2-0 when Novotna retired.
	   ``It's an awful way to end it,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't
playing well in the first set but I got back into the match.''
	   Williams broke Novotna's serve to get a chance to serve for the
second set. She was up 40-15, holding two set points, when Novotna
winced in pain as she lunged for a shot.
	   She took an injury timeout to be treated, while Williams skipped
rope to keep warm.
	   ``I always have a rope in my bag,'' Williams said.
	   When Novotna returned, she saved one set point but lost the
next. She was treated again, but was unable to hold serve at the
start of the third set and quit after losing the next game as well.
	   Two other seeded players advanced to the quarterfinals of the
dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament.
	   No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-3, and
No. 7 Nathalie Tauziat defeated Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 6-2.
	   Sandrine Testud beat Anke Huber 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.

Prada, Jil Sander and Fendi brainstorm the Milan runway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - Miuccia Prada and Jil Sander are brainy
designers. They deal in concepts rather than needs.
	   No matter that Miuccia sends her summer Prada girl down the
runway in thick rubber-soled combat boots, and Jil wraps her
maidens in spacy techno-fabric gowns, it's the thought that counts.
	   But what about dressing in the real world?
	   Take the latest Prada fanny pack, belted over the buttocks. It
looks great on the runway, but try sitting down on a crowded bus.
	   The Prada collection presented Wednesday night, gleaned
inspiration from contemporary sportswear, and in particular
yachting gear, from the lightweight parka, to the Bermuda shorts,
to the T-shirt dresses, all dutifully branded with the Prada logo.
	   But what a pity it would be to get Prada's expensive techno
fabrics from stretch latex to treated cotton, to metallic silk, wet
or stained with nasty salt spray.
	   Another Miuccia invention for warm weather fashion is the myriad
of little mirrors which adorn her long folk-style leather skirts,
and her skimpy evening slip dresses, in silk threaded with steel.
	   Even if not your daily wardrobe fare, the overall look of the
collection is definitely artsy-craftsy, which was the message Prada
meant to send down the runway.
	   ``I don't believe in looks,'' the designer said after the show.
``Each piece has to be a true work of art.''
	   And perhaps her true genius is in getting people to believe that
this is what they want even if their needs are elsewhere. The
company predicts that its cash register will ring up sales for over
dlrs 800 million in 1998.
	   Jil Sander, is a soul mate of Miuccia. The German designer's
clothes rumored to be both the best fitting and most expensive on
the Milan runway look more like sketches than real garments.
	   Her new asymmetrical skirt in space-like metallic techno fabric,
presented during Thursday's early morning show, looks like it could
stand on its own, and yet when worn down the runway it moves with
soft ease.
	   There are fewer suits in this round of Sander fashion, but
plenty of short and long jackets that paired with low-waisted
skirts or wide trousers could almost pass for a wear-to-work
outfit.
	   There is also a sports theme in this collection with its cropped
polo shirts, rubberized sweat jackets, and silver golf shoes.
	   But like the Prada masterpieces, these outfits are almost too
precious for healthy perspiration.
	   Karl Lagerfeld is another brainy ``moda Milanese'' designer,
whose eccentric creativity never ceases to amaze.
	   The pony-tailed, German born designer has shared his talent with
the Fendi's for several decades. This season he produced many
giggles and some gags by creating a millennium Fendi collection
featuring techno foam fabrics, violent slits, screaming neon
shades, and oversized shapes.
	   While the look was definitely projected into a hopefully
not-too-near future, a skimpy ribbon train, trailing behind a
gigantic foam skirt, was a nostalgic reminder of the passing
century.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday
invited Russian President Boris Yeltsin to take part in Middle East
peace talks in Washington next week and to play a bigger role in
the peace process.
	   Arafat is on a two-day visit to Moscow following talks in the
Gaza Strip on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Those
talks raised hopes that the stalled peace process could move ahead.
	   Russia is officially a co-sponsor of the peace process launched
by a conference in Madrid, Spain, in 1991. But the United States
has played a far greater role.
	   Yeltsin said his government might be interested in participating
in the talks, scheduled to open outside Washington on Oct. 15. But
he said Russia first wants to know the views of Israel and the
United States on the plan, the Interfax news agency reported,
citing Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Russia was an active player
on the world stage, despite its current hardships.
	   ``We do not shut ourselves up in our own shell,'' Primakov said
after his talks with Arafat. ``Russia does not always advertise its
involvement in the peace process, but even when it stays in the
shadow, it plays a positive role.''
	   Arafat later discussed preparations for the 2,000th Christmas
with Russian Orthodox Patriarch Alexy II, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   The celebrations ``will be helpful to the peaceful solution of
the Palestinian issue,'' Interfax quoted Alexy as saying, without
elaborating.
	   Arafat travels Friday to Helsinki.

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods' 6-under 66 and Mark
O'Meara's 67 were overshadowed by John Daly's 70 at the home of
golf Thursday as the United States crushed England 3-0 at the
Dunhill Cup.
	   Woods played flawless golf in a bogey-free round on his debut in
the 1 million pound (dlrs 1.67 million) championship and O'Meara
followed up his Masters and British Open triumphs with an eagle and
five birdies, sinking a 45-foot putt at the last.
	   But the pressure was on Daly and he came through it with a
hard-earned victory to earn praise from his team-mates.
	   Still struggling to keep his fragile game together as he
maintains his battle to shrug off alcoholism and gambling
addictions, Daly was up against oe of the world's emerging stars,
Lee Westwood.
	   Driving wildly to the right, he landed in deep pot bunkers and
or in bushes and bogeyed the fifth and sixth holes to fall behind.
Playing on the course where he won the British Open in 1995, Daly
got his round together and birdied 9, 10, 12 and 14 for a 2-under
score which downed Westwood by three.
	   ``It's just awesome for me to come back to a course I love and
to beat Lee gives me confidence,'' Daly said. ``The course inspires
me all the time. I wish the British Open were played here every
year.''
	   Daly was under pressure to drop out of the team after he
suffered an attack of the shakes during the Greater Vancouver Open
two months ago.
	   ``I was going to do anything to play here. There was no real
question in my mind that I was going to play here and I told that
to Tiger and Mark. I had that down moment to get through at
Vancouver and I'm very proud of myself that I did get through it.''
	   O'Meara said Daly's form against Westwood justified his decision
to put him up against England's top player. Woods said he was
inspired by Daly's performance.
	   ``What gave me a big boost was seeing John out there playing
well and when he got ahead of Lee that fired me up,'' Woods said.
``More than anything I had extra motivation seeing John out there
doing really well.''
	   With only one team from each group advancing to Sunday's final
stages, the Americans, who are favored to win the Dunhill Cup for
the fourth time, likely will be strongly challenged by the Swedes
on Saturday.
	   Led by Per Ulrik Johansson, Sweden overpowered Japan 3-0 with
Johansson carding a 71 to beat Katsuma Miyamoto by five.
	   Colin Montgomerie, who has lost to opponents from Paraguay and
India in this tournament in the past, stumbled by one stroke to
Zhang Lian-wei as China made its debut in the championship.
	   Fortunately for the Scottish captain, who was playing last, Gary
Orr and Andrew Coltart had already clinched victory for his team to
avoid another embarrassing loss.
	   Orr carded a 75 for a 1-stroke victory over Wu Xiang-bing and
Coltart had a 73 to beat Cheng Jun by five while Spain, led by Jose
Maria Olazabal's 2-stroke victory over Padraig Harringto, edged
Ireland 2-1.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago was
already at the airport, heading home from the Frankfurt Book Fair,
when his publisher called to say he had won the Nobel Literature
Prize on Thursday.
	   ``I'm personally very happy for myself,'' he said after rushing
back to the fair to a tumultuous reception of cheers and countless
roses. ``I'm also happy for my country.''
	   After years of being nominated and not winning, Saramago saw no
reason to stick around and wait for the Nobel announcement
Thursday.
	   ``Did I want and hope for it? No, just as little as I did the
last times,'' he said through an interpreter at a news conference
later. ``If it happened, all right. If it didn't happen, all
right.''
	   His publisher caught him five minutes before he was to get on
the plane, Saramago said.
	   Saramago, a tanned and balding 75-year-old, was beaming with
pride when he returned to the fair, but gracious and poised by the
time he began answering journalists' questions _ even those that
irked him.
	   Asked what he'd do with the dlrs 978,000 prize, Saramago
questioned why star athletes are never asked what they will do with
they money they earn.
	   ``We are so used to the fact that writers should be poor, so
that every time that a writer gets more money than is normal for
his day to day life, they are asked what they will do with it,'' he
said.
	   ``I don't plan to spend it in a casino, buy three cars, or four
video recorders. I intend to solve the situation of some people who
are close to me, and I am always open to any suggestions you
have.''
	   Asked why his works are important, he said: ``That's not for me
to decide. That's for my readers to decide.''
	   A writer's role in society? Everyone should ask that of
themselves, he replied.
	   ``The writer is no spiritual guide, he is no guru, he is just a
writer and also a man or a woman like everyone else,'' he said.
	   As the first winner from Portugal, Saramago said he felt a
special, patriotic pride and hoped ``more people will read
Portuguese'' now.
	   He said that Portuguese was in danger of being swamped by
languages spoken in bigger countries and hoped winning the prize
would make Portuguese ``more visible and audible.''
	   Saramago is one of Portugal's most popular contemporary
novelists, and his works have been translated into more than 20
languages.
	   He is perhaps best known for the fanciful novel ``The Stone
Raft,'' in which the Iberian Peninsula breaks off from Europe and
floats into the Atlantic. It contains what's described as ironic
commentary on ``major players in power politics.''

Kafelnikov and Rusedski crash out, joining Sampras and Rafter

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and
defending champion Greg Rusedski toppled out in second round play
of the Swiss Indoors, further depleting the dwindling pool of
seeded players.
	   The two joined Nos. 1 and 2 ranked Pete Sampras and Patrick
Rafter as early round casualties, leaving just two seeded players
in Basel midway through the second round.
	   Rusedski was beaten 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 by German qualifier David
Prinosil, while Kafelnikov was upset 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Sweden's
Magnus Gustafsson.
	   In an devastating first round for organizers, the tournment's
top three seeds and the three Grand Slam champions present crashed
out, leaving the draw vastly diminished.
	   Tournament organisers watched in horror as Wimbledon champion
Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and Australian Open titlist Petr
Korda, seeded third, all exited the tournament within 24 hours of
each other.
	   ``I have a lot of company,'' Rusedski said. ``There have been a
lot of upsets. I guess it's not good to be a seed this week.''
	   The lanky British power-server showed signs of weakness from the
start, narrowly saving two break points at to remain on serve at
3-2.
	   But Rusedski was immediately broken on his next serve, sending a
fierce backhand into the net, and allowing Prinosil to jump ahead
4-3. The Briton broke back at 5-6 to avoid surrendering the set,
but then lost the tiebreak.
	   The two players traded serves early in the second set, before
the German qualifier used the second of a pair of match points at
6-5 to clinch the victory.
	   Kafelnikov was hoping to use the tournament as a springboard to
reach the top eight in the ATP Tour rankings in order to earn a
berth at the ATP Tour World Championship next month in Hannover,
Germany.
	   The Russian broke Gustafsson to jump ahead 3-1, but then
appeared to yield control of the match.
	   Gustafsson broke early in the second set, then held onto his
lead to even the score.
	   In the final set, the two held serve until 5-5, when Gustafsson
used two break points to seal the match.
	   The devastation leaves American Andre Agassi at No. 4 and No. 6
Tim Henman of Britain as the only remaining seeds.
	   Agassi played Swiss qualifier Ivo Heuberger in second round play
later Thursday, while Henman was scheduled to meet Morocco's Hicham
Arazi.

Oman may raise duties on luxuries to counter falling oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Oman's government is considering increasing
customs duties on imports of luxury goods to compensate for the
recent sharp drop in oil prices, its trade and industry minister
has said.
	   The price fall has highlighted the revenue importance of customs
duties to the oil-producing country, Maqbool Ali Sultan told the
World Trade Organization in a statement released Thursday. The
minister didn't state the type of luxury goods to which he was
referring.
	   Oil accounts for nearly 80 percent of Oman's exports and about
75 percent of government revenues. Crude oil prices have stayed in
the doldrums recently because of a world supply glut that has
persisted despite producers' cutbacks.
	   Sultan told a meeting on Friday of a WTO working party
discussing Oman's entry to the global trade body that the country
is taking a range of trade liberalization measures to bring it into
line with WTO rules.
	   Oman will reduce the general binding rate for most farm and
industrial products to 20 percent from 25 percent. It also plans to
replace restrictions on imports of agricultural products with
tariffs from the date of its WTO accession.
	   While not giving details, Sultan told the meeting that Oman's
``very substantial and meaningful'' revised offer on services
includes commitments on banking, financial and other services.
	   ``Oman has gone a long way in accepting the demands of our
trading partners,'' the minister said. ``Please do not push us into
accepting commitments that we cannot live with.''
	   Governments should take into account Oman's dependence on the
single exhaustible resource of oil, Sultan added.
	   Governments said Oman had made good progress with its latest
offers, but they will have to be looked at again, a trade official
said.
	   European Union representatives told the meeting they wanted more
market opening commitments from Oman in telecommunications, the
official said. U.S. officials called Oman's statement
``remarkable'' and said the United States was ready to give
technical assistance.
	   It is the third meeting of the working group since it first met
in June 1996. The date of the next meet hasn't yet been determined.
	   The country, on the southeastern tip of the Arabian peninsula,
has a population of around 1.7 million Omanis and hosts 800,000
foreign nationals.

Drug-testing lab ordered shut; homes searched
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. Recasts. UPDATES with new lab head named &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's drug-testing laboratory will be shut while
the national Olympic committee (CONI) tries to put its house in
order amid allegations of cover-ups of positive tests and improper
procedures.
	   CONI's medical panel decided Thursday to close the Acqua Acetosa
lab after an International Olympic Committee (IOC) official deemed
the facility unsatisfactory.
	   ``Right now, the Rome laboratory does not have a chance of being
re-accredited by the IOC,'' the official, Jordi Segura, told
reporters. ``For the IOC, the most important thing is guaranteeing
the quality and trustworthiness of labs where analyses are done.''
	   It is the latest embarrassment in a doping debacle that has
already seen CONI president Mario Pescante resign and Acqua Acetosa
chief Emilio Gasbarrone fired.
	   There are four separate inquiries into the use of
performance-enhancing substances in Italian League soccer, and
investigators have reportedly discovered that some tests were not
complete and results of others might have been hidden.
	   Documentation on anti-doping tests was being discarded after two
months, while the lab is required to keep it at least two years,
five in the case of positive tests.
	   The head of the players union has threatened to call a six-month
strike to protest the handling of the investigations. The union
meets Monday to discuss a walkout.
	   Rome prosecutors searched Acqua Acetosa and the homes of five
current or former employees Thursday.
	   Gasbarrone, dismissed last week after 10 years as chief of Acqua
Acetosa, and four others are being investigated for abuse of office
and concealing evidence.
	   Segura, president of an IOC subcommittee on biochemistry and
doping, recommended a ``moratorium'' for two or three months on
tests at the lab, which will close Friday.
	   Francesco Botre, a pharmacologist, was nominated to take over as
the new head of Acqua Acetosa and he will be charged with cleaning
up procedures during the shutdown in an effort to retain IOC
accreditation.
	   In the meantime, tests that would have been conducted at Acqua
Acetosa will be done at labs in Barcelona, Spain; Cologne, Germany,
or Lausanne, Switzerland.
	   The scandal began in July after Zdenek Zeman, coach of the AS
Roma club, raised questions about the sudden muscular development
of certain players.

Jews protest against planned extreme-right rally in synagogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian Jewish Communities issued
a protest Thursday against a rally planned by the anti-Semitic
Hungarian Truth and Life Party in a rural synagogue.
	   The synagogue in Kecskemet, 100 kilometers (85 miles) southeast
of Budapest, houses the local branch of the Association of
Technological and Natural Science Societies.
	   ``It is an outrage that this extreme-right and anti-Semitic
grouping, which is de facto the spiritual heir of the Nazi party,
and whose representatives openly attack the Jewry,... now want to
hold their rally in a building that was built by the Jews, and
immortalizes the memory of the thousands of Jewish martyrs of
Kecskemet,'' the Hungarian Jewish Communities said in a statement
to the government's MTI news agency.
	   ``This is the desecration and the humiliation of the memory of
the martyrs,'' the statement added.
	   The spokesman of the Hungarian Truth and Life Party, Bela
Gyoeri, called the charges unfounded.
	   ``Our party is operating constitutionally, and we have not done
or said anything to support these charges,'' he said.
	   The party, lead by Istvan Csurka, is known for their rallies,
complete with Nazi-style salutes, flags resembling the
red-white-black Nazi swastika, and descriptions of anti-Jewish
slogans.
	   Csurka's party won parliamentary representation in last May's
general elections, for the first time in Hungary after World War
II.
	   Over 600,000 of Hungary's pre-war one million Jewish community
were killed by the Nazis in the war. Rural Hungary had suffered a
total ``final solution,'' as a result of which rural synagogues
were transferred to non-Jewish organizations.
	   The Hungarian Truth and Life Party is organizing a series of
rallies throughout the country in support of their candidates for
local elections on October 18.

Poland may seek extradition of communist-era prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland may try to extradite from Britain a
communist-era prosecutor allegedly responsible for the 1952 arrest
and subsequent execution of a World War II resistance hero, a
military prosecutor said Thursday.
	   Col. Tadeusz Krysicki, head of the Warsaw military prosecutor's
office, told the Polish state news agency PAP that the government
would seek to extradite Helena Wolinska, 79, if she fails to come
to Poland by Oct. 15 to testify in the investigation of the
resistance figure's death.
	   Prosecutors are investigating accusations that Wolinska
fabricated evidence and ordered the arrest of Gen. Emil Fieldorf,
the leader of the Polish underground Home Army that fought the
Nazis during World War II.
	   After the war, Fieldorf, known by the alias Nil, refused to
collaborate with the secret service of the new communist regime. He
then was charged by Wolinska in 1952 with killing Soviet soldiers
and leftist resisters during the war, and was hanged in 1953.
	   Historians say Wolinska fabricated the charges. If formally
charged and convicted of denying Fieldorf his freedom, she could be
sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.
	   Wolinska is a British citizen, but Polish officials on Thursday
were unable to provide her hometown or any other details.
	   Maria Gorowska, the judge who presided over Fieldorf's trial and
also was investigated by military prosecutors, died of cancer in
January at the age of 83 without testifying in the investigation.

Turkish Parliament approves possible military strike for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In an unanimous vote, Parliament on
Thursday authorized the government to take part in a possible
military intervention by NATO to end the violence in Kosovo.
	   Turkey, which has close ties with the predominantly Muslim
Albanian population of the troubled Serb region, has repeatedly
expressed its readiness to participate in any necessary measure to
stop the violence there.
	   The foreign ministry also warned Turkish citizens not to travel
through Yugoslavia.
	   Turkey, which has NATO's second-largest armed forces after the
United States, reportedly would take part in possible action with
four F-16 jets.
	   In July, Parliament had authorized the government to send
soldiers to Albania, which borders Kosovo.

Earthquake rattles residents of southern Peru, northern Chile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook southern Peru,
causing walls to collapse in shantytowns and people to flee their
homes, authorities said Thursday.
	   No deaths or injuries were reported from the 5.3-magnitude
quake, which rattled the southern city of Arequipa shortly before
midnight Wednesday, said fire department chief Nassry Salomon.
	   The epicenter was 27 miles (44 kilometers) northwest of
Arequipa, Peru's second largest city, located 465 miles (750
kilometers) southeast of Lima, Peru's Geophysical Institute
reported.
	   Many shantytown residents spent the night in the street fearing
further tremors would knock down their houses.
	   The earthquake also caused small landslides that blocked Peru's
Pan American highway, but traffic has been restored, Salomon said.
	   The quake was also felt in the sparsely populated north of
neighboring Chile, but there were no reports of victims or damage
there.

Husband found guilty of wife-beating in precedent-setting case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WINNIE KOROS &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAJIADO, Kenya (AP) _ The husband of a Maasai woman who was the
first in her tribe to sue her husband for abuse was found guilty
Thursday of beating his wife for five hours with a traditional
club.
	   ``I am satisfied that the prosecution has proved beyond doubt
that the injuries suffered by Agnes as caused by the accused amount
to bodily harm,'' Magistrate Charles Gitonga said in the courtroom
72 kilometers (45 miles) south of the capital, Nairobi.
	   Agnes Siyiankoi, a 31-year-old mother of four, testified on Feb.
9 that her husband, Moita ole Risa, beat her so badly she had to be
carried to hospital on a bicycle.
	   Gitonga fined Ole Risa, a security guard, 5,000 shillings (dlrs
83), in default of which he would face six months in prison.
	   Ole Risa forfeited his 5,000-shilling bail and left the
courtroom a free man as Siyiankoi watched with tears in her eyes.
	   She said she was not happy with the ruling and would appeal it.
	   ``I will pursue the case to set an example to women,'' she told
reporters after the judge delivered the verdict. ``I am taking care
of the children alone. My parents are ready to return the three-cow
dowry that they paid for me.''
	   Ole Risa was facing a maximum sentence of up to five years in
prison and lashes with a cane rod.
	   But Siyiankoi's attorney Gideon Solonka said he was satisfied
with the judgment.
	   ``It was okay in the sense that the court found that
wife-beating is wrong,'' he said. ``It is revolutionary not only in
the Maasai community but to the whole republic that wife- beating
is not justifiable, it is a criminal offense punishable in law.''
	   Wife-beating is a practice common among Maasai men, pastoral
people who live in many parts of Kenya.
	   ``I am of the view that a husband in Kenya like his counterpart
in England has no disciplinary powers over his wife. His only
remedy against his errant wife is to seek divorce,'' said Judge
Gitonga.
	   He said he found that Siyiankoi told the truth, and the
testimony of one of her children, who was present when the beating
occurred, corroborated it.
	   Ole Risa denied to the court that he had harmed his wife.
	   Representatives from the Kenya chapter of the International
Federation of Women Lawyers had no immediate comment on the
verdict.
	   The court was packed with Maasai elders and relatives of Ole
Risa who were unhappy with the verdict.

Tough new measures for violence on public transport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new, tougher measures to curb violence on public
transport expected; EDITS to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin was expected to
announce tough, new measures to curb violence on public transport,
hit by strikes for a third day Thursday by conductors demanding
protection from juvenile crime.
	   More than one million commuters were stranded at train stations,
according to radio reports. Traffic jams stretched up to 30
kilometers (19 miles) outside Paris as drivers tried to beat the
strike, which left suburban rail services virtually paralyzed.
	   The Socialist prime minister, trying to nip the strike before it
spreads, was expected to announce Thursday night a series of
measures to dissuade delinquency on trains, buses and Metros.
	   Justice Ministry sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said expected measures include longer sentences for anyone
convicted of physical assault; speedy trials with ``immediate''
court appearances; allowing public transport workers to demand
identity papers of those who break the law.
	   The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, ahead of Jospin's
appearance on French television.
	   There was some relief in the capital with bus services resuming
after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system deployed
two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   Also, the Metro was not affected. But only one train per hour,
if any, was running on most lines of the suburban train lines.
	   Rail services of the SNCF, the national rail network, were
particularly affected at the Montparnasse, Gare du Nord, Gare de
l'Est and Gare de Lyon stations, which serve most points of entry
into the capital.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday night on the RER C
line, where a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried to
stop youths from vandalizing a station. The escalating attacks, in
which drivers are jumped by gangs of youths, happen mostly in poor
suburbs with especially high unemployment.
	   ``How can you not show solidarity when there has been this
aggression?'' Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, a Communist,
asked in an interview Thursday on France 2 television.
	   The strikers ``are asking that there be guarantees of security
for passengers and themselves. On that point, we're behind them,''
he added.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area depend on public
transit daily.

	   BANYOLES, Spain (AP) _ Authorities say overloading may have
caused an excursion boat carrying some 140 French retirees to sink
Thursday, killing at least 20 people in a tranquil lake in
northeastern Spain.
	   ``Police are working on the theory that the boat was
overloaded,'' said a spokeswoman for the regional government's
rescue operation center in Barcelona. ``Initial reports suggest the
boat had a maximum capacity of 80.''
	   The 20 killed were all French. Thirteen people drowned in the
water, and seven people died after being taken to local hospitals.
	   Another two people were reported missing and it was not known
whether they had been on the boat trip or not, said the
spokeswoman, who in keeping with custom, declined to be identified.
	   A total of 38 people were treated in hospital following the
accident and 81 others, including the boat's Spanish captain, were
said to be uninjured.
	   An employee at the ticket sales counter at the lake said 141
tickets were sold. So far only 139 people, including the pilot,
have been accounted for.
	   Police underwater divers scoured the water and the wreckage of
the electrically-powered catamaran craft Thursday afternoon for the
possibility of more bodies.
	   National television images showed bodies covered in blankets
lining the small pier at the lake in the immediate aftermath of the
accident. Other shots showed bodies being pulled into small rowing
boats.
	   Most of those who drowned were believed to have been on the
lower deck of the vessel.
	   ''We could see old people up to their necks in water shouting
for help and other people crying,'' an unidentified schoolgirl told
national television.
	   The boat sank Thursday morning under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of
Barcelona and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid.
	   The national new agency Efe cited provincial fire chief Antoni
Guell denying earlier news reports that the boat had split in two.
	   A police officer helping with rescue operations told The
Associated Press that the boat had only left its mooring when the
pilot realized it had problems and tried to turn back. It sank,
stern first, just two meters (yards), out leaving its bow sticking
up out of the water.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips daily on
the lake, a spokesman for the firm that owned it, La Carpa
spokesman, told Efe.
	   Rescue said the majority of passengers were French retirees from
the western coastal area in and around the town of La Rochelle, 400
kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Paris.
	   Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long and up to 700
meters (765 yards) wide at one point, is the largest natural lake
in the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several
water events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Police arrest 4 in Caucasus car bomb that killed 17

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police arrested four people, including two former
army demolition experts, in connection with an explosion that
killed 17 people in a restive region of southern Russia, a news
agency said Thursday.
	   The Sept. 4 explosion, thought to have been caused by a car
bomb, gouged a five-meter (15-foot) crater in a street in
Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan.
	   Seventeen people, including two children, died in the explosion
outside the local television center on the street where Dagestan's
prime minister and Makhachkala's mayor live. Neither was hurt.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said four people, including two former
Russian army officers, have been arrested. The officers are former
demolition experts, it said, quoting officials in the North
Caucasus prosecutor general's office.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border.

Dollar down, gold up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was down against other major
currencies in late European trading Thursday. Gold prices rose.
	   Also Thursday, the Bank of England cut a key interest rate _ the
repo rate, the lowest rate at which the central bank loans money to
commercial banks _ by a quarter-point to 7.25 percent.
	   Analysts said it was too early to determine the impact of the
announcement on the dollar and other European currencies against
the pound. Typically, lower interest rates can weaken a currency by
making it less attractive to investors.
	   Jonathan Griggs, a currency analyst for Barings Plc in London,
said the dollar's fall came as dealers rushed to buy yen when Japan
hinted at stronger fiscal measures and the prospect of new banking
reform laws. The strengthened yen caused subsequent reverberations
across European financial markets.
	   The dollar's plummet against most other currencies is a
``general knock on the effect of the yen's movement,'' he said.
	   Another possible contributor, Griggs said, is that ``the
perception that the U.S. economy will remain strong relative to
other economies is changing.''
	   Dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
	   _1.6125 German marks, down from 1.6168.
	   _118 Japanese yen, down from 124.25.
	   _1.2947 Swiss francs, down from 1.3220.
	   _5.4065 French francs, down from 5.4213.
	   _1.8184 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8227.
	   _1,595.28 Italian lire, down from 1,597.90.
	   _1.5185 Canadian dollars, down from 1.5290.
	   The British pound was quoted at dlrs 1.7186, up from dlrs
1.6926.
	   Gold closed in London at dlrs 299.60 bid per troy ounce, up from
the closing price of dlrs 298.50 bid Wednesday.
	   In Zurich gold traded at dlrs 300, up from dlrs 298.50.
	   Gold rose dlrs 2.80 in Hong Kong to close at dlrs 301.15.
	   Silver closed in London at dlrs 5.07 bid per troy ounce, down
from dlrs 5.10 bid Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A suspected leader of Colombia's
Cali drug cartel was sentenced to six years in a Dutch jail
Thursday for his involvement in cocaine smuggling.
	   Luis Arnaldo Quiceno Botero was convicted of assisting in the
transport of 240 kilos of cocaine from South America to the
Netherlands in 1991 and 1992, Dutch prosecutor Elizabeth Horstink
said.
	   A district court also fined Quiceno Botero 100,000 guilders
(dlrs 55,000).
	   Although authorities believe Quiceno Botero _ still wanted by
U.S. authorities _ was a top leader of the notorious drug cartel,
there was only enough evidence to connect him to the three failed
drug shipments, Horstink said.
	   ``We do think we have arrested and sentenced an important person
in the criminal organization,'' Horstink said.
	   Quiceno Botero was arrested on the island of Curacao in the
Netherlands Antilles last Dec. 23 while on vacation with his
family.
	   The three shipments, which were intercepted outside the country,
were intended for the Dutch market, Horstink said.
	   The United States has requested Quiceno Botero's extradition
because he also is suspected of smuggling cocaine to the United
States, but the Dutch court has not yet made a decision, she said.

Drop in oil prices causes Russia's gas export prices to fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The drop in world oil prices has caused a 13
percent drop in prices that Russia's giant Gazprom company could
charge for natural gas exports in the first half of this year,
compared to the same period in 1997, a top executive said Thursday.
	   By October, Gazprom export prices were 20 percent lower than
during the same time last year, said Yelena Garpel, head of
Gazprom's price-setting department.
	   World gas prices are generally tied to those of other energy
sources, particularly those of crude oil, she said.
	   Garpel refused to provide average export prices, saying that
contracts varied greatly.
	   Gazprom _ the world's biggest gas exporter and Europe's main
supplier _ depends on exports because only 16 percent of its
domestic bills were paid in cash in the first half of this year.
	   Some were paid through barter deals, but more than half of the
total bills were not paid, company officials said.
	   Last year, Gazprom delivered 116.8 billion cubic meters (4.1
trillion cubic feet) of natural gas to Central and Western Europe,
Gazprom chairman Rem Vyakhirev has said.
	   The company has also signed contracts for the export of 2.7
trillion cubic meters (94.5 trillion cubic feet) of gas in the next
20 or so years, he said.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army said the
rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military activity''
starting Friday. The statement was delivered to Albanian-language
media in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   The KLA said they retain the right to defend themselves if
attacked and demand international monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   The statement puts additional pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose troops have been fighting the
secessionists since Feb.28, leaving hundreds of people killed and
tens of thousands homeless in the southern Serbian province.
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
so far refused to openly declare a cease-fire even though there has
been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   The KLA said that it declared the cease-fire ``to respect the
engagement of the international community to end the civilian
tragedy in Kosovo and to fulfill the demands from the U.N.
resolution of September 24.''
	   NATO has threatened to intervene against the Serb-led forces in
Kosovo if Milosevic refuses to comply to all points of the
resolution, including the partial withdrawal of his troops from
Kosovo and allow free access to humanitarian and aid organizations
to the displaced people.

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Tajikistan's president and the
country's main opposition leader held talks on speeding up the
reconciliation process in the Central Asian country, a presidential
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The meeting between President Emomali Rakhmonov and opposition
leader Said Abdullo Nuri on Wednesday was ``fruitful and held in a
constructive atmosphere,'' said presidential spokesman Zafar
Saidov.
	   After lengthy negotiations during the meeting, Rakhmonov
appointed opposition member Zokir Vazirov to the post of deputy
prime minister for social issues and local governments, Saidov
said.
	   The appointment falls under a peace agreement that calls for 30
percent of government and local executive bodies be filled by
opposition members.
	   Vazirov became the 12th opposition representative in the
government. Opposition members are entitled to two more posts,
including that of defense minister, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Rakhmonov and Nuri also discussed the investigation into the
September killing of a prominent opposition leader, as wells as
solidifying peace agreements in this poor, mountainous former
Soviet republic.
	   In addition, they debated the peaceful disarmament of
independent bands of gunmen who periodically launch attacks outside
Dushanbe. A deadline for them to turn over their weapons expired
Wednesday, but many have not done so.
	   Outbreaks of violence between the hard-line government and the
mostly Islamic opposition still occur periodically in Tajikistan,
despite a peace agreement last year that ended five years of civil
war.

<TEXT>
	   VALEKNBURG, Netherlands (AP) - The vice president of the
International Cycling Union, Daniel Baal of France, has decided to
leave the World Cycling Champinships before the end of the
championships, saying he felt alone in the struggle against doping
in the sport.
	   Baal is also president of the French Cycling Federation and has
to handle the discipline of the five French members of the Festina
team which was kicked out of the Tour de France in the aftermath of
the doping scandal plagued the event this summer.
	   Baal has been one of the advocates for further measures and
presented a structure for mandatory health checks at the
International Cycling Union congress on Monday.
	   He also was named to be a founding member of a new anti-doping
cycling funded by national federations, cycling teams and riders.
The new group, the Council for the Fight Against Doping (CFAD),
will follow up measures for increased anti-doping and blood tests,
medical coverage and contributions to research.

Amnesty urges Syria to release longest serving prisoner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Amnesty International on Thursday called on
the Syrian government to release its longest serving political
prisoner, saying the 54-year-old man was detained 32 years ago
after an unfair trial.
	   The London-based human rights group also urged Syrian
authorities to allow Abdel-Majid Zaghmout access to medical care.
	   Syrian officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Amnesty said Zaghmout has been on a hunger strike in Adra civil
prison outside the capital, Damascus, for the past 13 days to
protest his continued detention.
	   Zaghmout, a Palestinian, reportedly suffers from heart problems,
high blood pressure, severe weight loss and acute ulcers, Amnesty
said in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo.
	   Zaghmout, a former member of Fatah, the mainstream faction in
the Palestine Liberation Organization, was arrested on May 10, 1966
and charged with the murder of a Palestinian guerrilla leader.
	   He was sentenced to death later that year by a military court
after ``a summary and grossly unfair trial,'' Amnesty said.
	   Syria's defense minister commuted the death sentence in 1989 to
a prison term equivalent to the time he had already spent in
custody and ordered his release, the statement said. It wasn't
clear why the order was never carried out.
	   ``He should be released immediately,'' Amnesty said.
	   Amnesty says hundreds of political prisoners are held in Syrian
jails.

Swedish government survives vote of no-confidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Prime Minister Goeran Persson's new
minority government easily survived a Thursday vote of
no-confidence called by the main opposition party.
	   The vote was 186 in support of the government and 82 against,
with 74 abstentions. All those voting against the government were
deputies from the conservative Moderates party, Sweden's
second-largest after Persson's Social Democrats.
	   In Sept. 20 national elections, the governing Social Democrats
got less than 37 percent of the vote, down from 45 percent in
1994's elections. It was the party's worst-ever result and the
Social Democrats' decline was the biggest by any party that got
parliamentary seats.
	   Moderates leader Carl Bildt, in calling for the no-confidence
vote, said the Social Democrats' poor performance undermined their
authority to continue in government.
	   Persson has remained prime minister by working out a cooperation
with the ex-Communist Left Party and the Greens. It is an
apparently awkward alliance and observers have predicted it will
quickly collapse.
	   The abstaining votes were cast by three non-socialist parties.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Unknown attackers shot and
wounded a leading Muslim imam at his home in a crime-infested slum
in South Africa, police said Thursday.
	   A group of unidentified men called at Sheikh Abdurahman
Gafieldien's house on Wednesday night in Manenburg, an area of Cape
Town that is the base for a drug gang. When the imam opened the
door he was shot in the face and the men fled, said police Capt.
Anine de Beer.
	   Gafieldien received death threats earlier this year after he
witnessed a robbery, Manenburg police station commissioner Dirk
Mentoor said.
	   Gafieldien was rushed to a hospital where he is in a critical
but stable condition.
	   A prominent figure in Cape Town's small but vocal Muslim
community, Gafieldien has campaigned against drugs and violence,
even brokering peace deals between feuding crime gangs.
	   Gafieldien has also criticized a Muslim vigilante group, People
Against Gangsterism and Drugs, that police believe is behind a wave
of bombings and shootings in the squalid Cape Flats townships.
	   ``What is particularly abhorrent about these and similar attacks
is that they are often directed at religious leaders ... who oppose
the acts of violence,'' said police commissioner Ganief Daniels.
	   Violence in Cape Town made international headlines recently
after an August bomb attack on a Planet Hollywood restaurant killed
two people.

Tudjman's chief of cabinet resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A senior aide to President Franjo
Tudjman, who last month accused another Tudjman aide and the
military counter-intelligence service of orchestrating attacks
against their opponents, announced Thursday that he has resigned.
	   Hrvoje Sarinic told state-run news agency HINA that he met
Tudjman on Wednesday, and realized that ``the decision to remove me
has already been taken, without giving me a chance to support my
claims.''
	   Apparently seeing that Tudjman would not ask him to stay,
Sarinic decided to disclose to the public that on Oct. 1, he
offered to Tudjman an ``irrevocable resignation'' on all of his
posts, including the membership in the party and in another
intelligence service.
	   Last month, Sarinic, the chief of cabinet, told the newspaper
Jutarnji that the military counter-intelligence unit was behind a
media campaign against the more liberal members of the ruling
party. He said their actions are likely commanded by Tudjman aide
Ivic Pasalic.
	   The claims demonstrated the growing rift in Tudjman's ruling
party between the hard-liners, usually characterized as
nationalists who oppose democracy, and moderates, who lean toward
organizing Croatia along Western lines.
	   But it also highlighted Tudjman's opponents' constant claims
that his party, or some of its members, are using state
institutions for political or personal gains.
	   Pasalic, who is considered a hard-liner, denied Sarinic's
allegations.
	   A parliamentary commission is to summon both Sarinic and
Pasalic, as well as head of the military intelligence, on Saturday,
to examine the case.
	   The ruling party's rift affects the government as well, where
hard-liners control the army and large sections of police. If
Tudjman accepts Sarinic's resignation, that would indicate that the
hard-liners have prevailed.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cargo-loaded barge sank off the Russian Far
East, and one person was killed and two more were missing, a news

Heat will be on Sampras, Chang, Agassi to play Davis Cup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMS; RECASTS; adds Marmion quotes; background &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The heat will be on Pete Sampras and Michael Chang
to play in next year's Davis Cup opener against Britain.
	   But U.S. Tennis Association president Harry Marmion admitted
there was still no guarantee the Americans would field a
full-strength team _ a rarity in recent years.
	   ``I have a feeling this year we'll put some additional pressure
on some of the players who did not participate, particularly Chang
and Sampras,'' Marmion said Thursday in London at the 1999 Davis
Cup draw.
	   ``The question of the top three players is a difficult one,'' he
added. ``We'll do the best we can to get them.''
	   In addition to the United States playing at Britain, the other
seven ties in the April 2-4 first round of the World Group are:
Sweden vs. Slovakia, Germany vs. Russia, Zimbabwe vs. Australia,
France vs. Netherlands, Spain vs. Brazil, Belgium vs. Czech
Republic and Switzerland vs. Italy.
	   While other countries always play at full strength, the United
States _ where the event seems to have lost its luster _ has been
fielding its second and third team. And losing.
	   Last month, without Sampras, Chang or Andre Agassi, Italy ousted
the Americans in the semifinals in Milwaukee. The Italians have won
the Davis Cup once _ the Americans a record 31 times.
	   Marmion, who is expected to be replaced Jan. 1 as president by
Judy Levering, termed the loss last month a ``good effort'' and
said Americans Todd Martin, Justin Gimelstob and Jan-Michael
Gambill ``played with great dignity.''
	   ``That was the best team we could put out,'' Marmion said. ``We
came up short. That's no disgrace. That's not an embarrassment. I
resent the use of the term embarrassment. It was not an
embarrassment.''
	   Marmion has been engaged in a war of words with Agassi. Agassi
last month termed him ``pathetic,'' criticized Milwaukee as the
site, but said he might consider playing the Davis Cup for a new
president.
	   Asked if he would try to make up with Agassi, Marmion said, ``I
doubt it, although I will be urged to so by some.''
	   ``We lost a decade of players, a generation of players in
America,'' he added. ``We never established the loyalty to the
David Cup in that group. We're just going to have to play through
that.''
	   Marmion said he would prefer Tom Gullikson to remain as U.S.
Davis captain, but said that decision would be Levering's.
	   Even if the Americans beat Britain, they will have a tough road
with Australia (26-time champion) likely in the second-round and
Sweden, Germany or Russia in the semifinals.
	   Britain, returning to the elite 16 of the World Group for the
first time since 1992, will be headed by Tim Henman and
Canadian-born Greg Rusedski.
	   ``It should be a feast of tennis for the fans. What a tie,''
said Lawn Tennis Association chief executive John Crowther.
	   The probable indoor sites for the tie include Wembley in London,
Birmingham, Newcastle, Manchester or Glasgow.
	   Sweden and Italy, which meet in the 1998 final next month in
Italy, were given the joint top seeds. Spain and the United States
were seeded joint third and fourth followed by France and Australia
(joint fifth-sixth) and the Czech Republic and Germany (joint
seventh-eighth).
	   The second-round matches are July 16-18, semifinals (Sept.
24-26) and the final (Dec. 3-5).
	   Next year's Davis Cup will be the 100th. The event was begun in
1900 between the United States and the British Isles.
	   The International Tennis Federation, which runs the competition,
hopes to have a 100th anniversary celebration next year at the
Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, where the first Davis Cup was
played.
	   The ITF is also planning other events next year ``to lift the
profile and image of the Davis Cup,'' said ITF president Brian
Tobin.
	   This year's field includes a record 129 teams with Fiji the only
new addition.
	   ``We already heard from about seven people who would like to
play in Fiji next year,'' Tobin said.

Latvian parliament puts off controversial language bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Latvian Parliament on Thursday postponed
for a second time consideration of a controversial bill to
strengthen the use of the Latvian language.
	   The issue is a sore point with Latvia's large ethnic Russian
community, many of whom went to Russian-language schools and lived
in Russian-speaking communities and have little or no grasp of
Latvian.
	   Because of the huge numbers of Russians who moved to Latvia when
it was part of the Soviet Union, ethnic Latvians make up little
more than half of the country's population and they often worry
that their culture is endangered.
	   The move to postpone the bill came just five days after a
national referendum in which Latvians narrowly approved
liberalizing naturalization laws to lower some of the obstacles to
ethnic Russians becoming citizens. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Russians in Latvia became stateless with the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
	   The move to soften the naturalization laws was seen as a
significant step toward integrating the Russians and in turning
down the heat in a long-running dispute with the Kremlin.
	   Consideration of the bill in the Saeima parliament was delayed
because it contains contradictory provisions, the Baltic News
Service quoted education, science and culture committee head
Dzintars Abikis as saying.
	   Among the clauses being debated are one calling for Latvian to
be the only language used in state and municipal schools and one
calling for Latvian to be used in public demonstrations and
rallies, BNS said.

 &UR; Kosovo Albanian militants declare cease-fire
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with NATO comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army said the
rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military activity''
starting Friday. The statement was delivered to Albanian-language
media in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   The KLA said they retain the right to defend themselves if
attacked and demand international monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   The statement puts additional pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose troops have been fighting the
secessionists since Feb. 28, leaving hundreds of people killed and
tens of thousands homeless in the southern Serbian province.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown because of rebel attacks on
police and soldiers and has so far refused to accept U.N. demands
for a formal cease-fire. The government claims it needs a strong
police and military presence in the province to guard against
future attacks.
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
so far refused to openly declare a cease-fire even though there has
been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   The KLA said that it declared the cease-fire ``to respect the
engagement of the international community to end the civilian
tragedy in Kosovo and to fulfill the demands from the U.N.
resolution of September 24.''
	   NATO has threatened to intervene against the Serb-led forces in
Kosovo if Milosevic refuses to comply to all points of the
resolution, including the partial withdrawal of his troops from
Kosovo and allow free access to humanitarian and aid organizations
to the displaced people.

Many issues outstanding ahead of peace summit in Washington
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. peace mediator Dennis Ross was unable to
get top Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to reach agreement
Thursday on outstanding issues ahead of a peace summit next week in
Washington.
	   The United States hopes the sides will resolve a list of
secondary issues standing in the way of an agreement over a long
overdue Israeli troop withdrawal and leave larger issues for talks
to be hosted by U.S. President Bill Clinton beginning Oct. 15th.
	   Although Ross said ``further progress'' was made in Thursday's
meeting, negotiators said that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will have to tackle the
interim issues in Washington.
	   ``We hope that when we go to Washington we can finalize the
agreement,'' Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat told
reporters after four hours of meetings with Israeli counterparts.
	   The issues that remain unresolved are the opening of a
Palestinian airport, the release of Palestinian prisoners and the
establishment of a safe passageway between the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, Erekat said.
	   After meeting in Gaza with Arafat and Netanyahu on Wednesday,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the sides had made
``significant progress'' but still had a lot to do in Washington
before concluding an agreement.
	   Ross stayed in the region after Albright's departure to wrap-up
enough of the outstanding issues to make a Washington signing more
possible.
	   ``We've said all along, nothing is agreed until everything is
agreed,'' Ross told reporters.

Sudan accuses U.S., Israel of training Ugandan troops
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's defense minister has accused the
United States and Israel of training Ugandan troops, who he said
attacked southern Sudan last month.
	   In a statement to Parliament on Wednesday, Defense Minister Maj.
Gen. Ibrahim Suleiman said the Ugandans used ``very sophisticated
weapons in the attack.''
	   Suleiman also claimed that the United States is currently
operating a war room in Uganda from where, he said, it masterminded
the attacks on Sudan's Eastern Equatoria province.
	   ``The Ugandan troops that were engaged in the incursion against
Sudanese territories have received advanced training by the United
States and Israeli experts,'' he said. He did not elaborate or
offer any evidence to support his statements.
	   Sudan claims that Ugandan and Eritrean troops supported local
rebel groups in southern Sudan during clashes with government
forces last month. Uganda and Eritrea deny the allegations.
	   The United States accuses Sudan of supporting international
terrorism. On Aug. 20 it fired missiles to destroy a pharmaceutical
plant in Khartoum that it said was making chemical weapon agents.
	   Rebel forces, mainly Christian and animist, have been waging a
military campaign against the government in Khartoum since 1983 for
more autonomy for the southern districts as a means to reduce the
dominance of the Arabized and Islamic north.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.

UEFA rejects Hearts' protest over Mallorca goalposts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer's governing body Thursday rejected
an appeal lodged by Scottish club Hearts over the size of the
goalposts in a Cup Winners Cup first-round match against Mallorca
of Spain.
	   The teams tied 1-1 last week in the second-leg match at
Mallorca's Luis Sitjar Stadium, with Mallorca advancing to the next
round 2-1.
	   But Hearts complained to UEFA that the goalposts at one end of
the pitch were too close together.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body rejected the appeal after
considering official match reports and the views of the clubs, the
referee and the official UEFA delegate at the match, a UEFA
statement said.
	   The decision clears the way for Mallorca to meet Genk of Belgium
in the second round.
	   However, the panel decided that a UEFA disciplinary inspector
will investigate whether Mallorca ``has violated any regulations as
regards the provision of goalposts which comply with the laws of
the game.''
	   After a similar complaint last year UEFA ordered the replay of a
game between Spartak Moscow and Sion of Switzerland.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Kosovo declared a unilateral cease-fire
Thursday, while support within NATO for airstrikes to force
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown appeared to hit a
snag.
	   Tensions between Yugoslavia and NATO nations were intensifying
following three days of meetings between Milosevic and special U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The diplomat briefed Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
NATO officials Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, on the results of
those talks and was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for
another session with Milosevic.
	   Albright said Holbrooke would be delivering a message that the
time for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo was ``all but gone.''
She demanded full compliance with U.N. orders to end the crackdown
and said ``half measures'' would not be enough.
	   The cease-fire by the Kosovo Liberation Army puts additional
pressure on Milosevic, whose troops have been fighting the
separatists since Feb. 28, killing hundreds of people and
displacing an estimated 270,000.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   A KLA statement said the rebel command ``has decided to refrain
from all military activity'' starting Friday. The statement,
delivered to Albanian-language media in the provincial capital
Pristina, said it retained the right to defend themselves if
attacked.
	   Before the declaration, reporters in Kosovo heard three or four
bursts of mortar fire Thursday in the Malisevo area about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. The firing indicated some
military action was continuing, although U.S. officials have
conceded there has been no significant fighting for about a week.
	   Holbrooke was ordered Thursday to return amid further signs of
opposition within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic
efforts.
	   At the White House on Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
the United States would vote to authorize military strikes against
Serbia if Milosevic ``continues to defy the international
community.''
	   ``In the days ahead my counterparts in Europe will be making
similar decisions,'' the president said in a ceremony in the
Roosevelt Room.
	   Holbrooke refused to talk to reporters after his final session
with Milosevic on Wednesday. But Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency
said Milosevic warned him that threats of NATO airstrikes only
dimmed the chances for peace in Kosovo.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic on
Thursday en route to a London for a meeting of the major powers
most deeply involved in the negotiations. Russia strongly opposes
using force to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is expected to
deliver that message when he meets Albright in London.
	   In the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, about 20 vehicles carrying
diplomats and their families from the United States, Britain and
Australia left Thursday for the Hungarian capital of Budapest. The
diplomats will remain in Budapest until it becomes clearer whether
NATO will strike to force Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   Despite mounting evidence that Milosevic has not complied with
U.N. demands for a cease-fire, the withdrawal of Serb troops, and
the return of refugees to their villages, Washington lacks the
international consensus needed to bomb Milosevic into action.
	   Milosevic says he has fulfilled those demands and his office
issued a statement Wednesday saying that ``threats, which are
delivered to our country, jeopardize the continuation of the
political process.''
	   Holbrooke did succeed in negotiating safe passage for Selman
Morina, the sole survivor of a massacre last week in which 13 other
ethnic Albanian males were allegedly shot and killed by Serb
police. The police deny involvement.
	   Morina left the country Wednesday and will be interviewed by
U.N. war crimes investigators in The Hague, Netherlands, said a
senior U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Serbia, meanwhile, announced measures Wednesday that brought the
country nearer to war footing. It ordered government departments to
increase security and threatened punishment for those who spread
``fear, panic and defeatism.''
	   Detailed maps showing locations of 46 main Belgrade underground
shelters were published in newspapers, including instructions on
``what to do in case of an attack.''
	   Yugoslavs went on panic shopping sprees _ causing shortages of
flour, sugar and other staples.

Iran reports clash with Taliban, Taliban denies it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Taliban offer to hold talks with U.N. envoy &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran said its border forces fought a three-hour
battle with Afghanistan's Taliban militia Thursday, inflicting
heavy casualties. But the Taliban denied that any fighting took
place.
	   In fact, the Taliban claimed, Iran has been firing artillery
into Afghanistan during the past three days.
	   Iran's official media reported that Taliban forces fired mortars
and machine guns early Thursday at Iranian border posts in
northeastern Khorasan province, provoking Iranian troops to return
fire.
	   The Iranian barrage forced Taliban fighters to retreat, Iranian
television said.
	   This was the first major battle reported between the two sides
since tensions began to rise in August when many Iranians went
missing in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, admitted
recently that its fighters killed eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist in northern Afghanistan.
	   Iranian media said Thursday's clash occurred at 6.30 a.m. (0300
GMT) in Torbat-e Jam in the Saleh Abad region. The area is about
180 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of the Iranian city of
Mashhad.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a top army
commander as saying that the Taliban suffered heavy casualties.
	   Brig. Gen. Azizollah Jaafari, commander of the ground forces of
Iran's elite Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, said three of the
militia's border posts were destroyed. The situation is now calmed,
he said.
	   There were no immediate reports of any Iranian casualties.
	   But Shakeel, a Taliban spokesman who uses only one name, denied
any skirmish. He dismissed the report as propaganda against
Taliban.
	   Another Taliban spokesman, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, said Taliban
leader Mullah Omar had ordered his border commanders to ``show
restraint and not retaliate'' even though Iranians have been
raining artillery on Afghanistan during the past three days.
	   The Taliban twice released Iranian prisoners as goodwill,
Muttawakil said, adding that Omar has invited the U.N. special
envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, ``for direct face to face
talks about the whole Afghanistan situation.''
	   It is an unusual offer given that Omar has never publicly met
with foreigners since the Taliban took control of the Afghan
capital, Kabul, in 1996.
	   Lakhdar, who was in Tehran Thursday, has stayed away from
Afghanistan citing security reasons. He has, however, offered to
meet Taliban leaders in Islamabad, Pakistan.
	   ``We want to invite the United Nations and Iran to settle the
matter with Afghanistan through negotiations,'' Muttawakil said
when contacted by telephone from neighboring Pakistan.
	   However, Taliban has already rejected Iran's demands that the
Taliban apologize for killing its citizens and hand over the
culprits for trial in Tehran.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing its northern-based opposition, which includes
the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also are
Shiite Muslims.
	   Iran says it has massed more than 200,000 troops on its eastern
border with Afghanistan. Iranian troops conducted several
large-scale military exercises during the past few weeks.
	   Afghanistan's Taliban army has sent an estimated 10,000 troops
to its western border with Iran.

New Albanian government wins vote of confidence in parliament

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's new Socialist-led government
won a vote of confidence in Parliament on Thursday, after Prime
Minister Pandeli Majko promised to lead this former Communist
country out of its political and social crisis.
	   All 104 Parliament members who attended the session voted for
the new government. The opposition Democratic Party of former
President Sali Berisha holds 28 seats but has boycotted the
Parliament for months.
	   Majko, 30, was named prime minister after his predecessor, Fatos
Nano, resigned last month after failing to win approval for Cabinet
changes following riots two weeks ago triggered by the
assassination of a popular opposition leader.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the assassination and led a series of
protests that threatened to plunge the country into chaos.
	   On Wednesday, Majko outlined his government's agenda, saying top
priorities would be establishment of ``public order,'' fighting
corruption and initiating a dialogue with the opposition if they
return to the Parliament.
	   Majko is the youngest prime minister in Albania's history and is
widely seen as the standardbearer of a new generation of
politicians untainted by links to the former Communists.
	   His deputy prime minister and interior minister are also 30 year
olds.
	   Albania is still trying to recover from nationwide riots that
exploded in 1997 after pyramid investment schemes collapsed,
depriving many Albanians of their life savings.
	   Berisha, who was president at the time, resigned after
internationally sponsored elections brought Nano and his Socialists
to power.

Kosovo Albanian militants declare cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army said the
rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military activity''
starting Friday. The statement was delivered to Albanian-language
media in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   The KLA said they retain the right to defend themselves if
attacked and demand international monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   The statement puts additional pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose troops have been fighting the
secessionists since Feb. 28, leaving hundreds of people killed and
tens of thousands homeless in the southern Serbian province.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown because of rebel attacks on
police and soldiers and has so far refused to accept U.N. demands
for a formal cease-fire. The government claims it needs a strong
police and military presence in the province to guard against
future attacks.
	   But a member of the Serb-led information ministry in Kosovo,
Bosko Drobnjak, welcomed the announcement.
	   ``It would be good if it were true,'' he said. ``A cease-fire is
something that we've wished for a long time. Yugoslavia has
fulfilled all the requirements of the international community and
armed actions by the Serb side have long ceased. Of course, our
forces will respond when and if they are attacked.''
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
so far refused to openly declare a cease-fire even though there has
been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   The KLA said that it declared the cease-fire ``to respect the
engagement of the international community to end the civilian
tragedy in Kosovo and to fulfill the demands from the U.N.
resolution of September 24.''
	   NATO has threatened to intervene against the Serb-led forces in
Kosovo if Milosevic refuses to comply to all points of the
resolution, including the partial withdrawal of his troops from
Kosovo and allow free access to humanitarian and aid organizations
to the displaced people.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials welcomed the KLA
cease-fire.
	   ``Any attack ... against Yugoslav forces, makes our job more
difficult,'' said one NATO official on condition of anonymity. ``We
welcome it.''

 &UR; With Nobel Literature &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ For a second year in a row, the Vatican has
criticized the Swedish Academy's choice for the Nobel Literature
Prize.
	   L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's newspaper, described the
choice Thursday of Portuguese novelist Jose Saramago as ``yet
another ideaologically oriented recognition.''
	   Last year, the Vatican criticized the academy's choice of
Italian comic playwright Dario Fo, who often held the Roman
Catholic church up to ridicule.
	   Saramago was described by the newspaper as an ``old-school
communist'' and said that in his 1982 work ``Memorial do convento''
he expressed ``all his anticlerical vein.''
	   The newspaper also called Saramago's recent ``O eveangelho
segundo Jesus Cristo'' part of his ``substantially antireligious
vision.''
	   The Swedish Academy said it was honoring Saramago, 75, for work
that ``with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony
continually enables us to apprehend an elusory reality.''

Sukarno's daughter supported by huge rally in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ In a scene reminiscent of the massive
rallies orchestrated by her charismatic father decades ago,
Megawati Sukarnoputri raised her fist in the air and cried out
``freedom,'' triggering a mighty roar from tens of thousands of
adoring supporters.
	   The daughter of Indonesia's founding head of state, Sukarno, on
Thursday demanded an end to corruption, the prosecution of
lawbreakers and a better deal for the poor, in a speech regarded as
her first step toward running for president next year.
	   Undaunted by the fierce tropical heat, an estimated 50,000
gathered in a field near the beach resorts of the island of Bali, a
Hindu enclave in Muslim-dominated Indonesia, and a major source of
tourist revenue.
	   Dressed in red, the color of her Indonesian Democratic Party,
and carrying countless red signs, flags and banners, the crowd
shouted ``Mega must win!'' as she waved from a makeshift stage.
	   Many also carried pictures of her, and her late father.
	   ``In the next general election if the people want me to form a
government then I will form a government based on law,'' she in her
hour-long address.
	   In May, about 1,200 people died in riots on the neighboring main
island of Java, forcing President Suharto to quit 32 years after he
took power from Sukarno, Megawati's father.
	   In recent weeks, Habibie, Suharto's successor and longtime ally,
has been targeted by protests, and he has promised to hold
democratic elections next year.
	   But Habibie also appears to be intent on fending off Megawati
and other challengers for the presidency.
	   Megawati bitterly resents Habibie's government for not
officially recognizing her as the rightful leader of the party,
which has been wracked by squabbling and violence for years.
	   She maintains that she was deposed illegally as head of the
party in 1996, when dozens of her supporters were killed in a clash
with police and troops in Jakarta.
	   She accuses Suharto of engineering her ouster by a rival faction
and has criticized Habibie for refusing to recognize her as the
true party chief.
	   Habibie's government maintains the party is rightfully
controlled by Megawati's rivals.
	   Her father, President Sukarno was renowned for whipping up
support among the masses through electric oratory. As a fiery
nationalist, his targets in the 1940s, 50s and 60s were Dutch
imperialism, the United States and neocolonialism.
	   In contrast, the slow speaking, and sometimes hesitant, Megawati
focused on Indonesia's crippling economic crisis, which has
inflicted 80 percent inflation, food shortages, widespread
unemployment and soaring poverty.
	   Pitching her speech at Indonesia's downtrodden, Megawati said
life for ordinary people is getting harder and harder as the
economic crisis drags on.
	   Promising to stand up for the poor, her voice wavered
emotionally when she spoke of hungry peasant families hit by
soaring inflation.
	   While she didn't directly criticize the country's current
president, B.J. Habibie, or his predecessor, Suharto, by name, she
demanded an end to corruption that has been endemic in the world's
fourth most populous nation.
	   ``Whoever violates the law and abuses human rights, they have to
be prosecuted according to the law,'' she said. ``If they are
ordinary people, higher ranking goverment officials or former
officials, they have to be accountable.''
	   ``Judges and prosecutors have to follow the people's wishes
otherwise there is no place for them anymore.''
	   Suharto is currently at the center of a corruption inquiry
ordered by Habibie. But many believe it won't amount to much.
	   ``I warn the power holders that Indonesia has lost its
credibility in the eyes of the world because sovereignty doesn't
really belong to the people,'' she said.
	   Given all the rioting and looting that has wracked other parts
of Indonesia this year, government officials and the military had
tried to ban the gathering on the tranquil resort island.
	   But only a few dozen police appeared near the field Thursday,
and there were no signs of violence in the crowd. Most people had
walked hours down streets closed to traffic to reach the field.

 &UR; Soft-spoken iconoclast writer is first Portuguese-language Nobel
winner

 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Saramago became the first writer in
Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature Thursday. His
personal delight was seconded by a burst of public elation in his
homeland.
	   Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish
Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of
Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on
Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula.
	   ``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the
Portuguese language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair,
speaking through an interpreter.
	   Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and
iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country and
he hoped winning the prize would make the Portugal and its language
``more visible and audible.''
	   ``I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my
country,'' he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he
was engulfed by well-wishers offering roses.
	   Back home, President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause
for ``great collective satisfaction.''
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the award was ``above all a
prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language'' which is spoken by
180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also in Portugal's
five former colonies in Africa.
	   Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have
frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public.
	   Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice,
describing Saramago as an ``old-school communist'' who had a
``substantially antireligious vision.''
	   Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so upset by one of
Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name from Portugal's
nominees for the European Literature Prize. At the time, Lara said
Saramago's 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (The
Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman
Catholic religious convictions and divided the country.
	   The book describes a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives
with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion.
	   ``I have not come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago,
an atheist, at the time. He retreated in disgust with his Spanish
wife, Pilar del Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary
Islands.
	   He has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary
prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people and trying to make friends,'' he once said.
	   A gaunt man with wisps of white hair, Saramago was born in
Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon.
	   From a poor family, he never finished university but continued
to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It
sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the
welder's shop to a literary magazine.
	   But for the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the
41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published
only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974.
	   Since the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling
contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more
than 20 languages.
	   He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical
fantasy ``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as
``Baltasar and Blimunda.''
	   It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores
the war between individuals and organized religion, picking up
Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against
authority.
	   He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel
Garcia Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable
settings but at the same time tinged with magical elements.
	   The Nobel citation praised his work that ``with parables
sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables
us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular
newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always
inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.
	   ``Blindness,'' his most recent book to be translated into
English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an
inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.
	   ``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of
rationality,'' he said. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave
rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''
	   In the 1989 ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon
proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on
the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors,
thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a
stroke of his pen.
	   Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks.
	   In his 1986 book, ``The Stone Raft,'' the Iberian Peninsula
snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off
into the North Atlantic _ apparently in a metaphorical search for
identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union,
of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic members.
	   Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize Dec. 10 in
Stockholm.

Venus out, Serena advances

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Venus Williams beaten by van Roost &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ Dominique van Roost upset
fifth-seeded Venus Williams 6-1, 6-2, but the younger Williams
sister, Serena, advanced at the Porsche Grand Prix on Thursday.
	   Van Roost, ranked No. 12 in the world and winner of four titles
this year, was a late, wild-card entry into the dlrs 450,000 indoor
tournament.
	   But she swept past the higher-ranked American, using an
aggressive game to stun the 18-year-old.
	   In the quarterfinals, van Roost will meet top-ranked Martina
Hingis, who would lose the No. 1 spot if she loses against the
Belgian.
	   Hingis is being chased by Lindsay Davenport, who next plays
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Serena Williams advanced when third-seeded Jana Novotna, the
Wimbledon champion, twisted her back and had to retire.
	   Novotna hurt her back at the end of the second set. She tried to
play on but quit three games later.
	   Williams was ahead 2-6, 6-3, 2-0 when Novotna retired.
	   ``It's an awful way to end it,'' Williams said. ``I wasn't
playing well in the first set but I got back into the match.''
	   Williams, 17, broke Novotna's serve to get a chance to serve for
the second set. She was up 40-15, holding two set points, when
Novotna winced in pain as she lunged for a shot.
	   She took an injury timeout to be treated, while Williams skipped
rope to keep warm.
	   ``I always have a rope in my bag,'' Williams said.
	   When Novotna returned, she saved one set point but lost the
next. She was treated again, but was unable to hold serve at the
start of the third set and quit after losing the next game as well.
	   Two other seeded players advanced to the quarterfinals of the
dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament.
	   No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat Amelie Mauresmo 6-3, 6-3, and
No. 7 Tauziat defeated Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 6-2.
	   Sandrine Testud beat Anke Huber 6-2, 4-6, 6-2.

Bruce Springsteen takes the stand in fight to block recordings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to INSERT name of man claiming the rights to the
songs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Bruce Springsteen may have had his face
simultaneously splashed on the covers of Time and Newsweek in 1975,
but in those days the Boss was flat broke.
	   While the U.S. newsweeklies were hailing him as the future of
rock 'n' roll, Springsteen, then in his mid-20s, was living
hand-to-mouth and depending on his managers for handouts.
	   The 49-year-old rock legend answered questions about the early
days of his career in a London courtroom Thursday as he tried to
block a British company from putting out a previously unreleased
collection of songs he recorded in the early '70s.
	   Springsteen recalled in court that he had successfully won
control of all his songs from his original manager, Mike Appel,
after a court battle in 1977. Before that, times were bleak, he
said.
	   ``All I know is that in 1976 a lot of money had come in ... and
I was on the cover of Time and Newsweek and I was broke,'' he
testified. ``The creative control of my life had been wrested away
from me.''
	   Masquerade is arguing that it has a legal right to the songs
because they were licensed to use them by Jim Cretecos, a member of
his former management team who is claiming he owns the rights, not
Springsteen.
	   Told by an attorney that the CD of his old songs is being
marketed in the United States under the title ``Before the Fame,''
Springsteen replied: ``To my knowledge, it is not being marketed in
the States. I understand it is being sold here and all over Europe,
and that is why I am taking action, as I do against all
bootleggers.''
	   The hearing is expected to continue into next week.

Serb hard-liner removed from office for threats against NATO
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SRECKO LATAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The top international
mediator for Bosnia removed a Bosnian Serb hard-liner from his team
for threatening retaliation against possible NATO air strikes in
neighboring Yugoslavia, officials said Thursday.
	   The mediator, Carlos Westendorp, also banned the
ultranationalist Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj
both from entering Bosnia and interfering with implementation of
the Dayton peace accord.
	   Some Western officials fear Serb repercussions if NATO launches
air strikes against Yugoslavia for its attacks on ethnic Albanians
in the province of Kosovo. They fear thousands of foreign soldiers
and officials working in Bosnia also could be targeted by
hard-liners.
	   A final decision on whether NATO will conduct air strikes is
expected in the next few days.
	   Earlier this week Westendorp removed Dragan Cavic, vice
president of the strongest Bosnian Serb hard-line party, after he
promised solidarity with Serbs in Yugoslavia and said any NATO
military action would endanger the 1995 peace accord that stopped
the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war.
	   Cavic, a leading member of the Serb Democratic Party, won a seat
last month in the parliament that governs the Serb-held half of
Bosnia.
	   Westendorp demanded that the newly elected president of the
Serb-held half of Bosnia, Nikola Poplasen, ban Seselj from entering
Bosnia or interfering with the peace process.
	   The letter is likely to be a test for Poplasen, who won the
presidency as the leader of an ultra-nationalist Bosnian Serb party
with close links with Seselj. Poplasen's election victory delivered
a blow to Western powers in Bosnia, who now are looking for ways to
sideline him or remove him from office.
	   Last week, Seselj warned that in case of airstrikes, NATO
soldiers would be targeted ``no matter where they are, if reachable
to us.''
	   In the letter to Poplasen, Westendorp said Seselj's comments
``are in violation of the peace process and elementary standards of
international law.
	   ``As the elected president of Republika Srpska, we would ask
that you inform Mr. Seselj that his presence on the territory of
Bosnia-Herzegovina is unacceptable and that his participation in
electoral matters remains banned,'' it said.

Dinamo head resigns amid allegations of cigarette smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The chairman of Bucharest's Dinamo
soccer club submitted his resignation Thursday after allegations
that he was involved in a huge cigarette smuggling case.
	   Petre Buduru, who works for the interior ministry, said he was
offering his resignation to avoid tarnishing the team's name. He
denied allegations that he was connected to a dlrs 1 million
cigarette smuggling scandal.
	   ``I have replied to every single one of the accusations made
against me,'' Buduru said by telephone. The club's board of
directors will decide on Monday whether to accept his resignation,
he said.
	   The interior ministry will study the allegations over the next
few weeks, a statement said, carried by national news agency
Rompres.
	   Col. Gheorghe Trutulescu, a state security officer on trial for
masterminding the smuggling operation, identified Buduru as one of
his partners.
	   Dinamo is is second place in the Romanian first division. The
club belongs to the interior ministry and Buduru has been chairman
since 1996.

PSG appoints ex-coach George to replace Giresse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain fired coach
Alain Giresse on Thursday and immediately announced that fomer boss
Artur George would take his place.
	   George, who is from Portugal, had a successful stint as PSG boss
between 1991 and 1994.
	   Giresse, a former French international, has had a disastrous run
since taking over PSG in May.
	   Despite attracting international stars like Nigeria's Jay-Jay
Okocha and Christian Woerns of Germany in pre-season, PSG has lost
four of eight league games this season, including defeats to
newly-promoted minnows Sochaux and Lorient.
	   PSG was also dumped out of the European Cup Winners' Cup by
Maccabi Haifa after two poor performances against the modest
Israeli outfit.
	   Newspaper reports had initially linked Fabio Capello, the former
coach at AC Milan and Real Madrid, with the PSG job.

Former World Cup slalom champ to compete for Grenada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Jamaica has its bobsled team, Grenada now
has its one-woman Alpine ski team.
	   Elfi Eder, the Austrian slalom star, has decided to compete for
Grenada after leaving the Austrian team in a dispute with the
country's skiing federation.
	   ``I want to become No. 1 again,'' said Eder, the 1996 World Cup
slalom champion and silver medalist at the 1994 Olympics in
Lillehammer.
	   Eder missed last winter's World Cup season and the Nagano
Olympics because of her dispute with the Austrian Ski Federation,
which objected to Eder's choice of a personal coach.
	   ``I had to find a new country so that I could continue doing my
job,'' Eder said. ``Otherwise, I would have had to give up my
sport.''
	   Eder suffered a knee injury in August and had to miss six weeks
of practice. She won't be ready for the start of the World Cup
season on Oct. 24 in Austria.
	   ``That's too early for me. I am concentrating on trying to
become fit in time for the November races,'' Eder told the Austrian
media this week.
	   Eder said her goal was to compete through the 2002 Olympics in
Salt Lake City.

 &UR; Eds: Updates with Ahtisaari calling for negotiated solution in
Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari called Thursday
for a negotiated end to the conflict in Yugoslavia's southern
province of Kosovo, a news agency reported.
	   It is ``very important that negotiations continue in this
direction,'' Ahtisaari said in St. Petersburg, where he is
attending a conference of major cities in the Baltic Sea region.
	   However, ``the world community cannot allow hundreds of
thousands of people to be made to leave their homes,'' the Interfax
news agency quoted him as saying, referring to the forcible
eviction of ethnic Albanians who live in Kosovo.
	   Besides attending the conference in Russia's second-largest
city, Ahtisaari also met with Leningrad Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev to
discuss economic cooperation, environment protection and transit
issues, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

Albanian says Serb troops crossed border, Albanian army mobilized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ About 30 Yugoslav troops crossed three
times into Albanian territory Thursday and opened fire on an
Albanian border post and some houses in the village of Dobrun, the
interior ministry said.
	   There were no casualties reported and no exchange of fire from
the Albanian side, officials here said.
	   Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said the Yugoslavs crossed about
50 meters over the border during the afternoon incident. He said
the Albanian army unit at Kukes was mobilized and sent to the area
but the Yugoslavs withdrew a final time and never returned.
	   Albanian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Yugoslavs were apparently pursuing Kosovo Liberation Army rebels,
who maintain sanctuaries on Albanian territory.

Venezuelan airline open Cuba offices, British airlines future
</HEADLINE>
possibility &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Venezuelan airline ALAS has opened its
first office in Cuba at Havana's new international airport,
increasing the communist country's ties with the rest of the world.
	   At the same time, the British government this week was expected
to sign an air transport agreement with Cuban officials to allow
British Airways to fly to the Caribbean island for the first time,
Cuba's Prensa Latina news agency said in a dispatch monitored here.
	   The air transport agreement was key on the agenda of Foreign
Office minister Baroness Symons of Britain, who arrived in Cuba on
Wednesday for a two-day visit.
	   The addition of a new airline is a major event in Cuba, which in
recent years has grown to depend on tourism as its main source of
income.
	   Cuba still is struggling to recover from an economic crisis that
started at the beginning of this decade when the former Soviet bloc
collapsed and the communist island lost its most important trade
partners.
	   Prensa Latina said ALAS officials traveled to Havana for the
Wednesday inauguration, which including the opening of a second
office Habana Libre, a leading Cuban hotel.
	   ALAS will work with the Cuban travel agency Rumbos to provide
trips from Cuba to Venezuela, the Amazons and other islands in the
Caribbean, it added.
	   ALAS began service to Havana on April 15, with five flights to
the Cuban capital weekly. It now transports about 3,500 people to
Cuba monthly, the Cuban news agency said.

Ukraine offers to mediate in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma offered his
country's help Thursday in mediating the Kosovo crisis, a news
agency reported.
	   ``The only way to defuse the crisis is to start peace talks
immediately and resolve all issues by political means,'' Kuchma
said, according to Interfax.
	   Ukraine, like neighboring Russia, opposes NATO airstrikes
against Serbia. Ukraine, Russia and Serbia are all Slavic countries
that share the Orthodox religion.
	   Kuchma said Ukraine was willing to mediate between Serbia and
Kosovo, Interfax said, without elaborating.

Spice Girls' former chauffeur remains barred from writing book
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls' secrets are safe for a little
while longer at least.
	   Paul Attridge, the group's former chauffeur, lost his bid
Thursday to overturn a gag order preventing him from disclosing
information about the pop group.
	   Members of the group were granted the order in June after a
newspaper story in which Attridge speculated about the reasons for
Ginger Spice Geri Halliwell's departure.
	   Attridge, 31, was ordered not to release any details about the
Spice Girls' love lives, business affairs or spending habits. But
he went to court to overturn the injunction so he could write a
tell-all book of ``tittle-tattle'' and trivia.
	   The Spice Girls and Halliwell, in turn, sought jail time for
Attridge for violating the gag order.
	   The High Court ruled Thursday that the injunction should stand
but that it was unnecessary to jail Attridge, who apologized for
his conduct and agreed to honor the gag order.
	   Attridge vowed after the ruling, however, that he would ``fight
on'' and write his book.

Chancellor-elect skirts contentious gasoline tax

 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with incoming government agrees on tax relief,
skirts energy tax rise. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's Social Democrats and Greens
agreed Thursday on a broad plan to cut income taxes, but left open
the details of a more contentious rise in energy taxes.
	   The deal, negotiated by party leaders of the new government
coalition in a tough round of talks, fulfills a key campaign pledge
by the Social Democrats to ease the tax burden on average wage
earners.
	   Party leaders said the plan calls for 10 billion marks (dlrs 6.2
billion) in tax relief over the next four years, with lost revenue
to be made up partly by closing tax loopholes for the well-off.
	   ``We'll swiftly push through a major tax reform,'' Social
Democratic party chairman Oskar Lafontaine told reporters after a
four-hour bargaining session.
	   But demands by the small Greens party for a sharp hike in the
price of gasoline and other fossil fuels _ an idea that unsettles
industry and many voters _ got fairly short shrift.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, who sits on the supervisory
board of Volkswagen, has offered to bump up gas prices by six
pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter. Anything more would hurt the auto
industry, he says.
	   Lafontaine said only that both sides in Thursday's talks
``agreed to tackle the ecological tax reform'' in the new
parliament's four-year term.
	   Details of the entire tax reform still need to be worked out,
Lafontaine and Greens co-chairman Juergen Trittin told reporters.
	   Schroeder left during the talks for Washington, where he meets
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday. He was accompanied by the
Greens' Joschka Fischer, Germany's likely next foreign minister.
	   Both parties have set fighting unemployment as their top goal.
But how they intend to finance job measures and other campaign
pledges _ such as a boost in aid to families with children _
remained unclear Thursday.
	   Schroeder has insisted he plans no major tax increases despite a
budget gap of more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 12.5 billion) he
says he is inheriting from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government.
	   In addition, both parties agreed Thursday that they want to
lower social security payments by employers as a way to boost the
economy and create jobs.
	   Hours before Thursday's talks, Trittin renewed his side's call
for a broad increase in the price of oil, natural gas and coal. The
Greens say that would promote conservation and help finance the
proposed cut in employers' non-wage costs.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats, regrouping after their stinging
election defeat, denied that their budget had left Schroeder with a
budget shortfall.
	   ``New holes are being fabricated in the coalition talks,
apparently as a discreet way to dump election promises,'' said
Wolfgang Schaeuble, who is in line to replace Kohl as party
chairman.
	   Coalition talks were to continue through next week, with Cabinet
posts announced at the end.

Agassi, Henman only seeds to reach quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECASTS, UPDATES with Agassi and Henman matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi and
sixth-seed Tim Henman survived the second round of the Swiss
Indoors on Thursday, becoming the only seeded players to escape
from early round devastation.
	   Fifth-seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov and defending champion Greg
Rusedski toppled out in their second round matches earlier in the
day, joining world No. 1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick
Rafter as early round casualties.
	   But Agassi, who won each of his four titles this year without
dropping a set, needed just 53 minutes to dispose of Ivo Heuberger,
breaking the Swiss qualifier twice in each set on way to a 6-2, 6-2
win and a place in the quarterfinals.
	   ``Beating a qualifier doesn't necessarily feel great but it
feels good to have two wins behind me,'' said Agassi, who cruised
through the first round with a 6-3, 6-2 win over 1998 Wimbledon
champion Roger Federer of Switzerland, ranked 396.
	   ``You just keep going to the next point and if the matches go
quickly, you just count your blessings.''
	   In an apocalyptic first round, the tournment's top three seeds
and the three Grand Slam champions present crashed out, leaving the
draw sadly diminished.
	   Tournament organisers watched in horror as Wimbledon champion
Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and Australian Open titlist Petr
Korda, seeded third, all exited the tournament within 24 hours of
each other.
	   ``It's difficult nowadays to count on the seeded players to win
all the time,'' said Agassi, who earned titles in Washington, Los
Angeles and San Jose and Scottsdale this season. ``It's a tough
field to start the indoors season with. You just have to try and
get through it.''
	   Agassi, who held the No. 1 ranking in the ATP back in April
1995, fell out of the top-100 at the end of 1997 for the first time
since he'd turned pro in 1985.
	   But after tearing through this season, Agassi has soared back up
to eighth place.
	   And now, the American has a chance to return to the top spot at
the end of the year.
	   While Agassi has no Grand Slam or Super-9 titles this season,
his 53-13 match record is the best on the ATP Tour this season in
match victories and winning percentage.
	   The American is currently fifth in the ``Road to Hannover''
standings, and a good result in Basel could cement his place among
the top-eight, securing him a berth in the World Championship next
month.
	   Ranked 11th in the world, Henman defeated Morocco's Hicham Arazi
6-4, 7-6 (7-4) to earn his place in the quarterfinals.
	   ``The standard of the men's is just so high,'' said Henman, who
needed three sets to beat Australia's Jason Stoltenberg, ranked 36,
in the opening round. ``You have to beware. Anyone in the top 50
can beat anyone else.
	   ``This tournament might turn out to be one of the strongest
events of the ye!je?-XQ`5- Rk2)4Pg

1996 French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov, ranked 10th in the

Rusedski 7-6 (7-4), 7-5.

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, Albright warns Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with KLA declaring cease-fire, Serb statements.
RECASTS and CHANGES byline; no pickup.
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday, putting more pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   Tensions between Milosevic and the United States, which is
pressing for NATO airstrikes against Serb-led troops, intensified
as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared Thursday in
Brussels that time was running out for the Yugoslav president to
comply with U.N. demands.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army in
Kosovo's capital Pristina said the rebel command ``has decided to
refrain from all military activity'' starting Friday.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Although the KLA has been driven from all but a few scattered
areas, the announcement is politically significant. Milosevic
launched his crackdown Feb. 28 after attacks by KLA rebels against
police and soldiers in the majority Albanian province.
	   He has insisted he needs to maintain a military and police
presence in the area to guard against further KLA attacks.
	   In the statement, the KLA said its guerrillas would defend
themselves if attacked. The rebels demanded international
monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even though there has been
no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   He considers the Kosovo rebels as ``terrorists and bandits,''
and any cease-fire on his part would legitimize them as a
negotiating partner, one of his associates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO officials on the
results of his three rounds of talks with Milosevic this week. He
was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for more talks.
	   Albright said Holbrooke would be delivering a message that the
time for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo was ``all but gone.''
She demanded full compliance with U.N. resolutions to end the
crackdown and said ``half measures'' would not be enough.
	   Before the rebels' cease-fire announcement, reporters heard
three or four bursts of mortar fire Thursday in the Malisevo area
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   But U.S. officials said there has been no significant military
activity in Kosovo in the past week.
	   Holbrooke was ordered to return amid further signs of opposition
within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic efforts.
	   At the White House Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
the United States would vote to authorize military strikes against
Serbia if Milosevic ``continues to defy the international
community.''
	   ``In the days ahead my counterparts in Europe will be making
similar decisions,'' the president said in a ceremony in the
Roosevelt Room.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic Thursday
en route to a London for a meeting of the major powers most deeply
involved in the negotiations. Russia strongly opposes using force
to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is expected to deliver that
message when he meets Albright in London.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, about 20 vehicles carrying
diplomats and their families from the United States, Britain and
Australia left Thursday for Budapest, Hungary. The diplomats will
remain there until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to
force Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   The United States says that Milosevic has not complied with U.N.
Security Council demands for a cease-fire, the partial withdrawal
of his troops, and the return of refugees to their villages.
	   Milosevic says he has fulfilled those demands and his spokesman
Ivica Dacic said Thursday that the threats of NATO strikes were a
``rapist act.''
	   Serbia's ultra-nationalist Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj warned
``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins.''
	   Indicating possible retaliatory strikes, Seselj warned
neighboring countries not to ``participate or help the aggressor
... (or) they will also be considered our enemy and would have to
face the consequences.'

Investigators seek to speed up recovery of Swissair wreckage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Still unsure why Swissair Flight 111 crashed into
the North Atlantic, investigators are summoning a heavy-lift barge
that will try to scoop up as much wreckage as possible before
winter storms scatter crucial evidence.
	   The chief investigator, Vic Gerden of Canada's Transportation
Safety Board, said Thursday his team needs to recover more
electrical components from the ocean floor in order to have a
reasonable chance of determining why smoke began seeping into the
cockpit 20 minutes before the Sept. 2 crash.
	   All 229 people aboard the New York-to-Geneva flight were killed
when the MD-11 crashed off the Nova Scotia coast.
	   Canadian and U.S. divers spent three weeks retrieving human
remains and debris. But that slow-moving and dangerous operation
was called off earlier this week after all the easily accessible
human remains were recovered.
	   Gerden said a heavy-lift industrial barge, the Sea Sorceress,
would move into the crash site this weekend and use its huge crane
to lift pieces of wreckage onto the deck of a companion barge.
	   ``The objective is to recover the remainder of the wreckage as
soon as possible,'' Gerden said. ``The weather is deteriorating,
and soon all operations will have to be suspended.''
	   So far, Gerden said, less than 10 percent of the plane has been
recovered.
	   Gerden said investigators continue to examine the plane's flight
data and cockpit voice recorders, which stopped working six minutes
before the crash.
	   The flight data recorder, in the last 90 seconds before it
stopped, showed a sequence of breakdowns and faults in about 40 of
the plane's systems, Gerden said.
	   ``The sequence could provide potentially important clues about
electronic components and power sources and help us reconstruct the
events happening aboard the aircraft,'' Gerden said.
	   But he said those clues would only reveal symptoms of the
problem that caused the crash, not the source. The definitive
answer, he said, probably will require recovery of wiring and other
electrical components.
	   Gerden said there was no indication of any problem handling the
plane until 90 seconds before the recorders stopped. During that
last span, he said, some of the instrument displays in the cockpit
malfunctioned.
	   Gerden declined to comment about a report Wednesday on ABC News,
giving new details about the plane's final minutes based on
information from the cockpit voice recorder. Canadian law prohibits
public release of the cockpit voice recorder's contents.
	   According to ABC, flight attendants were told to use flashlights
to clear meal trays as the pilots cut power to the passenger cabin
in an attempt to find the source of the smoke.
	   The crew had called a flight attendant into the cockpit and
asked if she smelled smoke in the cabin, and she said she could
not, according to ABC.
	   Within three minutes of first smelling something, the captain
said he could definitely see smoke. A minute later, the crew made
its first distress call to request a landing. The crew put on their
oxygen masks two minutes later.
	   Meanwhile, a flight attendant announced to passengers that the
plane would land in Halifax in 20 to 25 minutes, and the pilot
began an emergency checklist trying to isolate the source of smoke,
ABC said.
	   The first step was to turn off power to the cabin. Flight
attendants were told to use flashlights to pick up meal trays, then
reported that passengers were remaining relatively calm.
	   The identification of the victims has been slow because the
bodies were badly fragmented by the impact of the crash.
	   Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said
remains of 78 victims have been identified thus far _ including the
pilot and co-pilot whose remains were identified Wednesday through
DNA comparisons.
	   In all, experts have now recognized 204 distinct DNA patterns in
the human remains, but Butt said it may take several more months
before many of these patterns can be matched with DNA samples
provided by victims' relatives.

Romania and Hungary to form a military force to act in Balkans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Romanian Cabinet submitted to
Parliament on Thursday draft legislation to form a joint military
force with Hungary which could be used to help NATO bring stability
in the troubled Balkans.
	   The proposed 1,000-member battalion _ half Romanians and half
Hungarians _ would serve in peacekeeping missions or other crises,
the government said.
	   The official language will be English and the troops could be
used both by NATO and the European Union in specific missions.
	   Romanian officials declined to say if the force could be used in
a possible mission in Kosovo. Both Hungary and Romania border
Yugoslavia's territory.
	   The cabinet spokesman, Rasvan Popescu said Romania will respect
all the U.N. resolutions and its commitments as a member of the
NATO Partnership for Peace program.
	   The Supreme Council of the National Defense will meet Sunday to
consider Romania's response to the crisis in Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.

Palestinian fugitive gets life term for bombings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A military court on Thursday sentenced in
absentia a Palestinian to life imprisonment for carrying out
bombings in southern Lebanon, the official National News Agency
reported.
	   Ahmed Abdel-Karim al-Saadi, the leader of a fundamentalist Sunni
group, was accused of bombing ``religious sites'' and liquor stores
between 1994 and 1995, the news agency said. It did not elaborate.
	   A co-defendant, Palestinian Bilal Shreidi, was sentenced to five
years hard labor for the bombings and to one year for attempting to
kill Lebanese army soldiers, the news agency said.
	   Al-Saadi was sentenced to death last year, also in absentia, for
the 1995 assassination of a fundamentalist Muslim cleric in Beirut.
	   Three other co-defendants in the case were hanged in March.
	   Al-Saadi, also known as Abu Mohjen, is believed to be living in
the Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh in southern Lebanon.
	   The government exercises little control over the sprawling camp
on the outskirts of the port city of Sidon, and police and the army
are reluctant to enter for fear of causing heavy casualties in the
event of a gunfight.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Prodi later saying government will decide at last

 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ In a concession to his Communist allies, Italy's
premier said Thursday that conditions weren't ripe for NATO air
strikes against Yugoslavia, complicating efforts for an alliance
consensus on how to deal with the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' Premier Romano Prodi told the Chamber of
Deputies, where he was battling for political survival a day ahead
of a confidence vote.
	   Prodi said the U.N. Security Council should approve any strikes,
a doubtful prospect in the face of Russian opposition.
	   Later, Prodi appeared to backing off from any definite word now.
He was quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA as telling some
deputies from his coalition that the government ``reserves the
right'' to decide at the last minute whether to back an armed
intervention by NATO.

 &UR; Soft-spoken iconoclast writer is first Portuguese-language Nobel
winner
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with reaction in Portugal, CHANGES byline

 &UR; By BARRY HATTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Jose Saramago became the first writer in
Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday. His
personal delight was seconded by a burst of public elation in his
homeland.
	   Saramago, 75, and Portuguese said they were pleased the Swedish
Academy had finally acknowledged the literary contribution of
Portugal, a small country of 10 million people bordering Spain on
Europe's southwestern Iberian Peninsula.
	   ``It has taken all of this century to win a Nobel Prize for the
Portuguese language,'' Saramago said at the Frankfurt Book Fair,
speaking through an interpreter.
	   Saramago, a soft-spoken man known for his hard-edged and
iconoclastic views, said he shared the honor with his country and
he hoped winning the prize would make Portugal and its language
``more visible and audible.''
	   ``I'm personally very happy for myself. I'm also happy for my
country,'' he said at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany where he
was engulfed by well-wishers offering roses.
	   Back home, President Jorge Sampaio said the award was a cause
for ``great collective satisfaction.''
	   Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said the award was ``above all a
prize for Portugal and the Portuguese language'' which is spoken by
180 million worldwide, mostly in Brazil, but also in Portugal's
five former colonies in Africa.
	   Saramago's controversial opinions and atheistic outlook have
frequently clashed with the establishment and the general public.
	   Even on the day he won the prize, the Vatican newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano attacked the Swedish Academy's choice,
describing Saramago as an ``old-school communist'' who had a
``substantially antireligious vision.''
	   Undersecretary of State Sousa Lara was so upset by one of
Saramago's novels in 1992 that he withdrew his name from Portugal's
nominees for the European Literature Prize. At the time, Lara said
Saramago's 1991 novel ``O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (The
Gospel according to Jesus Christ) offended Portugal's Roman
Catholic religious convictions and divided the country.
	   The book describes a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives
with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of his crucifixion.
	   ``I have not come to bring peace but the sword,'' said Saramago,
an atheist, at the time. He retreated in disgust with his Spanish
wife, Pilar del Rio, to his home in Lanzarote in Spain's Canary
Islands.
	   He has never courted the kind of fame offered by literary
prizes, and his bluntness can sometimes offend.
	   ``I am skeptical, reserved, I don't gush, I don't go around
smiling, hugging people and trying to make friends,'' he once said.
	   A gaunt man with wisps of white hair, Saramago was born in
Azinhaga, a small town near Lisbon.
	   From a poor family, he never finished university but continued
to study part-time while supporting himself as a metalworker.
	   His first novel, published in 1947 _ ``Terra do Pecado,'' or
``Country of Sin'' _ was a tale of peasants in moral crisis. It
sold badly but won enough recognition to propel him from the
welder's shop to a literary magazine.
	   But for the next 18 years, Saramago, a communist who opposed the
41-year conservative dictatorship of Antonio Salazar, published
only a few travel and poetry books while he worked as a journalist.
	   He returned to fiction only after Salazar's regime was toppled
by a military uprising in 1974.
	   Since the 1980s, he has been one of Portugal's best-selling
contemporary writers and his works have been translated into more
than 20 languages.
	   He first won critical acclaim abroad with his 1982 historical
fantasy ``Memorial do Convento,'' published in English in 1988 as
``Baltasar and Blimunda.''
	   It is set during the Catholic-inspired inquisition and explores
the war between individuals and organized religion, picking up
Saramago's recurring theme of the loner struggling against
authority.
	   He is most frequently compared with Colombian writer Gabriel
Garcia Marquez because his prose is often rooted in recognizable
settings but at the same time tinged with magical elements.
	   The Nobel citation praised his work that ``with parables
sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables
us to apprehend an elusory reality.''
	   Saramago remains a prominent nonconformist through his regular
newspaper and radio commentaries, though his views are always
inspired by his deep concern for his fellow man.
	   ``Blindness,'' his most recent book to be translated into
English, is an unsettling allegory about the social meltdown as an
inexplicable blindness sweeps through society.
	   ``This blindness isn't a real blindness, it's a blindness of
rationality,'' he said. ``We're rational beings but we don't behave
rationally. If we did, there'd be no starvation in the world.''
	   In the 1989 ``The History of the Siege of Lisbon,'' a Lisbon
proofreader mischievously inserts the word ``not'' into a text on
the 12th century capture of the Portuguese capital from the Moors,
thereby fictionally altering the course of European history with a
stroke of his pen.
	   Such historical and literary mischief are Saramago trademarks.
	   In his 1986 book, ``The Stone Raft,'' the Iberian Peninsula
snaps off from the rest of the European continent and floats off
into the North Atlantic _ apparently in a metaphorical search for
identity away from the standardizing nature of the European Union,
of which Portugal and Spain are enthusiastic members.
	   Saramago will receive the dlrs 978,000 prize on Dec. 10 in
Stockholm.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A day after U.S. peacemakers praised
``a new spirit'' in the Middle East, Israeli troops shot and killed
a Palestinian rioter during clashes Thursday in the tensely divided
West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Fifteen Palestinian stone throwers were injured and a news
photographer on assignment for a foreign news agency was in serious
condition after he was shot in the back of the head with a rubber
coated bullet.
	   The violence, and assurances by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to hardliners in his coalition government that he will
not buckle under U.S. erfere or keep back rioters. Israeli troops fired rubber-coated
bullets at the crowds and injured Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse.
	   Doctors said Abu Alan, who was also shot in the arm, suffered a
skull fracture and was in serious condition. He was operated on for
three and a half hours and doctors said there was a slight chance
that he could be paralyzed.
	   The army's Hebron commander, Col. Yigal Sharon, said in a
statement that ``soldiers could not identify the injured
photographer among the rioters.'' He said the army regretted the
injury and hoped Abu Alan would recover.
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel filed an angry complaint
with the government and army over the incident and called for ``a
thorough investigation and disciplinary action as warranted along
with a guarantee the army will take steps to ensure there is no
indiscriminate shooting of journalists in the future.''
	   A 20-year-old Palestinian rioters was fatally struck in the head
by a rubber bullet. He was put on life support, but was removed
several hours later and declared dead. Afterwards, dozens of
relatives and friends carried his body, wrapped in a white sheet
and draped with Palestinian flags, to the morgue of nearby Alia
Hospital. The funeral was to be held Friday.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike called
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, to protest
Israel's eight-day blockade of the Palestinian areas and a curfew
placed on the 30,000 Palestinians still living under Israeli rule
there. Fatah called for further unrest Friday.
	   On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held
three-way talks with Netanyahu and Arafat and afterwards praised
the two Mideast leaders for finding ``a new spirit,'' and said she
hoped remaining issues could be resolved in the Oct. 15th
Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would
dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising fears among
Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would come under
intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to
topple the premier if he signs a deal to cede more West Bank land
to the Palestinians.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reportedly met with CIA director George
Tenet Thursday, in the region to help the sides reach a security
accord.
	   But the sides seemed unable to complete agreements over smaller
outstanding issues ahead of the Washington talks, meant to tackle
only larger disputes. Albright's envoy to the region, Dennis Ross,
failed to bring negotiators to agreement over a host of secondary
issues Thursday and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said they
would have to wait until next week to be resolved.

Germany wins show-jumping team competition

	   ROME (AP) _ Germany on Thursday won the team competition in the
show-jumping event at the World Equestrian Games in Rome.
	   France came in second, confirming its result in the 1994 Worlds
in The Hague, while Britain clinched the bronze.
	   Germany's Olympic champion Franke Sloothaak on chestnut San
Patrignano Joly led the powerful team, which had also dominated the
team show-jumping at the 1994 World Games in The Hague and in the
1996 Atlanta Olympics.
	   The Germans also featured Lars Nieberg on Loro Piana Esprit,
Markus Beerbaum on Lady Weingard and Ludger Beerbaum on Priamos.
	   Germany finished with 25.19 penalties, compared with to France's
37.36 and Britain's 38.57.
	   The U.S, team, which was third after Wednesday's test, finished
ninth.
	   ``We are very disappointed,'' said Marty Bauman, a spokesman for
the Americans. ``There's no explanation for what happened today, it
was one of those days.''
	   On the individual's side, Olympic silver medalist Willi
Mellinger of Switzerland took the lead of the provisional standings
on grey Calvaro V, followed by Sloothaak.
	   France's Thierry Pomel on Thor des Chaines was third.
	   With Thursday's test, 25 riders qualified for the next stage of
the event, which is to be held on Saturday.
	   The U.S. top rider was Alison Firestone, of Upperville,
Virginia, on Major. She placed eighth.
	   ``Alison has a chance'' in the individual, said Bauman.
	   Eric Hasbrouck of Badford, New York, also made it in the best
25, capturing the last spot. He rides bay Freestyle.
	   On Sunday, the individual show-jumping ends with a spectacular
final test where four finalists engage in a direct confrontation
mounting each other's horses.

Five new nonpermanent members elected to Security Council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Capping a campaign that featured an Aegean
cruise, a trip to the circus and lots of wining and dining, Canada
and the Netherlands beat out Greece on Thursday to join the
Security Council, the most powerful U.N. decision-making organ.
	   U.N. delegates selected the two countries, along with Malaysia,
Namibia and Argentina, as the five new nonpermanent members of the
15-member council, replacing Portugal, Sweden, Japan, Kenya and
Costa Rica, whose two-year rotating stints expire.
	   ``This is good for the Security Council and good for us,'' Dutch
Foreign Minister Jozias van Aartsen told Dutch TV after the vote.
	   The council, effectively the U.N. board of directors, has 10
nonpermanent seats and five permanent ones: the United States,
Britain, China, France and Russia. Every year, five of the
nonpermanent seats go up for election by a secret ballot before the
185-member General Assembly.
	   Malaysia, Namibia and Argentina went uncontested as candidates
for their regional groups.
	   The two seats slated for the regional group that encompasses
Western Europe, North America and other countries, however, were
contested by Canada, the Netherlands and Greece.
	   Their campaign raised some eyebrows over the summer after Greece
invited U.N. delegates for a weeklong Aegean cruise. Greece denied
the trip _ dubbed by some diplomats a ``blue water pitch'' to get
votes _ was related to the council bid.
	   Canada and the Netherlands also campaigned heavily, with the
former inviting delegates to a performance of Canada's ``Cirque du
Soleil'' and the latter staging its own moonlit cruise, albeit down
New York's East River.
	   Canada garnered 131 votes, the Netherlands 122, and Greece 87. A
two-thirds majority was required.
	   Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, who has been in town
for weeks campaigning, noted the ``unorthodox'' tactics used in the
council bid.
	   ``Usually in elections, where you're walking the streets, you
loose a little around the waistline,'' he told reporters, patting
his belly. ``This one I've managed to gain a few, simply by the
nature of U.N. campaigning.''
	   He pledged to use the seat to put forth the causes Canada has
recently championed, such as landmine eradication, ending
exploitation of women and children, and making the United Nations
more democratic.
	   Greek foreign ministry spokesman Theodoros Theodorou said that
Athens' failed bid showed that the 15-member body cannot be
considered truly representative.
	   ``The same countries always return periodically to the Security
Council and therefore the representative nature of the body is not
ensured,'' he said after congratulating the Netherlands and Canada
on winning.
	   He acknowledged that the victors had histories of supporting
U.N. development programs, which he said, worked in their favor.
	   Greece has only been on the council once before, in 1952-53.
Canada has held the seat five times, most recently in 1989-90, and
the Netherlands on four previous occasions, most recently 1983-84.
	   Canada and the Netherlands were believed to have had the best
shot at landing seats because of the dispute over Cyprus, the
Mediterranean island divided between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.
Having Greece on the council could further politicize the issue.
	   Others cited the prominent Dutch and Canadian presence on
peacekeeping forces and development programs as well as the
continued Dutch influence over its former colonies who voted
Thursday.

Tough new measures for violence on public transport

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced tough, new
measures to curb violence on public transport, hit by strikes for a
third day Thursday by conductors demanding protection from juvenile
crime.
	   The Socialist prime minister said the attitude of youths who
commit such crimes ``is absurd'' and ``self-destructive'' because
they hurt those who are serve them -- bus drivers and metro and
train conductors -- and ``this is not a game.''
	   ``These acts will be punished,'' Jospin said in an interview on
state-run television.
	   Jospin said that the penal code will be revised shortly to deal
more harshly with cases of violence toward transport workers. And
inspectors who currently check tickets will be able to verify
identities of passengers, Jospin said, adding that they would be
``aided by police officers.''
	   He also said that justice would be swift for suspected
offenders.
	   Trying to nip the strike before it spreads, Jospin pleaded to
parents to control their children and to public transport employees
not to ``overreact.''
	   More than one million commuters were stranded at train stations,
according to radio reports. Traffic jams stretched up to 30
kilometers (19 miles) outside Paris as drivers tried to beat the
strike, which left suburban rail services virtually paralyzed.

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim militants lobbed three
grenades at Indian security forces in troubled Kashmir on Thursday,
killing at least two soldiers and wounding another four, police
said.
	   Nine passersby were also injured in Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu-Kashmir state and the center of insurgency since 1989.
	   A few hours later, the rebels blew up a scooter outside local
government headquarters, wounding at least 12 people, police said.
	   The window panes of the state secretariat building and more than
a dozen nearby shops were shattered by the blast. Five of the
injured needed hospital treatment, police said.
	   Security forces cordoned off parts of Srinagar after the attacks
and carried out house-to-house searches for nearly five hours.
	   The rebels want Kashmir to become independent or join
neighboring Pakistan, an Islamic state. Kashmir is the only Muslim
majority state in predominantly Hindu India.
	   India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Muslim guerrillas.
Pakistan says it lends only moral support.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over
control of Kashmir, since each gained independence in 1947. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest.

Prosecutors want 10 years prison for woman accused of aiding
</HEADLINE>
terrorists &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors on Thursday asked the high
state court in Frankfurt to give 10 years prison to a woman accused
of helping terrorists in a 1977 Lufthansa airliner hijacking, in
which the pilot was killed.
	   Monika Haas, 50, is charged smuggling weapons and explosives
from Algiers to the Spanish island of Palma de Mallorca, where she
allegedly delivered them to the hijackers. Haas had special
interest in the group because she was once married to one of them,
prosecutors said.
	   Four hijackers, members of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, later used the weapons to hijack the Lufthansa jet on
Oct. 17, 1977 with 82 passengers on board.
	   After flying to Rome, the hijackers made stops across the
Mediterranean and North Africa. The pilot was killed in South
Yemen.
	   The final stop was Mogadishu, Somalia where German commandos
stormed the plane early on Oct. 18, 1977. One terrorist, Suhaila
Al-Sayeh, was severely wounded; her three male companions were
killed and the passengers and remaining crew rescued.
	   The hijackers had demanded dlrs 15 million and the release of
jailed members of Germany's leftist terrorist Red Army Faction,
responsible for the September 1977 kidnapping of Hanns-Martin
Schleyer, president of the German employers' federation.
	   After the raid, Schleyer's body was discovered and three Red
Army Faction leaders were found dead in their prison cells.
Authorities said the three had committed suicide.
	   Al-Sayeh, now known as Souhaila Andrawes, was arrested in Norway
in 1994. She had been released after a year in jail in Somalia.
Prosecutors said information she gave to Oslo police, along with
newly discovered East German secret police files, was the basis for
the charges against Haas.
	   However, Al-Sayeh refused to testify against Haas when she was
called to do so in July 1996.
	   Haas, the mother of three children, has denied ever being on
Palma de Mallorca. She was first arrested and freed again in 1992,
then charged in 1994. Her trial began in January 1996.
	   In March 1997, she was freed on her own recognizance to resume
work as a medical assistant, after the court determined there was
no reason to believe she would attempt to flee although she
remained on trial.
	   Closing arguments by the defense are expected on Oct. 19, after
which a verdict could also be read, or scheduled for a later
session.

	   BANYOLES, Spain (AP) _ Authorities said overloading may have
caused an excursion boat carrying some 140 French retirees to sink
Thursday, killing at least 20 people in a tranquil lake in
northeastern Spain.
	   ``Police are working on the theory that the boat was
overloaded,'' said a spokeswoman for the regional government's
rescue operation center in Barcelona.
	   The passengers were all French. Thirteen people drowned and
seven others died in local hospitals. Two people who purchased
tickets for the excursion were missing. It was not known whether
they boarded or not, said the spokeswoman, who in keeping with
custom, declined to be identified.
	   Xavier Pomes, a regional government delegate, said the boat was
only licensed to carry 80 people but he added that only a full
investigation would show whether overloading was the problem.
	   Pomes said the boat would not be brought up until Friday.
	   A total of 38 people were treated in hospital although by
evening time only 22 were being kept in, two in serious condition.
	   Eighty-one people, including the boat's Spanish captain,
survived the accident uninjured.
	   The boat company had sold 141 tickets for the excursion. So far
only 139 people, including the pilot, have been accounted for.
	   ``It's a miracle. I don't know how to swim,'' said one survivor,
identified only as Marie-Madeleine, who told French radio how her
husband saved her. ``I stopped breathing. I stayed a minute under
water and must have grabbed onto a bar before being pulled out of
the water.''
	   When the passengers realized the boat was in trouble many jumped
overboard and swam to shore. Many others were caught onboard having
being seated on the lower deck.
	   Police said the boat tried to turn back when the pilot realized
it had problems just 10 meters out. It sank just two meters from
shore.
	   ``We could see old people up to their necks in water shouting
for help and other people crying,'' an unidentified schoolgirl told
national television.
	   At nightfall, police underwater divers halted the search for
more bodies from the sunken electrically-powered catamaran craft.
	   Bodies covered in blankets lined the small pier at the lake in
the immediate aftermath of the accident. Some bodies were pulled
into small rowing boats.
	   The boat sank under clear skies and in calm waters as it set off
Thursday morning to circle Lake Banyoles, just north of Barcelona
and some 350 miles (565 kilometers) northeast of Madrid, the
Spanish capital.
	   The vessel, launched earlier this year, made 50 trips a day on
the lake, a spokesman for the La Carpa firm that owned it, said.
	   The passengers were all French retirees from the western coastal
area around the town of La Rochelle, 400 kilometers (250 miles)
southwest of Paris.
	   Lake Banyoles, two kilometers (1.5 miles) long and some 700
meters (765 yards) at its widest, is the largest natural lake in
the northeastern region of Catalonia and was used for several water
events in the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

Sudan cracks down on street food stalls to control diseases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Authorities have closed down nearly 1,500
food kiosks and put on trial more than 6,000 street vendors in a
crackdown aimed at preventing diseases through contaminated food,
an official said Thursday.
	   ``The situation has now been contained,'' Abdullah Sid-Ahmed,
the health minister of Khartoum state, said.
	   He said police accompanied by health officials have shut down
1,432 food, vegetables and fruits stalls in the state of Khartoum
since the crackdown began last Saturday.
	   A total of 6,128 people who were put on summary trials received
punishments ranging from verbal warning to fines and flogging,
Sid-Ahmed was quoted as saying by the state-run Omdurman Radio.
	   The crackdown is part of a wider campaign to combat water and
food borne diseases during the monsoon months of August, September
and October.
	   Every year up to 40 percent of Sudan's 25 million people come
down with malaria during the rainy season.
	   Sid-Ahmed said that 16 hospitals and 68 clinics in Khartoum have
``intensified their efforts for the treatment of malaria and
diarrhea.'' A slaughterhouse in northern Khartoum also was closed
down.
	   As a result, ``we have controlled the increase in malaria,
diarrhea and eye diseases,'' he said.
	   Low-flying planes have been spraying insecticides over vast
areas surrounding the capital following the spread of mosquitoes
and flies as a result of heavy rain and the flooding in the Nile.
	   This year's flood, the worst in decades, damaged tens of
thousands of homes and farms. Last month, officials reported
200,000 people were left homeless in eight states.

Athens race: mayor versus political machine

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ There are a few more trees in Athens, some
stretches of smooth sidewalk, a car-free shopping zone and one
quite comfortable mayor.
	   Dimitris Avramopoulos, a former diplomat now running city hall,
has built a wide base of support by doing what his predecessors
could not: appear to tame Greece's unruly capital.
	   Now there's another giant challenge. The powerful Socialist
party wants him out.
	   The outcome of the mayoral race _ part of nationwide municipal
elections on Sunday _ is being closely watched as a possible
bellwether for even bigger stakes in the future.
	   The expected Avramopoulos victory could be his final stepping
stone to a shot at the leadership of the main opposition New
Democracy party. New Democracy, which has been in power only three
of the past 17 years, is presently led by the less charismatic
Costas Caramanlis.
	   But an upset victory by challenger Maria Damanaki, of the
governing Socialist party, could prove a crippling blow to
Avramopoulos' image, turning him from potential savior to pariah
among conservatives.
	   ``In these four years, Athens has begun to regain its lost
appearance, to obtain an identity, to strengthen its international
authority, to undertake initiatives, to be more clean,''
Avramopoulos as he campaigned for a second four-year term under the
slogan ``The Battle for Athens.''
	   Ms. Damanaki, a well-known political activist, says Avramopoulos
is trying to turn Athens into ``Disneyland,'' and his politics lack
true depth.
	   Avramopoulos ignores ``the wounds of the capital,'' Ms. Damanaki
cried at a rally in central Athens.
	   Ms. Damanaki has canvassed far-flung neighborhoods and made
rounds of speeches. But she's yet to confront Avramopoulos face to
face.
	   The mayor has chosen to make no public campaign appearances and
has erected only a few banners. A massive sign in Athens' main
square promises to give the homeless the money saved by not
campaigning.
	   In the homestretch, Avramopoulos seems unstoppable. Some voter
polls give him a more than 3-to-1 edge over Ms. Damanaki, who first
emerged as the voice of the student uprising against the 1967-74
military dictatorship.
	   The poll figures also offer a possible lesson to other
politicians in Greece, where scant attention has been paid to
quality-of-life issues in the frenzy to modernize.
	   Athens has grown five-fold in the past 30 years _ mushrooming
from a cozy city around the Acropolis to a smog-choked metropolis
that is home to half the country's 10.2 million people.
	   Across the country in the 900 mayoral and 187 other local
government elections Sunday, the outcome will serve as a litmus
test for Premier Costas Simitis' harsh austerity policies aimed at
getting Greece into the European Union single currency group by
2001.
	   Conservatives have waged strong mayoral campaigns in key cities
such as Pireaus and could unseat Socialist incumbents.
	   But Simitis has weathered the brunt of anti-belt tightening
protests so far and the Socialists still seem capable of easily
winning national elections in 2000. This could set up a chance for
Avramopoulos to grab the opposition leadership and challenge the
Socialists in 2004, when Athens hosts the summer Olympic Games.
	   Avramopoulos refuses to publicly discuss his long-range
political goals, preferring instead to concentrate on pushing
visible changes.
	   He created a new flag for the city, hired municipal police with
bright uniforms, built nearly 20 water fountains, planted trees and
replaced nearly 95,000 square meters (342,000 square feet) of
sidewalk. A pedestrian shopping district opened this year and plans
are also under way to build garages to alleviate the city's chronic
traffic problems.
	   He has erected Europe's tallest Christmas ``tree'' _ actually
strings of lights attached to a pole _ and hosted hundreds of
cultural events.
	   But critics accuse him attempting to make cosmetic changes
without first dealing with the underlying problems of a city grown
too big too fast.
	   ``Surely the changes are impressive,'' said Athens historian
Sarantos Kargakos. ``They remind me of the ornaments we put on
graves in cemeteries ... the real Athens is sinking and this mayor
is preparing an appropriate funeral.''

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, Albright warns Milosevic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with KLA declaring cease-fire, Serb statements.
RECASTS and CHANGES byline; no pickup.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday, putting more pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   Tensions between Milosevic and the United States, which is
pressing for NATO airstrikes against Serb-led troops, intensified
as Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared Thursday in
Brussels that time was running out for the Yugoslav president to
comply with U.N. demands.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army in
Kosovo's capital Pristina said the rebel command ``has decided to
refrain from all military activity'' starting Friday.
	   Kosovo is a southern province of Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are
ethnic Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   Although the KLA has been driven from all but a few scattered
areas, the announcement is politically significant. Milosevic
launched his crackdown Feb. 28 after attacks by KLA rebels against
police and soldiers in the majority Albanian province.
	   He has insisted he needs to maintain a military and police
presence in the area to guard against further KLA attacks.
	   In the statement, the KLA said its guerrillas would defend
themselves if attacked. The rebels demanded international
monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even though there has been
no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   He considers the Kosovo rebels as ``terrorists and bandits,''
and any cease-fire on his part would legitimize them as a
negotiating partner, one of his associates said on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke briefed
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and NATO officials on the
results of his three rounds of talks with Milosevic this week. He
was told by Albright to return to Belgrade for more talks.
	   Albright said Holbrooke would be delivering a message that the
time for a diplomatic settlement in Kosovo was ``all but gone.''
She demanded full compliance with U.N. resolutions to end the
crackdown and said ``half measures'' would not be enough.
	   Before the rebels' cease-fire announcement, reporters heard
three or four bursts of mortar fire Thursday in the Malisevo area
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   But U.S. officials said there has been no significant military
activity in Kosovo in the past week.
	   Holbrooke was ordered to return amid further signs of opposition
within NATO to an attack without further diplomatic efforts.
	   At the White House Thursday, U.S. President Bill Clinton said
the United States would vote to authorize military strikes against
Serbia if Milosevic ``continues to defy the international
community.''
	   ``In the days ahead my counterparts in Europe will be making
similar decisions,'' the president said in a ceremony in the
Roosevelt Room.
	   Russia's foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, met Milosevic Thursday
en route to a London for a meeting of the major powers most deeply
involved in the negotiations. Russia strongly opposes using force
to resolve the crisis, and Ivanov is expected to deliver that
message when he meets Albright in London.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, about 20 vehicles carrying
diplomats and their families from the United States, Britain and
Australia left Thursday for Budapest, Hungary. The diplomats will
remain there until it becomes clearer whether NATO will strike to
force Milosevic to end his crackdown.
	   The United States says that Milosevic has not complied with U.N.
Security Council demands for a cease-fire, the partial withdrawal
of his troops, and the return of refugees to their villages.
	   Milosevic says he has fulfilled those demands and his spokesman
Ivica Dacic said Thursday that the threats of NATO strikes were a
``rapist act.''
	   Serbia's ultra-nationalist Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj warned
``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins.''
	   Indicating possible retaliatory strikes, Seselj warned
neighboring countries not to ``participate or help the aggressor
... (or) they will also be considered our enemy and would have to
face the consequences.'

Serb police harass director of ethnic Albanian center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police detained the director
of the ethnic Albanian information center in strife-torn Kosovo
province but released him unharmed after three hours, the center
reported Thursday.
	   Enver Maljoku, the director of Kosovo's Information Center which
is close to the province's ethnic leadership, was held for three
hours Wednesday night in a police station in the provincial capital
Pristina.
	   Maljoku's mobile telephone, press documentation and tapes were
confiscated. One of the interrogating policemen, dressed in
civilian clothes, openly threatened Maljoku's family, the Center
said.
	   The latest incident came amid increasing pressure on ethnic
Albanian journalists reporting in Kosovo. Some have already ceased
working and left the province.
	   Maljoku, a former journalist himself, has been working as the
Center's director since its founding in 1993.
	   He was attacked in July this year when unidentified gumen shot
at him entering his home one evening. The bullets hit a wooden
fence in front of Maljoku's house.

crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin predicted Thursday
that France would for the most part be spared ill effects of the
international financial crisis because the ``bases for growth are
solid.''
	   But he proposed the launch of a ``big European loan'' to support
Europe-wide growth.
	   ``The storm and the hail falls on lots of regions of the world,
but not directly on Europe today,'' the Socialist prime minister
said in a television interview.
	   Europe ``is a space and a region better protected than its
neighbors.''
	   Jospin said that the current crisis proves ``that liberal
(economic) ideas are dangerous in an era of globalization.''
Globalization, he said, must be regulated, notably by national
policies that support growth and European decisions ``turned more
toward growth.''
	   He said the recent victory of Germany's Gerhard Schroeder made
possible a common European policy of growth.

Arena likely to be offered U.S. national team job

 &UR; EDS: Subs 12th graf to add statement from Arena. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ D.C. United coach Bruce Arena is the leading
candidate for the U.S. national team job and likely will be offered
the position after the Major League Soccer championship game, U.S.
federation secretary general Hank Steinbrecher said Thursday.
	   ``We will not do anything during MLS,'' Steinbrecher said from
the USSF's Chicago headquarters. ``Bruce is certainly the leading
candidate with Carlos Queiroz having pulled out.
	   ``After the (MLS) Cup, we'll approach Bruce perhaps about
coaching our team. We intend to continue our discussions with
Bruce. I expect an offer will come at the end of MLS.''
	   The MLS Cup is scheduled for Oct. 25 in the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, California, but the United States has friendly against
Australia Nov. 6 in San Jose, California.
	   Steinbrecher said he wasn't sure who would coach the U.S. team
for the Australia match.
	   ``We don't know yet,'' Steinbrecher said. ``If Bruce takes the
job, we believe everything can be worked out. If not, a
player-coach or an assistant coach will take the team.''
	   Arena repeatedly has refused to comment on media reports and did
so again Thursday, issuing a statement through the club's media
relations department.
	   ``At the current time I do not wish to make any comments
concerning any speculation about my future,'' Arena said. ``I have
a job and that is coaching D.C. United. I am pleased for all the
interest that is being shown about our sport. I would appreciate if
the entire subject could be dropped until the appropriate time.''
	   D.C. United finished off the Miami Fusion on Sunday in their
first-round playoff series and begins its best-of-3 Eastern
Conference semifinal series against the Columbus Crew on Sunday.
	   Arena and Queiroz, the former Portuguese national team and
current United Arab Emirates coach, were the leading candidates for
the U.S. job. Earlier this week, USSF president Bob Contigulia was
to fly to the United Arab Emirates to meet with Queiroz for an
interview, but reportedly was told by Queiroz not to come if he
didn't have an offer in hand.
	   Steinbrecher said he spoke to Arena earlier this week.
	   ``In general, we had conversations about philosophy, what the
job is, what direction the national teams and the federation are
going in,'' said Steinbrecher, who said he would prefer a long-term
contract through the next World Cup.
	   D.C. United general manager Kevin Payne has said he wants Arena,
who has coached the club to MLS' first two league titles, through
the Interamerican Cup, scheduled for Nov. 14 and Dec. 5.
	   The Interamerican Cup pits the CONCACAF club champion, D.C.
United, against the South American Copa Libertadores champion,
Brazil's Vasco da Gama, and a victory would be a major credibility
boost for both United and the three-year-old MLS.
	   Both sides have said they were willing to compromise to allow
Arena to coach both the U.S. team and D.C. United through the end
of the Interamerican Cup.
	   ``We won't do anything until the playoffs are over,''
Steinbrecher said. ``This is the day the MLS needs to shine. We're
not going to do anything to take away from that.''

PSG fires Giresse, reappoints Jorge as coach
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Changes headline, corrects spelling of Jorge, recasts
throughout &HT;    PARIS (AP) _ Fed up with a run of disastrous results, the owners
of French soccer giant Paris Saint-Germain fired coach Alain
Giresse on Thursday, and immediately appointed former coach Artur
Jorge to take his place.

<TEXT>
	   Jorge, who is Portuguese, had a successful stint as PSG boss
between 1991 and 1994.
	   He will take over the reigns again at the Parc des Princes on
Monday, announced club president Charles Bietry.
	   Giresse, a former French international, has had a poor run of
results since taking over PSG in May.
	   Despite attracting international stars like Nigeria's Jay-Jay
Okocha and Christian Woerns of Germany in pre-season, PSG has lost
four of eight league games this season, including defeats to
newly-promoted minnows Sochaux and Lorient.
	   PSG currently lies in 12th place in the standings, nine points
behind leader Bordeaux.
	   It was also dumped out of the European Cup Winners' Cup by
Maccabi Haifa after two poor performances against the modest
Israeli outfit.
	   During Giresse's final game, at home to Lens on Sunday, captain
Marco Simone missed a penalty and PSG conceded a late goal to lose
1-0.
	   Italian Fabio Capello confirmed that he met with PSG bosses
about the post, but newspaper reports Thursday said that the club
balked at the wage demands of the former AC Milan and Real Madrid
coach.
	   Jorge, 52, is currently coach of Vitesse Arnhem, which lies
second in the Dutch league behind Feyernoord.
	   Until last year, he was Portuguese national coach, but quit
after failing to qualify for the World Cup finals.
	   Previously, Jorge was in charge of Matra Racing, FC Porto,
Benfica and the Swiss national team.
	   Under Jorge, PSG won the French Cup in 1993 and French
championship in 1994.
	   Giresse, who starred as a player for France in the 1982 and 1986
World Cups, arrived at PSG from Toulouse, where he won promotion to
the French first division is his first season

Tarantino wins men's sabre, Flessel women's epee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Luigi
Tarantino of Italy claimed the men's sabre title Thursday at the
world fencing championships.
	   In the meantime, Laura Flessel was busy proving that epee was a
French event, claiming the women's title just 24 hours after Hugues
Obry won the men's.
	   A silver medallist at last year's worlds in Capetown, the
25-year-old Tarantino beat out his compatriot Raffaello Caserata
15-10 to take the crown, after slashing his way into the final with
a 15-10 semifinal win over Russia's Sergei Kharikov.
	   Caserata settled for silver while Kharikov and Fernando Medina
of Spain shared the bronze.
	   Russia's Stanislav Pozdniakov failed to defend his title, the
Olympic champion squarely losing 15-10 in the quarterfinals to
Medina.
	   Flessel, second in the World Cup rankings, easily defeated
Germany's Denise Holzcamp 15-8 for the title.
	   In fact, the 26-year-old fairly flew through the medal rounds,
beating Cuba's Tamara Estery-Almeida 15-9 in the quarterfinals and
Hungary's Hajnalka Toth by the same score in the semis.
	   Toth shared third-place with her compatriot Gyoengyi Szalay, the
bronze medallist in Atlanta and at last year's worlds.
	   Szalay was beaten 15-8 in her semifinal against Holzcamp.
	   Competition continues Friday with the finals of the men's team
foil event and the women's individual foil.

For first time, foreigners able to buy condos in Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: figures in U.S. dollars. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ For the first time ever, foreign tourists will be
able to buy condominiums and time-share units along Cuba's beaches
as a part of dlrs 250-million Canadian-Cuban joint venture unveiled
Thursday.
	   The project, backed by Cuba's communist government, calls for
construction of 2,000 luxury units over the next 10 years and is
one of the biggest outside investments yet in Cuba's tourism
industry.
	   At least in the short term, U.S. citizens won't be among those
buying into the new resorts. Under the longstanding U.S. trade
embargo, Americans generally aren't allowed to spend money in Cuba.
	   But other foreigners have no such constraints. Cuban and
Canadian executives expect Western Europeans and Canadians to snap
up the new units, including condos starting at dlrs 200,000 and
time-share units starting at dlrs 5,000 for annual one-week stays.
	   The project is a joint venture between Cuba's top hotel company,
Gran Caribe Hotel Corp., and a Canadian-based real estate
development company called Cuban Canadian Resorts International.
	   Executives of the two companies were joined at a news conference
Thursday in Toronto by Eduardo de la Vega, Cuba's vice minister for
tourism.
	   He said tourist visits to Cuba have mushroomed from less than
350,000 in 1990 to more than 1.2 million last year. Canada provided
the most visitors _ 170,000 _ followed by Italy, Germany, Spain and
France.
	   The joint venture, called Cuban Club Resorts, is headed by David
McMillan, a former chairman of the Hotel Association of Canada.
	   He said planning for the project began five years ago, and
included careful research into whether there would be any impact
from the Helms-Burton law or other U.S. legislation aimed at
discouraging foreign investment in Cuba.
	   McMillan said there would be no effect from Helms-Burton because
the beachfront property in question was not confiscated by Fidel
Castro's government from any American owners and thus was not
subject to any U.S. legal claims.
	   As for the possibility of American customers for the joint
venture, McMillan said, ``We wouldn't encourage anyone to break the
law.''
	   Documents released at the new conference suggested that there
will a shortage of high-quality hotel rooms for tourists in Cuba
even if the U.S. embargo remains in place.
	   ``It is almost impossible to predict the growth that will occur
when the embargo softens to allow tourism,'' one brochure said.
	   Initially, Cuban Club resorts plans to build luxury resorts at
four locations _ Santa Maria del Mar, Santa Lucia, Varadero and
Cayo Coco.
	   The first one will be at Santa Maria del Mar, 11 miles (18
kilometers) east of Havana. Construction is to begin in March,
McMillan said.
	   Canada, a staunch opponent of the U.S. trade embargo, has become
one of Cuba's biggest trading partners, with annual two-way trade
exceeding dlrs 700 million. The new project is one of more than 30
joint ventures involving the two countries.

Russian official: IMF remains `wary,' holds off on loans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Primakov holding talks with Chubais. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is already factoring into its
fourth-quarter budget dlrs 2.4 billion in international loans,
despite signs that lenders are reluctant to hand over the money,
the finance minister said Thursday.
	   Mikhail Zadornov also said the budget to go to parliament next
week forecasts another sharp drop in the ruble rate, which has
plummeted since the currency was devalued in August.
	   Zadornov and other Russian officials tried and failed to win a
new loan installment from the International Monetary Fund during a
visit to Washington this week. Zadornov said the IMF won't issue
the funds until Russia takes a definitive stab at overcoming its
current troubles.
	   The Russian government has yet to finalize a plan to tackle the
economic crisis _ even though the country desperately needs the
foreign aid to help pay its many debts. Wage and pension arrears
sparked a day of nationwide protests Wednesday.
	   The talks in Washington showed that lenders' attitude to Russia
is ``very wary,'' Zadornov said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``They expect practical steps first,'' he said. ``If these steps
help to stabilize the situation and are based on free-market
instruments, then they will receive understanding and support.''
	   The IMF helped arrange a dlrs 22.6 billion international loan
package for Russia in July, but had disbursed only dlrs 4.7 billion
before the crisis hit in August and froze further installments.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met Thursday with Anatoly
Chubais, who was in charge of negotiations with international
lenders under the previous government.
	   Chubais said they discussed the government's efforts to obtain
the IMF money, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Zadornov said he and the IMF discussed the fourth-quarter budget
in detail and focused on one that includes dlrs 2.4 billion in
as-yet-undisbursed loans. Without that money, Russia would have to
print money to cover its shortfalls, which the IMF has strongly
opposed.
	   The budget will foresee a ruble rate of 20 to 23 to the dollar,
or 4.3 to 5 cents. That was much lower than Thursday's rate, which
fell slightly to 16.2 to the dollar, or about 6.2 cents, from 15.8
to the dollar Wednesday, or 6.3 cents.
	   The government said Thursday it would send a draft
fourth-quarter budget to parliament on Oct. 14 or 15. It said it
would announce an economic program before Oct. 20.
	   The only sign of a crisis-attacking plan from Primakov's
government so far has been a draft published by the Russian media
last week that called for a number of Soviet-style administrative
controls. Primakov, however, insists he supports continued market
reforms.
	   Primakov met Thursday with Anatoly Chubais, who was in charge of
negotiations with international lenders in the previous Russian
government.
	   ``We must draw lessons from (Wednesday's protests), since the
people have mostly been driven by the dissatisfaction with economic
conditions,'' Primakov said.
	   The Cabinet discussed a plan to reduce the debts of Russian
companies, which have piled up in recent years to a staggering 1.2
trillion rubles (dlrs 75 billion), or about 40 percent of the
country's gross domestic product, Russian media said.

Santos claims ugly, costly victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ It was a victory that barely offset
Santos' losses.
	   In Wednesday night's 1-0 victory over Rosario Central in the
first leg of of the Copa CONMEBOL final, the Brazilians blew a
penalty kick and a chance to put the Argentines in a deep hole
heading into the decisive second-leg game in Rosario on Oct. 21.
	   And that's not counting the loss of all-star forward Viola,
defender Jean and coach Emerson Leao, all expelled from the
fight-filled match.
	   The Argentines also took losses _ forwards Bustos Montoya,
Marcelo Carracedo and Dario Scotto were red-carded and will sit out
the deciding game. But a 1-0 decision wasn't a bad result for the
visitors, who can win the tournament with a victory at home by a
two-goal margin.
	   ``Central got off cheap,'' read the headlines Thursday in
various Argentine dailies.
	   Almost everything was ugly about the game, starting with the
cold, rainy weather that settled over Vila Belmiro stadium.
	   The game wasn't 10 minutes old when Central's defender
Maximiliano Cuberas collided with Santos goalkeeper Zetti. In the
argument that followed, Viola and Scotto argued and were expelled.
	   Many of the 15,000 fans hurled umbrellas at Scotto, who
responded with obscene gestures.
	   Santos got the worse of the exchange of red cards. Viola is the
team's top scorer, and his league-leading 14 goals are one reason
Santos is in second place in the Brazilian national championship.
	   Claudiomiro got the only goal on a header in the 28th minute.
The visitors never threatened Zetti's net, but the Brazilians
failed to capitalize on numerous scoring chances.
	   In the midfield, Santos' Narciso and Central's Christian
Danielle spent the game exchanging words and even blows. When
Narciso bumped Javier Capelletti, Santos' Jean stepped in to
separate the two and was surprised with a red card.
	   Narciso then blew a chance to widen the lead by missing a
penalty kick in the 73rd minute.
	   Uruguayan Jose Luis da Rosa had a difficult evening, but at
least his challenged calls went both ways. The Brazilian press
noted that he failed to whistle a penalty against Santos' Marcos
Basilio but also wrongly called back a legitimate goal by Santos
forward Adiel.
	   Still, Brazilian media recalled that sparks often fly when South
America's soccer archrivals get together.
	   ``It was a battle worthy of the worst moments of the rivalry
between Brazilians and Argentines,'' said the Rio daily Lance.

One of biggest tax delinquents agrees to pay taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Russia's biggest tax delinquents, the
natural gas monopoly Gazprom, has agreed to pay its September taxes
within days, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   ``There are only purely technical issues to be settled, and in
the next few days, we will announce the exact figure,'' Gazprom
chairman Rem Vyakhirev told reporters during a break in a meeting
with the head of the State Tax Service, Georgy Boos.
	   Gazprom has long maintained that the government's unpaid gas
bill is as big, if not bigger, than Gazprom's unpaid taxes.
	   The Russian government's chronic failure to collect taxes from
both companies and individuals is one of the main reasons for its
cash shortage.

Kosovo Albanian militants declare cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Serb comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday.
	   A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army said the
rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military activity''
starting Friday. The statement was delivered to Albanian-language
media in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
	   The KLA said they retain the right to defend themselves if
attacked and demand international monitoring of the cease-fire.
	   The statement puts additional pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, whose troops have been fighting the
secessionists since Feb. 28, leaving hundreds of people killed and
tens of thousands homeless in the southern Serbian province.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown because of rebel attacks on
police and soldiers and has so far refused to accept U.N. demands
for a formal cease-fire. The government claims it needs a strong
police and military presence in the province to guard against
future attacks.
	   But a member of the Serb-led information ministry in Kosovo,
Bosko Drobnjak, welcomed the announcement.
	   ``It would be good if it were true,'' he said. ``A cease-fire is
something that we've wished for a long time. Yugoslavia has
fulfilled all the requirements of the international community and
armed actions by the Serb side have long ceased. Of course, our
forces will respond when and if they are attacked.''
	   Despite international pressure and NATO threats, Milosevic has
so far refused to openly declare a cease-fire even though there has
been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past week.
	   The KLA said that it declared the cease-fire ``to respect the
engagement of the international community to end the civilian
tragedy in Kosovo and to fulfill the demands from the U.N.
resolution of September 24.''
	   NATO has threatened to intervene against the Serb-led forces in
Kosovo if Milosevic refuses to comply to all points of the
resolution, including the partial withdrawal of his troops from
Kosovo and allow free access to humanitarian and aid organizations
to the displaced people.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials welcomed the KLA
cease-fire.
	   ``Any attack ... against Yugoslav forces, makes our job more
difficult,'' said one NATO official on condition of anonymity. ``We
welcome it.''

Iraq hints Turkey may suffer if threats against Syria go on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq hinted Thursday that it could deprive
Turkey of business deals if it persists in threatening Syria in a
military dispute.
	   A statement issued after a Cabinet meeting chaired by President
Saddam Hussein said ``threats and warnings'' were not the way to
solve problems between neighbors, the official Iraqi News Agency
said.
	   INA said the Cabinet made it clear that Turkey's relations with
Syria will affect its ties with other countries _ a veiled threat
that Ankara may loose its commercial deals with Baghdad under the
oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   The deal allows Iraq to get around U.N. economic sanctions for
buying millions of dollars worth food, medicines and other
humanitarian goods with money earned by U.N.-supervised oil sales.
	   INA quoted the Cabinet statement as saying that Turkish
statements on Syria are ``irresponsible and rash.''
	   Turkey accuses Syria of hosting Turkish Kurd rebels and has said
it is prepared to take military action if Syria does not dismantle
the rebel bases. Syria denies helping the rebels
	   Despite their long enmity, Iraq has reason to side with Syria:
Turkish troops often cross into northern Iraq in pursuit of Kurdish
rebels who use the area as a springboard for attacks on targets
inside Turkey.
	   Iraq and Syria have been traditional rivals because they were
ruled by rival factions of the Baath Party. In the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war, Syria supported Iran and shut down a vital Iraqi oil
pipeline in its territory.
	   Syria also contributed troops to the U.S.-led multinational
military coalition that ejected Iraqi troops from Kuwait in 1991.
	   But relations began to mend recently with growing business ties.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A former U.N. arms inspector for Iraq has
demanded his onetime boss retract statements that he broke the law
by speaking out to the media about Iraq's weapons capabilities.
	   The lawyer for the former inspector, Scott Ritter, said in a
letter that the claims by the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler, could be considered defamatory, even though Ritter may be a
public figure.
	   ``If you wish to avoid assuming personal liability, we require
your prompt retraction of your accusation,'' the lawyer wrote to
Butler.
	   Butler has received the letter and is considering it, spokesman
Ewen Buchanan said.

Researchers determine ancient temperatures of Earth

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Earth has warmed about 2 degrees
Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) in the last five centuries after
shivering through thousands of years of a chill that reached as low
as 41 degrees below the average (minus 40 degrees Celsius), say
researchers who took the planet's temperature through hundreds of
drill holes.
	   Separate research teams, using different sites and slightly
different methods, were able for the first time to put specific
temperatures on the climate changes that have affected Earth over
50,000 years. Both groups found evidence of warming under way for
centuries, a trend likely linked to industrial pollution.
	   The Earth seems to have developed a fever over the last 500
years, said Henry Pollack of the University of Michigan, leader of
a team that took temperature readings from 358 bore holes drilled
in Europe, North America, Australia and South Africa.
	   ``We found that the average global temperature has increased by
about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (one degree Celsius) over the last
five centuries,'' said Pollack. ``About half of that warming has
occurred since 1900.''
	   And about 80 percent has occurred since 1750, the start of the
industrial age and the large-scale burning of fossil fuels, Pollack
said. Such burning puts into the atmosphere huge amounts of
greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide. It is widely believed that
an excess of greenhouse gases is causing the Earth to warm, and
Pollack said his findings support the theory.
	   ``Our results ... are fully consistent with the conclusion that
human activity is a significant driving force behind global
warming,'' Pollack said.
	   Another research team, which included G.D. Clow of the U.S.
Geological Survey, took readings in bore holes drilled into ice in
Greenland and Antarctica and detected temperature changes over
thousands of years.
	   Clow's group determined temperatures during the last major ice
age, during a brief period of warming in medieval times and during
a more recent warming trend.
	   In the readings that overlap between the two methods, the two
groups' findings agree.
	   Both teams determined ancient temperatures by lowering
thermometers far beneath the surface. Deep levels of ice or earth
preserve the thermal record of the past ages, and the deeper
readings are taken, the older the temperature.
	   On Greenland, Clow's team could sample temperatures from 50,000
years ago with readings from the bottom of a 10,000-foot-deep ice
bore hole. The team then measured temperatures at several points
along the shaft, each representing a different era.
	   Similar readings were taken in Antarctica, although the results
go back only about 4,000 years, Clow said.
	   Temperatures during the last major ice age, about 22,000 years
ago, were about 41 degrees colder than current average surface
temperature at the Greenland drill site, said Clow, or about minus
65 degrees F (minus 54 degrees Celsius).
	   About 22,000 years ago, ice mountains thousands of feet high
covered Canada and swept down as far south as Wisconsin, Clow said.
	   His team found evidence from about 1,200 years ago of what is
known as the medieval warm period, when average temperatures rose
by about two degrees (one degree Celsius), or enough to grow lush
forests in Greenland and to encourage Vikings to settle there.
	   ``It soon cooled off, though, and everybody there probably
starved,'' said Clow. ``The Little Ice Age started about 700 years
ago and lasted about 150 years.''
	   During that time, temperatures dropped almost two degrees (one
degree Celsius) below average, or about 4 degrees (two degrees
Celsius) below the average for the medieval warm period. That was
enough to send sea ice much farther south, blocking some Viking
ocean routes.
	   There followed a gradual warming that peaked in the 1930s, said
Clow, but Greenland remains cooler than it was during the medieval
warm period.
	   In Antarctica, readings that go back 4,000 years show a gradual
warming, said Clow. ``It has been warming pretty constantly for the
last 1,000 years,'' he said. ``It is warmer there now than it has
ever been in the last 4,000 years.''

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A day after U.S. peacemakers praised
``a new spirit'' in the Middle East, Israeli troops shot and killed
a Palestinian rioter during clashes Thursday in the tensely divided
West Bank city of Hebron.
	   Fifteen Palestinian stone throwers were injured and a news
photographer on assignment for a foreign news agency was in serious
condition after he was shot in the back of the head with a rubber
coated bullet.
	   The violence, and assurances by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to hardliners in his coalition government that he will
not buckle under U.S. pressure at next week's peace summit,
hampered optimism that the sides were close to ending 18 months of
deadlock.
	   The violence in Hebron erupted early Thursday, when dozens of
Palestinians approached Israeli-manned checkpoints and threw chunks
of rock at soldiers guarding small Jewish enclaves in the
Israeli-run sector of the divided city. Palestinian police did not
interfere or keep back rioters. Israeli troops fired rubber-coated
bullets at the crowds and injured Hussam Abu Alan, a photographer
on assignment for the Agence France Presse.
	   Doctors said Abu Alan, who was also shot in the arm, suffered a
skull fracture and was in serious condition. He was operated on for
three and a half hours and doctors said there was a slight chance
that he could be paralyzed.
	   The army's Hebron commander, Col. Yigal Sharon, said in a
statement that ``soldiers could not identify the injured
photographer among the rioters.'' He said the army regretted the
injury and hoped Abu Alan would recover.
	   The Foreign Press Association in Israel filed an angry complaint
with the government and army over the incident and called for ``a
thorough investigation and disciplinary action as warranted along
with a guarantee the army will take steps to ensure there is no
indiscriminate shooting of journalists in the future.''
	   A 20-year-old Palestinian rioters was fatally struck in the head
by a rubber bullet. He was put on life support, but was removed
several hours later and declared dead. Afterwards, dozens of
relatives and friends carried his body, wrapped in a white sheet
and draped with Palestinian flags, to the morgue of nearby Alia
Hospital. The funeral was to be held Friday.
	   Throughout Hebron, Palestinians observed a general strike called
by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, to protest
Israel's eight-day blockade of the Palestinian areas and a curfew
placed on the 30,000 Palestinians still living under Israeli rule
there. Fatah called for further unrest Friday.
	   On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held
three-way talks with Netanyahu and Arafat and afterwards praised
the two Mideast leaders for finding ``a new spirit,'' and said she
hoped remaining issues could be resolved in the Oct. 15th
Washington summit. U.S. President Bill Clinton said he would
dedicate considerable time to the negotiations, raising fears among
Israel's far-right politicians that Netanyahu would come under
intense U.S. pressure to make concessions.
	   Right-wing members of Netanyahu's government have threatened to
topple the premier if he signs a deal to cede more West Bank land
to the Palestinians.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli pullback from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a blueprint for a
Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants. Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai reportedly met with CIA director George
Tenet Thursday, in the region to help the sides reach a security
accord.
	   But the sides seemed unable to complete agreements over smaller
outstanding issues ahead of the Washington talks, meant to tackle
only larger disputes. Albright's envoy to the region, Dennis Ross,
failed to bring negotiators to agreement over a host of secondary
issues Thursday and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said they
would have to wait until next week to be resolved.

Latvian parliament puts off controversial language bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ The Latvian Parliament on Thursday postponed
for a second time consideration of a controversial bill to
strengthen the use of the Latvian language.
	   The issue is a sore point with Latvia's large ethnic Russian
community, many of whom went to Russian-language schools and lived
in Russian-speaking communities and have little or no grasp of
Latvian.
	   Because of the huge numbers of Russians who moved to Latvia when
it was part of the Soviet Union, ethnic Latvians make up little
more than half of the country's population and they often worry
that their culture is endangered.
	   The move to postpone the bill came just five days after a
national referendum in which Latvians narrowly approved
liberalizing naturalization laws to lower some of the obstacles to
ethnic Russians becoming citizens. Hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Russians in Latvia became stateless with the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991.
	   The move to soften the naturalization laws was seen as a
significant step toward integrating the Russians and in turning
down the heat in a long-running dispute with the Kremlin.
	   Consideration of the bill in the Saeima parliament was delayed
because it contains contradictory provisions, the Baltic News
Service quoted education, science and culture committee head
Dzintars Abikis as saying.
	   Among the clauses being debated are one calling for Latvian to
be the only language used in state and municipal schools and one
calling for Latvian to be used in public demonstrations and
rallies, BNS said.

NATO faces struggle to rally all 16 behind air strikes

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO was struggling Thursday for a
common stand on whether the alliance could legally order airstrikes
against Yugoslavia without a new Security Council resolution --
which Russia has vowed to veto.
	   Member nations were searching for a legal basis that would be
palatable for all 16 members. But Italy already cast doubt on the
assertions of NATO Secretary General Javier Solana and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that no new U.N. resolution
was necessary.
	   While insisting that the conditions were not ripe for a military
strike, Italy's Premier Romano Prodi said that intervention will
have to ``be legitimized'' by the council.
	   ``We do not believe that the chances of a political solution
have been exhausted,'' Prodi told the Chamber of Deputies in Rome.
	   Germany is in the midst of a governmental and parliamentary
transition and has strict procedures about meeting the
constitutional demands for such an operation.
	   The Greens party, which is about to enter the national
government, argued publicly Thursday about conditions for NATO
strikes in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   ``We want to keep NATO from giving itself a mandate,'' Greens
defense expert Angelika Beer said. She insisted on a clear U.N.
mandate for German warplanes to take part in any airstrikes.
	   Portugal currently has a minority government and also could face
similar legislative problems before falling into line.
	   Greece and Spain have also shown hesitation over the past few
days but now appeared to be on board, backing the idea no new U.N.
decision was needed.
	   The NATO Council, the political body of the alliance, started
discussing a common ``legal basis'' for airstrikes but would need
at least need a few more days before coming to an agreement, a NATO
official, who demanded anonymity, said.
	   Albright, Solana, special U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and
Supreme Allied Commander Wesley K. Clark were all in Brussels to
assess the chances of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Albright also wanted to rally all allies for the cause. ``I
believe it is time for the allies to move to the next phase of
decision-making,'' she said.
	   NATO military officials have repeatedly said it is ready to
launch an airstrike as soon as it gets the green light. In the
meantime the alliance kept looking Thursday for signs that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic was prepared to meet U.N. demands for
peace in the province.
	   ``This is a period in which we are still assessing compliance,
and President Milosevic is obviously making up his mind whether he
is going to fully comply,'' Clark said.
	   NATO has been preparing plans for months to launch airstrikes
and is now awaiting member approval to put them into operation.
	   ``All plans are still ready to go,'' said Clark.
	   Solana has stressed the alliance did not need the backing from
the United Nations to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia and had
enough legal backing for such an operation.

Iran says it will help to resolve Turkey-Syria dispute

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Iran promised Thursday to do its best to
help resolve a military dispute between Turkey and Syria, warning
that an escalation of the crisis could harm the Islamic world.
	   Turkish leaders accuse Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
carry out cross-border attacks into Turkey. Syria denies the
accusation, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has raised fears of a
regional conflict.
	   Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, met in Damascus on
Thursday with Syria's President Hafez Assad for more than an hour,
the presidential spokesman said.
	   Syrian officials said Kharrazi is expected to fly to Turkey on
Friday.
	   Iran is mediating in its capacity as the current head of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 55-member group that
includes both Syria and Turkey.
	   ``OIC can play an important role in solving the present crisis
and tension between Damascus and Ankara,'' Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa told reporters. He added that Syria is ready,
along with Iran, to find a solution.
	   On Wednesday, Turkey's Parliament issued an ultimatum to Syria,
demanding that it expel Turkish Kurdish rebels from its territory
or ``face the consequences.'' It did not spell out what actions it
might take.
	   Talking to reporters after his meeting with Assad, Kharrazi said
``expanding the crisis would not be in the interest of the region
and the Islamic world.''
	   ``Iran would exert all efforts to eliminate tension between
Damascus and Ankara through diplomatic and peaceful means,'' he
said.
	   The Turkish newspaper Yeniyuzyil reported Thursday that Ankara
was prepared to stage limited attacks against alleged rebel camps
if Syria did not honor its ultimatum within 10 days.
	   Turkey's Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit told the private NTV
television Thursday that the government has taken no decision on a
deadline. But ``it is obvious that we can not wait for a long
time,'' he said.
	   ``In the meantime, we will step up diplomatic efforts with Arab
and Muslim countries to explain Syria's attitude, which is not
linked with humanity and Islam,'' Ecevit said.
	   Meanwhile, the Hurriyet newspaper said Turkey had given Syria 45
days to prove that it has ended its support for the rebels.
	   In Cairo, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk urged
Syria Thursday to ``take seriously'' Ankara's concerns. He also
called on Turkey to show restraint.
	   On Tuesday, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak shuttled between
Syria and Turkey in an attempt to reduce tensions.
	   Turkey also asys the rebels have training camps in Lebanon near
its border with Syria. Turkish news reports have speculated that
Ankara could attack alleged the bases in Lebanon's
Syrian-controlled eastern Bekaa Valley.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from
a meeting of the six nation Contact Group warning of ''grave
consequences'' if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does not
end the ''humanitarian crisis'' in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply
with the Security Council resolution he will be responsible for the
consequences, and they will be grave,'' Cook said after a meeting
of foreign ministers form the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.	   
	   He also told Milosevic not to underestimate the ''united
resolve'' to force him to abide by the U.N. resolution passed last
month calling for him to halt the Serb offensive against ethnic
Albanians.

	   ''If he was looking for rescue from any members of contact
group, he did not get it tonight,'' Cook said.
	   The meeting was requested by the Americans in a bid to
consolidate support for NATO air strikes. While Britain and the
United States strongly back military action, international support
is lukewarm. Russia, in particular, has been the most critical,
warning that NATO action would lead to further bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Earlier Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that ''time is all but
gone'' and NATO stood ready to take a decisive step. She said that
Russia's objections would not affect NATO taking action.
	   But in another bow to a diplomatic resolution, Albright also
ordered senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to return to the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for additional talks with Milosevic.

	   The Americans and the British contend that Milosevic has failed
to meet U.N. demands to withdraw troops from Kosovo, a southern
province of Yugoslav. Last week, international monitors reported
the discovery of further massacres against Albanian civilians.
	   Those discoveries led to strong condemnation and an increase in
international pressure for Milosevic to withdraw his military
police from the province.
	   But despite pressure to declare a ceasefire, Milosevic has
refused, although there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during
the past week.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes.
	   On Thursday, ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence
declared a unilateral cease-fire Thursday. A statement distributed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army from Kosovo's capital of Pristina
said the rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military
activity'' starting Friday.

Shell under siege in Nigeria can't guarantee flow of crude

longer guarantee flow of crude from southern Nigeria; ADDS quotes,

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Caught in the middle of worsening ethnic
tensions in southern Nigeria, Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell said
Thursday it could no longer guarantee the flow of crude oil from
that region after mobs seized its facilities.
	   For several days, angry ethnic Ijaw protesters have been
attacking Shell sites in the oil-rich Niger River delta region,
trying to use Nigeria's dependence on petroleum exports as leverage
to force the government to pay attention to its grievances.
	   Ijaw tribal leaders are angry at Nigeria's military government
for allegedly siding with a rival group in the same region.
	   Fifteen oil flow stations belonging to Shell's Nigerian joint
venture have been affected by the ethnic strife.
	   ``Armed youths on October 4 ordered the closure of the flow
stations in protest against the March 1997 relocation of the
headquarters of the Warri southwest local government council.''
Shell said in a statement issued in the commercial capital of
Lagos.
	   Ijaw leader Frank Umare told reporters in the delta district of
Warri on Thursday the attacks will continue until the military
junta creates a new local government council only for Ijaws with a
headquarters in the Ijaw town of Ogbe-Ijoh.
	   Umare accused the junta of siding with the rival Itsekiri group
by relocating the Warri council from Ogbe-Ijoh to an Itsekiri
village.
	   Victim of the tribal dispute, Shell says it has issued a notice
to its crude buyers that it cannot guarantee availability of crude
because of ``the shutdown of 378,000 barrels of crude production
from 15 flow stations.''
	   On Wednesday, armed protesters seized two helicopters belonging
to Shell Petroleum Development Company _ Shell's Nigerian joint
venture _ and took control of an oil rig.
	   The demonstrators also seized a nearby oil rig belonging to a
foreign contractor working for Shell.
	   In an earlier statement, Shell announced the immediate
evacuation of all its staff from the area.
	   Relay stations and terminals are important links in Nigeria's
oil industry and are used to pump oil into holding tanks, where it
is stored for export.
	   Ethnic groups often try to hold foreign oil firms hostage to
amplify their disputes with other groups and the federal military
government.
	   Although rich in oil, the Niger River delta states are among the
poorest and most neglected in Nigeria.
	   Basic infrastructure in towns and villages is often provided by
foreign oil companies operating in the area, because the government
has failed to provide paved roads, electricity and clean water.
	   The youths, many from the Ijaw ethnic group, say they do not
want to participate in voter registration for next year's
presidential elections which began Monday throughout the country.
	   They also insist that the government release the results of an
inquiry into bloody confrontations last year between two rival
ethnic groups.

 &UR; British Foreign Secretary Cook warns Milosevic of grave
consequences
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs; ADDS additional Albright comments; edits
throughout  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from
a meeting of the six nation Contact Group warning of ''grave
consequences'' if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic does not
end the ''humanitarian crisis'' in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo
that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply with the Security Council
resolution he will be responsible for the consequences, and they
will be grave,'' Cook said after a meeting of foreign ministers
from the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and Italy.
	   He also told Milosevic not to underestimate the ''united
resolve'' to force him to abide by the U.N. resolution passed last
month calling for a halt to the Serb offensive against ethnic
Albanians.
	   ''If he was looking for rescue from any members of contact
group, he did not get it tonight,'' Cook said.
	   The Contact Group meeting was requested by the Americans in a
bid to consolidate support for NATO air strikes. While Britain and
the United States strongly back military action, international
support is lukewarm. Russia, in particular, has been the most
critical, warning that NATO action would lead to further bloodshed
in Kosovo.
	   ''Time is running out. The humanitarian situation has not
improved. There has to be some action,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said after the meeting. While she left open ''a
chance'' for a diplomatic solution, Albright said NATO stood ready
to take action. She said that Russia's objections would not affect
NATO involvement.
	   But in another bow to a diplomatic resolution, Albright also
ordered senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to return to the
Yugoslav capital of Belgrade for additional talks with Milosevic.
	   The Americans and the British contend that Milosevic has failed
to meet U.N. demands to withdraw troops from Kosovo, a southern
province of Yugoslav. Last week, international monitors reported
the discovery of further massacres against Albanian civilians.
	   Those discoveries led to strong condemnation and an increase in
international pressure for Milosevic to withdraw his military
police from the province.
	   But despite pressure to declare a ceasefire, Milosevic has
refused, although there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during
the past week.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes.
	   On Thursday, ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence
declared a unilateral cease-fire Thursday. A statement distributed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army from Kosovo's capital of Pristina
said the rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military
activity'' starting Friday. (mb)

Bill to give homosexual couples new rights awaits passionate
</HEADLINE>
debate &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday sought to
calm debate on a potentially explosive bill to give homosexuals and
unmarried couples legal status -- a move opponents fear will
undermine the family and lead to adoptions by gay couples.
	   ``If there were not so much passion, I think we would have
advanced with much less trouble,'' Jospin said on the eve of debate
on the bill by French lawmakers. ``Opponents are creating problems
where there are none.''
	   ``Marriage is an institution ... and will remain so,'' he
assured in an interview on state-run television. ``Adoption (by
homosexuals) is forbidden and will remain so.''
	   Homosexual couples will still be forbidden to have progeny via
artificial procreation, Jospin said.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact is sponsored by Jospin's
Socialist camp which has a large majority in the 577-seat National
Assembly. It is likely to be tripped up only by time, with numerous
amendments, but unlikely not to become law.
	   Known as PACS, it provides fiscal and social advantages to
homosexual couples and unwed heterosexual couples. It reaches the
National Assembly after a decade of lobbying by homosexual groups
and heated debate over the issue.
	   Religious leaders -- Roman Catholic, Jewish and Muslim -- have
spoken out against the proposed law, along with most rightist
politicians and various associations in favor of the family or
against abortion.
	   They all fear such a law would blur lines and diminish marriage
by giving the state's blessing to all sorts of unions.
	   Various lifestyles ``should not become, via the law, social
references,'' Catholic bishops have said, calling the bill
``useless and dangerous.''
	   ``Marriage isn't a simple contract or a private affair, but
constitutes one of the fundamental structures of society,
maintaining its coherence,'' the bishops said.
	   For Jospin, the bill simply ``takes into account the evolution
of society.''
	   Today, in France, some 4.4 million heterosexual couples live
together outside marriage. There is no known figure for homosexual
couples.
	   The bill is aimed at resolving fiscal, social and inheritance
problems for those groups.
	   Among other things, it would allow those subscribing to the
Civil Solidarity Pact to file joint tax returns, diminishing the
tax burden; bequeath more money to the partner through a lightening
of the inheritance tax load; and provide all the benefits of
married people at the work place. That includes allowing for the
same vacation time and time off for both in moments of bereavement.
	   It also would allow a homosexual to benefit from his partner's
social security coverage, already the case for heterosexual
concubines.
	   Any two unrelated people, even friends, can enter a PACS union,
which can be ended at will, by marriage or death.

Slovak opposition declares unity in bid to form government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Leaders of all four opposition
parties formally declared unity Thursday in their efforts to form
Slovakia's government for the next four years.
	   The show of cooperation came just days after the alliance showed
signs of rupturing over the temporary refusal of the Party of the
Democratic Left to work with the Hungarian Coalition Party.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, the chairman of the largest opposition party,
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said some differences must still
be solved, although he did not specify what they were.
	   ``There is will that all four parties should participate in the
government,'' he said.
	   Meeting at roundtable discussions, the leaders established two
committees designed to lay the groundwork for their leadership in
the new Parliament, in which they will hold 93 of 150 seats.
Parliament convenes Oct. 29, and the party leaders said they hope
to officially form the new government before municipal elections
Nov. 13-14.
	   Despite the declaration of unity, the leader of the Party of the
Democratic Left, Jozef Migas, said a final decision on whether to
join with the ethnic Hungarian party in the new government will be
made at the party's congress.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia, which was the top vote-getting party in last month's
elections despite losing to the combined opposition forces, asked
for the post of parliament chairman.
	   ``We will create conditions for the opposition, as they are
common in the democratic world,'' Dzurinda responded.
	   The leaders said decisions on specific government posts have not
been made.

Congolese rebels turn empty town into rear base for key battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Minor editing throughout, CLARIFIES that ousted businessman,
not Kabila, has joined the rebels. New to some points. &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ When Congolese rebels marched into Kalima
last week, they found a ghost town of stone houses and a small
alley lined with crumbling red brick villas dating back to the
former Belgian colonial rulers.
	   It seems as though time has stopped in this former tin-mining
town, where hardly anyone or anything moves in the scorching sun,
and the only sound is the twittering of birds.
	   Most of the 10,000 residents, fearing for their lives, fled with
Congolese government troops 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest to
Kindu, where a battle is raging for control of a strategic air
base. Both sides claim to be winning that battle.
	   In his two-month war with the rebels, President Laurent Kabila
has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counter-offensive
against rebel-held towns in eastern Congo.
	   The rebels see Kindu as the prize in their campaign to topple
Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and
warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   And now the rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, mutinous
Congolese soldiers and Rwandan officers _ are using Kalima as a
rear base to direct supplies to their 2,000 comrades fighting for
Kindu.
	   Before 1996, Kalima was a major tin-producing center.
Electricity came from a power plant 15 kilometers (9 miles) away,
and the tin was shipped by truck over a tarmac road southeast to
Bukavu on the southern tip of Lake Kivu.
	   Income from tin built a high school and a large hospital in
Kalima, but both have been closed for two years.
	   Tin production stopped in late 1996 when Rwandan-backed rebels
under Kabila's command launched an eight-month rebellion that
ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   When he took power in May 1997, Kabila awarded the mining
concessions to Victor Ngezayo, a local businessman.
	   Less than a year later, Kabila scrapped the contract and chased
Ngezayo out of Kalima. Ngezayo has now sided with the new rebels,
hoping to win back his mining business.
	   Villas that used to be home to the owners and managers of the
mines and smelter now house rebels.
	   Tangles of green creepers wind through the red brick houses
built for Belgian colonial administrators as the jungle damp slowly
eats away at the foundations. The doors are locked, but the windows
are broken.
	   On the verandah of a large, hilltop villa, commander Richard
Mondo, barefoot and dressed in a flourescent green sleeveless shirt
and khaki army trousers, listens to instructions on a field radio
about the arrival of another aircraft carrying food and munition
from the rebel stronghold in Goma.
	   Spindly 11-year-olds and ragtag former Congolese soldiers, a
sort of impromptu squad that guards Mondo, have also camped out
among the leather armchairs, fragile glasstop tables and weapons
and ammuniton littered across the marble floor.
	   Barechested fighters kill time playing darts on the verandah. A
boy soldier watches satellite TV inside the cool living room. He is
dwarfed by his assault rifle that leans against the wall.
	   Only a few residents were on hand to greet the rebels who
trudged 240 kilometers (150 miles) through thick tropical forest to
capture the town with little difficulty Saturday.
	   Government soldiers, reportedly reinforced by Sudanese troops,
had commandeered all the vehicles in town and shipped supplies and
ammunition to Kindu.

Top police official convicted of fraud in Italian kidnapping
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A paramilitary police general was convicted Thursday
of fraud in connection with an industrialist's kidnapping and
sentenced to three years and four months in prison.
	   The involvement of Carabinieri Gen. Francesco Delfino in the
eight-month-long abduction of Giuseppe Soffiantini, an ailing
businessman from northern Italy, was one of several recent chapters
of murky handling of kidnappings.
	   In March, a month after Soffiantini was released, the
industrialist's son told police that another son had given a
billion lire (dlrs 600,000) to the general via a family friend. The
money was allegedly demanded to ease the way for the
industrialist's release.
	   But prosecutors accused Delfino of pocketing the money himself.
The general denied the charge, contending that the money found in a
search of the general's assets was cash put aside to pay for a
villa.
	   Soffiantini was released after relatives paid some dlrs 3
million, reports said.
	   The court in Brescia, northern Italy, rejected prosecutors'
demands that Delfino be convicted of a stiffer charge, extortion.
	   In August, a Sardinian prosecutor committed suicide in his
office after being questioned about allegations he and two others
extorted one billion lire (dlrs 600,000) from the family of a young
mother who was abducted in Sardinia.

Astronomers detect faintest, most distant object ever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The faintest and most distant objects ever
sighted _ galaxies of stars more than 12 billion light years away _
have been detected by an infrared camera on the Hubble Space
Telescope.
	   The sighting penetrates for the first time to within about one
billion light years of the very beginning of the universe,
astronomers said, and shows that even at that very early time there
already were galaxies with huge families of stars.
	   ``This is new territory,'' said Lisa Storrie-Lombardi, an
astronomer the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena. ``We didn't
really know what we would see.''
	   ``We are seeing farther than ever before,'' said Rodger I.
Thompson, a University of Arizona astronomer and the principle
researcher in the study. ``We have not reached the edge (of the
universe), but we have made a step into a new area.''
	   Thompson and his team focused an infrared instrument on the
Hubble on a narrow patch of the sky that had been previously
photographed in visible light. The instrument detected about 100
galaxies that were not seen in the visible light and 10 of these
were at extreme distance.
	   He said the galaxies are seen as they were when the universe was
only about five percent of its present age. Astronomers generally
believe the universe began with a massive explosion, called the
``big bang'', that occurred about 13 billion years ago.
	   Since the big bang, astronomers believe that galaxies are moving
rapidly away from each other, spreading out and becoming more
distant. For this reason, distance and time can be measured
together. Light from the distant objects traveled for about 12
billion years before being detected by Hubble.
	   Infrared radiation cannot be seen by the eye, but it is the most
common type of light from distant galaxies. For this reason, said
Thompson, the infrared instrument could detect galaxies that were
invisible to earlier Hubble studies.
	   Thompson said that a more advanced space telescope, now in the
planning stages by NASA, will be needed to absolutely confirm the
distance and age of these faint objects.
	   ``We can see the objects clearly, but we can't get their age for
sure,'' said Thompson.
	   ``This is an exciting first step into this distant universe,''
said Alan Dressler, a Carnegie astronomer who was not a member of
the observing team. ``We're looking for zero (a time before stars
and galaxies had formed) and we haven't found it yet.''

India criticizes Pakistan for claiming to represent Kashmiri
</HEADLINE>
people &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India on Thursday sharply criticized a
reported Pakistani statement that Islamabad would negotiate on
behalf of the Kashmiri people during next week's talks between the
two countries on security and the Kashmir dispute.
	   The diplomatic sparring comes before foreign secretaries' level
talks scheduled to be held in the Pakistani capital Oct.15-18, the
first talks for a year.
	   A statement by the Indian external affairs ministry in New Delhi
said: ``The state of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India
and a part of the territory is under the illegal and forcible
occupation of Pakistan.''
	   India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest. The
neighbors have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, in 50
years.
	   On Thursday, Indian newspapers quoted the top bureaucrat of the
Pakistan foreign ministry as saying that Pakistan would negotiate
on behalf of the Kashmiri people at the forthcoming talks and that
the Kashmiri people will at a later stage be involved in these
talks.
	   The Indian foreign ministry accused Pakistan of abetting
terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir where Muslim rebels have been
fighting an insurgency war since 1989.
	   Pakistan says it lends only moral support to Muslim guerrillas.
	   International pressure has mounted on the two neighbors to talk
since they conducted nuclear tests in May. The tests brought
worldwide condemnation and economic sanctions.

 &UR; British Foreign Secretary Cook warns Milosevic of grave
consequences
 &UR; Eds: ADDS byline; SHORTENS lead; Edits and tightens throughout &QL; 
 &UR; BY MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from
a meeting of the six-nation Contact Group on Thursday warning of
``grave consequences'' if Yugoslavia does not end the
``humanitarian crisis'' in Kosovo that has claimed hundreds of
lives.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply
with the Security Council resolution he will be responsible for the
consequences, and they will be grave,'' Cook said after a meeting
of foreign ministers from the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   He also told Milosevic not to underestimate the ''united
resolve'' to force him to abide by the U.N. resolution passed last
month demanding a halt to the Serb offensive against ethnic
Albanians in the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   ''If he was looking for rescue from any members of contact
group, he did not get it tonight,'' Cook said.
	   The Contact Group meeting was requested by the Americans in a
bid to consolidate support for NATO air strikes. While Britain and
the United States strongly back military action against the Serbs,
international support is lukewarm. Russia, in particular, has been
the most critical, warning that NATO action would lead to further
bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   ''Time is running out. The humanitarian situation has not
improved. There has to be some action,'' U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said after the meeting. While she left open ''a
chance'' for a diplomatic solution, Albright said NATO stood ready
to take action. She said that Russia's objections would not affect
NATO involvement.
	   However, the statement agreed to by the Contact Group only
called on Milosevic to meet the U.N. resolution, and didn't mention
the threat of military action.
	   In another bow to a diplomatic resolution, Albright also ordered
senior U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to return to the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade for additional talks with Milosevic.
	   The Americans and the British contend that Milosevic has failed
to meet U.N. demands to withdraw troops from Kosovo. Last week,
international monitors reported the discovery of further massacres
against Albanian civilians.
	   Those discoveries led to strong condemnation and an increase in
international pressure for Milosevic to withdraw his military
police from the province.
	   But despite pressure to declare a ceasefire, Milosevic has
refused, although there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during
the past week.
	   Serbs began cracking down in February on Albanian separatists
who are fighting for independence from Serbia, the dominant
republic in Yugoslavia. Since then, hundreds of people have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 have been driven from their homes.
	   On Thursday, ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence
declared a unilateral cease-fire Thursday. A statement distributed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army from Kosovo's capital of Pristina
said the rebel command ``has decided to refrain from all military
activity'' starting Friday. (mb)

Family of murdered Jamaican boy not allowed to come to Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Had Randal Dooley been Swedish, most of his
relatives would have had no trouble attending his funeral in
Toronto this weekend.
	   The 7-year-old Jamaican boy died two weeks ago and his
stepmother has been charged with second-degree murder in his
beating death. Police allege the boy was beaten relentlessly during
his few short months in Toronto.
	   But only his Jamaican mother _ and none of his aunts or uncles _
have been allowed to travel to Canada to attend the Saturday
funeral because of Canadian immigration policies.
	   It's a stance that's dismayed many observers.
	   ``All I want is for the federal government and all levels of
government to try to give this poor kid some dignity in his death
that he didn't get when he was alive,'' said Toronto City Councilor
Rob Davis, who spent Thursday helping plan Randal's service.
	   ``If that means allowing his relatives into the country to
attend his funeral, then that's what should be done.''
	   Jamaica is on a list with 135 other countries, including India,
China, Cuba and Algeria, where visitors' visas are required and can
be denied due to concerns about the credibility of potential
visitors to Canada.
	   ``Every citizen of every country needs a visitor's visa,''
Huguette Shouldice, an official atimmigration
officer to determine the bona fides of his or her request.''
	   Shouldice refused to talk about Dooley's case specifically, but
speculated that some of his relatives were probably stopped from
traveling to Toronto because of concerns they would not return to
Jamaica.
	   There are no such worries about visitors from countries like
Sweden, France and Germany, she said, so the visitor's visa
requirement has been lifted.
	   ``There have been some abuses in the case of Jamaica,'' she
said, noting that some visitors from the impoverished Caribbean
nation don't return to Jamaica, choosing to live underground in
Canada rather than go back.
	   ``I would think that they were not able to satisfy the visa
officer that they were coming for a temporary visit.''
	   What about compassionate grounds?
	   ``That would have been taken into account when allowing the
boy's mother to come to Canada,'' she said.
	   But Racquel Burth, Randal's mother, didn't get an immediate
green light when she applied to travel to Canada when she first
learned of her little boy's murder, her sister said.
	   After some hesitation and lots of questions, Immigration
officials let her into Canada, said Nicky Hermitt on the line from
Kingston, Jamaica.
	   Relatives in Jamaica were horrified and demoralized when they
saw the difficulties Burth faced coming to Toronto.
	   ``I was wondering why and how they could do this to her at a
time like this,'' Hermitt said.
	   ``A lot of us didn't even bother trying after that. Some of us
tried but they wouldn't let us come.''
	   Denise Burnett, a deejay at Toronto reggae station CIUT, said
some sympathy should have been extended to other family members as
well.
	   ``If death doesn't warrant some element of human compassion from
our bureaucrats _ especially the death of a child _ I don't know
what does.''
	   Burnett said her station is taking dozens of calls daily about
Dooley's murder and the difficulties Jamaicans often face trying to
come to Canada for visits.
	   ``This is Canada and we have to accept that racism exists here.
It's very subtly done, and immigration policies are no exception.''

Peaceful end to standoff between Iran/Afghanistan 'urgent': UN

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Reports of skirmishes Thursday
between Iran and Afghanistan add a greater sense of urgency to the
need for a quick and peaceful end to the standoff, said United
Nations special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi.
	   Brahimi, the man enlisted by the U.N. secretary general to break
the stalemate, arrived in Pakistan after four days of talks in Iran
saying the ``situation is very serious (but) there is a very good
chance to make progress.''
	   However Brahimi said the skirmishes, ``which must have occurred
while I was in the air,'' lend a fresh sense of urgency.
	   ``There is no time to lose and the story you were telling me
about this incident makes it even more urgent,'' Brahimi said upon
his arrival at Pakistan Air Force base outside the federal capital
of Islamabad.
	   Iran said its border troops waged a three-hour gun battle with
Taliban soldiers before repulsing the attack and inflicting heavy
casualties.
	   The Taliban denied the fighting, but accused Iran of shelling
its soldiers in Afghanistan.
	   ``We have no reports of casualties but for three days they fired
artillery into Afghanistan,'' Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil said from the
Taliban headquarters in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan.
	   An estimated 200,000 Iranian soldiers are facing off against an
estimated 10,000 Taliban troops on the troubled border that divides
the two nations.
	   Iran wants an apology from the Taliban for the killing of its
diplomats in Afghanistan in August as well as the release of about
50 Iranians being held captive in southern Kandahar.
	   The Taliban are refusing calling the Iranian diplomats
``conspirators''.
	   The Taliban accuse Iran, Russia and the Central Asian nations of
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan of arming and financing its opponents,
who rule barely 10 percent of the country.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance say Pakistan is arming the Taliban and
sending in military advisors and soldiers to bolster its ranks, a
charge Pakistan denies.
	   It's not clear whether Brahimi will be meeting Taliban
representatives during his week-long stay in Pakistan.
	   While saying he has accepted a Taliban invitation to go to
Afghanistan, Brahimi said it will have to wait until security
concerns are settled.
	   The United Nations withdrew its international staff from
Afghanistan on Aug. 21 after an Italian U.N. worker was shot and
killed by Taliban soldiers. Another U.N. worker was wounded.
	   ``Let me remind you that one of us was killed in the streets of
Kabul from all appearances by a Taliban and we are discussing these
problems and until we are finished these discussions our people in
New York do not allow people from of United Nations to got to
Afghanistan,'' said Brahimi
	   ``I regret that very much, but i am very hopeful that our
discussions with the Taliban will lift this restriction and allow
us to go to Kandahar and meet Mullah Mohammed Omar,'' he said.
	   In the meantime Brahimi said he will seek Pakistan's help to get
a Taliban representative to come to Pakistan to meet him here.
	   ``I am counting on the support and cooperation of Pakistan to
make this happen as soon as possible,'' he said.
	   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban
religious army.

Second of three Mexican brothers heading `meth' ring freed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISAAC A. LEVI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The second of three brothers who allegedly
headed the world's biggest speed-pill ring has been released on
orders from an appeals court.
	   But Luis Amezcua Contreras was immediately re-arrested Wednesday
for extradition to the United States, where he and his brother
Jesus are wanted on a San Diego, California, federal court
indictment for drug-related crimes.
	   Earlier this week, the appeals court in the western city of
Guadalajara ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict Luis
Amezcua on charges of criminal association, money laundering and
tax evasion.
	   He was freed Wednesday from Puente Grande federal prison in
Jalisco state. But agents immediately brought him to Mexico City to
face the extradition proceedings.
	   Investigators say Luis, Jesus and a third brother, Adan, headed
the Colima Cartel, considered the world's biggest methamphetamine
and ephedrine trafficking operation, stretching from Mexico and
California, to India and Germany.
	   U.S. authorities said the gang also shipped methamphetamines
from its Los Angeles area labs to Dallas and then on to Charlotte
and Greensboro, North Carolina, for sale.
	   The San Diego indictment of June 18 charges Luis, 34, and Jesus,
32, of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine, conspiracy
to possess ephedrine, a component of ``meth'' or ``speed,'' and
continuing a criminal enterprise.
	   Some of the indictment's allegations date to 1989.
	   U.S. authorities said the brothers contacted suppliers in India,
Germany, China and elsewhere to collect meth ingredients, and set
up labs to make the finished product in the United States and
Mexico.
	   Mexican authorities arrested the Amezcua brothers on June 1. Due
to insufficient evidence, the brothers were not charged with
drug-trafficking but with related crimes.
	   Jesus Amezcua was freed Aug. 4 when a criminal court in
Guadalajara dropped the last charges against him _ criminal
association and money laundering _ because the statute of
limitations had expired.
	   Reportedly, Jesus was re-arrested soon after, pending
extradition also to the United States.
	   Only Adan remains in Puente Grande Prison, serving an 18-month
sentence for illegal possession of firearms.
	   The Mexico City newspaper La Jornada said Thursday another 13
persons, including Adan's wife, Griselda Saltos, were freed by
court order along with Luis. But the Attorney General's Office said
it had no information.
	   Last December, U.S. drug agents rounded up more than 80 people
linked to the gang, including the purported Los Angeles and Dallas
cell leaders.
	   Three working meth laboratories were raided, including two in
the Los Angeles area. Explosive and toxic chemicals were discovered
near schools and housing projects.

Tarantino wins men's sabre, Flessel women's epee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ World Cup leader Luigi
Tarantino of Italy claimed the men's sabre title Thursday at the
world fencing championships.
	   In the meantime, Laura Flessel was busy proving that epee was a
French event, claiming the women's title just 24 hours after Hugues
Obry won the men's.
	   A silver medallist at last year's worlds in Capetown, the
25-year-old Tarantino beat out his compatriot Raffaello Caserata
15-10 to take the crown, after slashing his way into the final with
a 15-10 semifinal win over Russia's Sergei Kharikov.
	   Caserata settled for silver while Kharikov and Fernando Medina
of Spain shared the bronze.
	   Russia's Stanislav Pozdniakov failed to defend his title, the
Olympic champion squarely losing 15-10 in the quarterfinals to
Medina.
	   Flessel, second in the World Cup rankings, easily defeated
Germany's Denise Holzcamp 15-8 for the title.
	   In fact, the 26-year-old fairly flew through the medal rounds,
beating Cuba's Tamara Estery-Almeida 15-9 in the quarterfinals and
Hungary's Hajnalka Toth by the same score in the semis.
	   Toth shared third-place with her compatriot Gyoengyi Szalay, the
bronze medallist in Atlanta and at last year's worlds.
	   Szalay was beaten 15-8 in her semifinal against Holzcamp.
	   Competition continues Friday with the finals of the men's team
foil event and the women's individual foil.

Jones grades his performance before meeting teacher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Roy Jones is relying on his ego to get up for
his WBC light heavyweight title defense against part-time
schoolteacher Otis Grant next month.
	   ``I got to look good. I don't fight without looking good,''
Jones said at a news conference Thursday to announce the Nov. 14
fight. ``I need to look good for my own self, and if I am not
looking good, I don't want to be out there.''
	   Jones grades his ring performances by just one criteria.
	   ``I love knockouts, I love knockouts,'' said Jones, who is 37-1
with 31 knockouts.
	   Jones will not be defending his WBA 175-pound (159-kilogram)
title in the HBO televised fight, which will be held at the
Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard, Connecticut.
	   While Jones has designs of belting around Grant inside the ring,
outside of the ring he only wants to lavish praise on the
unheralded challenger, who has a 31-1-1 record with 17 knockouts.
	   ``I like the fact that Otis is actually the type of guy that I
think boxing should be full of,'' Jones said of Grant, who is
taking a leave of absence from his job teaching mentally challenged
teens at a high school in suburban Montreal to train for the fight.
	   ``He is a perfect guy to let your kids watch and model
themselves after because he works hard, he has good ethics, he is a
good person and you can't ask for more than that,'' Jones went on
about the 30-year-old Grant, a 1993 graduate of Concordia College
in Montreal.
	   ``I am very proud to give a person like him an opportunity to be
in the ring with me because most of the guys who I fight I don't
want to be in the ring with. I would rather just take them over
behind one of these buildings and take care of business,'' said
Jones.
	   That was how it was with his last opponent, Lou Del Valle, when
the pair taunted and exchanged angry barbs prior to Jones handing
out a 12-round beating July 20 at Madison Square Garden.
	   ``To be honest, I didn't want to knock Del Valle out, I wanted
to punish him,'' Jones said. ``I wanted to beat him all night.''
	   Jones said he has no such intentions this time, and Grant was
equally complimentary about the 29-year-old champion.
	   ``This will be the toughest, biggest fight of my career,
possibly my life,'' Grant said. ``Pound for pound he is considered
the best fighter in the world and it is seldom that a fighter gets
the opportunity to go in against someone who is considered the best
in the business.''
	   On the undercard, IBF lightweight champion Shane Mosley will
defend his title against an as-yet undetermined opponent.

Cubans remember revolutionary Ernesto `Che' Guevara on anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Cubans remembered revolutionary hero Ernesto
``Che'' Guevara across the Caribbean island Thursday with
gatherings of the communist faithful 31 years after he was killed
in Bolivia.
	   The ceremonies were more low-key than those held last year,
shortly after Guevara's remains were returned to Cuba from Bolivia
in time for the 30th anniversary of his death.
	   Thousands of children gathered Thursday in Havana's huge Plaza
of the Revolution to join the Pioneers communist youth group,
Cuba's Prensa Latina said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico City.
``We will be like Che,'' is the group's slogan.
	   Another ceremony was held in the central city of Santa Clara,
where Guevara's remains were entombed last Oct. 8 following a
funeral cortege nearly halfway across the island.
	   Born in Argentina, Guevara joined Cuban leader Fidel Castro's
revolutionary struggle in the late 1950s and went on to become a
Cuban citizen and hold several ministries in the government.
	   Guevara promoted the export of Cuba's revolution to other
countries and was trying to organize Bolivians to overthrow their
government when he was killed by that South American country's
army.
	   Three decades later, Guevara is revered as a revolutionary hero
in Cuba and remains a mythic figure across Latin America, where his
bearded likeness can be seen on such things as T-shirts and
watches.

Lawmakers agree to press for new Islamic Laws
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - Lawmakers agreed Thursday to press
ahead with a constitutional amendment that would create a new
Islamic order in Pakistan.
	   Human rights groups and women activists have strongly condemned
the constitutional amendment warning it would give help militant
members of rival Islamic sects and threaten the rights of women and
minorities.
	   Several women's group threatened to demonstrate outside
Pakistan's Parliament on Friday when the revised amendment is to be
introduced into the National Assembly or Lower House of Parliament.
	   The amendment has undergone some revisions since it was first
introduced last month.
	   Bowing to pressure from within his ruling Pakistan Muslim League
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif returned the two-thirds majority needed
to pass constitutional amendments. Originally Sharif sought to
reduce it to a simple majority.
	   However the law retains sweeping powers for the federal
government, say its opponents.
	   It retains a clause which makes it an ``obligation'' for the
federal government ``to prescribe what is right and to forbid what
is wrong . . . in accordance with the principles of Islam.''
	   Opponents to the amendment fear it will, in the name of Islam,
give the federal government authority that supersedes the
constitution itself.
	   The government, meanwhile, promised to protect the rights of
minorities and women.
	   But Pakistan's Christian community, which has been demanding the
repeal of other Islamic laws in Pakistan, rejected the amendment.
	   ``Pakistan is not for Muslims alone,'' the state-run news agency
quoted Peter Sahotra, a lawmaker representing Pakistan's minority
religious groups.
	   Pakistan is 90 percent Muslim.
	   While Sharif is expected to easily pass the new Islamic law
through the National Assembly it could possibly be defeated in the
Senate or Upper House of Parliament, where the opposition
dominates.

Ganassi signs unknown as Zanardi's replacement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ The last time Chip Ganassi picked a virtual
unknown as a driver for his CART team it paid off with Alex Zanardi
winning 14 races and two FedEx Series championships in three years.
	   Now, with Zanardi leaving at the end of the season to join Team
Williams in Formula One, Ganassi is hoping lightning strikes again.
	   He announced Thursday that Juan Pablo Montoya has signed on as
the new teammate for Jimmy Vasser, the 1996 series champion.
	   The 23-year-old Montoya of Colombia recently clinched the 1998
FIA Formula 3000 Championship, winning seven poles and four races
in the 12-race season. The young driver also has served as the
official test driver for Williams.
	   Montoya, who signed a 3-year deal with Ganassi, will take part
in a Formula One test in France on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
before flying to the United States for his first test with
Target/Chip Ganassi Racing.
	   He is scheduled to drive one of the team's Reynard-Hondas on
both the road course and the oval at the Miami-Dade Homestead
Motorsports Complex in Homestead, Florida Oct. 22-26 and will be at
the season-finale at Fontana, California on Nov. 1 to see his first
CART event.
	   ``I watched Juan Pablo test alongside Alex two weeks ago in
Barcelona and was very impressed,'' Ganassi said. ``He comes highly
recommended from the people at Williams who've been working with
him for the last year.
	   ``He has a lot of confidence and possesses the tools and skills
to be a successful driver for us.''
	   Actually, Montoya competed in the U.S. before, finishing third
in the Barber Saab Pro Series in 1994 before returning to Europe.
	   Frank Williams, owner of the Formula One team, said, ``Juan
Pablo has a lot of talent and we are confident Chip Ganassi and his
team will offer the right environment to develop his skills
further.''

Pamphlet threatens violence to whites in Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ An anonymous pamphlet on Thursday
threatened foreigners, particularly whites, with violence if they
did not leave this troubled mountain kingdom.
	   ``We warn the expatriates ... that we are armed and dangerous,''
said thousands of leaflets handed out in the capital of Maseru.
	   The pamphlet, which carried no signature or group name, said
white foreigners were more likely to be the first targets because
they were more noticeable than their black counterparts, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   The pamphlet did little to quell a conflict that has claimed the
lives of at least 60 Lesotho citizens and eight South Africans
since Sept. 22, when South Africa's military entered the country to
restore order.
	   Part of a regional effort intended to protect Lesotho's
government from a rebellious military, the South African soldiers
encountered stiff resistance. On Tuesday, South Africa doubled its
force to nearly 1,400 soldiers.
	   Lesotho, a poor country of two million people, is totally
surrounded by South Africa.
	   Lesotho's government was concerned by the pamphlet.
	   ``We will appeal to people from outside Lesotho to be careful,''
said Foreign Affairs Minister Tom Thabane.
	   The government on Thursday threatened to fire public employees
who supported three opposition parties that began demonstrating in
August.
	   ``This move by government will not augur well for this period
when so much reconciliation is needed,'' said opposition leader
Retshilisitsoe Sekhonyane.
	   The opposition groups charge that fraud in the May elections
gave the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy 79 of 80 seats in
Parliament. The protests closed the city at times.
	   In a motion before Parliament on Thursday, the ruling party
backed the government's decision to invite military intervention by
the Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation regional
group.
	   During discussion of the motion, Environment and Women Affairs
Minister Mamoshebi Kabi asked if the country still needed a
monarch. The royal palace gave refuge to opposition protestors over
the past two months.
	   Lesotho must foot the bill for the military operation, the South
African Ministry of Defense said Thursday.
	   The first week of operations was estimated to cost more than 8
million rand (dlrs 1.3 million).
	   A spokesman for South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said
the Lesotho government and opposition would meet a SADC delegation
on Monday to pursue reconciliation.

Sides meet for less than five hours, union to respond Tuesday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nobody walked out of the latest National
Basketball Association collective bargaining talks, but nothing
much was accomplished.
	   On Day 100 of the lockout, the opposing sides met for more than
four hours Thursday in what was described as more of a
question-and-answer meeting than a bargaining session.
	   They will meet again next Tuesday, which NBA deputy commissioner
Russ Granik acknowledged will be the ``drop dead'' date for saving
an 82-game regular season.
	   ``There was a minimum of posturing, although I can't say there
was any progress,'' commissioner David Stern said. ``There's still
an essential area that keeps us apart _ the fact that we want a
fair, defined percentage of revenues.''
	   No owners attended the meeting, which was held at a midtown
Manhattan hotel.
	   The only players present were Patrick Ewing and Herb Williams of
the New York Knicks and Dikembe Mutombo of the Atlanta Hawks, which
was a change from the last formal bargaining session Aug. 6 when
more than a dozen players attended and the owners stormed out upon
hearing the players' latest offer.
	   The players also walked out of a bargaining session in late June
when they said they wouldn't listen to any offer that contained a
``hard'' salary cap _ their term for the league's insistence on
putting an absolute ceiling on player salaries.
	   ``Well, nobody walked out. So in that (respect) it was a lot
better. But we're still in the same place,'' said Ewing, president
of the players union. ``We're hoping we can make some progress
Tuesday and get this thing going because we want to play.''
	   The bulk of the meeting consisted of players and their attorneys
asking questions about the owners' most recent proposal, which was
made two weeks ago and included 19 pages of the league's position
on all issues, major and minor, that could come up during
negotiations.
	   ``We're going to bring players in (to New York) over the weekend
to discuss what the league is proposing, and who knows what may
evolve from that,'' union director Billy Hunter said. ``But it is
our contention that there's still a long way to go.''
	   In 51 seasons encompassing 35,001 games, the NBA has never lost
a game because of a labor impasse. But it's almost a foregone
conclusion that this is the year it will happen.
	   The entire exhibition season has already been canceled, and
since it will take at least three weeks to sign almost 200 free
agents, make trades and hold abbreviated training camps, it will be
almost impossible for the regular season to start on time Nov. 3.
	   Both sides continue to await a decision from arbitrator John
Feerick on the union's grievance contending that more than 200
players with guaranteed contracts for the upcoming season should be
paid during a lockout.
	   Feerick's ruling is due by Oct. 19, and it's release could have
a significant impact on the pace of negotiations. If the players
win and the owners are unable to get a judge to delay the award,
the union believes it will be more likely to come to a fair
agreement.
	   To date, the union has offered the owners two different olive
branches: To slow the growth of the salary cap (which was dlrs 26.9
million last season) if the percentage of revenues paid toward
salaries rises above 63 percent; or to reduce the maximum annual
raise in any contract from 20 percent to 10 percent.

	   BANYOLES, Spain (AP) _ Overloading may have caused a tour boat
carrying about 140 people to sink Thursday, killing at least 20
French retirees in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain.
	   The electrically powered catamaran sank under clear skies and in
calm waters as it set off at midmorning to circle Lake Banyoles,
just north of Barcelona and about 350 miles northeast of Madrid.
	   It was not immediately known what caused the boat to sink, but a
rescue official said authorities ``are working on the theory that
it was overloaded.''
	   Xavier Pomes, a regional government delegate, said the boat was
only licensed to carry 80 people but he added that only a full
investigation would show whether overloading was the problem. The
boat would not be brought up until Friday, he said.
	   An employee at the tour operator's ticket office said 141
tickets were sold. So far, only 139 people, including the pilot,
have been accounted for, but it was not known if two of the ticket
holders were on board the boat at the time of the accident.
	   Police underwater divers scoured the water and the boat's
wreckage Thursday afternoon searching for victims but halted the
search at nightfall. National television showed bodies covered with
blankets lining the small pier at the lake and rescuers pulling
bodies into small rowing boats.
	   The boat had just left its mooring and was about 30 feet (9
meters) out on the lake when the pilot realized there was problem
and tried to turn back, said a police officer at the scene. It
sank, stern first, just six feet from shore, leaving its bow
sticking out of the water.
	   Most of those who drowned were believed to have been on the
vessel's lower deck.
	   ``We could see old people up to their necks in water shouting
for help and other people crying,'' an unidentified schoolgirl told
national television.
	   All 20 dead were French retirees: 13 people who drowned in the
water and seven who died after being taken to local hospitals.
	   Another 38 people were treated in a hospital after the accident.
	   Most of the passengers were French retirees from the western
coastal region near La Rochelle, 250 miles (402 kilometers)
southwest of Paris.
	   The La Carpa firm that owns the boat said it was launched
earlier this year and made 50 trips daily on the lake, the largest
in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seeded Andre Agassi and No. 6
Tim Henman survived the second round of the Swiss Indoors on
Thursday, becoming the only seeded players to escape the early
round devastation.
	   No. 5 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and defending champion Greg Rusedski
lost their second-round matches earlier in the day, joining
top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2 Patrick Rafter as early round
casualties.
	   Rusedski was toppled 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 by German qualifier David
Prinosil, while Kafelnikov was ousted 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 by Sweden's
Magnus Gustafsson.
	   Agassi, who won each of his four titles this year without
dropping a set, needed just 53 minutes to dispose of Ivo Heuberger,
breaking the Swiss qualifier twice in each set on way to a 6-2, 6-2
win and a place in the quarterfinals.
	   ``Beating a qualifier doesn't necessarily feel great, but it
feels good to have two wins behind me,'' said Agassi. ``You just
keep going to the next point, and if the matches go quickly, you
just count your blessings,'' Agassi said.
	   Henman defeated Morocco's Hicham Arazi 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). The
tournament's top three seeds tumbled out of the tournament in the
opening round, leaving the draw wide open.
	   Wimbledon champion Sampras, U.S. Open champion Rafter and
Australian Open titlist Petr Korda, seeded third, all lost within a
24-hour span.
	   Boris Becker also made an early exit, eliminated in the first
round.

Tough new measures for violence on public transport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike to continue Friday; RELEADS to conform;
TRIMS,

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced tough, new
measures on Thursday night to curb violence on public transport.
But striking train drivers demanding protection from juvenile crime
gave notice that they would stay off the job a fourth day.
	   More than one million commuters were stranded at train stations
on Thursday, according to radio reports. Traffic jams stretched up
to 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Paris as drivers tried to beat
the strike.
	   The near-paralysis of suburban rail services was expected to
repeat itself on Friday.
	   The train authority, the SNCF, said there would likely be no
trains Friday at four Paris stations -- Est, Nord, Lyon and
Montparnasse. Several other suburban lines also were likely to be
affected by the walkout to varying degrees.
	   The Socialist prime minister said the attitude of youths
responsible for violence on the public transport system ``is
absurd'' and ``self-destructive'' because they hurt those who serve
them -- bus drivers and metro and train conductors -- and ``this is
not a game.''
	   ``These acts will be punished,'' Jospin said in an interview on
state-run television.
	   Jospin said that the penal code will be revised shortly to deal
more harshly with cases of violence toward transport workers. And
inspectors who currently check tickets will be able to verify
identities of passengers, Jospin said, adding that they would be
``aided by police officers.''
	   He also said that justice would be swift for suspected
offenders.
	   There was some relief in the capital with bus services resuming
after a two-day walkout. The city's RATP transit system deployed
two more companies of CRS elite police on their bus lines,
prompting drivers to return to work.
	   The Metro was not affected.
	   Rail service was particularly affected at the Montparnasse, Gare
du Nord, Gare de l'Est and Gare de Lyon stations, which serve most
points of entry into the capital.
	   The walkout was triggered by an attack Monday night on the RER C
line, in which a worker was beaten with a spray can after he tried
to stop youths from vandalizing a station. The escalating attacks,
in which drivers are jumped by gangs of youths, happen mostly in
poor suburbs with especially high unemployment.
	   Statistics show urban violence has risen by 400 percent in the
past six years.
	   About 9 million people in the Paris area depend on public
transit daily.

Researchers find tumor-fighting gene for lung and colon cancers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A gene that appears to control the growth of
tumors has been found by Texas researchers studying genetic
patterns in lung and colon cancer.
	   Researchers at the University of Texas, Southwestern Medical
Center in Dallas, report in the journal Science that a gene called
PPP2R1B helps to regular the growth of cells and that a mutation of
the gene may help promote lung and colon cancer.
	   Dr. Glen Evans and Dr. Steven Wang, co-authors of the study,
said that PPP2R1B makes a protein that helps to regulate phosphate
metabolism. When the gene is flawed, they said, phosphate builds up
and cell growth becomes uncontrolled, resulting in a tumor.
	   The researchers said that a mutation of PPP2R1B can be inherited
and people with this gene have an increased risk of developing
cancer of the lung or colon.
	   Evans said the gene may also be involved in other forms of
cancer.
	   The discovery adds to a growing list of gene mutations linked to
cancer.

Iran defends firing on Taliban to Security Council
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iran-Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran justified its decision to fire on
Afghanistan's Taliban troops Thursday, telling the Security Council
that it took ``some limited and proportionate measures'' to defend
itself against Taliban attacks.
	   In a letter to the council president, Iran's U.N. ambassador,
Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian, said Iran used ``maximum restraint'' in
deference to U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who is in the region to
try to defuse the tensions between the two sides.
	   The ambassador said Iran had the right to defend itself against
the Taliban's ``flagrant aggression and provocation'' based on
Article 51 of the U.N. charter, which allows states to defend
themselves if attacked. The article also requires that member
states immediately inform the Security Council when they take such
actions.
	   Iran's official media said Thursday its border forces fought a
three-hour battle with Afghanistan's Taliban militia, after the
Taliban fired mortars and machine guns at Iranian border posts in
northeastern Khorasan province.
	   Iran said its counterattack inflicted heavy casualties, but the
Taliban denied that any fighting took place and said in fact that
Iran has been firing artillery into Afghanistan during the past
three days.
	   The battle, in Torbat-e Jam in the Saleh Abad region, was the
first major battle reported between the two sides since tensions
began to rise in August when Iranian diplomats and truck drivers
disappeared in Afghanistan.
	   Several of the diplomats were slain, prompting an Iranian
military buildup at the border and threats of retaliation.
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent Brahimi to the region in an
effort to calm the tensions.
	   Spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday that Annan was concerned
about the reports of border clashes and urged both sides exercise
restraint.
	   Annan expects the Taliban to cooperate with Brahimi, who arrived
in islamabad on Thursday for talks with senior Taliban officials
and Pakistani government officials, Eckhard said.

Strawberry's test results look good
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry was given an optimistic
medical report Thursday and doctors said the New York Yankees
outfielder probably will be sent home this weekend.
	   Doctors removed a 16-inch (41-cm) portion of Strawberry's large
intestine during a three-hour operation last Saturday to get rid of
a 2 1/2-inch (6.4-cm) cancerous tumor that nearly obstructed his
intestine.
	   ``Doctors are optimistic that he will make a complete recovery
and return to full activities, including playing major league
baseball next season,'' Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center said
in a statement.
	   Strawberry probably will be sent home Sunday. Doctors said they
anticipated he will undergo one round of chemotherapy.
	   A microscopic examination of tissue removed from Strawberry
showed no indications the tumor had spread. The margins of the
colon were cancer-free, as was his liver.
	   Doctors said 35 of 36 lymph nodes removed from Strawberry during
the three-hour surgery were cancer-free, but one lymph node
contained evidence of the tumor.
	   Strawberry, 36, went for medical tests just as the Yankees were
starting the American League playoffs. He hit .247 this season with
24 home runs _ his highest total since 1991 _ and 57 RBIs in 295
at-bats.

Gorter fined, suspended for racial epithet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ New England's Edward Gorter was fined a
league-record dlrs 20,000 and suspended for two games for using a
racial epithet against a teammate, Major League Soccer commissioner
Doug Logan said.
	   The fine is twice the previous high lodged by the MLS, dlrs
10,000 against Miami's Carlos Valderrama for refusing to take part
in a team practice session last July.
	   Logan based the fine and suspension, the latter to be carried
out at the start of the 1999 season, on his investigation into the
altercation between the players after a New England practice on
Tuesday. The team suspended Gorter without pay and asked the MLS to
investigate.
	   Gortner ``used an offensive racial epithet'' against teammate
David Nakhid, Logan found, after the two became involved in a
heated exchange following practice.
	   ``I have met with Mr. Gorter personally and he has admitted his
misconduct,'' Logan said in a statement released by the league.

East Timor talks end, UN upbeat about progress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Indonesia and Portugal agreed Thursday to
meet again next month to continue discussions on granting autonomy
to disputed East Timor and setting up interest sections in each
other's countries.
	   The decision came after two days of talks overseen by the U.N.
chief's personal representative Jamsheed Marker _ the first since
Indonesia and Portugal agreed in August to discuss granting the
Timorese limited autonomy.
	   Both sides gave their views on new U.N. proposals for autonomy
and worked out details on setting up interest sections in Jakarta
and Lisbon, Marker said. He said he hoped the interest sections
would be up and working by January.
	   ``We have a great deal to do as yet, a long way to go,'' Marker
said after the talks concluded. ``But ... the spirit, the
willingness to find a compromise and the atmosphere in the
negotiations was extremely good and very positive and feeds my
inherent optimism on all issues.''
	   East Timor has defied a diplomatic solution since Indonesia sent
troops to the territory in 1975 and annexed it soon thereafter.
Portugal abandoned East Timor after 400 years of colonial rule.
	   The territory, 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) east of Jakarta,
has endured guerrilla warfare since the takeover. A small band of
rebels regularly attacks Indonesian troops, who have been accused
of widespread human rights violations.
	   In Jakarta on Tuesday, Indonesia's foreign minister, Ali Alatas,
called on Portugal to accept its proposal to grant autonomy, not
independence, to the half-island as ``a final and peaceful
solution'' for the troubled territory.
	   Portugal had previously backed nothing short of
self-determination for East Timor. Timorese separatists have
demanded that a referendum be held on self-determination.
	   The Indonesian government has repeatedly rejected the idea,
saying it could reopen old divisions and conflicts within East
Timorese society.
	   In addition to a new round of talks here Nov. 19-21, talks on
including more East Timorese in negotiations would be held in late
October or early Nobember in Austria, Marker told reporters.
	   ``Attempts will be made to expand the participants, as well as
the dialogue,'' Marker said.

Indians happy after split in New York
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN AFFLECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ The Cleveland Indians laughed just a little
more easily Thursday. They flipped the ball around the infield
during practice, striking goofy poses at second base.
	   Why not be loose?
	   Thanks to some great pitching and Chuck Knoblauch, the Indians
survived Yankee Stadium with a split in the first two games of the
American League championship series.
	   All the sudden, the underdog Indians have home-field advantage
against a New York team that on Tuesday was proclaimed practically
unbeatable. The series' next three games will be at Jacobs Field,
where the crowd will be anxious to one-up the fans at rowdy Yankee
Stadium.
	   ``I think that baseball is a game of momentum,'' Indians manager
Mike Hargrove said Thursday, a day after Cleveland's controversial
4-1, 12-inning win in Game 2.
	   ``I think that there was probably was a little more of a bounce
in our step,'' he said.
	   The shift in mood, both on the Indians and in the city, was
unmistakable Thursday.
	   Hollering fans in head dresses met the club as it rolled in from
New York in the wee hours.
	   A radio talk show host invited Clevelanders to call in and vent
about those ``dirty, rotten, crybaby Yankees,'' following Game 2's
pivotal play, in which Knoblauch argued with the umpires rather
than chasing a throw that bounced off Cleveland's Travis Fryman as
he crossed first base. Enrique Wilson scored from first on the
play, giving Cleveland a 2-1 lead in the 12th inning.
	   Even Jim Thome, who swears he doesn't believe in postseason
momentum, had to acknowledge the impact.
	   ``We're hoping that play could give us a kick,'' he said. ``If
you want to say luck, yeah, I think we were lucky. I think we are
also talented and Charlie Nagy kept us in position to win that
game. We battled to the point where we could catch a break.''
	   Now that the Indians have caught the break, the Yankees and
their 118 wins don't seem so formidable, if they ever did to an
Indians team that split six games with New York at Jacobs Field
this year.
	   ``I don't care what they did in the past,'' Kenny Lofton said.
``This is the present.''
	   The Tribe's escape from New York and return to Cleveland was
even settling down Game 3 starter Bartolo Colon, the hard-throwing
rookie who admitted to being jittery early in his only other
postseason start _ the Indians' clinching win over Boston last
Saturday.

Human Rights Watch: In quest for peace, government neglecting
</HEADLINE>
abuses &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana is starting
peace negotiations with leftist rebels without seriously attempting
to stop massive human rights abuses by Colombia's warring parties,
a leading international rights group charged Thursday.
	   ``Unfortunately the topic of human rights still doesn't figure
clearly, in unequivocal terms, in the agenda of negotiations,'' the
director of Human Rights Watch/Americas, Jose Miguel Vivanco, told
a news conference.
	   The Washington-based group released a 230-page report, ``War
Without Quarter'' which notes that while Colombia's civil conflict
claimed the lives of 1,250 combatants last year, there were 2,183
political killings of noncombatants and nearly no chance of
bringing the killers to justice. .
	   Vivanco criticized the two-month-old Pastrana administration for
proposing, in advance of a peace dialogue expected to begin next
month with Colombia's largest rebel group, an eventual blanket
amnesty for all actors in the conflict.
	   Such a pardon would ``constitute a violation by Colombia of its
international judicial obligations ... and I would say an
irresponsible invitation to all parties that continue to kill, to
kidnap and to execute extrajudicially, to keep on doing so,'' he
said.
	   Although Colombia's military is blamed for just 3 percent of the
country's 1997 human rights abuses, it continues to ``tolerate and
acquiesce'' the murderous activities of landowner-based
paramilitary groups who are responsible for more than two-thirds of
the rights violations, Vivanco said.
	   And in those cases where judicial investigators have produced
evidence of regional military commanders providing weapons and
logistical support to the paramilitary death squads that have
massacred scores of alleged guerrilla sympathizers in the past few
years, the cases are transferred to military courts that absolve
the accused, he charged.
	   To emphasize his fear of continued atrocities, Vivanco held up a
photocopy of a flier now being distributed by the paramilitary

Sampras in ``wild'' bid to retain No. 1 ranking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the battle to keep his No. 1 ranking for a
record sixth year, Pete Sampras has turned to an unlikely source _
Boris Becker.
	   Sampras has been ranked No. 1 in the world for the last five
years, a streak matched only by Jimmy Connors. He wants the record
by himself.
	   When he failed to win his fifth U.S. Open crown last month,
Sampras lost his chance at virtually clinching the year-end No. 1
title.
	   ``That's why I'm here,'' he said Thursday in a telephone
conversation from a hotel room in Basel, Switzerland. ``If I had
won the Open this year, this probably wouldn't have happened.
	   ``Five weeks in Europe. That's a big commitment.''
	   While the ranking is done by computer on a 52-week basis, it's
easier to compare by using the ATP Tour's Road to Hanover points
race. That's based on a calendar year, and by the time the
season-ending ATP Tour World Championship in Hanover, Germany, is
over, the two are identical.
	   Sampras currently is third in the Road to Hanover race, 379
points behind U.S. Open champion Patrick Rafter, who leads with
3,260 points. Chile's Marcelo Rios is second at 3,173.
	   Following Sampras (2,881) are Carlos Moya of Spain (2,819) and
Andre Agassi (2,527).
	   While every player in the top 10 has a mathematical shot at
finishing the year at No. 1, the winner almost certainly will come
from the top five.
	   Sampras had planned on playing three tournaments before Hanover
_ Lyon, France; Stuttgart, Germany; and Paris. When he realized he
needed more points to retain his coveted No. 1 year-end ranking, he
went in search of wild cards to two more tournaments _ Basel,
Switzerland, and Vienna, Austria.
	   Sampras found out that even the world's top-ranked player can't
make last-minute plans. Neither could accommodate Sampras since it
was too late to enter the normal way and both tournaments had
already awarded all of their wild cards.
	   Then luck stepped in _ twice.
	   Mark Philippoussis, the U.S. Open runner-up, pulled out of Basel
with an injury. That spot in the tournament was taken by the next
highest-ranked player on the entry list. And that was Switzerland's
Marc Rosset, who just happened to have been given a wild card.
	   Sampras wasn't able to take advantage, losing in the opening
round to South Africa's Wayne Ferreira.
	   But Rafter also was a first-round loser, so Sampras didn't fall
further behind in the points race.
	   Then Sampras learned Boris Becker had received a wild card for
Vienna, which begins on Monday.
	   ``I contacted Boris to see if he was going to play. He's
obviously not playing as much,'' Sampras said. ``He said he would
give it to me. Otherwise I would have left for home.''
	   Sampras admitted he had never heard of a player giving up a wild
card so that someone else could have it.
	   ``Boris is not playing full-time and he knows what I'm trying to
achieve this year,'' he said. ``I figured he's not playing that
much. He knows how much it means.''
	   The race to No. 1 will be decided on the court. Besides Sampras,
Rafter and Moya also are scheduled to play in Vienna.
	   At Lyon, Sampras will be in a field that includes Rafter and
Rios.
	   Then all five of the top players will be at Stuttgart, Paris and
Hanover.
	   ``It pretty much might come down to Hanover,'' Sampras said.
``But I have four more tournaments before then. I'm hoping to get
my game back.''

Robbins takes first-round lead in Tournament of Champions

<TEXT>
	   OPELIKA, Alabama (AP) _ Kelly Robbins broke out of a lengthy
funk with a 6-under-par 66 Thursday to take the first-round lead in
the LPGA Tournament of Champions.
	   Robbins, who had nine birdies overall, birdied the final two
holes to take a one-shot lead over Juli Inkster. Pat Hurst and Se
Ri Pak came in at 4-under and leading money winner Annika Sorenstam
was at 69.
	   Thirteen players broke par on a day when the sun finally came
out after Tuesday's pro-am was rained out.
	   Robbins had slipped to 25th on the earnings list with dlrs
274,432 after winning a career-high dlrs 910,000 last year, her
fourth straight in the top 10 on the earnings list. She won the
year's first event, the HealthSouth Inaugural on Jan. 16-18, but
had only five top-10 finishes in her next 22 tournaments.
	   Inkster bogeyed the second and third holes, but got even with an
eagle on the par-5 fourth hole. She was 5-under on the four par-5s.
	   The tournament is being played on Grand National Golf Club's
par-72 Lake Course.

Barbados defeats Leeward Islands in Red Stripe competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Barbados defeated the Leeward Islands
by 75 runs at Jamaica's Alpart Sports Club Thursday, setting up a
three-way tie in Zone Two of the Red Stripe Bowl one-day cricket
tournament.
	   Three wickets each from spinners Ryan Hinds and Henderson
Broomes, in addition to two wickets from leftarm spinner Winston
Reid, enabled the Bajans to beat the defending champions.
	   The Leewards were coasting at 57 without loss when they lost the
wicket of skipper Stuart Williams, who was dismissed by Broomes for
35. Williams' dismissal triggered a collapse that included the
dismissal of topscorer Wilden Cornwall, who made 51.
	   Only Anthony Lake (22) and Dave Joseph (20) of the remaining
batsmen offered resistance to the Bajan spinners, who wrapped the
Leewards innings in 46.2 overs.
	   The Leewards innings seemed to be a carbon copy of the Barbados
innings. After being sent in to bat they received a solid start
from captain Philo Wallace and Sherwin Campbell.
	   Wallace made 62 and Campbell 31 in an opening stand of 69 runs.
The Barbadians were made to struggle after the good start and it
took resolute batting from Adrian Griffith, who made 59, and Floyd
Reifer with 23 to bolster the innings to a respectable 235 in 49.4
overs.
	   Bowling for the Leewards, part-time spinner Keith Arthurton
finished with three wickets for 37 runs while fastbowler Kenny
Benjamin ended with three for 44.
	   The win means Barbados, the Leewards and Jamaica each have three
points, though the Leewards have played two matches. The Bajans,
who last won the regional one-day tournament in 1988, have a chance
of taking the lead in the zone when they play the United States
Friday.
	   The Americans have been beaten by the Leewards and Jamaica in
their matches to date.

Earthquake recorded off south coast of Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An earthquake of magnitude 3.4 shook
the Bass Strait Thursday night, seismologists said. No damage was
reported.
	   The quake, with an epicenter was 30 miles (50 kilometers)
southwest of Wilson's Promontory, or about 125 miles (200
kilometer) southeast of Melbourne, struck at 10.05 p.m. local time
(1205 GMT) at a depth of 4 miles (7 kilometer) beneath the ocean
surface, the Seismology Research Center in Melbourne said.
	   ``No reports of any structural damage have been received and
none would be expected from an earthquake of this magnitude and
depth,'' the center said in a statement.
	   ``The earthquake has not been reported felt.''
	   The center said the energy released by the quake would be
equivalent to a few tons of high explosive.
	   There had been no shocks before the quake, and none in the hour
since, the center said.

Duval, Tataurangi share one shot lead ater opening 65s
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK KURZ Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP) _ David Duval, the most successful
golfer in the world since his first victory here last year, shot a
6-under-par 65 Thursday to grab a share of the first-round lead in
the Michelob Championship.
	   Duval made three straight birdies beginning on the 14th hole,
then had a 12-footer (3.6-meter) lip out on the final hole. Phil
Tataurangi also had a 65, making six birdies and no bogeys on the
6,853-yard (6,236-meter) River Course at Kingsmill.
	   Local resident Curtis Strange, Frank Lickliter and Steve Pate
had 66s on a rainy, cool day along the James River.
	   Duval's victory in a playoff with Duffy Waldorf and Grant Waite
last year was his first, and he's added five more in becoming the
first golfer to win three times in consecutive seasons since Nick
Price in 1992 and 1993.
	   Duval also leads the tour with more than dlrs 2.1 million in
earnings, and said he's eyeing the money title as a secondary
consolation prize.
	   ``Having not won a major, it certainly would be nice,'' he said.
	   Tataurangi, 165th on the money list, made five birdie putts
inside eight feet (2.4 meters) and rolled in two 20-footers (6
meters), one to save par and one for birdie.
	   ``My putting's been holding me back a little bit, but I feel
I've really been playing well,'' the 28-year-old New Zealander
said. ``I've been kind of waiting for a low round to show up, and
I'm glad it showed up today.''
	   It could have been lower still, he said, if he'd made more
putts.
	   ``I hit a lot of nice iron shots where I didn't make birdies,''
he said.
	   Strange, a non-winner since his second U.S. Open title in 1989,
used a blistering four-hole stretch to do most of his scoring.
Starting on the back, he made three straight birdies, then an eagle
on the third when he hit a driver and then knocked a fairway 4-wood
to within 10 feet (3 meters).
	   He would have had a share of the lead, too, but he three-putted
his final hole.
	   Strange is no stranger to contending here. He tied for sixth in
1995, then started the next year with a 65, one shot behind
wire-to-wire winner Scott Hoch. A second-round 77 took Strange out
of contention.
	   As the unofficial host, he said other things sometimes get in
the way.
	   ``You want to do well in front of your family and friends,'' he
said. ``... But I think it might be something good for me now
because it keeps my concentration out there. I've worked very hard
out there this week.
	   ``Everybody knows what this tournament and this place mean to
me.''
	   Pate, who is 38th on the money list and trying to work his way
into the top 30, and thus in the field for the lucrative Tour
Championship, needed only 24 putts and made six birdies despite
hitting only five fairways.
	   ``I putted extremely well, I hit my irons well. Basically I did
everything well except hit my driver,'' he said.

Knoblauch: ``I screwed up the play''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM WITHERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Chuck Knoblauch nearly needed a police escort
to escape New York. When he arrived in Cleveland, it was the middle
of the night but the Yankees second baseman already was the toast
of the town.
	   Knoblauch's boneheaded decision to argue with umpires while the
Cleveland Indians scored the go-ahead run in the 12th inning, cost
New York Game 2 in the American League championship series.
	   By the time he reached his hotel room after the flight to Ohio,
Knoblauch had run the play over in his mind hundreds of times. And
after finally seeing it on TV for the first time, he understood his
failure.
	   ``I screwed up,'' he said Thursday.
	   An off day before Friday's third game provided the Indians and
Yankees a chance to recover from Wednesday's thrilling 4-1
Cleveland win, which tied the series 1-1. The Indians' full team
worked out at Jacobs Field while only a handful of Yankees came to
the ballpark as manager Joe Torre made their workout optional.
	   Knoblauch, booed loudly by the Yankee Stadium crowd in his final
at-bat in Game 2 and ripped in the New York papers with banner
headlines such as ``Blauch Head'' and ``Chuck Brainlauch,''
couldn't stay away.
	   He needed to explain himself and ask forgiveness.
	   ``I screwed up the play, and I feel terrible about that,'' he
said in an unscheduled appearance in the interview room. ``I should
have went and got the ball, regardless of what the outcome of the
umpire's call was. ... I need to apologize to my teammates and my
manager and the Yankees and all the Yankee fans. Bottom line, I
screwed up the play.''
	   By admitting his mistake, Knoblauch and the Yankees can now turn
their attention to facing the Indians.
	   Since falling behind 5-0 in the first inning of Game 1,
Cleveland has slightly outplayed the team that won an AL record 114
games during the regular season and has been favored to win the
World Series.
	   New York had plenty of chances to go up 2-0 in the series, but
failed in clutch situations all game long.
	   The Yankees were 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position, and
after hitting .299 with men at second and third during the regular
season, they're batting just .182 (8-for-44) during the postseason.
	   ``We had so many chances to win that game earlier, and we
didn't,'' Paul O'Neill said. ``But so did the Indians. Hey, we lost
one game and hopefully we'll come back and rally around each
other.''
	   In Game 3, the Yankees will face Bartolo Colon, who limited them
to three hits in eight innings in Cleveland's 11-0 win June 21.
Andy Pettitte, who lost to the Indians twice in last year's
first-round series, will start for New York.

	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Olympic organizers took less than an hour
Thursday to approve a dlrs 1.45 billion budget for the 2002 Winter
Olympic Games.
	   The budget, based largely on assumptions about revenue and
expenses, passed the Salt Lake Olympic Committee's Board of
Trustees by voice vote after surprisingly sparse and congenial
debate.
	   The spending plan, subject to final approval by the
International Olympic Committee, is more than dlrs 400 million
larger than the budget Nagano, Japan, used while hosting this
year's Winter Olympics.
	   The board also approved four contracts for design and
construction of the speed skating oval at Oquirrh Park and for the
cross-country skiing and biathlon venue at Soldier Hollow.
	   But three abstentions to the budget vote indicated that while
the approval process was smooth, it wasn't perfect.
	   Board representatives for Gov. Mike Leavitt and Salt Lake City
Mayor Deedee Corradini abstained from Thursday's budget approval,
saying their bosses wanted more time to study the budget _ though
both expect it to pass muster.
	   ``I have confidence in the process and the team that has put
this budget together,'' said Nolan Karras, Leavitt's
representative. ``Having such a careful budget prepared three years
before the Games is quite a feat.''
	   ``We think this budget wears well under close scrutiny,'' said
Roger Black, Corradini's representative. ``The deeper we get into
it, the more confidence we have.''
	   The third abstention came from Ken Bullock, the board
representative of the Utah League of Cities and Towns and a
frequent critic of Games planning. Bullock again voiced concerns
that the budget failed to ``prioritize'' its intent for the
greatest benefit of Utah's citizens.
	   ``We haven't really looked at what the Olympics will bring to
the citizens of this state,'' he said. ``The board has not
fulfilled its responsibilities for what the look and the feel of
the Games will be for our citizens and our children.
	   ``If this budget is a living document, as many have said, then
the approval process isn't that critical. ... There are problems
that still need to be solved.''
	   Bullock planned to meet with SLOC President Frank Joklik to
discuss his concerns.
	   The SLOC staff unveiled the proposed budget on Sept. 24, and it
has since been examined by representatives of local, state and
national government, as well as international Olympic officials.
	   The Salt Lake blueprint doesn't include dlrs 171 million in
transportation, security and Paralympics costs that organizers said
will be picked up by the federal government. Nor did Nagano's
budget include dlrs 500 million in government-funded venue
construction.
	   The Salt Lake spending plan covers 41 functions, such as medical
services or security; 200-plus projects, like the torch relay; 400
subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as tree plantings.
	   In other business, the committee awarded design and construction
contracts for the cover _ with a dramatic, externally supported
cable system _ which must be built on the speedskating oval. The
construction award was given to a company headed by Alan Layton, a
board trustee.
	   Layton told the board he hadn't been involved in negotiations
for the contract and left the meeting before the board voted. The
contract will be evaluated by an independent Olympic ethics
committee before gaining final approval.
	   Construction at the oval is expected to begin next April and
conclude by Nov. 2000.
	   ``We have a real interest in seeing this project go forward
quickly,'' U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz
told the board. ``It's very important to our athletes from a
training standpoint that we get this facility completed.''
	   The board also approved a design contract for the remaining
facilities at Soldier Hollow and approved a venue use agreement
between SLOC and the state for use of the Wasatch Mountain State
Park, where Soldier Hollow is located.
	   Construction at the venue, site of biathlon, cross country and
Nordic combined skiing, will start next spring and finish by Oct.
2000.

Grounded South Korean fishing boat sinks, causing fears for

environment

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A South Korean fishing ship that
grounded on rocks two days ago sank Thursday off Stewart Island,
causing fears of oil fouling the island's east coast and killing
wildlife.
	   Penguins, thousands of muttonbirds, brown kiwis, seals and a
wide range of other bird and sea life lived in the area where the
ship has sunk.
	   The Dong Won 529 hit rocks on Breaksea Islands on Tuesday and
its 38 crew were evacuated. Salvage experts and local authorities
have since been trying to figure out how to refloat the ship.
	   Some oil had leaked from the ship, but authorities did not know
how much or what type of oil it was, said the director of Maritime
Safety, Russell Kilvington.
	   A spill sighted by helicopters on Thursday was between 4-5 miles
(6-8 kilometers) long.
	   ``A little oil can actually go a long way geographically,''
Kilvington said. ``It could be _ by a long way _ the worst we have
ever had.''
	   People at the scene Thursday night were extremely surprised the
ship had sunk.
	   ``There was an attempt yesterday with a couple of tugs and a
number of fishing boats to pull the vessel off and they failed
completely. In fact ... the vessel didn't move at all,''
	   ``The salvors on behalf of the charterers Sanfords had been on
the vessel to probably a few minutes of it moving, and I don't
believe they had any view it was going to move,'' he said.
	   With 300 metric tons of fuel oil plus some hydraulic and
lubricating oil on board, wilder weather would be welcome to help
disperse the oil, Kilvington said.
	   ``That (fuel oil) does disperse quite readily, and in dispersed
quantities is not a major hazard, but certainly great lumps of it
will be harmful to wildlife,'' he said.
	   ``There are small quantities of lubricating oil, probably
hydraulic oil. That's relatively small in quantity, but very
harmful.''
	   Aerial spraying would probably be used to disperse any oil that
leaked from the vessel. Depending how deep the surrounding water
was, it might also be possible to pump oil off the vessel,
Kilvington said.
	   Divers on Friday began examination of the hull to find and plug
any holes from which oil was leaking.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A somber U.S. House of Representatives
authorized Thursday a wide-ranging impeachment inquiry of President
Bill Clinton, making him the third chief executive in history to
face the threat of being removed from office. The investigation was
approved by a 258-176 vote, with 31 Democrats joining majority
Republicans. After digesting the vote, Clinton made a brief
statement to reporters: ``I hope that we can now move forward with
this process in a way that is fair, that is constitutional and that
is timely.... It is not in my hands. It is in the hands of Congress
and the people of this country _ ultimately in the hands of God.
There is nothing I can do.'' (US-CLINTON-CONGRESS)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for
independence for the Serbian province of Kosovo declared a
unilateral cease-fire Thursday, putting more pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to end his crackdown. Tensions between
Milosevic and the United States, which is pressing for NATO
airstrikes against Serb-led troops, intensified as Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright declared Thursday in Brussels that time
was running out for the Yugoslav president to comply with U.N.
demands. A statement distributed by the Kosovo Liberation Army in
Kosovo's capital Pristina said the rebel command ``has decided to
refrain from all military activity'' starting Friday.
(YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A day after U.S. peacemakers praised
``a new spirit'' in the Middle East, Israeli troops shot and killed
a Palestinian rioter during clashes Thursday in the tensely divided
West Bank city of Hebron. Fifteen Palestinian stone throwers were
injured and a news photographer on assignment for a foreign news
agency was in serious condition after he was shot in the back of
the head with a rubber coated bullet. The violence, and assurances
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hard-liners in his
coalition government that he will not buckle under U.S. pressure at
next week's peace summit, hampered optimism that the sides were
close to ending 18 months of deadlock. (ISRAEL-HEBRON)
	   BANYOLES, Spain (AP) _ Overloading may have caused a tour boat
carrying about 140 people to sink Thursday, killing at least 20
French retirees in a tranquil lake in northeastern Spain. The
electrically powered catamaran sank under clear skies and in calm
waters as it set off at midmorning to circle Lake Banyoles, just
north of Barcelona and about 350 miles (550 kms) northeast of
Madrid. It was not immediately known what caused the boat to sink,
but a rescue official said authorities ``are working on the theory
that it was overloaded.'' (SPAIN-BOAT SINKS)
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Iran promised Thursday to do its best to
help resolve a military dispute between Turkey and Syria, warning
that an escalation of the crisis could harm the Islamic world.
Turkish leaders accuse Syria of sheltering Kurdish rebels, who
carry out cross-border attacks into Turkey. Syria denies the
accusation, and Turkey's harsh rhetoric has raised fears of a
regional conflict. Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, met in
Damascus on Thursday with Syria's President Hafez Assad for more
than an hour, the presidential spokesman said. (IRAN-TURKEY-SYRIA)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks made a dramatic comeback from a 240-point
plunge Thursday, ending slightly down after bargain hunters stepped
in to staunch the frenzied selling. The Dow closed down 9.78 points
_ or by 0.1 percent _ at 7,731.91 after dipping 240 points earlier
in the day. Broader stock indicators, which were again taking a
much bigger bruising than the Dow 30 industrial stocks, ended
lower. Technology, Internet and financial stocks suffered some of
the biggest losses. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The high-flying U.S. dollar plunged
dramatically for a second straight day, taking many U.S. stocks
down as well Thursday. The world's economic troubles hit closer to
home despite international officials' best efforts to prove they
are fighting back. The dollar suffered its biggest two-day drop
against the Japanese yen in 25 years as panic selling swept the
world's dlrs 1.5 trillion-a-day currency markets. The free fall was
blamed in large part on hedge funds, the once-obscure investments
favored by the wealthy. Hedge funds have been dumping dollars in
recent days on a belief it will weaken further as prospects for the
U.S. economy darken. The dollar is now worth nearly 20 percent less
versus the Japanese yen than at its August peak. (US-ECONOMIC
CRISIS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sagging consumer confidence nipped into sales
for many of the biggest U.S. retailers in September, leaving
department stores hurting but also boosting business for discount
and value-oriented merchants. It was the second straight month that
sales at many stores fell below expectations, raising concerns that
the upcoming holiday season may not be as good as many had
expected. This year began as one of the best in recent history for
retailers. A healthy economy, low inflation and unemployment
levels, and a surging stock market encouraged consumers to spend.
But signs that the economy's growth may be slowing, coupled with
continued volatility in the stock market and political turmoil in
Washington, has left many Americans worrying that the country may
be nearing a recession. (US-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Bank of England cut a key lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point Thursday, heeding hints from the British
government, pleas from manufacturers and predictions from
economists showing Britain nearing recession. Businesses welcomed
the cut, but demanded further reductions from the new 7.25 percent
repo rate _ the lowest rate at which the central bank loans money
to commercial banks _ to avoid factory closures and rising
unemployment. The modest rate cut was a marginal factor in the
sharp drop of the London Stock Exchange, Europe's largest, said
analyst David Hillier, chief United Kingdom economist at Barclays
Capital Group. (BRITAIN-INTEREST RATE)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Southeast Asian trade ministers
proposed a set of ``bold new measures'' Thursday aimed at restoring
economic confidence in the region, saying the sharp cuts in trade
and investment barriers they approved a day earlier were not
enough. The measures must still be studied and accepted by each
government. If approved, they would be announced at a summit of
leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in
December, the ministers said. On Wednesday, the ASEAN trade
ministers had set targets for reducing regional trade and
investment barriers to help Asia recover from its 15-month-old
financial storm. But they decided that additional measures were
needed because of alarm over a sharp drop in foreign investment in
the region. (ASEAN TRADE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The drop in world oil prices has caused a 13
percent drop in prices that Russia's giant Gazprom company could
charge for natural gas exports in the first half of this year,
compared to the same period in 1997, a top executive said Thursday.
By October, Gazprom export prices were 20 percent lower than during
the same time last year, said Yelena Garpel, head of Gazprom's
price-setting department. World gas prices are generally tied to
those of other energy sources, particularly those of crude oil, she
said. Garpel refused to provide average export prices, saying that
contracts varied greatly. (RUSSIA-GAS)

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Sylvester Stallone, David Cassidy, the
Culkins, congressman Sidney Yates. Some of the items may have moved
as separates. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ Sylvester Stallone checks his
tough-guy image at the front door of his home, which is full of _
of all things _ art.
	   The star of ``Rambo'' and ``Rocky'' movies is a connoisseur who
favors the old masters.
	   Stallone is refining his collection and offering the William
Adolphe Bouguereau painting ``Alma Parens'' for sale, Sotheby's
auction house spokeswoman Laura Mason said Wednesday.
	   Sotheby's described the painting ``Alma Parens'' as ``a young
idealized woman in a noble pose, offering her nurturing breast to
the children around her.''
	   The painting, valued at an estimated dlrs 2 million, will be
shown at Sotheby's in Beverly Hills on Oct. 16 and 17 and auctioned
Nov. 10 at Sotheby's New York.
	   ___
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ David Cassidy will end his two-year run as star
of ``EFX'' in December.
	   ``It's been a wild ride _ and a genuine pleasure,'' Cassidy said
Wednesday of the flashy musical at the MGM Grand hotel-casino. He
took over the lead role from Michael Crawford in 1996.
	   ``From day one, MGM Grand believed in me and my vision for this
show,'' said Cassidy. ``Together we created the biggest and best
production show on the planet.''
	   Cassidy, who is landing new fans with old ``Partridge Family''
hits, said he will spend time promoting his new CD, ``Old Trick,
New Dog'' and pursue concerts and TV projects.
	   MGM Grand has not announced a replacement for Cassidy.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Life without father has brought peace to the
Culkin household.
	   ``We're an entirely different family now. We're all happy,'' mom
Pat Brentrup told US magazine.
	   Brentrup lives in New York with six of her seven children,
including 16-year-old Kieran Culkin, the star of ``The Mighty'' and
next year's ``She's All That'' and ``The Cider House Rules.''
	   She won a bitter custody battle against the youngsters' father,
Kit Culkin, last year. Her son Macaulay, 18, has a nearby apartment
with his wife.
	   ___
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It's rare for a departing congressman to get a
sendoff from the whole U.S. National Symphony Orchestra _ 100
regular players, including a harp and two kettledrums. But Rep.
Sidney R. Yates, a Democrat and the oldest and longest-serving
member of the House, got just that.
	   Yates, 89, is not seeking re-election in the Chicago district
that first elected him in 1948. He has been noted in recent years
for his success in getting Congress to finance the National
Endowment for the Arts, despite a pledge by Republican leaders to
abolish it.
	   At the Kennedy Center performance Wednesday night, music
director Leonard Slatkin introduced Yates' 23-year-old grandson
Jonathan, a professional musician, who conducted the orchestra in
Mozart's overture to ``The Marriage of Figaro.''
	   The rest of the program was devoted to modern American music in
Yates' honor, by composers Leonard Bernstein, Samuel Barber, John
Adams and Richard Rogers.

Baghdad's book bazaar speaks volumes on Iraq's isolation

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Strolling down the middle of al-Mutanabbi
Street on a Friday feels like parting a sea of books.
	   Vendors at the weekly book market spread thousands of volumes on
plastic tablecloths that spill onto the pavement from sidewalks on
both sides of a 300-yard (meter) stretch of the downtown street.
	   Begun after the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on
Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, the bazaar is a bizarre mix of
novels, histories, outdated textbooks, aging magazines in French,
English and Arabic and tracts on long-forgotten crises.
	   The mishmash of aging books _ and collections just as old in
regular bookstores _ speaks volumes about intellectual life in
today's Iraq, whose citizens were once among the most voracious
readers in the Arab world.
	   Covers of some yellowing Arabic magazines from the 1940s show
Egypt's late King Farouk. In nearby piles are a 1983 American
chemistry text, a Jackie Kennedy biography, a comic book ``War of
the Worlds,'' and ``The Assassination Attempts on President Saddam
Hussein,'' written by a cousin of the Iraqi leader.
	   Books were included under the trade embargo, which will not be
lifted until U.N. arms inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction and its programs for producing
them.
	   But since the sanctions also severely limit the export of oil,
Iraq's major money earner, little cash would be available for books
even if they weren't covered by the embargo.
	   ``There is no doubt the sanctions ... left a mark on the
cultural life,'' said Hamid Saeed, the government's deputy minister
for culture and information. ``They did not affect the wish to
read, but the problem lies in that books no longer enter Iraq.''
	   Saeed said Iraq's National Company for Printing and Distribution
imported 12.5 million books in 1988 for a population of 18 million.
Few have been imported since, except for 100,000 copies shipped in
by participants at a 1996 book fair.
	   The culture ministry has cut the number of titles it prints from
more than 300 yearly in the 1980s to only 100 a year now. The books
must be no longer than 160 pages because of shortages in paper and
ink, Saeed said.
	   The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has
provided some textbooks, but average Iraqi readers must fend for
themselves.
	   University professors say they cannot keep up with developments
in fields from literature to brain surgery. Those lucky enough to
have relatives abroad ask them for needed titles. The rest make do
with grubby photocopies, or used books.
	   Students lag behind their counterparts in other countries,
especially since the Internet also is not available due to Iraq's
feeble communications network.
	   Thus, many readers turn to al-Mutanabbi Street _ named for a
revered Iraqi poet of the 10th century _ to search for something
new or at least a bargain on some rare, old book.
	   The Friday market feeds largely on private libraries sold by
families struggling to make ends meet. One book seller said the
heirs of a literature professor recently sold his 3,000-book
library for 1.4 million dinars (dlrs 800).
	   Although the market has good deals, some also can strain an
Iraqi household's budget.
	   A book on surgical techniques sold for 14,000 dinars (dlrs 8),
more than half the monthly salary of a senior government employee.
A rare new issue of the British news magazine The Economist cost
1,500 dinars (90 cents), nearly the price of a chicken.
	   The government fears rare books _ some even four or five
centuries old _ are being spirited out of Iraq by people who scour
the book bazaar. So the Saddam Center for Manuscripts is
encouraging citizens to sell their heirlooms to it.
	   The center's head, Osama al-Naqeshbandi, said he recently bought
a 400-year-old manuscript from a family for 8 million dinars, or
about dlrs 4,700.
	   That is a lot of money in Iraq, but the price probably was far
less than the book could have fetched if it had been smuggled out
to a collector abroad.

Bellagio, the world's costliest hotel

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ First it was illusionists Siegfried and Roy and
their mystical white tigers. Then it was pirate sea battles in the
middle of the desert.
	   Now, gambling mogul Steve Wynn, who counts Walt Disney among his
heros, is betting dlrs 1.9 billion that the masters _ Van Gogh,
Monet, Renoir and Picasso _ will entice more high-rollers to the
Las Vegas Strip.
	   Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., opens his long-awaited
Bellagio hotel-casino Oct. 15. During a tour of the resort
Wednesday, he promised that Bellagio, which includes dlrs 300
million in art masterpieces and resembles a small, elegant city,
will be ``an alternative to Paris.''
	   It is, according to Warren Marr, gambling consultant for
PricewaterhouseCooper, the most expensive hotel ever built. But
industry analysts believe Wynn's latest creation will be a success.
	   Bellagio is named after a picturesque town on Lake Como in
Italy. The idea for the name came when Wynn, his wife, Elaine, and
friends Paul and Anne Anka happened on the town while on vacation.
	   Fronted by an 11-acre (4.5-hectare) lake, the 36-story resort is
reached by a winding road that climbs up from the Strip. Off the
main lobby is a conservatory five stories tall with settings that
change with the seasons, and nearby is the Bellagio Gallery of Fine
Art. Wynn has spent some dlrs 300 million on the artwork, half of
it from a personal fortune valued at dlrs 500 million.
	   A dozen restaurants overlook the lake or one of five swimming
pools, and are run by some of the top restaurateurs in the country.
They include Le Cirque and Circo from New York, Olives from Boston
and Aqua from San Francisco.
	   One of the restaurants, Picasso, features works by the master.
During Wednesday's tour, Ted Pillsbury, former director of the
Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, and now a consultant to
Wynn, supervised the hanging of one of the paintings.
	   With retail sales a growing factor in Las Vegas, Wynn has also
made deals with some the top names in the fashion industry for his
Via Bellagio, an avenue of pricey shops including Armani, Chanel,
Gucci, Tiffany, Chanel, Moschino and Prada.
	   One section of the casino is reserved for the resort's casino
customers, heavy hitters with credit limits that run as high as
dlrs 10 million, Wynn said. The games range from baccarat to high
limit slots that include dlrs 1,000 machines.
	   The casino customers have their own elegant check-in area and
private elevators to whisk them to the 400 suites in the 3,025-room
resort.
	   Jason Ader, senior managing director for Bear, Stearns and a
leading analyst for the casino industry, believes Bellagio will be
a ``must-see attraction'' that will draw more visitors, mainly
coveted casino customers who are often referred to as high-rollers
or whales.
	   A dearth of whales in recent months has hammered profits at many
of the city's upscale hotels, including the Mirage. Ader said the
question is whether Bellagio's snaring casino customers will
cannibalize the Mirage and other high-end properties.
	   ``If you're one of the guys competing against Bellagio, batten
down the hatches, because it's going to be a rough ride,'' said
Bruce Turner, gambling analyst for Salomon Brothers.
	   Ader said Bellagio ``will be among the nicest of the five-star
resorts in the country. The amenities will be over-the-top,
compared to resorts they compete with.''
	   The sharp decline in the stock market and the economic problems
in Asian and other countries has reduced the amount of money
available for leisure activities, and that's ``just one more
challenge the industry faces,'' Ader said. Still, he added, ``I
wouldn't make a bet against Steve Wynn.''
	   Wynn said the idea from the start was that Bellagio would expand
the Las Vegas market to a new level.
	   Standard room rates at Bellagio range from dlrs 159 to dlrs 459.
Alan Feldman, Mirage vice president of public affairs, said
reservations are running ahead of levels when the company opened
the Mirage and Treasure Island resorts.
	   Wynn signed illusionists Siegfried and Roy to open the Mirage
and they made box office history as the country's highest-grossing
show. When he opened Treasure Island in 1993 he concocted a pirate
sea battle in front of the hotel that draws millions annually, then
signed with Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil to produce ``Mystere''
at the resort.
	   He's turned to Cirque again to produce ``O'' at Bellagio, a
stage spectacular featuring a cast of 74 synchronized swimmers,
divers, acrobats and aerialists in a setting that includes 1.5
million gallons (5.7 million liters) of water.

	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ John Daly is compiling an Old
Course record to be proud of. Colin Montgomerie has one he'd rather
forget.
	   British Open titlist at St. Andrews in 1995, Daly already has
one Dunhill Cup title at the home of golf and, after his 3-stroke
victory over in-form Lee Westwood Thursday, has won five of his six
matches in the competition.
	   Daly helped Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara score a impressive 3-0
Group 1 victory over Westwood's England team after carding a 70.
Woods had a bogey-free 66 to beat David Carter by eight and Masters
and British Open titlist O'Meara returned a 67 to beat Peter Baker
by seven.
	   They were the sort of scores Montgomerie hoped for as he faced
up to Zhang Lian-wei, leading player of the debutant Chinese team.
	   But Europe's No. 1 player for the past five years managed to
lose his match after a 1-over 73. Zhang made level par 72 despite
bogeys at the last two holes, and joins a list of now famous
outsiders who have topped the talented Scot at the home of golf.
	   Remember Raul Fretes of Paraguay? He beat Montgomerie by one
stroke when the Paraguayans upset the Scots in the 1993 Dunhill
Cup.
	   And how about India's Gaurav Ghei? He downed Monty when the Scot
managed only a 79 when India scored a 2-1 victory over the
defending titlist in '96.
	   Fortunately for Montgomerie this time, Gary Orr and Andrew
Coltart won their matches to make sure Scotland beat China 2-1 and
go into Friday's match against Ireland hopeful of a place in the
final stages.
	   ``I would say my colleagues helped me out a lot,'' Montgomerie
said. ``He played better on the day. There's no excuses. I'm just
glad that Gary and Andrew pulled through.''
	   Daly, who scored a Dunhill Cup triumph in 1993, didn't need any
help from Woods and O'Meara.
	   Going out first against Westwood, who has recently climbed to
eighth on the world rankings, he drove wildly into pot bunkers and
bushes to fall behind with bogeys at five and six.
	   But he pulled his fragile game together to collect birdies at
the 9th, 10th, 12th and 14th and move ahead of the Englishman whose
hopes were dashed by a drive out of bounds at the Road Hole, the
17th.
	   Daly's form has been erratic during his long period of recovery
from alcohol and gambling addiction and his colleagues paid tribute
to him after his victory over Westwood.
	   ``What gave me a big boost was seeing John out there playing
well and when he got ahead of Lee that fired me up,'' Woods said.
``More than anything I had extra motivation seeing John out there
doing really well.''
	   O'Meara, whose team faced Japan in Friday's group games, said
that Daly's performance justified his decision to put him up
against the English team's leading player.
	   ``He's proven to me he had get the job done,'' O'Meara said.
``He can play whoever he wants to now.''

	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The main challenger to Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso broke his post-electoral
silence Thursday, saying he would continue to oppose the
government.
	   ``Once more, we will be a relentless opposition and there will
be no truce starting now,'' said Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who
suffered his third consecutive defeat as the presidential candidate
for the leftist Workers Party.
	   With most of the votes counted, Lula won 31 percent of the valid
vote to Cardoso's 53 percent.
	   Lula said the party's main task now is to work for victory in
state government elections. The second round of voting will take
place Oct. 25.
	   ___
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The leaders of Peru and Ecuador said
Thursday that talks aimed at ending a border dispute had reached an
impasse and asked the countries guaranteeing the peace negotiations
to intervene.
	   President Alberto Fujimori of Peru and his Ecuadorean
counterpart, President Jamil Mahuad, arrived in Brasilia on
Wednesday to discuss the dispute over a remote stretch of sparsely
unpopulated mountain jungle.
	   After two days of negotiations without reaching an agreement,
the two sides asked United States, Brazil, Argentina and Chile to
intervene.
	   Fujimori and Mahuad will now travel to Washington to meet with
President Clinton on Friday to discuss the situation and ask for
his help.
	   The conflict dates to 1941, when Peru and Ecuador fought a war
along the Pacific coast at a time when their jungle border was
undefined. Since then, Peru and Ecuador have fought two wars over
the area, in 1981 and 1995.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana is plunging
into peace negotiations with leftist rebels without trying to curb
human rights abuses by Colombia's warring parties, a human rights
group said Thursday.
	   ``Unfortunately the topic of human rights still doesn't figure
clearly, in unequivocal terms, in the agenda of negotiations,'' the
director of Human Rights Watch/Americas, Jose Miguel Vivanco, told
a news conference.
	   Colombia's civil conflict claimed the lives of 1,250 combatants
last year and there were 2,183 political killings, a 230-page
report released by the group said.
	   Vivanco also said Colombia's military tolerates the activities
of landowner-based paramilitary groups, which are responsible for
more than two-thirds of the nation's human rights violations.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The second of three brothers who allegedly
headed the world's biggest amphetamine ring has been released on
orders from an appeals court.
	   But Luis Amezcua Contreras was immediately re-arrested Wednesday
for extradition to the United States, where he and his brother
Jesus are wanted for drug-related crimes.
	   Earlier this week, the appeals court in the western city of
Guadalajara ruled there was insufficient evidence to convict Luis
Amezcua on charges of criminal association, money laundering and
tax evasion.
	   He was freed from prison but immediately brought to Mexico City
to face the extradition proceedings.
	   Investigators say Luis, Jesus and a third brother, Adan, headed
the Colima Cartel, considered the world's biggest methamphetamine
and ephedrine trafficking operation, stretching from Mexico and
California, to India and Germany.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Leaders of Mexico's 1968 democracy movement
filed a complaint with federal prosecutors, accusing former Mexican
leaders of planning to massacre students, a Mexico City daily said
Thursday.
	   Some 300 people are believed to have been killed in the Oct. 2,
1968, massacre in Mexico City, according to human rights groups.
The government has maintained that only 30 to 40 people died and
that student protesters opened fire first.
	   The complaint alleges the police and military assault on unarmed
protesters was ``planned, directed, coordinated and executed by
officials of the federal government,'' the report said.
	   Top government and military files on the massacre remain sealed
despite growing calls for their release.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Venezuelan airline ALAS has opened its
first office in Cuba.
	   ALAS began service to Havana on April 15, with five flights to
the Cuban capital weekly. The airline now transports about 3,500
people to Cuba monthly, the Cuban news agency said.
	   The new office will open at the island's international airport.
	   The addition of a new airline is a major event in Cuba, whose
dependence on tourism has grown in recent years.
	   The British government this week was expected to sign an air
transport agreement with Cuba to allow British Airways to fly to
the Caribbean island for the first time, Cuba's Prensa Latina news
agency said in a dispatch monitored in Mexico.
	   Cuba still is struggling to recover from an economic crisis that
started when the former Soviet bloc collapsed and the communist
island lost its most important trade partners.

	   PRILUZJE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ ``No Serb has crossed to the other
side since last year,'' said Zoran Kostic, pointing to the far bank
of the Sitnica River from a defensive bunker on a dike at the edge
of this village in embattled Kosovo province.
	   His Albanian neighbors have made it too dangerous for Serbs like
Kostic to cross. As if to illustrate the point, the sound of a
single gunshot echoed across the fields.
	   While the world is preoccupied with the fate of the Albanian
majority in Kosovo, Serbs clustered in small communities like this
are also frightened, worried about their families, wondering how
they will get their crops in and what tomorrow will bring.
	   A Priluzje man was shot and wounded Tuesday as he fled from what
were believed to be members of the Kosovo Liberation army, an
ill-organized force of ethnic Albanian guerrilla fighters
struggling for independence from Serbia, the main republic of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   Following a harsh crackdown on the separatists by Yugoslav
forces in recent months, U.S.-led NATO forces are considering a
military strike on Serbian targets.
	   Kostic, 48, is the man who organized the defense of Priluzje,
about 20 kilometers (15 miles) northwest of Pristina, the
provincial capital. He supervised the digging of bunkers on the
dike along the Sitnica and planned the rotation of lookouts _
usually old men with shotguns and hunting rifles during the day and
young, better-equipped men after nightfall.
	   On the other side of the river lies more than 200 hectares (500
acres) of Serb farmland. No barley or wheat or corn will be brought
in this year.
	   ``They were shooting at me from our own land,'' said an agitated
Dusan Milic, an aging Serb with gray stubble, as he crept slowly
along the dike with the help of a rugged stick. ``In 1941 the
Albanians killed an entire Yugoslav Army regiment in the hills. And
a lot of partisans were killed by Albanians in 1944.''
	   The Serbs here have always lived among the ethnic Albanians. But
things that started going wrong in 1989 got really bad this
February when fighting broke out between government forces and
small bands of guerrillas.
	   ``We were not the biggest friends on the earth, but we did
business together,'' said Kostic. ``So in that sense, there was an
interchange.''
	   At the end of a deeply rutted dirt road just outside the village
of Bukos, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the north, Rade Bozovic
and his cousin sat terrified in an attic, rifles in hand, as about
50 or 60 KLA fighters walked by his house last week.
	   ``I didn't know if it was my responsibility to shoot them or
not,'' he said. He had sent his 90-year-old father and four
children walking quickly toward Bukos, just over the hill from the
rural Bozovic home.
	   He and his cousin decided their only duty was to protect their
families, so they waited quietly until the KLA men passed by. The
KLA didn't shoot. Neither did Bozovic.
	   The KLA, he said, infest the hills above his house. When they
need supplies, they change into civilian clothes and walk to a
nearby town below.
	   ``They all know each other,'' he said.
	   Asked if he is afraid, Bozovic turned his head slowly and gazed
hard at his interlocutor.
	   ``Yes, I'm afraid,'' he said, cracking walnuts in his hand,
looking down the slope. ``I'm afraid of the terrorists. I'm afraid
of NATO. NATO would hit the power plant near here. And they are not
that accurate.''
	   He points to a white house on the next rise, a neat bungalow
surrounded by fruit trees. It's an Albanian family, he says. He has
no problem with his neighbor. And his neighbor has no problem with
him.
	   ``We wouldn't have any problems at all, but the West hates us.
The problems come because the British, the French and the Americans
hate us.''
	   He nods down the slope to a clump of trees at the edge of his
property.
	   ``If NATO comes, we will handcuff you to those willows as a
human shield,'' he tells his American visitor, not the slightest
trace of a smile visible on his lips.

Dollar drops against yen, Japanese stocks mixed in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped against the yen early
Friday in Tokyo, after sharp swings in global markets driven by
hedge funds overnight. Japanese stock prices turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 118.18 yen in early trading, down 4.18 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 119.05 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.40 points, or 0.38
percent, to 13,075.46. On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed at
13,026.06 points, down 5.78 percent or 799.55 points _ its largest
point fall this year.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa attributed the rapid fall in
the dollar this week in part to a correction in the Japanese
currency's weakness, hinting that there will be no central bank
intervention for now on the foreign exchange market.
	   ``The yen has continued to decline since September of last year.
We're now at a time where it's acceptable to see a correction to
that. But the dollar's recent fall is a bit rough,'' Miyazawa told
a regular news conference.
	   ``For now I don't think foreign exchange intervention is
necessary,'' Miyazawa said.
	   The dollar's weakness followed a 7-percent plunge against the
yen in New York Thursday before recovering for a much smaller loss
as hedge funds unwound large positions in a very volatile market.
	   The sharp fall, which began Wednesday on expectations of Japan's
fiscal stimulus measures, was only interrupted by rumors the U.S.
Federal Reserve was posed to intervene to temper the dollar's
slide.
	   In New York on Thursday, the dollar careened 10 yen down, then
six yen up, to finally settle at only about one yen lower on the
day.
	   The dollar's fluctuations were matched by those in the U.S.
stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones industrial average was down
by 275 points at its intraday low on Thursday and the benchmark
30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down more than 2 points.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices were largely lower as
export and blue chip issues were sold in reaction to the stronger
yen. A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad.
	   ``The apparent weakening of the U.S. economy is also drawing
selling of export shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of
trading at Tokyo Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 6.10 points, or 0.61 percent, to 995.40. The
TOPIX closed down 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.805 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.785 percent, driving its price down to 108.93 yen from 109.13
yen.

Another hurdle for Darryl Strawberry

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tears welled up in Darryl Strawberry's eyes and
for a moment he had to stop to wipe them away and compose himself.
There was no shame in that, not for a 36-year-old man facing cancer
surgery.
	   At that poignant moment, the human side of Strawberry was out
there, displayed for all the world to see. It was an emotional, sad
peek into the soul of a star, a moment when Strawberry was just
another guy, trying to summon the courage to face the biggest
challenge of his life.
	   Too often, athletes are viewed as some kind of special species,
immune from the daily grind that the rest of the population faces.
They are celebrated, hailed really, because they are blessed with
special skills and talents others envy.
	   Then, every so often, something bad happens, something that
leaves them vulnerable, just like everybody else. People forget
that athletes are subject to the fragile balance of life. That
overlooked element gets lost in the cheers and is found again at
times of travail.
	   Strawberry found that balance in his diagnosis _ colon cancer.
	   He has been down this path before, too often, in fact. There
were alcohol and drug problems, followed by tax troubles, much of
it grief he brought upon himself.
	   There was back surgery at what should have been the most
productive time of his career. There was enough baggage that no
team was interested in a guy who had become a baseball vagabond
after once being one of the game's most feared sluggers. Whole
seasons went up in smoke, erased by choice or chance.
	   Strawberry seemed used up early, assigned to baseball's scrap
heap, playing for peanuts with the St. Paul Saints in the Northern
League, an independent operation that functions as a court of last
resort.
	   To his credit, he pressed on, convinced that he could still
play. Eventually, the New York Yankees agreed. On July 4, 1996,
owner George Steinbrenner gave himself a birthday present and
signed Strawberry as a spare part on a Yankees team that would win
the World Series.
	   He became what manager Joe Torre calls ``the Straw Factor'' a
sort of folk hero in the Bronx, remembered for his first baseball
incarnation as a teen-age slugger with the New York Mets, welcomed
back in the twilight of his career as an old friend who had
overcome some hard times.
	   He was limited to 11 games last year because of a cranky knee
but refused to go away, fighting through it to win a spot on this
year's team.
	   Strawberry seemed reborn in Yankee Stadium, a senior statesman
on the team who still could swing a productive bat. He hit 24 home
runs in 295 at-bats this season, despite a persistent pain in his
stomach.
	   Everybody has gone through that experience, a twinge here, an
ache there, something that will eventually go away.
	   This pain didn't go away.
	   Cleveland pitcher Dwight Gooden, an old pal from their days
together, first with the Mets and then with the Yankees, recalled a
midsummer conversation with Strawberry.
	   ``When we saw him the last time we were here,'' Gooden said,
``he mentioned about having some pain in his stomach and he wanted
to get checked out, but he wasn't sure he could get through it.''
	   Strawberry knew this was no ordinary baseball injury, no simple
sprain or strain. And like so many people, he tried to put it out
of his mind.
	   When the pain and worry became too much, he decided to find out
once and for all just what was wrong.
	   Cancer.
	   The Yankees stitched Strawberry's No. 39 on the back of their
caps. In San Diego, ex-teammate Jim Leyritz put the number of his
cap. Bartolo Colon of the Indians did the same.
	   It was baseball reaching out to one of its own. Perhaps Gooden
put it best.
	   ``I met Darryl in '83,'' he said. ``We became very close after
that, especially the time we spent with the Mets, and you care more
for a guy off the field than you do on the field because baseball
is going to be here. We have to live our life after that. So any
time you see a good friend like that go through something like
that, it is very touching and you feel for that person.''
	   Within days of his diagnosis, Strawberry had surgery, a long,
complicated operation that removed the tumor and part of his large
intestine.
	   And hours before the operation, Darryl Strawberry cried, tears
for himself and his family, tears for all the troubled times he had
put himself through before, and tears for all the difficult ones he
faces now.

Italian confidence vote too close to call

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The survival of Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
coalition has come down to at most a handful of deputies, making
Friday's confidence vote too close to call.
	   Italy's second-longest lasting government since World War II had
a fighting chance after a faction of hard-line Communists earlier
in the week defied their leader and decided to back Prodi, despite
strong displeasure over the proposed 1999 budget.
	   A confidence vote requires one more than half of those voting.
Because by tradition the president of the 630-member Chamber does
not vote, if all show up, 315 yes votes does the trick.
	   By most observers' counts, Prodi could count on 312 or 313 votes
by Thursday night, possibly already enough if some deputies don't
show up for illness.
	   Prodi's coalition had depended throughout its two years and five
months in office on Communist Refoundation votes for a majority in
the lower Chamber of Deputies.
	   But on Sunday, Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti and his
loyalists decided to stop supporting the government.
	   Then the party's second in command, Armando Cossutta, led a
split of Refoundation followers, giving Prodi a shot at winning.
	   To woo the Communists, Prodi pledged that his government would
work to make law Refoundation's pet project -- a 35-hour work week
-- and stood back Thursday from endorsing NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia without specific backing from the U.N. Security Council,
as Cossutta has demanded.
	   As the confidence vote approached, Prodi was also hoping to pick
up the extra votes he needed from former Christian Democrats.
	   The opposition Northern League, whose recent local losses have
made it wary of early elections, was expected to abstain.
	   Former Chamber president Irene Pivetti, who is in the
opposition, said Thursday she would have backed Prodi but her
newborn baby she is nursing wasn't up to making the trip from her
home in Milan to Rome for the vote.

UN nuclear report faulted for ignoring allegations by former
</HEADLINE>
inspector &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A nonproliferation advocacy group faulted
the U.N. nuclear agency for ignoring in a major report recent
claims that Iraq possess nuclear bomb components.
	   The Nuclear Control Institute also criticized a major six-month
report by the International Atomic Energy Agency for downplaying
the significance of a decision by Iraq that has halted weapons
inspections for two months.
	   ``This is the most embarrassing and indefensible of the IAEA
reports on Iraq,'' the group's president Paul Leventhal, said
Thursday in a statement.
	   In its report, the IAEA repeated its previous claims that it
hadn't detected any prohibited nuclear materials, equipment or
activities during inspections over the past six months.
	   While saying clarifications and inconsistencies about Iraq's
nuclear weapons program still need to be resolved, the IAEA said
the gaps could be filled over the course of a long-term monitoring
program rather than through intrusive inspections.
	   ``These verification activities have revealed no indications
that Iraq had achieved its program objective of producing nuclear
weapons or that Iraq had produced more than a few grams of
weapon-usable nuclear material or had clandestinely acquired such
material,'' the report said.
	   Last month, a former U.N. arms expert, Scott Ritter, told a U.S.
congressional hearing that U.N. intelligence information indicated
that Iraq has components necessary for three nuclear weapons and
that it lacks only the fissile material to make them.
	   The IAEA's suggestion that nuclear inspections be exchanged for
monitoring ``is insupportable in light of intelligence,'' Leventhal
said. ``It's like putting a convicted felon up for parole who's
packing a gun that lacks only bullets.''
	   U.N. arms experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
long-range missiles and chemical, biological and nuclear weapons
before the Security Council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq halted cooperation with inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Iraq had
destroyed its banned weapons.
	   Permanent council members Russia, France and China have strongly
advocated switching nuclear inspections over to long-term
monitoring, arguing that they have a credible picture of Iraq's
nuclear weapons capabilities.
	   They were expected to have made a push to close the so-called
nuclear file this month, based on the IAEA report. But the council
last month suspended all regular reviews of U.N. sanctions to
punish Iraq for its Aug. 5 decision.
	   The IAEA report said that in light of the Aug. 5 decision, its
inspectors hadn't been able to interview Iraqis about the country's
clandestine nuclear program. It said the decision ``significantly
reduces the effectiveness'' of the monitoring program and the level
of assurances it can provide.
	   A team will visit Iraq later this month to discuss the adequacy
of Iraq's declarations about its weapons plans and clarify the
remaining inconsistencies, the IAEA report said.

Officials suspect deal may never be implemented

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ With a Mideast summit looming and
violence in the streets, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
trying to beat the clock and agree on a deal hinged on so many
conditions that some fear it may never be carried out.
	   In Jerusalem Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
failed to solve a host of secondary issues they must complete to
let their bosses tackle the more difficult ones at a summit next
week in the United States with President Bill Clinton.
	   At the talks, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat are to complete a deal that would pull
Israeli troops out of 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
security guarantees from the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu has said that he would only leave the areas if
Arafat's government can guarantee that it will take serious action
against Islamic militants and that it can prevent terrorists from
operating in areas in its control.
	   The Palestinians, who already control about one-quarter of the
West Bank, including major population centers, maintain they are
fighting terrorism. They want assurances that after they sign a
deal, Israel will keep its side of the bargain and carry out a long
overdue troops withdrawal it promised more than a year ago.
	   Under past agreements, Israel was to have completed three
separate withdrawals from the West Bank, where the Palestinians
hope to establish an independent country.
	   But no withdrawals have been carried out, Netanyahu has pledged
to continue expanding Israeli settlements, and Israel will not show
the Palestinians map of the planned withdrawal. All this has left
the Palestinians deeply suspicious.
	   `We want guarantees that any agreement reached will be
implemented,'' said senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   The Israelis harbor similar concerns. One key Israeli demand is
for the PLO to remove sections of its charter calling for the
destruction of Israel. The Palestinians have said the Palestine
National Council, their parliament in exile, voted to effectively
revoke those clauses. But Israel says the vote was ambiguous; the
older charter is the version still posted on Palestinian Internet
web sites.
	   Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, a confidant of the prime
minister, said the Palestinians must change the charter to show the
Israeli public they have truly embraced peace.
	   ``Today, we demand from our former adversary only what we
demanded of ourselves _ the genuine transformation in attitudes
that is the foundation of real peace,'' Sharansky wrote in an
editorial in the Jerusalem Post.
	   ``For Israelis, that required a national consensus against
ruling another people. For Palestinians, it means expunging from
the public consciousness the desire to eradicate the Jewish
state,'' he said
	   During her visit to the region this week, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said that after months of deadlock, the
two sides were demonstrating a new spirit and willingness to move
forward with a deal. Agreement was reached in several areas, but
Erekat said issues important to the Palestinians such as the
operation of its airport and prisoner releases, will have to wait
for Washington to be solved.
	   Even as negotiations took place Thursday, violence raged in the
tense West Bank city of Hebron, where Israeli troops shot and
killed a Palestinian rioter and seriously wounded a Palestinian
photographer working for a foreign news agency.
	   The violence was touched off by a call from Arafat's Fatah party
to strike in protest of Israel's blockade of Palestinian areas.
Israel imposed the blockade, which prevents Palestinians from
reaching jobs inside Israel, in fear of attacks by Islamic
militants.
	   In a leaflet circulated throughout the West Bank, Fatah called
for further unrest Friday, until Israel ``shows their real desire
for peace.''

Homosexual rights bill awaits debate in France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECAPS pvs.
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is attempting to calm
debate on an explosive bill that would give homosexuals and
unmarried couples legal status _ a move opponents fear will
undermine the family and lead to adoptions by gay couples.
	   ``If there were not so much passion, I think we would have
advanced with much less trouble,'' Jospin said Thursday, a day
before French lawmakers debate the bill . ``Opponents are creating
problems where there are none.''
	   ``Marriage is an institution ... and will remain so,'' he
assured in an interview on state-run television. ``Adoption (by
homosexuals) is forbidden and will remain so.''
	   Homosexual couples will still be forbidden to have children
through artificial procreation, Jospin said.
	   The so-called Civil Solidarity Pact is sponsored by Jospin's
Socialist camp, which has a large majority in the 577-seat National
Assembly. The legislation is likely to be heavily amended, but
still become law.
	   Known as PACS, it provides fiscal and social advantages to
homosexual couples and unwed heterosexual couples. It reaches the
National Assembly after a decade of lobbying by homosexual groups
and heated debate over the issue.
	   Religious leaders _ Roman Catholic, Jewish and Muslim _ oppose
PACS, along with most rightist politicians and various associations
in favor of the family or against abortion.
	   They all fear such a law would diminish marriage by giving the
state's blessing to unions that are not marriage between
heterosexuals.
	   Various lifestyles ``should not become, via the law, social
references,'' Catholic bishops have said, calling the bill
``useless and dangerous.''
	   ``Marriage isn't a simple contract or a private affair, but
constitutes one of the fundamental structures of society,
maintaining its coherence,'' the bishops said.
	   For Jospin, the bill simply ``takes into account the evolution
of society.''
	   Today, in France, some 4.4 million heterosexual couples live
together outside marriage. There is no known figure for homosexual
couples.
	   The bill is aimed at resolving fiscal, social and inheritance
problems for those groups.
	   Among other things, it would allow those subscribing to the
Civil Solidarity Pact to file joint tax returns, diminishing the
tax burden; bequeath more money to the partner through a lightening
of the inheritance tax load; and provide all the benefits of
married people at the work place. That includes allowing for the
same vacation time and time off for both in moments of bereavement.
	   It also would allow a homosexual to benefit from his partner's
social security coverage.
	   Any two unrelated people, even friends, can enter a PACS union,
which can be ended at will, by marriage or death.

Nicklaus at crossroads: Ailing hip, troubled business empire

<TEXT>
	   PALM COAST, Florida (AP) _ Jack Nicklaus was getting tired.
	   Walking 10 miles (16 kilometers) through the Arizona mountains
bow-hunting elk last week was no problem. He also can spend an hour
on the driving range without pain in his hip or creaks in the rest
of his 58-year-old bones.
	   ``I can hit golf balls all I want. And I can walk,'' he said.
``But the two of them _ they don't like each other.''
	   Still, Nicklaus is always up to the challenge _ 227 yards (207
meters) to the flag on the 16th hole, a slight breeze in his face
and the flag positioned back left, guarded by a deep bunker.
	   He was playing alone and in pain in the ceremonial first round
at Grand Haven, his newest course. But satisfaction came in knowing
that Nicklaus Design is thriving _ 164 golf courses worldwide, 56
others under construction.
	   And it momentarily took his mind off the public portion of his
business empire, which is in shambles.
	   ``We'll make this 2-iron like a 1-iron, take it in to the right
with a little draw,'' Nicklaus told about 100 people following him
on a hot, muggy afternoon.
	   A slight waggle at address. Lips pursed in determination as he
stood over the ball. The flying right elbow and familiar follow
through.
	   Vintage Nicklaus. Perfect shot.
	   At times, Nicklaus looks like he can conquer the world, as he
almost did at the Masters six months ago when he made yet another
Sunday charge up the leaderboard before finishing sixth, two
strokes ahead of Tiger Woods.
	   And yet, to see him hobble to the cart is a painful reminder why
he ended his record run in the majors _ 146 in a row, 154 for which
he was eligible _ and why he won't play another competitive round
this year.
	   In golf and business, Nicklaus has seen both ends of the
spectrum in 1998.
	   ``I've had a fair year playing golf, and I've had bad things at
the end of the year,'' he said. ``One of my businesses is the best
it has ever been and one is the worst it could ever be. I've had a
lot of good things and a lot of terrible things. But it's all part
of life.''
	   And once again, Nicklaus is in dire need of one of his trademark
comebacks.
	   ``We're going to survive this,'' he said. ``People don't think
we are, but we'll survive it and we'll move on.''
	   It is hard not to believe him because Nicklaus always finds a
way. He got one of his 70 victories on the PGA Tour by closing with
five straight birdies to win by a stroke at the 1978 Inverrary
Classic. One of his 18 majors came at the 1975 Masters, when he
somehow sank a 40-foot (12-meter) putt on the 70th hole.
	   ``Jack knew he was going to beat you,'' Tom Weiskopf once said.
``You knew Jack was going to beat you. And Jack knew that you knew
he was going to beat you.''
	   Only the task is a little tougher this time, and it will take
much more than simply pulling a 1-iron from the bag and knocking
down the stick on the 17th at Pebble Beach.
	   Golf World magazine last month and the November issue of Golf
Digest, which hits the newsstands Monday, reveal a pattern of
business problems for Nicklaus. The latest crisis probably will be
played out in court.
	   Two years ago, Nicklaus spun off Golden Bear Golf Inc. from his
privately held Golden Bear International and raised dlrs 36 million
through an initial public offering. The main profit center of the
public company would be Paragon Construction International, which
would actually build the golf courses that Nicklaus designed.
	   The stock opened at dlrs 16 and rose to a high of dlrs 22.50
before it began a free fall _ dlrs 9 in autumn 1997 and dlrs 4 this
summer before the bottom fell out.
	   A review of Paragon contracts forced Golden Bear Golf to restate
its 1997 losses from dlrs 2.9 million to dlrs 24.7 million. NASDAQ
suspended trading of the stock (JACK) on July 27 and lawsuits by
shareholders followed. As chairman, Nicklaus cannot detail what
went wrong.
	   The last time Nicklaus faced a financial burden _ he racked up
about dlrs 150 million in debt in the mid-1980s, according to Golf
World _ he escaped with help from his incredible win at the 1986
Masters.
	   But along with his business, Nicklaus also is in the middle of a
health crisis.
	   His deteriorating left hip is one reason he decided to back out
of his remaining commitments this year _ a Shell's Wonderful World
of Golf match Oct. 28 against Gary Player, the Shark Shootout in
November and the Three-Tour Challenge.
	   Hip replacement surgery is not in the forecast. At least not
yet. Dr. Peter Egoscue has prescribed a rigorous exercise routine
designed to strengthen muscles. In one of them, Nicklaus sits in a
chair with his hands behind his back and a block between his legs,
then tries to stand up without moving forward.
	   If he feels the muscles in his hip and lower back region are
stronger, he won't need surgery. If not, he'll have the hip
replacement and hope he recovers by 2000, which probably will be
his farewell tour at Pebble Beach (U.S. Open) and St. Andrews
(British).

Impeachment: The real vote might be the one on Nov. 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Historic yes, but Thursday's vote was no
surprise. The real suspense comes Nov. 3 when Americans elect a new
Congress _ in effect picking the jurors who will hear President
Bill Clinton's case and render a verdict.
	   The outcome of that election could draw a road map for the
House's impeachment hearings and Clinton's future.
	   If Republicans pick up a lot of seats, say 15 or more in the
House and five or more in the Senate, the Republicans could be
emboldened to push ahead aggressively with hearings delving deeply
into Clinton's behavior, not only with Monica Lewinsky but on
Whitewater, fund raising and missile technology transfers.
	   But if Republican gains are modest and public opinion remains in
the president's corner, Clinton's prospects for a plea bargain grow
brighter, perhaps along the lines of the public rebuke suggested by
former President Ford.
	   ``This election is crucially important in determining what the
next phase of this inquiry looks like,'' said Thomas Mann, director
of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
	   The impeachment fight will not be a driving force in many
campaigns, Mann said. Nevertheless, ``the election results will be
interpreted as a referendum on impeachment.''
	   The U.S. House of Representatives voted 258 to 176 Thursday to
launch the impeachment review against Clinton, only the third time
in history that lawmakers have taken such a step. If the House
decides to impeach Clinton, the case will move to the Senate for a
trial where a two-thirds vote would be required to remove the
president.
	   The White House professed delight that only 31 Democrats _ fewer
than expected _ joined in the impeachment vote. ``You got a vote
that was along party, partisan lines because they don't think the
process is going to be fair, fast or focused,'' said presidential
counselor Rahm Emanuel. That has been _ and will be _ the White
House mantra about impeachment.
	   In contrast to Thursday's numbers, the vote to open impeachment
proceedings against Richard Nixon a quarter century ago was 410 to
four _ with 98 percent of Nixon's fellow Republicans voting for the
inquiry.
	   ``This looks like a highly partisan inquiry at this stage,''
Mann said. ``It's getting off to a very different start than the
Watergate inquiry did. And given the public sentiment out there
among the broad public, it suggests to me, absent additional
devastating referrals, that the president is certainly likely to
survive all this.''
	   ``What we can't say until after the election is how long the
agony will go on.''
	   Boston University historian Robert Dallek said Clinton should
take little comfort from Thursday's vote because only five
lawmakers voted against both the Republican impeachment measure and
the Democratic alternative.
	   With most ``voting for some kind of impeachment proceeding,
that's a kick in the head,'' Dallek said. If the election does not
produce big surprises, Dallek said, ``They'll probably impeach him.
He'll be let off the hook in the Senate. They won't convict him.''
	   Certain of Thursday's outcome, the White House did not lean too
hard on Democrats to vote against impeachment proceedings.
Clinton's wife, Hillary, personally gave Democrats a pass for
voting against the president, declaring there would not be any
retribution.
	   ``We don't want anybody bleeding, dying or falling on their
sword,'' a senior administration official said. ``The vote
(Thursday) is not as important as the vote Nov. 3.''
	   White House officials recognized there were conservative and
moderate Democrats in mostly Republican districts districts who
needed to vote for the inquiry for the sake of political survival.
	   To Democrats in tough races in swing districts, the White House
argued they could boost their election chances by supporting the
Democratic alternative for a limited investigation and prescribed
time limits.
	   Michigan State University political scientist David Rhode said
Republicans leaders are in the difficult position of struggling to
reconcile the public's disgust with the Lewinsky affair with the
desires of the Republicans' core constituency to charge ahead.
	   ``If in the wake of the elections the Republican membership is
not convinced that to vote for impeachment will significantly
endanger their political future, they will vote for impeachment.''
But in the Senate, he said, ``It's difficult to imagine 67 votes
for conviction.''

	   SHANNON, Ireland (AP) _ A Delta Airlines jet en route from
England to Atlanta was diverted to Ireland's Shannon airport when a
pilot noticed an unidentified odor on board soon after takeoff.
	   The MD-11 aircraft landed safely without incident at about 3
p.m. (1400 GMT) Thursday. The MD-11 is the same model of aircraft
that was involved in the Sept. 2 Swissair crash off the Nova Scotia
coast that killed all 229 people on board.
	   Investigators did not immediately find anything wrong with the
Delta Airlines plane, but all 220 people on board were kept
overnight in Ireland while checks continued, according to Ireland
International, the Irish news agency.
	   A spokesman for Shannon Airport, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity, would not say what the suspected odor was.

Schroeder pushes economic program further, promising tax cut
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BON107 &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder has
taken the first step toward overhauling German taxes, which are
often seen as a heavy burden on Europe's biggest economy.
	   Schroeder's Social Democrats and their junior partner, the
Greens party, agreed Thursday on the outlines of reform, including
tax relief for average wage earners and businesses but also a
commitment to raise energy taxes over the next four years to
finance a cut in other levies.
	   With both parties hoping that lower taxes will bring down
double-digit unemployment, the project could be key to the success
of Schroeder's administration, Germany's first center-left
government in 16 years. Since coalition talks began last week, the
two parties have already agreed to launch a government program to
find jobs for 100,000 young jobless.
	   In the toughest bargaining so far in talks on forming a new
government, the Social Democrats on Thursday smothered a dispute
over the environmentalist Greens' call for a broad rise in energy
prices, including a sharp hike in the gasoline tax.
	   The idea, a bugbear for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's outgoing
government, unsettles industry and many voters in this car-crazy
nation. Schroeder has said he will only allow an increase of 6
pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, much less than the Greens want.
Anything more would hurt the auto industry, says Schroeder, who
sits on the supervisory board at Volkswagen.
	   The Social Democrats' chairman, Oskar Lafontaine, said only that
both sides ``agreed to tackle the ecological tax reform'' in the
new parliament's four-year term.
	   He and Greens co-chairman Juergen Trittin refused to give
details of the tax plans after Thursday's talks, saying the exact
numbers still need to be worked out.
	   A tax cut would fulfill a major campaign pledge of the Social
Democrats. Leaders of the two parties said their plan calls for 10
billion marks (dlrs 6.2 billion) in tax relief for individuals over
four years, to be offest partly by closing loopholes for the
well-off in Germany's highly complicated tax laws.
	   A crucial part of the reform is lowering the heavy social
security contributions that companies must legally make for their
employees, which both parties see as a way to create jobs.
	   A cornerstone of the social welfare state, the non-wage costs
make workers expensive and tend to hurt Germany's competitiveness.
Under the plan, higher taxes on fossil fuels would make up for the
lost revenue.
	   Schroeder has insisted he plans no major tax increases despite a
budget gap of more than 20 billion marks (dlrs 12.5 billion) he
says he is inheriting from the outgoing government.
	   With the incoming government also stressing fiscal prudence,
that leaves uncertain the prospects for financing other campaign
pledges, such as a boost in aid to families with children.
	   Schroeder invited the Greens into his government after he ousted
Kohl in a Sept. 27 election. Coalition talks are to run through
next week, and Cabinet posts are to be announced at the end.

She raised wild horses for love, died protecting them
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHET BROKAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PLAINVIEW, South Dakota (AP) _ As the years passed and her
arthritis worsened, Helen Altfillisch found it tougher and tougher
to ride herd on the 300 wild horses and the other critters on her
ranch.
	   But with the help of friends, a pair of crutches and the old
pickup that she drove around her 8,000 acres (3,200 hectares), she
scratched a living from the western South Dakota ranch she had run
since her father died nearly four decades ago.
	   She raised cattle for income, horses for love, friends say.
	   She rode horses when she was younger, but she could not ride
them or break them in recent years as her hip joints deteriorated.
She let the horses run wild on the rolling grasslands and the
cottonwood-studded Cheyenne River valley.
	   The dominant stallions each gathered a family in what probably
was the last privately owned herd of wild horses in South Dakota.
	   ``She sure loved those horses. ... She always thought first of
them and last of herself,'' said rancher Jim Collins, a neighbor
and friend who for many years helped Miss Altfillisch with work she
could not do alone.
	   She took pride, too, in not asking for help.
	   When her pickup broke down in a pasture last winter, she used
her crutches and started walking home at about 3 p.m. She finished
the 2 1-2 -mile (4-kilometer) trek to her house at 4 a.m., Collins
said.
	   That tenacity is probably why she didn't use her cellular phone
and wait for help when she found a colt mired in the mud on her
ranch in May.
	   Instead, the 71-year-old woman left her pickup, grabbed her
crutches and waded into the 2-foot-deep (a-half-meter-deep) muck to
help the little horse.
	   Neither Miss Altfillisch nor the colt made it out of the
silted-in stock dam.
	   John Rhoden, a Meade County sheriff's deputy who was among the
first on the scene, described a kind of honor guard of animals _
wild horses, prairie dogs and a coyote _ standing nearby. ``It was
quite a sendoff,'' he said.
	   ``Her love for the horse just took her out there,'' Rhoden
added. ``It's kind of the way she lived her life. She was really
independent ...''
	   Miss Altfillisch spent virtually her entire life on the ranch
about 100 miles (160 kilometers) west of Pierre, the state capital.
She attended South Dakota State University briefly, but returned
home to help her ailing father and never made it back to college.
	   After he died in 1961, she ran the ranch and cared for her
mother until her death. Miss Altfillisch had dresses for social
occasions but spent most of her time in blue jeans, work shirts and
a much-mended jacket.
	   In 1983, she told a reporter she had no regrets about her life,
and about never marrying. ``The way things worked out, it didn't
work out.''
	   Instead, she poured her attention and affection into the ranch
and the horses, right up to the moment of her death.
	   Without their keeper, Miss Altfillisch's horses had to be sold
to help pay off ranch loans. Family and friends rounded them up,
loaded them on trucks and took them to the Philip Livestock Auction
about 50 miles (80 kilometers) away.
	   Friends, neighbors and relatives paid tribute to her grit,
gumption and kindness _ ``one of a kind,'' someone said _ when they
gathered at the sale barn recently for the auction of her 299
horses.
	   ``I think she'd probably have cried today if she'd been here,''
Collins said.
	   Still, recalling times working with his good friend over the
years, he grinned. Though he worried whenever she walked among
horses, she was always fine when the dust cleared.
	   When they rounded up horses, he said, she would use her pickup
to herd the running animals, leaving a cloud of dust some 50 feet
(15 meters) in the air.
	   ``It was sure comical to watch her out there chasing horses,''
Collins said. ``They didn't get away.''
	   The sale of wild horses drew several hundred people. Some came
to buy, others were simply curious. The auction lasted four hours.
	   One by one, the horses were led into the sale ring and paraded.
Some snorted or whinnied as they trotted nervously in front of the
crowd.
	   Cowboy hats tipped in unison as buyers craned to get a better
look at a horse. If an animal looked a little scraggly, the
auctioneers might note they all had sound legs and hooves.
	   Miss Altfillisch's friends and relatives had worried that most
of her horses might be bought for slaughter. But many were bought
by companies that supply bucking horses for rodeos. Local ranchers
also bought a lot of the animals.
	   One little girl was disappointed when her father dropped out of
the bidding for a frisky colt. Then the auctioneer announced that
the colt had been bought by someone with their name. From the other
side of the sale barn, her grandmother sent word that it would be
her horse.
	   In her will, Miss Altfillisch provided that her favorite horse
would not be sold. Angel Baby, the horse she used to ride, will be
kept by her cousin, Louis Freiberg of Rapid City, who owns the
ranch next to hers.
	   Though she sometimes had to sell horses to make ends meet, Miss
Altfillisch hated to part with any, said her niece, Alice Earle of
Canton, Massachusetts.
	   ``They really were her pets,'' she said. ``She just let them
be.''

Holbrooke heads back to Belgrade, rebels call cease-fire
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbia's vice premier is threatening
to send NATO troops home ``in coffins'' as a special U.S. envoy
tries again to persuade Slobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown in
Kosovo and avoid a NATO attack.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared a united NATO
stands ready to authorize bombing of the Serbs for their military
actions in Kosovo. She dispatched U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke back
to Belgrade to warn the Yugoslav president that ``time is all but
gone'' for a peaceful settlement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and an estimated 250,000
people have been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a
crackdown Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by KLA ``terrorists.''
	   In an apparent bid to undercut that claim, the KLA announced a
unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo starting Friday. The move
will add to the pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Milosevic has refused to openly declare a cease-fire, even
though there has been no major fighting in Kosovo during the past
week and the KLA has been largely routed. He considers the Kosovo
rebels as ``terrorists and bandits,'' and any cease-fire on his
part would legitimize them as a negotiating partner, one of his
associates said on condition of anonymity.
	   The Serbian and Yugoslav governments showed little sign that
they are prepared to bow to international pressure, apparently
gambling that Russian opposition to a NATO attack will persuade key
alliance members, including Germany and Italy, to block any action.
	   Milosevic's spokesman, Ivica Dacic, insisted Thursday that NATO
threats were a ``rapist act'' and that the government has met the
conditions laid down last month by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Serbia's fiery vice premier, Vojislav Seselj, was more blunt.
	   ``NATO soldiers may possibly enter our country as combatants but
they will leave it in coffins,'' Seselj said Thursday. He warned
other countries in the region not to provide any help to NATO or
``they will also be considered our enemy and would have to face the
consequences.''
	   Despite Belgrade's claims of compliance, the United States
contends that 60 percent of the troops sent to Kosovo to crush the
independence movement remain in the province, as do all but 1,000
of the 10,000 special police, some of whom are accused of
committing atrocities against civilians.
	   U.S. officials say the troops and police are digging in for the
winter, especially along the roads to Pristina, the provincial
capital.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the United States
would vote to authorize military strikes against Serbia if
Milosevic ``continues to defy the international community.''
	   ``NATO must be prepared to act militarily to protect our
interests, to prevent another humanitarian catastrophe in the
Balkans,'' he said.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO allies endorsed a last-ditch U.S.
effort to end the violence in Kosovo peacefully, even as Albright
warned Milosevic that ``time is all but gone'' for him to avoid
airstrikes.
	   Albright told reporters the North Atlantic Council, the
political arm of NATO, will agree on an activation order ``in the
next few days'' that would authorize an attack on the Serbs. ``I am
confident we have the legitimate grounds,'' Albright said.
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook emerged from a
meeting of the six-nation Contact Group warning of ``grave
consequences'' if Yugoslavia does not end the ``humanitarian
crisis'' in Kosovo that has claimed hundreds of lives.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply
with the Security Council resolution he will be responsible for the
consequences, and they will be grave,'' Cook said after a meeting
of foreign ministers from the United States, Russia, Britain,
France, Germany and Italy.
	   The meeting of the Contact Group, the nations that oversee the
Balkans, was requested by the Americans in a bid to consolidate
support for NATO air strikes.
	   While Britain and the United States strongly back military
action against the Serbs, international support is lukewarm.
Russia, in particular, has been the most critical, warning that
NATO action would lead to further bloodshed in Kosovo.

Innocent plea entered for Dokes on attempted murder charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ An innocent plea was entered Thursday for
former heavyweight champion Michael Dokes, accused of attempted
murder in the beating of his fiancee.
	   Dokes was arrested Aug. 31 after his fiancee went to a hospital
for treatment of injuries. She told police she was beaten, sexually
assaulted and held against her will by Dokes.
	   Police said the victim suffered several facial fractures and was
so severely beaten that her face was unrecognizable. Dokes was
charged with attempted murder, sexual assault and false
imprisonment.
	   Dokes briefly held the WBA heavyweight title in 1982, but his
career was derailed by drug arrests and cocaine abuse. He made a
comeback and fought for the heavyweight title in 1993, but was
stopped by Riddick Bowe in the first round.
	   He last fought last November, when he weighed 280 pounds for a
bout.

Newspaper: Malaysian leader prepared to step aside once economy
</HEADLINE>
stabilizes

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the
longest-serving ruler in Asia, has said he's prepared to step down
once the country's troubled economy stabilizes, a Singapore
newspaper reported Friday.
	   There was no immediate way to verify the report in the Straits
Times newspaper, and there were no similar reports in Malaysian
news media.
	   In addition to wrestling with financial turmoil, Mahathir has
also been seeking to control the political fallout from the
dismissal and arrest of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The Straits Times said in a front-page report that Mahathir told
supporters on Thursday ``that he was prepared to step down after 17
years as prime minister of Malaysia, once the economy stabilizes.''
	   ``He had no intention of remaining at the helm until the end of
the currency crisis, which economists say could last between three
and five years,'' the Straits Times said of the outspoken,
72-year-old leader.
	   The newspaper said Mahathir made the statements to about 600
members of his UMNO political party in a meeting behind closed
doors.
	   ``They roared in disapproval and urged him to stay on, The
Straits Times learned,'' according to the Singapore newspaper
account.

Global turmoil won't pull Australia into recession, forecaster
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Global economic turmoil may drag
Australia's economy down, but probably won't lead to a recession,
an independent forecaster said Friday.
	   A five-year business outlook by Access Economics said the
strength of the domestic economy has so far largely protected
Australia from the Asian economic crisis.
	   But it said a worsening global outlook was expected to drag
Australia down next year.
	   ``This slowing will be driven by the continuing disruption in
our export markets, by the fall in global commodity prices and by
the impact of cheap Asian imports on the sales of a clutch of
Australian manufacturers,'' the Access report said.
	   Access Economics director Chris Richardson said the first six
months of 1999 would be the toughest period for Australia.
	   ``That will be the period in which not only will Australian
exporters still be feeling the heat in a number of markets but
Australian manufacturers who compete against imports out of Asia
will also be feeling the heat,'' Richardson told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   But Richardson said he did not expect the downturn to push
Australia into recession.
	   The report coincides with Treasurer Peter Costello's warning
Thursday that continuing uncertainty within Japan's financial
markets would impact on Australia.
	   Also Thursday, Prime Minister John Howard said the difficulties
of a turbulent world economy should be recognized, but there should
not to be any sense of undue pessimism or panic.
	   ``The world is not lurching towards recession,'' he said in a
speech to a business dinner in Sydney.
	   ``The world still remains a very beckoning and a very strong
place economically in many respects.''
	   Access Economics is an organization of academics and economic
professionals, independent of government, which makes forecasts on
a national and state level, and sells the work for profit.
	   Its forecasts are generally watched by government and markets.

Tokyo court rejects compensation appeal from Filipino sex slaves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court in Tokyo rejected Friday claims for
compensation from 46 Filipino women forced into sexual slavery for
Japanese soldiers during World War II.
	   The Tokyo District Court turned down a demand of 20 million yen
(dlrs 169,000) in compensation from each of the 46 plaintiffs, a
court official said.
	   Friday's ruling was the second on compensation lawsuits filed by
former sex slaves in Japan.
	   In April, a court in southwestern Japan ordered the Japanese
government pay 300,000 yen (dlrs 2,500) in damages to three South
Koreans used as sex slaves by the Japanese military during the war.
	   In rejecting the Filipinos' demand, Yoriaki Ichikawa, presiding
judge of the Tokyo District Court, ruled that the international law
under which the Filipino plaintiffs are seeking damages, does not
permit compensation demands by individuals, Kyodo News said.
	   Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans but also
Filipinos, Chinese and Dutch, were forced into sexual slavery
during the war.
	   It was only in 1992 that the Japanese government finally
admitted that the Imperial army was involved in establishing and
running the front-line brothels.
	   Japan maintains, however, that all questions of compensation for
the past war already have been settled with the various nations
involved.
	   Of the 46 Filipino women, there were some aged 10 and others
were teen-agers when they were seized by the Japanese for service
in brothels, their lawyers have said.
	   Amonita Balajadia, one of the plaintiffs, told a news conference
that Japanese soldiers took her in December 1942 as she and other
women were washing clothes in a river on Luzon Island, where her
family had gone after Japanese troops burned their house.
	   To date, seven of the Filipino plaintiffs, including Maria Rosa
Henson, the first Filipino woman to publicly admit she was forced
into sexual slavery, have died, Kyodo said.
	   In 1993, Henson and 46 other Filipino women filed a class suit
against the Japanese government in the Tokyo District Court to
demand direct compensation and an official Japanese apology.
	   Japan has paid some aid to former sex slaves through a
private-funded body. Most women have refused to accept the payment,
saying it is not enough and is part of attempts by Japan to avoid
taking full responsibility for its wartime actions.

Dollar drops against yen, Japanese stocks mixed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midmorning currency, stock and bond prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar continued its plunge against the
yen Friday in Tokyo as hedge funds scrambled to stem losses from
the greenback's slide. Japanese stocks were little changed.
	   The dollar bought 116.42 yen as of midday, down 5.94 yen from
late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of
119.05 yen overnight.
	   The dollar dove briefly to a 16-month low of 111.73 yen in
overnight trading from more than 135 earlier this week.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average slipped 29.02 points, or 0.22
percent, to 12,996.97. On Thursday, the Nikkei index closed at
13,026.06 points, down 799.55 points in its largest point fall of
the year.
	   The U.S. currency swung wildly as hedge funds _ known for
betting huge sums on world currency movements _ rapidly sold dollar
and then bought again as rumors swept the market.
	   But the overall trend remained down. The drop, which began
Wednesday as Japanese officials discussed new stimulus measures,
caught many hedge fund managers by surprise. Many had been betting
the dollar would rise against the Japanese currency.
	   When the dollar started to fall, they sold their holdings, only
fueling to the greenback's slide.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa attributed the rapid fall
partly to a correction in the Japanese currency's recent weakness,
adding that the central bank had no plans to intervene.
	   ``The yen has continued to decline since September of last year.
We're now at a time where it's acceptable to see a correction to
that. But the dollar's recent fall is a bit rough,'' Miyazawa told
a regular news conference.
	   On the Tokyo stock market, share prices were largely lower as
export and blue chip issues were sold in reaction to the stronger
yen. A higher yen tends to make Japanese exports more expensive
abroad.
	   ``The apparent weakening of the U.S. economy is also drawing
selling of export shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manger of
trading at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 10.83 points, or 1.08 percent, to 990.67.
The TOPIX closed down 45.48 points, or 4.34 percent, the day
before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.820 percent from Thursday's finish of
0.785 percent, driving its price down to 108.79 yen from 109.13
yen.

Tyson lawyers move forward to try and keep Oct. 19 hearing date
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson's lawyers moved forward on two
fronts Thursday to try and keep an Oct. 19 hearing date that might
be his last chance to return to the ring by the end of the year.
	   Tyson's lawyers filed another motion with the Nevada Supreme
Court in a continuing effort to keep his psychological records
private, while lawyers across the country worked on a settlement of
charges stemming from a Maryland traffic accident.
	   Both issues must be resolved within the next few days if Tyson
is to go before the Nevada Athletic Commission once again on Oct.
19 to try and get back the boxing license revoked when he bit
Evander Holyfield's ears more than 15 months ago.
	   Boxing regulators say they want Tyson's psychological records no
later than 5 p.m. Monday if the tentative hearing date is to be
kept. Tyson has fought release of the reports because of possible
embarrassing information they contain.
	   ``We must have all the medical information by Monday to have the
Oct. 19 hearing,'' said Marc Ratner, executive director of the
athletic commission.
	   Though release of the records may be embarrassing to Tyson, his
advisers have indicated that they will allow them to be made public
if the state Supreme Court doesn't intervene because they want to
keep the Oct. 19 hearing date.
	   As of closing time Thursday, the Supreme Court had yet to issue
an emergency stay asked for by Tyson to keep the records private
when they are given to the commission.
	   The more pressing issue for Tyson, though, figures to be the
misdemeanor assault charges filed against Tyson in Maryland, where
lawyers for Tyson and the two men were in negotiations Thursday in
an effort to settle the case.
	   Tyson is scheduled to go on trial on the charges on the same day
as the commission hearing, and his advisers said there was some
progress in seeking a settlement that could cause the charges to be
dropped.
	   ``There's been a lot of headway in that area and it could be any
day now,'' a Tyson spokesman said on condition on anonymity. ``The
only way he can move forward in Nevada is to settle in Maryland.''
	   Prosecutors in Montgomery County, Maryland said Thursday the
trial date is still on, however, despite efforts to settle the
civil portion of the case.
	   Richard Hardick, 50, says Tyson kicked him in the groin after
Hardick's car rear-ended a Mercedes driven by Tyson's wife, Monica,
Aug. 31 in a Washington, D.C., suburb. Hardick and Abmielec
Saucedo, 62, who said Tyson punched him in the face, filed criminal
complaints that led to the charges.
	   Talks to reach a financial settlement with the two men began
last week.
	   The Oct. 19 hearing is crucial to Tyson because the former
heavyweight champion is in financial trouble and wants to begin his
comeback with a December fight in Las Vegas that could earn him
enough money to pay off a dlrs 13 million IRS lien.
	   If Tyson's relicensing is delayed even further, there would not
be enough time to put together a comeback fight by the end of the
year.

Aircraft diverted after suspicious odor detected

	   SHANNON, Ireland (AP) _ A Delta Airlines jet en route from
England to Atlanta made an emergency landing at Ireland's Shannon
airport after pilots noticed an strange odor in the cockpit soon
after takeoff.
	   The MD-11 aircraft landed safely without incident at about 3
p.m. (1400 GMT) Thursday, 50 minutes after it had taken off from
Manchester. The MD-11 is the same model of aircraft that was
involved in the Sept. 2 Swissair crash off the Nova Scotia coast
that killed all 229 people on board. The cause of that crash has
not been determined.
	   ``This was part of our standard procedure,'' said Delta
spokesman Todd Clay. ``It is a precautionary action in accordance
with Delta procedures. Anytime pilots detect an unusual odor in the
cockpit they are to declare an emergency and land as quickly as
possible.''
	   Clay said pilots described the odor as electrical in nature, but
that it had dissipated by the time the plane landed in Shannon.
	   Investigators did not immediately find anything wrong with the
plane, but all 220 people on board were kept overnight in Ireland
while checks continued.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Maybe the Atlanta Braves should just sign Kevin
Brown this winter. That way, they wouldn't have to worry about him
beating them each fall.
	   The lifelong Georgia resident picked up exactly where he left
off last October, pitching another gem at Turner Field to give the
San Diego Padres a 3-0 win Thursday night and a 2-0 lead in the NL
championship series.
	   Brown, who won twice at Atlanta in the 1997 NLCS while with
Florida, shut down the Braves on only three singles. Relying on his
heavy sinker and a nasty fastball in the mid-90s mph, he struck out
11 and lowered his ERA this postseason to 0.38 in three starts.
	   Brown outdueled Tom Glavine, and contributed with his bat, too.
He singled with two outs in the sixth inning to set up Quilvio
Veras' RBI single, and also singled and scored in a two-run ninth.
	   The Padres traded three prospects to Florida in the offseason to
get Brown. He's eligible for free agency after this season and
perhaps the Braves, despite their great rotation, would be better
off getting Brown and keeping him out of the way.
	   San Diego won without 50-homer man Greg Vaughn, out of the
starting lineup for 3-4 days because of a strained left quadriceps.
Game 1 star Ruben Rivera took his place, but Brown was all the
Padres needed on this night.
	   A crowd of 43,083, about 8,000 short of a sellout, spent the
last couple of innings booing the Braves' futility.
	   Atlanta is appearing in its seventh straight NL championship
series, but never has faced an 0-2 deficit. In fact, no team has
ever lost the first two games at home and come back to win a league
championship series since the best-of-7 format began in 1985.
	   Game 3 will be Saturday at San Diego, with Greg Maddux pitching
for the Braves against Sterling Hitchcock. The Padres are hoping
for a big weekend at home to reach the World Series for only the
time, the first since 1984.
	   Pitching ruled the evening, with Brown throwing his hard stuff
and Glavine tossing his off-speed deliveries. Glavine was not
particularly sharp, however, walking a season-high six.
	   Still, it was 0-0 until the sixth, when Chris Gomez, Brown and
Veras each singled with two outs. Brown made his only mistake of
the game on Veras' hit when he was thrown out at third.
	   Not that Brown needed it, but the Padres scored two insurance
runs in the ninth off Odalis Perez. Brown's leadoff single set up
RBI singles by Steve Finley and Wally Joyner.
	   Glavine did his best, even hitting one of the Braves' singles.
In Wednesday night's 3-2 loss in 10 innings, the 20-game winner was
used as a pinch-hitter and walked.
	   Both pitchers worked around bouts of wildness in the second.
	   Glavine walked the bases loaded before getting Brown to look at
strike three for the final out.
	   Brown walked the first two batters in the bottom half. He got
Javy Lopez to ground into a double play, and neatly covered the bag
at first to take the relay.
	   A double by Veras and two walks again loaded the bases with two
outs in the Padres third. Carlos Hernandez hit a fly ball that
center fielder Andruw Jones glided a long way to catch, prompting
Braves owner Ted Turner to playfully fan himself with an Atlanta
hat in mock relief.

SOCOG starts Olympic volunteer drive
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Barbara and Laurie Smith got married in
1984 and spent their honeymoon at the Los Angeles Olympic Games.
They have sat side by side at the three subsequent summer games but
are looking forward to a more active role in 2000.
	   ``We're absolutely nuts about the Olympics,'' said Barbara Smith
at the launch of the Sydney Organizing Commitee's (SOCOG) volunteer
drive Friday.
	   The Smiths are two of 500 volunteers who joined up immediately
when Sydney won the bid in 1993.
	   ``Laurie went to the 1968 Olympics in Mexcio as a spectator and
has been to every one since,'' said Barbara Smith. ``We got married
in 1984 and had our honeymoon at the L.A. Games and thanks to
Laurie I've seen all of them since then.''
	   SOCOG is sweating on plenty of Smiths and Joneses getting behind
the volunteer program. It needs about 50,000 volunteers with half
of those having some specialist skill, such as a foreign language.
	   David Brettell, who is in charge of the volunteer drive for
SOCOG, is a specialist in volunteering.
	   ``I joined SOCOG as a volunteer three years ago and went on the
full-time staff about nine months later,'' Brettell said Friday.
``Volunteering is in my blood. I've been to six Olympics before as
a spectator and when we won the bid I made up my mind I wanted to
work with SOCOG.''
	   Brettell was full of praise for the volunteers in Atlanta 1996,
but not the volunteer program run by the hosts.
	   ``You can't criticize what the people there did but they need to
be better managed and appreciated,'' Brettell said.
	   In Atlanta many volunteers ended up staying away from the games,
beaten by the transport snafus and a lack of clear direction. That
city brought together 51,000 volunteers, but had 18 million people
_ the size of Australia's total population _ living within 6-1/2
hours drive of the Olympic hub.
	   SOCOG will accept applications from foreigners, but all
volunteers will need to pay for their own transport to Sydney and
all accommodation whilst there. SOCOG will provide uniforms and
meals.
	   The policy has already drawn criticism, notably from leading
first aid volunteer group St. John Ambulance. The service wanted
Australian dlrs 2 million (U.S. dlr 1.16 million) to help house
their volunteers but the appeal was rejected.
	   Brettell also cautioned potential volunteers not to sign up
expecting glamor and a clear view of the main stadium track.
	   ``If that's their passion, to watch the sport, we would actively
encourage that _ but not through volunteering,'' Brettell said.

	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Maybe the Atlanta Braves should just sign Kevin
Brown this winter. That way, they wouldn't have to worry about him
beating them each fall.
	   The lifelong Georgia resident picked up exactly where he left
off last October, pitching another gem at Turner Field to give the
San Diego Padres a 3-0 win Thursday night and a 2-0 lead in the NL
championship series.
	   Brown, who won twice at Atlanta in the 1997 NLCS while with
Florida, shut down the Braves on only three singles. Relying on his
heavy sinker and a nasty fastball in the mid-90s mph, he struck out
11 and lowered his ERA this postseason to 0.38 in three starts.
	   ``It's definitely sweet when you have success here,'' Brown
said. ``I need to find some wood to knock on. I feel pretty good
right now.''
	   Brown outdueled Tom Glavine and helped with his bat, too. He
singled with two outs in the sixth inning to set up Quilvio Veras'
RBI single, and also singled and scored in a two-run ninth.
	   ``They were timely,'' he said. ``That's one of the reasons I
really enjoy the National League play. You don't always swing the
bat good, but once in a blue moon, you get a chance to
contribute.''
	   The Padres traded three prospects to Florida in the offseason to
get Brown, and his postseason performances against Houston and now
Atlanta have been well worth it.
	   Brown is eligible for free agency after this season and perhaps
the Braves, despite their great rotation, would be better off
getting the right-hander and keeping him out of the way.
	   ``I knew when we got him that he would make a big difference,
but I didn't know he would make this kind of impact,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said. ``When Kevin Brown is on, he's as tough
as any pitcher in the game. Right now, he's locked in.''
	   San Diego won without 50-homer man Greg Vaughn, out of the
starting lineup for 3-4 days because of a strained left quadriceps.
Game 1 star Ruben Rivera took his place, but Brown was all the
Padres needed on this night.
	   A crowd of 43,083, about 8,000 short of a sellout, spent the
last couple of innings booing the Braves' futility against Brown.
	   ``We hit two balls good all night,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox
said. ``Against us, this is the best I've seen him.''
	   Atlanta is appearing in its seventh straight NLCS, but never has
faced an 0-2 deficit. In fact, no team has ever lost the first two
games at home and come back to win a league championship series
since the best-of-7 format began in 1985.
	   Game 3 will be Saturday at San Diego, with Greg Maddux pitching
for the Braves against Sterling Hitchcock. The Padres are hoping
for a big weekend at home to reach the World Series for only the
time, the first since 1984.
	   ``We can't feel good about being 0-2, but we have the type of
club and pitching that we could easily reel off four in a row,''
Cox said.
	   With Brown and Glavine working on a cool and windy night, the
forecast was for good pitching. And that's how it played out, with
Brown throwing his hard stuff and Glavine tossing his off-speed
deliveries. Glavine was not particularly sharp, however, walking a
season-high six.
	   It was 0-0 until the sixth, when Chris Gomez, Brown and Veras
each singled with two outs. Brown made his only mistake of the game
on Veras' hit when he slid head-first and was thrown out at third.
	   Not that Brown needed it, but the Padres scored two insurance
runs in the ninth off Odalis Perez. Brown's leadoff single set up
RBI singles by Steve Finley and Wally Joyner.
	   Glavine did his best, even hitting one of the Braves' singles.
In Wednesday night's 3-2 loss in 10 innings, the 20-game winner was

center fielder Andruw Jones glided a long way to catch, prompting
Braves owner Ted Turner to playfully fan himself with an Atlanta
hat in mock relief.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Brown was born in McIntyre, Ga., went to school at Georgia
Tech and lives in Macon, Ga., about 80 miles away. ... Brown won
his lone start against Atlanta in the regular season, pitching 6
1-3 scoreless innings. ... Vaughn hopes to be able to pinch-hit in
Game 4. ... Glavine is 9-10 lifetime in the postseason.

Chinese province sends officials to try to stop state firm losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Alarmed by rising losses at many state-owned
companies, the governor of northeastern Liaoning province has sent
190 officials to try to put their businesses in order, the official
newspaper China Daily reported Friday.
	   Liaoning _ once a powerful industrial hub and now a rust-belt of
aging factories _ has led the sharp decline in China's state
enterprise profits. With 1,400 large and mid-sized state
enterprises, it has swelling unemployment, worker protests over
unpaid salaries and pensions, and China's highest concentration of
money-losing companies.
	   According to provincial officials, in the first eight months of
1998 losses in Liaoning's state industry grew to 10.5 billion yuan
(dlrs 1.27 billion), or an average of 44 million yuan (dlrs 5.37
million) a day, the newspaper said.
	   Zhang Guoguang, Liaoning's governor, has pledged to halt the
collapse of state industry within three months, it said.

South Korean leader bids farewell to Japanese emperor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung bid farewell to
the Japanese emperor Friday, ending a trip to Tokyo aimed at
promoting a revival in ties between the two countries.
	   Kim, who held a summit meeting with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
and addressed Parliament on Thursday, was scheduled to fly to the
western city of Osaka later Friday for meetings with ethnic
Koreans.
	   The South Korean president, who arrived on Wednesday on his
first trip to Japan since taking office, returns to Seoul on
Saturday.
	   At the farewell meeting Friday with Emperor Akihito, Kim said he
hoped the emperor could visit South Korea before the two countries
co-host the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament, Kyodo News agency
quoted him as saying.
	   Kim said on Thursday that it was ``unnatural'' that a Japanese
emperor has not come to South Korea, considering the countries are
neighbors and have had diplomatic relations for 33 years.
	   Kim and Obuchi on Thursday signed a ``new partnership'' pact
opening up new areas of cooperation between the two countries,
including the Asian financial crisis and stability on the Korean
Peninsula.
	   The agreement also included Japan's clearest apology yet for its
1910-1945 colonial rule of South Korea. In a departure from earlier
Japanese statements of remorse _ which some South Koreans have
considered lacking in sincerity _ the wording of Thursday's apology
was negotiated between the two sides and printed in an official
document.
	   In a speech to Japan's Parliament later Thursday, Kim said South
Korea and Japan should not forget their 1,500-year history of
exchanges just because of Japan's decades-long aggression.
	   Economics also played a key role in the summit. Japan offered
Kim a dlrs 3 billion loan package to help Seoul overcome its severe
financial downturn. Seoul is struggling to restructure its economy
under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the International Monetary
Fund.
