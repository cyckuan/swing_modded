<HEADLINE> Report: Phila. Mayor Wooed for DNC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The mayor of Philadelphia could be moving into  
a top position with the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been a fantastic mayor -- one of the best -- and he brings  
people together,'' Vice President Al Gore said of Mayor Edward G. 
Rendell. ``I would hope that he'd play a significant role of some 
kind, but it's premature to talk about specifics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very capable person who is a great leader, not only  
among Democrats but independents (and) independently thinking 
Republicans,'' Gore said Thursday night on ``Larry King Live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell spokesman Kevin Feeley and DNC officials did not return  
calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	David Yarkin, another Rendell spokesman, told The Washington  
Post that his boss had not been offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Friends of his from the party have talked to him about it and  
asked him if he'd be interested in the DNC position if a vacancy 
existed,'' Yarkin said. ``He said, 'I would consider it 
strongly.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell, who will leave office at the end of the year,  
reportedly caught the attention of Gore with his successful push to 
persuade the Republican Party to hold its 2000 national convention 
in Philadelphia and by chairing a Gore fund-raiser in June that 
raised $450,000.

<HEADLINE> Vanguard's Bogle Opts Out of Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John C. Bogle, legendary founder and senior  
chairman of mutual fund giant Vanguard Group, agreed to step down 
Friday despite winning an exemption from a company policy that 
requires directors to retire after they turn 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard, best known for creating mutual funds that mimic stock  
indexes like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, announced that its board 
passed a resolution Friday that exempted Bogle from the policy, but 
he decided to retire anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard chief executive and chairman John Brennan will succeed  
Bogle at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogle's decision followed a well-publicized attempt to persuade  
the board to lift the long-standing rule, which requires directors 
to retire in December of the year in which they turn 70. Bogle 
turned 70 in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply appreciative of the board's decision. But time  
marches on, in my life and in Vanguard's,'' Bogle said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanguard was founded by Bogle in 1975 amid differences between  
senior managers at Wellington Management, an investment firm 
founded in 1928. With nearly $500 billion of assets under 
management, second only to Fidelity Investments, Vanguard is widely 
regarded as the fastest growing mutual fund company. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his decision, Bogle won't be retiring from Vanguard  
completely. He is becoming president of a new Vanguard venture, to 
be called the Bogle Financial Markets Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, many observers believe Bogle's retirement will have  
little impact on the company. For several years now, his primary 
role has been as an educator and lecturer on issues affecting the 
mutual fund industry. He is a staunch supporter of low-cost funds 
and long-term investing. 
</P>
<P>
	Mutual fund analysts have said the leadership transition between  
Bogle and Brennan is expected to be smooth because Vanguard's 
day-to-day operations have been run by Brennan for several years. 
Brennan, 45, also is a protege of Bogle's. He was named chief 
executive in 1996 and chairman in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But media accounts earlier this year reported that Bogle had  
differences with Brennan over Brennan's support for an expansion 
into the discount brokerage business. Bogle has complained that 
discount brokerages encourage a gambling mentality among investors. 
Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pa., has played down those 
reports.

<HEADLINE> Blueberries May Aid Balance, Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A secret of youth may be as close as a nearby  
farm or the supermarket shelves: blueberries. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly rats fed the human equivalent of at least half a cup of  
blueberries a day improved in balance, coordination and short-term 
memory, a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience said. A 
cup of blueberries is a normal serving. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other fruits and vegetables, blueberries contain chemicals  
that act as antioxidants. Scientists believe antioxidants protect 
the body against ``oxidative stress,'' one of several biological 
processes that cause aging. 
</P>
<P>
	People ``are told that once you're old, there's nothing you can  
do. That might not be true,'' said Barbara Shukitt-Hale, who 
co-authored the study at the Agriculture Department's Human 
Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Blueberries, strawberries and spinach all test high in their  
ability to subdue molecules called oxygen free radicals, which are 
created when cells convert oxygen into energy. In normal amounts, 
free radicals help rid the body of toxins, but they can also harm 
cell membranes and DNA, which results in cell deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tufts study said strawberry and spinach extract produced  
some improvement in memory, but only blueberry extract had a 
significant impact on balance and coordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have suggested that antioxidants in fruits and  
vegetables could prevent cancer and heart disease. Previous 
research by the Tufts scientists indicated that antioxidants slowed 
down the aging process in rats that started taking the dietary 
supplement at 6 months of age. Their latest study was the first to 
show antioxidants can actually reverse age-related declines, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	They don't know why blueberries were more effective than  
strawberries and spinach or exactly how the chemicals work in the 
laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fruits and vegetables in general are very good for you. That's  
without question ... It's another thing to know why,'' said 
Marcelle Morrison-Bogorad, who directs the neuroscience and 
neuropsychology program at the National Institute of Aging. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinical trials need to be done to see whether humans could  
benefit, she said. The institute, which helped finance the Tufts 
research, already is sponsoring studies to test the effect of 
vitamin E, another antioxidant, aspirin and B vitamins on the 
mental processes of older women. 
</P>
<P>
	The rats used in the Tufts study were 19 months old, the  
equivalent of 65 to 70 years in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	They begin losing motor skills at 12 months. By 19 months, the  
time it takes a rat to walk a narrow rod before losing its balance 
drops from 13 seconds to 5 seconds. After eating daily doses of 
blueberry extract for eight weeks, the rats could stay on the rod 
for an average of 11 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	They also performed better in negotiating mazes, as did those  
fed strawberry and spinach extracts, which signals improved 
short-term memory. But the subjects on the strawberry and spinach 
diet were no better at staying on the rod than rats who got no 
fruit extract. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists believe the antioxidants improve cell membranes  
so that important nutrients and chemicals can flow through more 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
	James Joseph, one of the Tufts scientists, starts his day by  
mixing a handful of berries in a protein drink. ``Motor behavior is 
one of the first things to go as you age,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Troops Leaving East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesian troops loaded weapons,  
ammunition and computers onto navy ships today, departing the 
war-ravaged territory of East Timor ahead of the arrival of a 
multinational peacekeeping force gathering in neighboring 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian military officials said it would take one week for  
their troops to withdraw from the territory, leaving the chance for 
friction with arriving peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Melbourne radio  
station 3AW today that any army attacks against the peacekeepers 
could provoke harsh retaliation and could spur the United States to 
send combat troops into the territory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the Indonesian army and Indonesian government is  
likely going to embark upon that course. They would know that would 
provoke a massive reaction from other parts of the world,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said Thursday the United States  
would contribute 200 troops to serve in mainly support positions in 
the Australian-led force, which is expected to number 7,000 men. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said today he thought  
Howard's comment only left the door open for a larger force, not 
necessarily U.S. ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an extraordinary miscalculation on the part of  
anyone who would seek to attack U.N. forces,'' Lockhart said. The 
mandate provides for ``all necessary means. The rules of engagement 
are robust. The Australian-led force will obviously respond as 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Darwin, Australia, the launching ground for the peacekeeping  
mission, fishing trawlers were squeezed out by warships berthed 
three abreast. Airliners competed with fighter-bombers and 
transport planes for space over the only airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 Australian troops, 250 British Gurkhas and soldiers  
from New Zealand prepared for the deployment, which could begin as 
soon as this weekend. Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told 
reporters in New York the force could grow to 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The peacekeepers' arrival will allow a full-scale relief effort  
to begin for tens of thousands of desperate East Timorese who fled 
the fighting that followed an Aug. 30 vote for independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Australian transport planes made the first airdrop of food  
aid to the refugees in the mountainous jungles. But the 15 tons of 
rice was only enough for one day for 15,000 people -- about 
one-tenth of those who the United Nations says are in desperate 
need of food. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were growing dangerously bleak in refugee camps in  
West Timor, the other half of the island, where independence 
supporters sought refuge from the wave of violence by 
pro-Indonesian militias, said Kris Janowski of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no shelter, food or medicine. Water is a major  
problem. In such a situation, there are deaths every day among 
infants, the sick and elderly,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian troops, who were accused of participating in violence  
following the vote, hauled bags of rice and medicine today to 
refugee camps in the mountains. More than 7,000 troops were on 
their way out of the province, said Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, the 
commander of Indonesian forces in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	On the outskirts of the capital, Dili, a refugee was wounded by  
gunfire as the crowd jostled for the food packages. He was shot by 
a man wearing army-type fatigues, but an army commander said the 
gunman was not a soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor was convulsed with violence after pro-Indonesia  
militiamen went on a rampage of killing, looting and arson after 
voters in this half-island territory of 850,000 people 
overwhelmingly approved independence from Indonesia, which invaded 
the former Portuguese colony in 1975. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, 
have died. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Timor's gutted capital, Dili, soldiers packed clothes  
and refrigerators onto military trucks. Others cleaned street 
debris near houses wrecked and smoldering after the terror wave. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a headache from staying in this crazy town,'' read  
graffiti sprayed on a wall near an army barracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dili was quiet today, without the scattered gunfire that has  
been going on for days. Only a few anti-independence militiamen, in 
their characteristic black T-shirts, roamed the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia's Parliament asked President B.J. Habibie to appear  
before legislators on Monday to explain the decision to allow the 
peacekeeper deployment. Habibie's decisions to allow the 
independence vote and the peacekeeping force have angered many 
nationalists in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian officials have promised their soldiers will cooperate  
fully with the multinational forces, though questions of command 
still need to be worked out on the ground, and the chance for 
conflict exists. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 9,000 soldiers due to be withdrawn from East Timor --  
but their withdrawal will overlap the peacekeepers' arrival. A 
force of 11,000 Indonesian police is to remain in East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Indonesian troops, who have faced hostility from the local  
population, appeared happy to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting for the peacekeeping troops. Maybe after  
that we leave East Timor forever,'' said one soldier who declined 
to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Belo, the East Timorese bishop who shared the 1996 Nobel  
Peace Prize, said today that peace and reconciliation were 
possible, but militiamen and troops who killed independence 
supporters must stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must forgive, but we must also bring about justice,'' he  
told Spanish state radio in an interview from Rome, where he 
traveled after fleeing the violence last week. ``There must be 
trials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Indonesian troops have been driving their  
militia allies back into the jungles and confiscating weapons found 
in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Some people who fled the militia's rage began to filter down  
from their refuge in the mountains to their ruined, smoldering 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are happy that the international peace force is coming,''  
said one young man who returned to his home city of Baucau. ``But I 
think they are coming a bit too late.''

<HEADLINE> No. 25 BYU 34, No. 23 Colorado St 13 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Brigham Young has always had a high-scoring  
passing offense. Byron Frisch, Rob Morris and Setema Gali showed 
this season's Cougars can play defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 25 BYU held Colorado State scoreless and allowed 129 total  
yards for three quarters, dominating the No. 23 Rams for a 34-13 
victory in the first game for the new Mountain West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to give a lot of credit to the BYU defense,''  
Colorado State coach Sonny Lubick said. ``They were very tough 
early on and they looked like they're a real solid team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams (2-1) finished with 28 rushing yards Thursday night and  
got 160 of their 289 passing yards in the fourth quarter, scoring 
two meaningless touchdowns against the reserves for BYU (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	``This helps a lot,'' said Gali, a defensive end who had one of  
BYU's three interceptions. ``We don't want to have a letdown. There 
is a potential for a great season. That's what we're hoping for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Frisch, a defensive tackle, credited BYU's coaches.  
</P>
<P>
	``We put our defensive ends on their tight ends and that limited  
them,'' he said. ``They couldn't get around the end and they 
couldn't get it inside. Where were they going to go?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, freshman running back Luke Staley had three  
touchdowns on his 19th birthday, and Kevin Feterik threw for two 
TDs. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley was Oregon's high school player of the year last season.  
He chose BYU over the likes of Nebraska, UCLA and Washington so he 
could play with his older brother, defensive back Dustin Staley. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here because I have a brother who's playing,'' he said.  
``I've always wanted to play with him and I've never had that 
chance. I thought it would be a unique experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Staley didn't have glamorous numbers: 14 carries for 65 yards  
and three catches for 35 yards. But he delivered when he was 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't play like a freshman, does he?'' Feterik said.  
``He's our starting halfback and he's a big part of our game plan. 
Once we get up 21 or 24 points, we'll always want to milk the 
clock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars showed Colorado State what it feels like on the  
losing end of a blowout. The Rams, unranked in the preseason, broke 
into the Top 25 after a 41-14 season-opening victory over then-No. 
14 Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety Erik Olson, who dropped a sure interception on BYU's  
second scoring drive in the second quarter, said the difference 
against the Buffaloes was that the Rams made big plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a pick in my hands and I dropped it,'' Olson said. ``In  
any kind of a big game, the seniors need to make plays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado State didn't have Kevin McDougal, who rushed for 190  
yards against the Buffaloes and had 147 before a hamstring injury 
forced him out of last week's victory over Nevada. It might not 
have mattered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way we were playing, they could have had Herschel Walker  
and we still would have won,'' Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the loss of Morris, a Butkus Award candidate, was reason  
for concern. He left in the third quarter with an abdominal strain, 
but later said he expects to play Sept. 25 against Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a long week off, so I'll be ready to go next  
week,'' Morris said. ``I've had worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BYU set the tone on the opening possession. Feterik led a  
79-yard, 15-play drive capped by Staley's 1-run run. 
</P>
<P>
	Feterik scrambled on third-and-18 for a 9-yard gain to the Rams  
19. He was hit as he reached the sideline by Rick Crowell, who was 
penalized for a late hit that gave BYU a first down at the 9. 
</P>
<P>
	It got out of reach in the second quarter. After Staley's 7-yard  
pass from Feterik gave BYU a 14-0 lead, the Rams couldn't catch a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars fumbled twice during their third scoring drive,  
including an apparent turnover near midfield by running back 
Naufahu Tahi that Colorado State's Terrence Gibson returned inside 
the BYU 15. 
</P>
<P>
	However, officials ruled Tahi down.  
</P>
<P>
	On the next play, Feterik threw 27 yards to Ben Horton, who  
fumbled on the tackle. The ball bounced into the arms of BYU's 
Chris Hale, who added another 5 yards for a first down at Colorado 
State's 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Six plays later, the Rams blitzed. Feterik lofted a swing pass  
over the defenders' arms to Jaron Dabney, who raced into the end 
zone for a 15-yard touchdown, giving the Cougars a 21-0 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third, BYU added a 38-yard field goal by Owen Pochman and  
Staley's last TD, a 5-yard run that made it 31-0.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Decries Russian Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton pledged today to help Russia  
combat a deadly wave of terrorist attacks and said Americans 
``share the world's outrage over these cowardly acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The struggle against terrorism is a long and difficult road  
but we must not lose our resolve,'' the president said in a written 
statement. ``America stands ready to work with Russia to protect 
our citizens from this common threat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A wave of bombings has claimed about 300 lives in Russia this  
month, according to Russian officials. Russian officials blame 
Islamic militants from southern Russia and militants from the 
breakaway territory of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Clinton said, ``On behalf of the American  
people, I want to extend our deepest condolences to the families of 
victims of recent bombings in Russia. Our thoughts and prayers are 
with the loved ones of the nearly 300 people whose lives were 
tragically lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people share the world's outrage over these  
cowardly acts,'' the president said. ``These attacks were aimed not 
just at innocent people across Russia. They also targeted 
fundamental human rights and democratic values, which are cherished 
by Russia and other members of the international community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not allow terrorists to achieve their underlying  
objective, which is to undermine democratic institutions and 
individual freedoms,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, during a trip to New Zealand, met with Russian Prime  
Minister Vladimir Putin before the opening of the annual 
Asia-Pacific Economic forum. They discussed the bombings, as well 
as allegations of corruption and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's statement, Clinton said, ``In the days and weeks  
ahead, we will intensify our cooperation with Russian authorities 
to help prevent terrorist acts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said people across Russia ``who have been affected by these  
attacks are now beginning the hard task of rebuilding their lives. 
Their courage and resilience set an example for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
	``President (Boris) Yeltsin and Prime Minister Putin have also  
made important appeals to their countrymen that these attacks 
should not lead to new incidents of intolerance or bigotry and that 
the public should remain calm and unified in response.''

<HEADLINE> Vinery Thoroughbred Operation Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDWAY, Ky. (AP) -- Vinery, which grew from a family farm to a  
major thoroughbred breeding operation, was sold to a group led by 
Australian horseman Lynden Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Walden Jr. and his wife Elaine started Vinery on their  
family farm in 1987 with one stallion, Bionic Light. The business 
now features 28 stallions and a project in which Vinery stallions 
shuttle between the 245-acre Kentucky farm and a 2,500-acre Vinery 
farm in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Walden became partners last year with horse industry  
newcomers George and Kay Hofmeister. Walden said Thursday he had 
sold his remaining 10 percent interest in Vinery to the Hofmeisters 
over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, the Hofmeisters recently sold their Vinery holdings to  
Burns, who owns Roselands in Victoria, Australia. Included in the 
sale are such top Vinery stallions as Red Ransom, Gilded Time, 
Langfuhr and Sandpit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely makes me sad to lose Vinery,'' Walden told the  
Lexington Herald-Leader. ``But I plan to leave my horses at Vinery 
and will be a director of the farm and a client of the farm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walden declined to disclose the sale price.  
</P>
<P>
	George Hofmeister, founder of American Commercial Holdings, made  
a splash in the horse industry last year, when he and his wife 
bought Highland Farms in Paris, Ky., Stone Lodge Farm in New South 
Wales, Australia, and the breeding rights to 1998 Kentucky Derby 
and Preakness winner Real Quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Walden said the Hofmeisters decided to reduce their thoroughbred  
operations and were not comfortable with the size of the 
two-hemisphere breeding operation. However, they will retain their 
interest in Real Quiet, who is expected to stand at Vinery, and 
ownership of Highland Farms.

<HEADLINE> NFL Fines Dungy for Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy was fined  
$10,000 by the NFL on Friday for criticizing the officiating in 
last week's game against the New York Giants, even though the 
league admitted he had grounds for complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	The league admitted that officials, even after reviewing  
replays, blew three calls that, if corrected, could have altered 
the outcome of the game, won 17-13 by New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the technology we've got, if he (referee Ed Hoculi)  
can't make the right call, how can he be in charge of a crew?'' 
Dungy said he asked league officials. ``Their response was 
everybody makes mistakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the league's response was that Dungy ``publicly  
criticized the officiating ... (and) publicly discussed the 
substance of private conversations he had this week with the NFL 
Officiating Department.''

<HEADLINE> Group To Auction Indie Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lights! Camera! Auction? A business group  
plans to stage the first-ever live auction of movies, helping 
hungry independent filmmakers do deals with distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion, a partnership between a Chicago entertainment  
lawyer and two Mexican producers, began soliciting movies Thursday 
from filmmakers for the auction scheduled for March 3 in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The project, known as Films4Auction, will offer 20 movies to the  
top bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Sellers might be unknown filmmakers who have shopped their  
movies around the film festival circuits without landing a 
distributor, said Hal Kessler, the lawyer and partner in Art in 
Motion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people involved in independent film projects  
and I can see their frustration'' trying to sell their movies, said 
another partner, Ramiro Gonzalez. ``This is another door for them 
to the distributors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers might be anyone from top studios to small distributors,  
and the films could be bought for theatrical, television or video 
release, Kessler said. They could come away with a steal, picking 
up an indie gem at a bargain price, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Distributors always are on the lookout for a breakthrough  
independent hit. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' shot for about 
$60,000, has grossed $136 million for Artisan Entertainment, which 
picked it up for $1 million at the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're likely to get is a filmmaker whose tremendously  
valiant efforts to ruin many soles of shoes peddling their product 
for a year haven't paid off,'' Kessler said. ``It's that filmmaker 
who'll say to us, 'before I put my movie on a shelf, I want you to 
try to sell it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The auction will have safeguards to protect filmmakers from  
getting sold short. Filmmakers can set a reserve, the minimum price 
they will accept for their movies, and refuse to sell if bids fall 
below that. 
</P>
<P>
	Films could sell for as little as $75,000 or more than $1  
million if bidding becomes fierce, said Ricardo Del Rio, another 
partner with Art in Motion. The group figures the average sale 
price might be about $175,000 to $250,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction format may smooth over some frustrations first-time  
filmmakers go through in searching for distributors on the festival 
circuit, Del Rio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here is fairness in a game that was  
controlled by the buyers,'' Del Rio said. ``Filmmakers will have a 
fair chance to have their picture shown, first of all, and to have 
people compete for a decent or fair price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Auction buyers would get distribution rights, while filmmakers  
would retain rights for sequels, novels or stage productions based 
on the movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion will take a 10 percent commission on films sold,  
while buyers will pay an additional 10 percent over the selling 
price to the auctioneer, William Doyle Galleries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Auctions are offering everything from jewelry to real  
estate,'' said Louis Webre, vice president of marketing for the 
auction house. ``Film is just a natural for auction. It's not as 
out in left field as you would think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ads seeking submissions will appear in film trade publications  
and be distributed at film festivals, Art in Motion partners said. 
</P>
<P>
	Entrants must pay a $1,500 fee if they submit movies before Nov.  
13 and $1,750 after that. A filmmaker will get that fee back if the 
film is sold. 
</P>
<P>
	Art in Motion will pick the top 20 for auction and will screen  
the movies for potential buyers a few days before the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucius Barre, an independent-film promoter shopping movies this  
week at the Toronto Film Festival, said some distributors might be 
uncomfortable with the auction format, where they might have to 
make spot decisions on how much they are willing to pay for a film. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I will say nothing but encouraging things about this  
method,'' Barre said. ``There's a lot of worthwhile films that have 
fallen through the cracks, and this idea, whether or not you think 
it will fly, is a way of diversifying how we communicate between 
film buyers and sellers.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. MIA Team Heads to Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- A team of 98 U.S. military specialists  
leave for Vietnam Friday with hopes of recovering remains that may 
lead to the identification of American servicemen listed as missing 
in action in the Vietnam War, the U.S. Department of Defense said 
in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The team will join Vietnamese counterparts Tuesday to begin  
joint investigations and recovery operations in 23 provinces and 
cities during the 30-day operation, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six primary excavation sites and three alternate locations will  
be targeted in the 42nd joint MIA operation conducted in Vietnam 
since the U.S. Joint Task Force-Full Accounting was established in 
1992. Similar MIA searches also have been carried out in Cambodia 
and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1973, the remains of 529 American servicemen, formerly  
listed as unaccounted for, have been identified and returned to 
their families, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently 2,054 Americans still unaccounted for from  
the wars in Southeast Asia, 1,530 of them in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Museum Exhibits Titanic Mail Clerks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Among the 1,500 people who died on the doomed  
Titanic were five mail clerks, men who gave their lives trying to 
drag huge mail sacks up to the deck of the sinking liner in the 
vain hope of transferring them to another ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Postal Museum opened an exhibit Friday recalling  
their sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the exhibit, a visitor hears a strange sound like radio  
static. A pattern quickly emerges -- static and quiet, static and 
quiet, static and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	The sound of the great ship's dying cry for help is heard again.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the click-click-click you associate with Morse code.  
That's a telegraph,'' explained museum director James Bruns. 
``We've recreated the actual Marconi radio signal that would have 
been heard by other vessels that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As that signal raced through the air, alternating the new  
distress call S0S with the older CQD, a band of men working on a 
slower but more lasting means of communication struggled to save 
the mail from rising water. 
</P>
<P>
	Steward Albert Theissinger, who survived the sinking, reported  
helping the clerks bring mail to the deck for a while. He turned to 
other tasks when the frigid water in the mail room reached waist 
high, he recalled, but the mail clerks worked on, trying to save 
the letters and parcels. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit opens with portraits of the five and a discussion of  
the vessel's sinking and rediscovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing on display at the National Postal Museum was raised from  
the ocean bottom, Bruns stressed, pointing out that the Smithsonian 
Institution considers the wreck a memorial to those who died that 
should not be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet visitors can see the cracked pocket watch that belonged to  
one of the clerks, John Starr March, recovered from his body found 
floating in the sea. The watch stopped at 1:27 a.m. the morning of 
April 15, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	More artifacts came from the body of clerk Oscar Scott Woody --  
his miniature watch, four postal ``facing slips'' used to mark 
bundles of mail, travel orders instructing him to sail on the 
Titanic, his pocket knife, his mail chain and keys. 
</P>
<P>
	Once these items were gathered together in a small white bag  
stamped with a blue ``167,'' designating Woody's as the 167th body 
recovered. His belongings were placed in that bag for shipment to 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The bag is included in the exhibit, with the official  
notification card informing his wife that his body was recovered 
and telling her how to obtain his effects. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit also touches those who survived, with a giant  
red-and-white striped mail sack of the type used at the time for 
general mail shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	As the liner Carpathia arrived and began picking up survivors,  
its crew found that many women with infants and small children 
could not climb rope ladders up the side of the huge ship. A mail 
sack from Carpathia was used to lift the children safely aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	A video shot by a submersible visiting the wreck includes scenes  
of the flooded mail room and some of more than 3,000 sacks of mail 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been discussions of trying to recover the mail, Bruns  
said, but it raises complex legal questions. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trip the mail clerks were in the process of  
transferring the mail from British to U.S. custody. The question 
arises as to whether the U.S. Postal Service or the Royal Mail 
would take possession, he said. In addition, few who sent mail, or 
were to receive it, would be alive today, so the decision becomes 
complicated about whom it would be delivered to. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, he said, when an item is mailed there is a  
promise of delivery. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Woody and March, the mail contingent on Titanic included  
William Logan Gwinn, all Americans, and British mail clerks James 
Bertram Williamson and Richard Jago Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit ``Posted Aboard R.M.S. Titanic'' will be on display  
until June.

<HEADLINE> Sacred Objects Returned to Navajos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Four sacred artifacts being returned to the  
Navajo Nation are but a few of many treasured items lost over the 
years to thieves, tribal officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Navajo leaders planned a public prayer ceremony today in Window  
Rock to mark the artifacts' return after more than a decade spent 
out of tribal hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``These artifacts were given to the Navajo people by our  
superiors, the powers,'' said Steven Begay, a Navajo cultural 
specialist. ``For other people to have those items was not what 
they were intended for. They don't know how to use them or what 
they are used for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The centuries-old items have been identified by federal  
investigators as a mask, a tortoise shell and two coverings that 
may be drum heads or ceremonial vessel coverings. 
</P>
<P>
	Begay declined to say what the items were or how they are used.  
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of items held by museums and private collectors have been  
returned voluntarily to the tribe since federal legislation in 1990 
cracked down on looting of American Indian sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest objects being returned are among the few the Navajos  
have received through criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Johns, an agent with the Bureau of Land Management, said  
investigators recovered the artifacts in 1991 after tracking them 
to dealers in Santa Fe, N.M., and New York. He said they had been 
taken from a cave in northwestern New Mexico in 1986, before it was 
a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The mask was recovered from a Tucson home. The other objects  
were found at a Santa Fe gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Mexico man pleaded guilty in 1992 to selling the  
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Johns said it has taken years to return the objects to the  
Navajo because federal regulations require that authorities ensure 
the objects are being returned to the proper tribe.

<HEADLINE> Bob Barker Suffering From Fatigue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- ``The Price is Right'' host Bob Barker was  
expected to leave a hospital today after being admitted for 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, went to the emergency room at the George Washington  
University Hospital on Thursday when he ``didn't feel quite right'' 
before a meeting with some members of Congress, his spokesman, 
Henry Bollinger, said in a telephone interview from California. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokeswoman Lisa Saisselin said the television game  
show host was in good condition Thursday night and was expected to 
be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was visiting Washington to lobby lawmakers on behalf of a  
bill that would protect animals such as elephants that are part of 
entertainment acts. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Barker was given a lifetime achievement award at the  
26th annual Daytime Emmy Awards. Barker, who has taped more than 
5,000 shows in his career, has been on ``The Price is Right'' since 
1972, and was host of ``Truth or Consequences'' for 18 years before 
that.

<HEADLINE> Care To Bid on the Babe's Skivvies? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking to complete that fall wardrobe? Babe  
Ruth's underwear might be the perfect fit. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, maybe Jackie Robinson's tie rack does the trick.  
</P>
<P>
	Or perhaps the original words and music to ``Take Me Out To The  
Ball Game'' is just the thing to prop up on the piano. 
</P>
<P>
	Collector Barry Halper is making it all possible.  
</P>
<P>
	Halper, a minority owner of the New York Yankees and renowned  
collector of baseball memorabilia, already has his own wing in the 
Baseball Hall of Fame. Now, he's sharing his enormous trove with 
the public, beginning Thursday with an auction at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection, which Halper started in the late 1940s with  
Ruth's autograph the year before he died, grew in the '50s and '60s 
before it became a trend. It contains 80,000 items as disparate as 
what is believed to be the first baseball ever made (1846) to cigar 
boxes with players' names on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Expected to bring the highest bids are the bat from Ruth's final  
appearance at Yankee Stadium, which he used as a cane; a rare Honus 
Wagner baseball card with no back; Joe DiMaggio's rookie uniform 
from the Pacific Coast League; and Lou Gehrig's 1927 World Series 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Halper kept most of the stuff in his Livingston, N.J., basement.  
But when it became too much he decided to auction most of it and 
keep only personalized items. 
</P>
<P>
	Counted among his friends were Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson and  
Pete Rose. Each donated many items to the collection, along with 
autographs and signed sentiments to Halper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantle gave his Triple Crown trophy and World Series ring from  
1956. Jackson donated lithographs, a box of Reggie chocolate bars 
and 494 cards and collectibles. Rose contributed the signed uniform 
he wore when he got record hit No. 4,192, as well as an autographed 
Ty Cobb photo. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection also includes 400 uniforms, bats, balls, gloves,  
pennants, mugs, books, photos, rings, trophies, awards, pins, 
contracts, yearbooks, cards, wallets and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items of note include a baseball from Cal Ripken's  
record-breaking 2,131st consecutive game signed by President 
Clinton; a home plate signed by the 1988 gold medal Olympic 
baseball team; a 1969 Seattle Pilots yearbook; a ticket from the 
first World Series in 1903; and a questionnaire given to Roger 
Maris by the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The display is open to the public through Wednesday when  
Sotheby's puts up for auction artifacts from the early days of 
baseball, including an 1894 Cuban Giants Negro League program, a 
beer bottle from Ruth's family saloon and a ``Joe DiMaggio'' and 
``Norma Jeane DiMaggio'' signed baseball from 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the onsite auction, which runs through Sept. 29,  
buyers will be able to purchase items on the Internet in 
mid-October.

<HEADLINE> Future Teachers Need More Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colleges set on producing quality teachers  
must give students more practice time in kindergarten-through-12th 
grade classrooms, members of Congress told college officials 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often the experience of a student in college is a few  
weeks of poorly supervised sessions in a classroom,'' said Sen. 
Jack Reed, D-R.I, who is a member of the Senate committee that 
crafts federal education law. ``Then, upon graduation, they are 
thrown into a classroom alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The President's Summit on Teacher Quality brought hundreds of  
college and university presidents here this week to discuss the 
steps they can take to improve teacher preparation on their 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit comes a year after Congress updated higher education  
laws to make states and colleges more accountable for the quality 
of about 1,300 colleges and universities with teacher-preparation 
programs that receive federal aid. Lawmakers cited years of 
complaints that teacher colleges have been unwilling to make the 
changes necessary to turn out competent educators. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly all of the nation's 2.7 million teachers have a  
bachelor's degree, and nearly half have master's degrees. The 
majority of college programs require 7 to 10 weeks of student 
teaching or other types of field training, said Emily Feistritzer, 
president of the National Center for Education Information, a 
private Washington-based education research group that is preparing 
a national survey of teacher preparation programs. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the group, less than 5 percent of the nation's 356  
college teacher prep programs require more than four months of 
student teaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials believe such little time in classrooms before  
graduation leaves teachers feeling less prepared for their duties; 
they cite Education Department survey earlier this year that found 
4 out of 5 of the nation's public school teachers said they were 
not ready to teach minority or special education students or use 
technology in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who chairs the Senate Health,  
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said universities could 
remedy this by using government funds to build better relationships 
with elementary and secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	More than $75 million in federal grants for fiscal 1999 would  
pay for more collaboration between education schools and 
departments in the arts and sciences, more clinical experience in 
public schools for prospective teachers, and opportunities for 
training of graduates as they begin their first few years of 
teaching. To get the money, colleges must show that 80 percent of 
their prospective teachers have passed state licensing exams and 
provide reports on their teacher-education programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The concern over teacher quality is heightened by the nation's  
need to hire 2.2 million more teachers during the next decade 
because of retirements and increasing enrollments, Education 
Secretary Richard Riley told the officials. 
</P>
<P>
	At the summit's opening session Wednesday evening, he conceded  
the myriad of challenges today's teachers face. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect them to be computer whizzes,'' Riley said. ``We  
expect them to teach children who come to school without breakfast 
and return to broken homes. And they must sometimes do it in 
schools that are overcrowded or where ceilings are crumbling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said colleges as a whole must do more to support teacher  
education, which can't, like schools of medicine, law and business, 
turn to high-earning alumni for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too often the school of education is a poor cousin to the  
other schools on campus,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Up; Dow Gains 66.17 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose Friday as the dollar showed renewed  
signs of strength against the Japanese yen. As the dollar extended 
its recovery from the 3 1/2-year low reached Wednesday, it boosted the 
bond market, which enticed investors back into bank and brokerage 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average gained 66.17 to close at  
10,803.63, erasing its 63-point loss on Thursday. For the week, 
however, the average tumbled 224.80 points, a loss of 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also closed higher Friday. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 16.94 to 1,335.42, and the Nasdaq composite index 
jumped 62.90 to close at 2,869.62. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks benefited from the rising dollar in foreign-exchange  
markets. The dollar, which on Wednesday sank to 103.20 yen, the 
lowest level since early 1996, bought 106.86 Japanese yen in late 
U.S. trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has struggled against the yen in recent months amid a  
recovery in the Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors fear a weaker dollar because it makes imports more  
expensive, setting the stage for a rise in inflation in the United 
States. A falling dollar also can encourage foreign investors to 
pull out of U.S. stocks to seek more attractive returns elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``If foreigners get worried about the dollar depreciating, they  
are more inclined to not invest in U.S. securities or will even 
shift money out of the United States,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, a 
market analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. ``So a rising 
dollar clearly helps investor sentiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's government, meantime, worries that if the yen rises too  
sharply, it will cut short a recovery from that country's deep 
recession by making Japanese goods too expensive to compete 
effectively on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The rising dollar helped the bond market rebound. The yield on  
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond slipped to 6.04 percent from 
6.07 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The improvement in the bond market helped everything that  
depends on interest rates,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity 
analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. That included 
financial-services companies like American Express, which rose 3 3/8 
to 139 7/8, the strongest performer in the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 4 5/16 to 91 7/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Gains in a wide range of technology shares also supported the  
market. Microsoft gained 2 11/16 to 96 7/16, Cisco Systems picked 
up 3 to 73 1/2, and Sun Microsystems rose 4 to 88 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Adobe Systems jumped 7 1/8 to 105 after reporting that it earned 80  
cents a share in its fiscal third quarter, beating analysts' 
estimates of 74 cents a share. The software company also declared a 
2-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dow's two technology powerhouses fell steeply. IBM fell  
4 5/8 to 125 3/8 after a Merrill Lynch analyst issued a cautious outlook 
for the company's revenue growth. Analyst Steve Milunovich said in 
a report that he expects IBM's hardware sales to increase only 4 
percent from a year ago, down from a previous estimate of 6 percent 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett-Packard fell 3 1/8 to 100 13/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Solid gains from General Electric, up 2 3/4 to 120, and 3M, up 2  
3/16 to 98 1/4, helped the Dow move higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Commerce Department reported that new  
construction of homes and apartments rose 0.4 percent in August, 
keeping a brisk pace despite rising mortgage rates. But new 
building permits, considered a gauge of future construction, fell 
by 1.8 percent in August, after being unchanged in July. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Stock Exchange composite volume totaled 998.45 million  
shares, compared with 872.42 million in the previous session. 
Volume was higher due to the ``triple witching'' session, a 
once-a-quarter event when contracts on stock options, index 
options, and index futures all expire. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
NYSE. ``The market looked good in terms of participation,'' Hyman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.20 to 434.45.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average gained 0.3 percent.  
Germany's DAX index slipped less than 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 rose 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 rose 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panel Recommends Help for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To prevent future international financial  
crises, a high-level task force recommended Friday that commercial 
banks and wealthy investors play a bigger role in bailing out 
troubled national economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, also  
suggested that the International Monetary Fund return to a previous 
policy of providing smaller rescue packages. And it urged countries 
trying to develop market economies to avoid fixed currency exchange 
rates and to control short-term capital inflows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The task force believes that the primary responsibility for  
crisis prevention and management in emerging economies should be 
placed on the economies themselves and on the private lenders and 
investors that dominate today's international capital markets,'' 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason it was so difficult to get Congress to approve an $18  
billion increase in IMF financing last year, the report said, ``was 
the perception that Wall Street -- and particularly large banks -- 
was benefiting much more from (IMF-led) rescue packages than was 
Main Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These issues are expected to be at the center the annual  
meetings of the IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank, 
starting next week in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said both organizations need to refocus on areas they  
are best equipped to deal with instead of expanding into the 
other's territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a request from President Clinton last year, the  
New York-based Council on Foreign Relations put together an 
independent group to study changing the international financial 
system in light of global financial crises that began in mid-1997. 
Other nations and the IMF committed $190 billion to help bail out 
Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Russia and Brazil. One-third of 
the money has been disbursed so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Commerce Secretary Peter Peterson and Carla Hills, former  
U.S. Trade Representative, chaired the 29-person panel. It included 
economists, business leaders, labor union representatives, former 
government officials and lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Project director Morris Goldstein, an economist at the  
International Institute of Economics and a former IMF official, 
said real headway can be made in dealing with financial crises only 
by putting responsibility on the main participants, the 
emerging-market countries and their creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to change the behavior of borrowers and private  
creditors, and to do that you have to alter the incentives they 
have to manage risk better,'' Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the advantages of smaller (IMF) financial rescue  
packages is that over time they should convince borrowers and 
creditors they are on their own if they overborrow and overlend, 
and this will make them more careful in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report says that in recent years the balance has tilted too  
far away from market discipline. ``Unless balance is restored, we 
will not be successful either in deterring future crises or in 
garnering support for official rescue packages,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute for International Finance, which represents major  
international banks and financial institutions, recommended a 
voluntary, case-by-case approach for its members. Compelling them 
to take losses, the institute said Thursday, would ``make bad 
situations worse.''

<HEADLINE> Danforth Seeks Delay in Waco Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special counsel investigating the  
possibility of an official cover-up after the 1993 Branch Davidian 
siege has asked a Texas judge to delay lawyers' fact-finding in the 
civil lawsuit filed against the government by Davidian survivors 
and relatives of the dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Sen. John Danforth asked a federal judge in Waco to issue  
an order delaying for 30 days any discovery and witness interviews 
by government and plaintiffs' lawyers in the upcoming trial. He 
also requested permission to interview all witnesses first. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my firm belief that our inquiry will benefit by  
interviewing witnesses prior to their preparation for testimony in 
a civil trial,'' Danforth wrote Thursday to U.S. District Judge 
Walter Smith. ``Because a civil trial inherently involves advocacy, 
testimony tends to be very well-rehearsed and coordinated with the 
testimony of other witnesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Surviving Davidians and the relatives of the dead are  
challenging the government's conclusion that the fire that swept 
through the Davidians' compound on April 19, 1993 was set by cult 
members. Leader David Koresh and some 80 followers died during the 
inferno, some from the fire, others from gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth is investigating whether the government covered up its  
use of potentially incendiary tear gas grenades that day and 
whether federal agents fired any shots in the final hours, among 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith did not rule Friday on Danforth's request, which is not  
without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Monica Lewinsky investigation last year, Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr asked the judge in the Paula Jones sexual 
harassment lawsuit against President Clinton to halt any 
evidence-gathering in the civil case that related to the Lewinsky 
matter. Starr contended that lawyers in the Jones case were 
interfering with his criminal investigation by pursuing the same 
witnesses and evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Danforth, appointed last week by Attorney General Janet Reno to  
head an independent investigation into the newly revived Waco 
controversy, said he needs until mid-October to get his inquiry up 
and running. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are moving very rapidly,'' Danforth wrote. ``We do not  
envision, however, that we will be able to conduct detailed 
interviews of critical witnesses until mid-October. That is why we 
have requested the 30-day stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the two main plaintiffs' attorneys in the case  
voluntarily agreed Friday to postpone for two weeks the depositions 
of Reno, an FBI sharpshooter and a key FBI on-scene commander, 
which had been scheduled for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was too much to ask to give them two more  
weeks to sort of get organized,'' said Houston lawyer Michael 
Caddell. But he objected to a 30-day delay, saying, ``I cannot halt 
all discovery for 30 days and not impair my ability and still get 
ready for trial by January.'' He wrote to the judge Friday that 
discovery should continue and lawyers should be allowed to continue 
making copies of government evidence such as videotapes. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for other plaintiffs in the case, Jim Brannon of  
Houston, rejected the notion of voluntarily delaying his 
depositions, saying he would forge ahead unless told otherwise by 
the judge. Brannon said he intends to be in Washington beginning 
Monday to interview ``dozens and dozens'' of federal officials who 
were on the scene during the 51-day siege. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I object to the 30 days? Not if the court orders it, I  
don't. But only if a court orders it,'' Brannon said Friday. ``I'm 
not going to volunteer it, like Mr. Caddell seems to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith this week vacated the Oct. 18 trial date, saying the  
government needs more time to produce the voluminous amount of 
siege-related documents and evidence he recently demanded turned 
over to his court. The judge did not set a new date, but Caddell 
said he is operating under the assumption it will be in January or 
later.

<HEADLINE> Tommy Morrison Arrested for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- In his latest run-in with the law,  
ex-boxer Tommy Morrison was arrested on drug charges after being 
stopped for careless driving. 
</P>
<P>
	The former WBO heavyweight champion was carrying more than a  
gram of cocaine and also had marijuana and a gun, police said. He 
was released from jail Friday after making his $3,500 bond. His 
arraignment was scheduled for Oct. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison was arrested Thursday night after officers spotted him  
driving erratically on a busy street. He was cooperative, although 
he refused to take a drug test, Sgt. Mike Perryman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison, whose career ended in 1996 after he contracted the  
AIDS virus, has been in trouble with the law several times. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tulsa County, Okla., last week, he received a two-year  
suspended sentence after pleading guilty to drunken driving. At the 
hearing, Morrison said he might consider a return to the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a Delaware County (Okla.) jury convicted Morrison of  
driving under the influence and other charges related to a traffic 
accident that injured three people. He was ordered to spend time in 
a treatment facility. 
</P>
<P>
	He also avoided jail time on charges of drunken driving and  
speeding in Kansas in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrison won the WBO championship in 1993 by defeating George  
Foreman. He had 40 knockouts during his career.

<HEADLINE>  Kenyan Game Warden Found Not Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- A former Kenyan game warden was cleared  
today in the killing of British tourist Julie Ward in the famous 
Masai Mara game reserve 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Ole Makallah sat expressionless as Judge Daniel Aganyanya  
read out the verdict to an overflowing Nairobi courtroom. If 
convicted, he could have faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the courtroom, Maasai tribesman broke into dancing and  
singing after the verdict was announced. Makallah, 49, is a Maasai 
elder in his tiny village in western Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was a bitter blow to John Ward, who has devoted more  
than a decade to uncovering the truth of his daughter's final hours 
in the Masai Mara. He shrugged his shoulders as the judge announced 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Julie Ward's charred and mutilated remains were found there on  
September 13, 1988, six days after she disappeared from her 
campsite. Officials first claimed she had been attacked and killed 
by wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
	A trial four years later acquitted two park rangers in the  
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Aganyanya's decision on Friday came two months after three court  
assessors recommended a not-guilty verdict for Makallah, who was 
the game reserve's chief warden at the time of Ward's murder. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing the prosecution and defense cases in the 43-day  
trial, the assessors -- appointed under the Kenyan legal system to 
help the judge evaluate the evidence -- said the prosecution had 
failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Makallah had murdered 
the 28-year-old publishing assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Aganyanya was not bound by the assessors' opinion, he  
too said the prosecution had failed to prove its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Makallah maintained his innocence throughout the trial. He is  
now assistant director of the Kenya Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	John Ward, a hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, was an  
official member of the police team investigating his daughter's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified as a prosecution witness in Makallah's trial,  
alleging that the game warden's behavior during the search for his 
daughter had been suspicious and that Makallah had misdirected 
search parties and lied to investigators.

<HEADLINE> Huskers Await Test in Southern Miss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Coach Frank Solich knows the timing for an  
overhaul of Nebraska's offense was far from ideal. 
</P>
<P>
	Not with Southern Mississippi coming to Lincoln on Saturday.  
Solich said the Golden Eagles (2-0) will be the best team the No. 4 
Cornhuskers (2-0) have faced so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always a little leery of making a change, but thinking  
it all through it seemed like that would probably be the best thing 
for this football team,'' Solich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's game will be Nebraska's first with its new offense.  
Solich is giving up on the duel quarterback system of Bobby 
Newcombe and Eric Crouch. He's going with Crouch as the starter and 
moving Newcombe to wingback. Dan Alexander gets his first start at 
I-back after the sudden departure of DeAngelo Evans, who quit the 
team after two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Solich is confident the new system can work as well as the old  
one, which racked up 87 points in routs of Iowa and California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was playing out well for us. We were able to keep a fresh  
quarterback in there. I think there's a lot of pluses in that,'' 
Solich said. ``But this will make the defense prepare in a much 
different fashion with both those guys on the field at the same 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crouch played some wingback this year and took a screen pass  
from Newcombe 60 yards for a score in last week's 45-0 shutout of 
California, but he's been the more effective quarterback. Crouch 
leads the team with six touchdowns and is second in rushing despite 
limited playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe played at wingback as a freshman two years ago when  
Nebraska, which had Scott Frost starting at quarterback, wanted to 
find a place for him. Alexander leads the Cornhuskers in rushing 
this year with 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, they run every kind of option you can imagine.  
They are a big option team and a very, very good play-action team. 
They get big plays off the play action,'' Southern Miss coach Jeff 
Bower said. ``This is the type of game you obviously have to be 
very disciplined. You can't go to sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solich doesn't want his team to take the Eagles lightly.  
Southern Miss, in its fourth season in Conference USA, won league 
titles in 1996 and 1997 before Tulane took the crown last year with 
an undefeated season. Southern Miss avenged that with a 
season-opening 48-14 win over the Green Wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Miss' defense has allowed just 60 rushing yards in wins  
over Tulane and Division I-AA Northwestern State of Louisiana. 
Solich said the Eagles run a confusing defense by shifting players 
around until the ball is snapped. Southern Miss, went 7-5 last year 
and is the Huskers' first opponent coming off a winning season, 
with eight starters back on defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this type of defense can really make you look bad  
at times,'' Solich said. ``But on the other side of it, hopefully 
there will be some things called that we'll end up having a chance 
to make some big plays.''

<HEADLINE> Family Sends Young Kids To College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Sarah Davis, the youngest of four  
children, is a bubbly sixth grader who happens to be enrolled 
part-time at Purdue University. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah attends sixth-grade classes from 8 a.m. to noon, comes  
home for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, then goes to 
college-level Spanish and computer classes at the university. In 
the late afternoon, she's tutored in college-level chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to her fellow sixth-grade students, the 11-year-old is  
a prodigy. But by Davis family standards, she's just another kid. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah's 15-year-old brother Fred works on a research fellowship  
at Purdue, part of the six-year pharmacy program he'll graduate 
from at age 17. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sarah's two older siblings -- who now work for computer  
companies in California and New Jersey -- graduated from Purdue at 
ages 16 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
	This tendency to blaze trails through the educational system was  
sparked by parents who preach learning like it's gospel. Steve and 
Kathy Davis are natives of Iran, and both were educators before 
they moved to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	They were raised in a culture where parents helped educate their  
children, and they never intended to rely solely on the American 
school system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not put a lot of high expectations on the school  
system,'' Steve Davis says. ``I believe the school system is 
supplementary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with their first child, Michael, the Davises created  
their own educational plan. Michael attended a regular school, but 
in the evenings his father or mother would teach him more. If he 
was doing addition and subtraction in school, they'd teach him 
multiplication and division. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our kids never got bored, because always there was something  
to do,'' the father says. ``To what better use can you put time 
than to learning?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Davises steered clear of America's chronological system of  
teaching and let the kids advance as far as they wanted to go. 
Fred, at one point, was simultaneously taking courses in middle 
school, high school and college. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Davis children do more than just study. Michael was on  
the wrestling and track teams in high school, and Kelly, who's now 
21 and working in California, played the guitar and ran cross 
country. Fred spends time rooting for Purdue's basketball team and 
Sarah is in the school band. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe 100 percent that they have to be kids, just as they  
are at their age,'' says their father. ``We don't want to raise 
bookworms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Post, an associate professor of medicinal chemistry at  
Purdue, works with Fred on a research project. She says his age has 
no impact on the respect he commands from his peers, most of whom 
are doctoral students at least 10 years his senior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just interacting with Fred, you can tell he's a pretty happy  
kid,'' Post says. ``He's got a great sense of humor. He associates 
with other kids his own age, so he's not really being deprived of 
anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the Davises' method of child rearing, Post says she  
approves: ``They're just taking advantage of having a major 
university here and giving their kids every opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Miss America Parade Ready to Roll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Everyone loves a parade. Even  
striking casino hotel workers. Even tropical storm Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four hours after the storm and the strike had threatened  
to force the first-ever cancellation of the Miss America Pageant 
parade, the outlook Friday was as bright as Miss Vermont's smile. 
</P>
<P>
	Striking workers settled their three-day old job action Friday,  
resolving what pageant officials had feared could be an ugly, 
violent mix of pageantry and protesting. 
</P>
<P>
	And the storm was but a soggy memory. The sun beamed down from a  
cloudless blue sky as parade preparations wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Miracles happen,'' beamed Barbara K. Miller, 53, of Atlantic  
City, sitting in empty Boardwalk bleachers that had been set up for 
spectators Friday afternoon. ``We're very lucky it's coming off at 
all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 150,000 people were expected to turn out for the  
annual spectacle, which features the 51 Miss America contestants 
riding down the Boardwalk in open convertibles accompanied by 
marching bands, floats, drill teams, dancers, cheerleaders and 
string bands. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia 76ers president Pat Croce was the grand marshal of  
the parade, which also was to include Miss America 1939 Patricia 
Donnelly Harris. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Newton Wants Kentucky Home in Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- If Kentucky athletic director C.M. Newton  
has his way, there will be no Kentucky home for the annual 
Kentucky-Indiana basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, played each year in early December, currently  
alternates between Louisville's Freedom Hall and the RCA Dome in 
Indianapolis. However, Newton said he'd be just as happy playing in 
Indianapolis every year, as long as the schools continue splitting 
tickets and gate receipts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can put 18,000 (Kentucky fans) in a dome and only 10,000 in  
Louisville,'' Newton told the Lexington Herald-Leader. ``As long as 
we're half the building and creating a Final Four atmosphere, it's 
something we ought to investigate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky-Indiana games in Indianapolis have had an average  
attendance of 38,521 this decade. In Louisville, the games have 
drawn an average of 19,442. 
</P>
<P>
	Although such a move would mean no Wildcats-Hoosier games in  
Kentucky, Newton said it would be worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky fans would still have access to half the tickets, he  
said, and a game in the RCA Dome would give the Wildcats an 
early-season chance to play in an atmosphere similar to what they 
experience in the NCAA tournament, when all Final Fours and most 
regional finals are played in domes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, in a story about efforts to move the series  
permanently to Indianapolis, the Indianapolis Star-News reported 
that scheduling conflicts at the RCA Dome would make it impossible 
to make the change until at least 2003. A motor-sports trade show 
and a religious convention already have reserved the facility for 
early December 2000 and 2002, respectively, stadium director Mike 
Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky-Indiana series has alternated annually between  
Indianapolis and Louisville since 1991. Before that, the game 
rotated among Bloomington, Ind., Indianapolis and Lexington.

<HEADLINE> Vols Ready To Take on Spurrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Fool Steve once, shame on him. Fool  
Steve twice ... well, that doesn't happen too often. 
</P>
<P>
	Not since 1993-94, when Terry Bowden and his surprising Auburn  
teams pulled it off, has any team beaten Steve Spurrier and the 
Gators two straight games. No. 2 Tennessee tries to add its name to 
that short list Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The No. 4 Gators and Vols cap a huge day of football in the  
state of Florida, meeting in a rematch of last year's 20-17 
Tennessee victory. The Volunteers created five turnovers in that 
game and snapped a five-game losing streak to their biggest 
Southeastern Conference rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee (1-0) went on to win the conference and national  
championships. Florida (2-0) settled for leftovers for the second 
straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case with Auburn in 1994, Tennessee's next task is to  
prove the first win was no fluke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols will have to do it at The Swamp, where the Gators put  
their 29-game home winning streak against Tennessee's 14-game 
overall winning streak. Both streaks are the best in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden's situation was similar in that he brought a 17-game  
winning streak into his rematch at Florida Field. The Tigers won 
36-33, the last time Florida lost at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had extreme confidence,'' said Bowden, who considers the  
win at Florida the biggest in the 5 1/2 years he spent at Auburn. ``It 
wasn't because of the talent. It was because of the previous 17 
Saturdays that we had found a way to win. It was that audacity. The 
feeling was that we could find a way to beat anyone at that point. 
Tennessee has to come in here feeling the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vols coach Phil Fulmer has been preaching that attitude all  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just need to be ourselves,'' Fulmer said. ``And that's to  
be balanced, to run the ball and play a good mixture of pressure 
and coverage on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's what won Tennessee the championship last season and that  
was pretty much how the Volunteers beat the Gators, adding the 
healthy dose of turnovers to the rest of their balanced mix. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, many teams have come to Florida Field with good game  
plans, only to see them evaporate in the frenzy of Spurrier's Fun 
'N' Gun offense and the Gators' suffocating defense. Since 1994, no 
team has come close to beating Florida in the rematch after a 
victory the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, LSU and Georgia failed, the Tigers losing 22-10 in a  
game that wasn't that close, and Georgia falling 38-7 in the annual 
meeting in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State has had more chances than anyone and will get  
another this season. Bobby Bowden went 3-0-1 against Florida 
between the 1992 and 1994 seasons. But probably the most memorable 
rematch in Gators-Seminoles history was Florida's 52-20 romp over 
Florida State in the 1997 Sugar Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Why all the success in rematches? Why has Florida always bounced  
back from some of its biggest losses while others -- like Tennessee 
in this very series -- take much longer to rebound? 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good question,'' Gators quarterback Doug Johnson  
said. ``Maybe because we've got a little more respect for a team 
after a loss. Maybe it's because you realize you can be beaten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has a lot to do with pride,'' linebacker Eugene  
McCaslin said. ``When you lose a ball game, you lose a little 
pride. You want to come back and earn some respect. The only way to 
earn respect is to come out and play that opponent the best you 
can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee certainly should have the attitude advantage this  
year. The Vols are, after all, national champions who return the 
bulk of the team that beat the Gators last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has a completely new defense that has been torched for  
784 yards passing in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	But then there's the revenge angle.  
</P>
<P>
	While Terry Bowden, now a college football analyst for ABC, says  
he has never believed in revenge as a motivating factor, he thinks 
this game could be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might not choose the word `revenge,' but when Tennessee  
comes to town, it will be an ugly reminder that Florida is not the 
team in the conference anymore,'' Bowden said. ``It turns into a 
pride game. If Florida loses this game, it means they're still 
second best. And we all know, Spurrier doesn't like to be 
second-best at anything.''

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Burning in Northern Alabama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOOD SPRINGS, Ala. (AP) -- More than 1,000 wildfires have burned  
15,584 acres across Alabama since early August, including a blaze 
Friday that forced the closing of a rural school about 20 miles 
northwest of Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the fire here was under control Friday afternoon  
and posed no threat to the T.W. Martin School, but thick, black 
smoke hung across the school yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind is a terrible problem, and the low humidity,'' said  
Coleen Vansant, a spokeswoman with the Alabama Forestry Commission. 
``It makes the ignition point lower, it burns hotter and it burns 
more erratically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Siegelman declared a drought emergency for 33 northern  
counties Friday, making it illegal to do any kind of outdoor 
burning. He also activated an Alabama National Guard helicopter 
crew to help douse the wildfires burning in at least six counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Strawbridge, regional forester for the commission's  
northwest region, said continued dry weather and high winds whipped 
up by Hurricane Floyd could mean devastation as bad as in 1987, 
when 6,000 acres a day were lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said many of the blazes were sparked by people burning  
outside without a permit. Three people have been charged with 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
	At Huntsville Speedway, a blaze started Friday when a  
maintenance worker's weed-cutting machine caught fire and then 
spread to four VIP booths, concession stands and the speedway 
office complex. Track officials said it wouldn't delay the 2000 
season opener set for March 31.

<HEADLINE> New Inscription For Vietnam Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a gesture of respect for the 2,054 U.S.  
servicemen missing from the Vietnam War, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen on Friday dedicated a new inscription at the Tomb of the 
Unknowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The words that now grace the Vietnam tomb -- `Honoring and  
Keeping Faith with America's Missing Servicemen,' -- are carved in 
stone,'' Cohen said as dozens of veterans, former prisoners of war 
and families of missing servicemen sat silently at the Memorial 
Amphitheater in Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their permanence, like our remembrance of America's fallen  
soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, will be a measure of this 
nation's profound reverence and respect,'' he said. ``And those 
words will always remain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nation must also aim at ``restoring peace of mind to those  
who still struggle with a grief born of uncertainty'' about what 
happened to the men unaccounted for from Vietnam and other wars of 
the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	``So to the families and friends of those stilling missing we  
renew our oath: Without rest or reservation, we will strive to 
account for every warrior who has fought to preserve the freedoms 
that we cherish and enjoy this day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon decided earlier this year to place the inscription  
on the tomb cover of the Vietnam unknown after it removed the 
remains in May 1998 and positively identified them as 1st Lt. 
Michael Blassie, an Air Force pilot who was shot down in 1972. He 
was reburied by his family in St. Louis in July 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	This summer the Pentagon announced that the Tomb of the Unknowns  
never again would contain a symbolic victim of the Vietnam War 
because advances in forensic science -- particularly the use of DNA 
technologies -- make it at least theoretically possible that all war 
remains eventually can be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	When Blassie's remains were placed in the tomb in 1984 they were  
thought to be unidentifiable. The World War I remains in a grave 
below the main sarcophagus were dug up from an American cemetery in 
France and entombed on Veteran's Day, 1921. The World War II and 
Korean War unknowns were added in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tomb of the Unknowns is most recognized for the  
round-the-clock detail of sentinels who guard the white-marble 
sarcophagus that is atop the grave of the Unknown Soldier of World 
War I. Its inscription reads: ``Here Rests In Honored Glory An 
American Soldier Known But To God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the shadow of the sarcophagus are the graves of unknowns from  
World War II, Korea and Vietnam; each is marked with a white marble 
slab that is flush with the ground and marked with the dates of 
those conflicts. The Vietnam tomb is the only one of the three with 
an inscription other than the dates. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks at Friday's ceremony, Sen. Max Cleland said the  
tribute is especially important as a salute to ``those families for 
whom the war is not over'' -- those whose loved ones are still 
unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland, the Georgia Democrat who lost both his legs and one arm  
in a grenade explosion while serving in Vietnam, said he was 
confident the government was keeping faith with its pledge to 
achieve the fullest possible accounting of MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing all we can, but it's never enough,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon says 529 U.S. servicemen have been identified and  
accounted for from Vietnam since the end of the war, leaving 2,054 
MIAs. There are about 8,200 missing from the Korean War and more 
than 78,000 from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	In an indication of the growing use of DNA technologies by the  
Pentagon, on Wednesday the remains of two unknown soldiers from the 
Korean War were removed from the National Memorial Cemetery of the 
Pacific in Honolulu to try to match their DNA with DNA from family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon estimates that as many as 70 of the 866 sets of  
remains at the Hawaii cemetery eventually may be disinterred and 
identified through DNA matching.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Recovers Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar continued its climb back against the  
yen on Friday, amid more talk that the Japanese government might 
intervene in markets to rein in its soaring currency. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar, which rose for second straight session against the  
yen, was mixed against other major currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 106.86 yen in New York late Friday, up  
from 105.19 yen late Thursday and a 3 1/2-year low of 103.20 yen 
reached during trading on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has struggled against the yen in recent months amid a  
recovery in the Japanese economy, which has enticed traders to 
invest there. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's government, though, worries that if the yen rises too  
sharply, it will cut short a recovery from that country's recession 
by making Japanese goods too expensive to compete effectively on 
world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors of a Japanese intervention to temper yen-strength  
continue to circulate and amid calls from Japan for foreign 
cooperation to deal with the recent surge of the yen. While most 
are skeptical that such action will occur, it is likely to provide 
short-term support for the dollar, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted late Friday at $1.0404, up from $1.0399  
Thursday. The British pound was quoted at $1.6228, down from 
$1.6242. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday,  
included 1.5424 Swiss francs, up from 1.5415; and 1.4722 Canadian 
dollars, down from 1.4765. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8789 German marks, down from 1.8810 on 
Thursday; 6.3015 French francs, down from 6.3085; and 1.860.10 
Italian lire, down from 1,862.16.

<HEADLINE> NAACP May Boycott a TV Sweeps Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NAACP and other minority groups are  
considering a boycott of one of the four major television networks 
during a coming sweeps week, the civil rights organization's 
president said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking at trying to find a way to have a precision,  
laser-like strike,'' Kweisi Mfume said in a speech to the National 
Association of Black Owned Broadcasters. ``If you're talking about 
seven or eight days, that is possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at sweeps week,'' Mfume said. ``We've formed a  
coalition, so if they thought it was just black people they will be 
sadly mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No specific group or particular time period has been selected,  
he said. Sweeps are coming up in November and February, months when 
viewership numbers are used to set advertising rates. Local 
stations across the country design programming specifically to 
attract viewers during sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP and several other groups, mainly Hispanic, have  
condemned the networks for putting up virtually an all-white slate 
of series this fall. Mfume said the groups also are gathering data 
on network hiring and promotion as well as philanthropic records. 
</P>
<P>
	Minority organizations -- led by the Hispanic advocacy National  
Council of La Raza -- have called for a ``brownout'' of ABC, CBS, 
Fox and NBC through Sept. 25 to mark the first two weeks of the new 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	By targeting a sweeps period, the coalition of groups would take  
aim one of the most competitive and ratings-crucial periods for 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume, whose National Association for the Advancement of Colored  
People recently became a shareholder in all four networks, said the 
NAACP also will soon open a Hollywood office to monitor the 
situation.

<HEADLINE> TV Host Barker To Undergo Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Television game show host Bob Barker suffered  
what doctors consider a ministroke and will undergo surgery next 
week to clear a blocked artery that is impeding the flow of blood 
to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Samuel Potolicchio, a neurologist at George Washington  
University Hospital, said very little blood was getting through the 
artery in Barker's neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, host of ``The Price is Right'' for 28 years, was  
admitted to the hospital Thursday complaining of fatigue. Doctors 
determined that he had experienced a transient ischemic attack -- 
commonly considered a ministroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``The artery is basically cleaned out and then sewn back  
together again, and this should prevent him from having a stroke,'' 
Potolicchio said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker, 75, agreed to let doctors perform a procedure Monday to  
clear the block. He was advised to take care of the problem before 
returning home to California. Doctors have told Barker he could be 
released from the hospital as early as next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He will need two additional weeks of recuperation before he  
returns to his active schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``That should have minimal effect on the show, because they tape  
six to eight weeks in advance,'' said Henri Bollinger, Barker's 
publicist. 
</P>
<P>
	Barker was preparing for a speaking engagement Thursday before  
being stricken. A longtime animal rights activist, he had planned 
to spend the day lobbying for congressional legislation that would 
ban the use of elephants in circuses and traveling shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Price Is Right'' is the longest-running game show in TV  
history. Barker, the winner of a dozen Emmy awards, also spent 18 
years as host of NBC's ``Truth or Consequences'' game show.

<HEADLINE> Florida Gators Ride High At Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The stadium consists of 85,000 metal  
seats that aren't particularly comfortable. It surrounds 100 yards 
of football field that isn't much different from any other. 
</P>
<P>
	So what makes The Swamp The Swamp?  
</P>
<P>
	Most likely, it's the team that plays there.  
</P>
<P>
	No. 4 Florida plays No. 2 Tennessee on Saturday, trying to  
protect its 29-game winning streak at the stadium that got its 
nickname a few years after Steve Spurrier arrived as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so coincidentally, that is the period during which the  
Gators transformed themselves into a national power. And that is 
what makes the mystique of The Swamp pretty easy to figure, says 
Terry Bowden, whose 1994 Auburn Tigers were the last visitor to win 
at Florida Field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every SEC coach will tell you, it's no different from the  
stadium at LSU, Auburn, Georgia or Alabama,'' Bowden said. ``If you 
go back to before Spurrier was there and when Florida wasn't 
winning as much, there wasn't much mystique there. Then they 
started winning. And it's pretty simple. Winning creates a 
home-field advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Spurrier arrived in 1990, the Gators are 55-2 at Florida  
Field. Auburn and Florida State are the only teams to win there 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators believe there is something extra about The Swamp,  
which got its name thanks to a comment Spurrier made after Florida 
defeated Florida State 14-9 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Swamp is where the Gators live,'' Spurrier said, referring  
to what before had simply been known as Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The legend grew from there.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's very different,'' said running back Robert Gillespie.  
``When we run out there, the noise the crowd makes is like nothing 
you've ever heard before. There's a sea of orange and blue. You 
can't really see one person. Everyone blends into each other. A 
feeling runs over your body. It doesn't matter who you're playing. 
Whether it's Tennessee or Appalachian State, you want to go out and 
play hard for the fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tennessee has a streak of its own going -- a 14-game winning  
streak that included the SEC and national titles and the 
Volunteers' first victory over Florida in six years last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Tee Martin will start his first game at Florida  
Field. He's taking the approach many players do when they come into 
one of the most intimidating venues in college football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The football field is the same width, the same length,''  
Martin said. ``The goalposts are the same. The colors in there 
might be a little different, but that's about all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Volunteers haven't won at Florida since 1971, when coach  
Phil Fulmer played offensive line. He's trying to take the mystique 
out of the place and clue his players in on the hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot like our place in that it's tough to hear,'' Fulmer  
said. ``But until they experience it, there's not much you can 
really tell them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that, several Florida players were more than willing to  
chime in. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're confident and they're supposed to come in with  
confidence,'' Gators linebacker Eugene McCaslin said of the Vols. 
``But confidence doesn't win ballgames. They've got to come into 
The Swamp and win a game, and that's not real easy. Not a lot of 
people have done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Tennessee, Bowden brought his team to Florida in 1994  
riding a huge wave of success and emotion. Auburn had a 17-game 
winning streak at the time, and Bowden, now an analyst with ABC, 
was quickly drawing favorable comparisons to both Steve Spurrier 
and his own father. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers won that game 36-33 on a last-second field goal. The  
Florida fans filed out of their own stadium in silent shock. That's 
the last time The Swamp has been so quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	``After kickoff, you'll notice that Florida is about as loud as  
the rest of the stadiums in the SEC,'' Bowden said. ``The biggest 
difference there is that in the last quarter, it's just as loud. 
Because the people are going to keep yelling when their team is 
winning or close every game.''

<HEADLINE> Maine Bans Smoking in Restaurants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLOWELL, Maine (AP) -- Even before Maine's restaurant smoking  
ban took effect, the air was clear at Bolley's Famous Franks. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Pooler, the owner of the nine-table eatery down the road  
from the state Capitol, left no doubt that he would let smokers 
light up right up to the 12:01 a.m. Saturday deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, he acknowledged, many smokers will be upset by the  
new rule. ``But, to tell you the truth,'' he added, ``I think it 
will probably help business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maine joins a small list of states prohibiting smoking in  
restaurants. The law, which authorizes $100 fines for restaurateurs 
or patrons who violate the ban, makes exceptions for stand-alone 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermont and Utah have similar laws, and California prohibits  
smoking in bars as well as restaurants. A number of cities also 
have imposed smoking bans in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Across Maine, many restaurateurs jumped ahead of the law and  
posted their businesses as smoke-free, said Ed Miller of the 
American Lung Association's Maine chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	In Eastport, America's easternmost city, WaCo Diner owner Nancy  
Bishop said she spent ``a fortune'' to create a nonsmokers' dining 
room overlooking Passamaquoddy Bay long before the law was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the entire eatery will have to go smokeless, and some of  
the regulars are not happy. ``I will lose some customers,'' she 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``What bugs me is the freedom of choice issue,'' she said. ``The  
government has got to stop somewhere legislating everything the 
individual does.''

<HEADLINE> Sherman Switches From Booth To Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Ray Sherman, stung by criticism that  
his play-calling was too conservative last week, is switching from 
the booth to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new offensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings said  
the change has nothing to do with the less-than-rave reviews that 
suggested his calls weren't bold enough in his team's 17-14 victory 
at Atlanta in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why it's a big issue. It's not like we lost,''  
Sherman said. ``If we had lost, I could see everybody getting up in 
arms. You are not going to beat the Atlanta Falcons by 40 or 50 
points. They're a good defensive team. The bottom line is we won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But quarterback Randall Cunningham admitted this week that he  
still hasn't adjusted to Sherman, who replaced Brian Billick, the 
architect of the most prolific scoring machine in NFL history and 
now the head coach at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham said one major difference was that Billick was on the  
sideline last year when the Vikings piled up points at a record 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every time I sat down with him, he'd tell me what he was  
thinking. He'd say, `Next time we call this play, go to this guy, 
because he will be open.' And it's amazing, I do it and we're 
sitting there with a touchdown,'' Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham admitted he and Sherman didn't talk enough during the  
game Sunday, but added he didn't necessarily want him to abandon 
the booth, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I prefer him to be comfortable,'' Cunningham said. ``If I have  
to come to the phone, I did that my whole career in Philadelphia 
and I was very successful with it. I just want to make sure that 
I'm communicating with him and he's communicating with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Sherman said he and Cunningham would talk much more  
from now on because he is going to go back to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to switch to the field. I've been on the field with  
him before,'' said Sherman, who was Cunningham's position coach in 
1997 before joining the Pittsburgh Steelers as their offensive 
coordinator last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as being able to be right there for him, it helped back  
then,'' Sherman said. ``I hope it will help now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherman spent his lone season in Pittsburgh in the booth.  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green said it's natural for Cunningham to need more  
time to get comfortable with Sherman's approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we missed scoring opportunities regardless  
of how comfortable anybody felt,'' Green said. ``And no matter what 
the new situation, everybody's got to get comfortable with Ray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings say it wasn't conservative play-calling or the  
switch in coordinators, but execution breakdowns and infractions 
that curtailed their production last week, when they failed to 
score at least 24 points for the first time since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Green agreed he wasn't happy with the point production, but he  
blamed his players, not his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a combination of things, guys jumped offsides, guys  
missed blocks. The quarterback did not throw the ball away and we 
missed two field goals,'' Green said. ``So those add up to a lot of 
points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Receiver Cris Carter complained that expectations are so high  
this season that ``people are under the illusion that we have to 
win by 20 points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why is the standard we have different than anybody else?'' he  
wondered. 
</P>
<P>
	Probably because the Vikings piled up an NFL record 556 points  
last year.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Win Tiebreaker With Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox won a coin flip Friday and  
would be home for a tiebreaking playoff game against New York to 
decide the AL East -- just like in 1978, when Bucky Dent's homer won 
the division for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Yankees and Red Sox tie for the division lead as well as  
the wild card, thus ensuring that both reach the playoffs, Boston 
would be the division champion based on an 8-4 head-to-head record 
against New York, which would then become the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
	In the event of a tie for the wild card, a Red Sox-Athletics  
game would be in Oakland and an Athletics-Yankees game would be in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The date of any tiebreakers would likely be Oct. 4, unless that  
day is needed to make up any postponements that affect the races.

<HEADLINE> Dragging Death Defense Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRYAN, Texas (AP) -- A lawyer for Lawrence Russell Brewer  
acknowledged today that his client was present when a black man was 
dragged to his death, and Brewer himself told jurors he wanted to 
``clear up everything'' about his role. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers began presenting their case in the capital  
murder trial, saying that while Brewer was there when James Byrd 
Jr. was slain in July 1998, he was not the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When this is all over, you're going to realize he's not a  
killer,'' Doug Barlow, Brewer's attorney, told jurors this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You heard about this horrific offense. No one can contest that  
at all. You've heard no evidence about who did what at the scene. 
That's the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russell was there on that logging road, but that's all you do  
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, is the second of three white men charged with  
chaining Byrd to the rear of a pickup truck and dragging him to his 
death along a country road northeast of Jasper. John William King, 
24, was convicted of capital murder and condemned in February, 
while Shawn Allen Berry, also 24, is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, the second defense witness, said he wanted to testify  
``so I can clear everything up that's happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was questioned about his early criminal record and trouble he  
got into as a juvenile. His testimony was continuing. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Terry Pelz, a prison consultant, was the first defense  
witness. He rejected prosecution suggestions that letters Brewer 
wrote while locked up could be considered confessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prison has its own slang,'' said Pelz, who spent 20 years in  
the Texas prison system, rising to an assistant warden before 
resigning in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's prison jargon unlike any other language that we know  
of. It's boastful. You expect it. It's like being able to talk the 
talk but being unable to walk the walk. It's a machismo. They want 
to brag about things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had introduced into evidence a letter Brewer wrote  
to King while jailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do believe we are bigger stars, or should I say hero of the  
day, than what we ever expected,'' Jasper County District Attorney 
Guy James Gray quoted Brewer as writing. ``We accomplished more 
than most ever dreamed of, as for being recorded in any type of 
history whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who is seeking the death penalty for Brewer, said the use  
of a term like hero ``tells you a lot about future dangerousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before prosecutors rested their case Thursday, they took jurors  
through the final minutes of Byrd's life with testimony from a 
pathologist who described Byrd's injuries in grueling detail and a 
video following the 3-mile route where Byrd was dragged to his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	One juror looked away, another winced and members of Byrd's  
family, seated in the courtroom audience, dabbed tears as 
prosecutors stretched the 24 1/2-foot steel chain that was allegedly 
used as a murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Brewer's DNA matches that found on a cigarette  
and beer bottle at the site where Byrd was believed beaten and 
chained to the truck. An FBI DNA expert also testified he found 
Byrd's blood on a sneaker bearing the initials ``L.B.,'' which was 
recovered from the apartment where Brewer was staying.

<HEADLINE> Writer Wodehouse Faced Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The late British author P.G. Wodehouse might have  
faced charges of treachery if he had returned to England after 
World War II, according to British intelligence papers released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously classified documents cast doubt on the view that  
Wodehouse was simply naive in making a series of lighthearted 
wartime radio broadcasts from Germany. The papers reveal suspicions 
that Wodehouse received payments and favors from the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wodehouse, the creator of Bertie Wooster and his brainy valet  
Jeeves, wrote more than 120 books. He was put into an internment 
camp in 1940 after the German Army defeated France, where he and 
his wife Edith were living. He was released the following year and 
was permitted to make five radio broadcasts to England and America 
from Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	His whimsical descriptions of camp life caused outrage in  
England. 
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Wodehouse admitted that he'd made a ``hideous  
mistake,'' but said the broadcasts were only intended to reassure 
his readers about his well-being, and did not harm the Allied war 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, the Public Records Office released wartime  
files showing that the government generally accepted that view. But 
the documents released Friday showed that some officials had second 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1946 memo detailed a discussion with Sir Theobald Matthew,  
Britain's director of public prosecutions. Matthew felt Wodehouse 
``would have been a bad case to be the first prosecution of its 
kind,'' but he agreed with a judge's view that a jury should decide 
whether Wodehouse was guilty of treachery, according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Wodehouse ever comes to this country, he should be  
prosecuted,'' Matthew said, according to an intelligence memo. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a moot point, however, because Wodehouse lived in the  
United States from 1944 on. The British government awarded him a 
knighthood in 1975, six weeks before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials suspected but could not prove that Wodehouse  
was paid for his broadcasts, the newly released papers show. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1947 documents also show that the Wodehouses were entitled  
to German embassy rations of soap and cigarettes. A letter from the 
German Embassy to the military authorities requested that the 
couple's French villa be kept in good condition ``in view of the 
propaganda value of his work,'' the documents say. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Murphy, chairman of the P.G. Wodehouse Society, argued  
that the payments from the German Embassy were either royalties or 
maintenance ``because the Germans didn't want their world-famous 
prisoner to die in their hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is as likely that Wodehouse performed treacherous acts as  
it is for the sun not to rise tomorrow,'' Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Forces Sports Postponements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	For the third straight day, sports on the East Coast took a  
beating from Hurricane Floyd. A baseball game, two NHL exhibitions 
and a golf tournament were among the casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was brief and it was wet,'' Tom Lehman said after Floyd  
postponed the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sauers, who hasn't won on a PGA Tour event in a decade, was  
alone atop the leader board at 3 under par through five holes when 
the storm intensified and the wind picked up at the En-Joie Golf 
Course. Organizers halted play at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must have rained some overnight because the course was  
pretty wet,'' said Lehman, who is using the B.C. Open as a final 
tuneup for his third Ryder Cup appearance. ``By our third or fourth 
hole, the bunkers were full of water and the greens were starting 
to fill up. There was just not much you could do about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weather permitting, play was scheduled to resume this morning  
with the tournament still set for 72 holes. The forecast called r 
showers and breezy conditions in the morning, and sunshine breaking 
through in the afternoon. Sunny skies were expected over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight day, Floyd forced the postponement of a  
baseball game in Baltimore between the Orioles and Oakland 
Athletics. The games probably will be made up as part of a 
doubleheader Sept. 23, an off day for both clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain and flooded roads also caused postponement of NHL  
exhibitions matching the Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers in 
New York and the Washington Capitals against the Philadelphia 
Flyers in Philadelphia. The Capitals and Flyers will play Sept. 27. 
No new date was set for the game at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the week, the Carolina Hurricanes lost two preseason  
NHL games to Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Race tracks in the New York area were victimized by the weather,  
too, as was a race car event. 
</P>
<P>
	Belmont Park in New York was closed after the track became too  
wet and muddy for the horses and jockeys. Two New Jersey tracks, 
Monmouth Park and The Meadowlands, were closed, The Meadowlands for 
live racing and simulcast betting, and Monmouth for simulcast 
betting. 
</P>
<P>
	In Loudon, N.H., Thursday's time trials for Saturday's New  
Hampshire 100 at New Hampshire International Speedway were rained 
out. If it rains today, the 44-car starting lineup would be set 
based on the current 1999 championship point standings and 
postmarked entries for the event.

<HEADLINE> Penn St. Player Targets Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- LaVar Arrington very nearly chose to  
play for the University of Miami instead of Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	It makes sense, since the hulking linebacker's conduct of late  
recalls the Hurricanes of old rather than stodgy State College. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Arrington drew two personal fouls on the same play for  
his takedown on Pitt punter Greg DeBolt during No. 3 Penn State's 
20-17 win last week. Days later, he drew the Hurricanes' ire for 
Saturday's showdown by claiming ignorance about a fellow Butkus 
Award candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he feels he's a big man, talking big,'' Miami  
defensive tackle Damione Lewis said Thursday. ``But he's got to 
come out Saturday and let it show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the eighth-ranked Hurricanes expecting their first home  
sellout in years at the Orange Bowl, there's little question fans' 
biggest target will be wearing No. 11 in blue and white. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to understand that he is in the limelight,'' Penn State  
coach Joe Paterno said. ``He has to be able to have a little 
tighter control over himself than somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That isn't always the case with Arrington, who produces big  
plays and equally big headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington's body slam of DeBolt has been replayed countless  
times since Saturday. Certainly all the Hurricanes have seen it, 
many expressing surprise that he would pick on a hapless punter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not a punter, but that's the last thing I'd put up with,''  
said Miami quarterback Kenny Kelly, who figures to be in 
Arrington's sights. ``That's taking it a little bit overboard. If 
it happened to me, I couldn't tell you what I'd do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Crosland does both Miami's punting and placekicking.  
Teammates have been alternately spoiling for a fight and reassuring 
him they'll back him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're telling him to go after him, hit LaVar before he hits  
you,'' safety Jeff Popovich quipped. ``We'll look after him on 
special teams and make sure he's not in a wheelchair after the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arrington further fanned the flames Wednesday during a  
discussion comparing the teams' linebacker corps, perhaps the two 
finest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 65 players on the Butkus committee's preseason list of  
candidates to watch, five will be on the field Saturday. Penn 
State's trio of Arrington, Brandon Short and Mac Morrison all made 
the list, as did Miami's Dan Morgan and Nate Webster. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to respond to Morgan's assessment that Miami had the  
better group, Arrington said, ``Who's Dan Morgan?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long pause. ``No, I'm serious,'' Arrington said.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Arrington truly was oblivious. Still, the quote quickly  
found its way to Miami's bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Morgan spent much of Thursday trying to downplay  
the hubbub. Asked if he might take a moment Saturday to introduce 
himself to Arrington, the junior chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff is funny to me,'' said Morgan, who has led  
Miami in tackles in each of his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	But for a brief minute after the TV cameras turned off, Morgan  
took on a more serious tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can talk all the trash you want,'' Morgan added. ``I'm  
going to show who Dan Morgan is on Saturday. If they don't know who 
Dan Morgan is, they'll find out Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's an odd sight, watching the Hurricanes -- college football's  
former bad boys -- defend themselves against trash talk from Happy 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, Arrington could have been playing alongside Morgan  
if not for a last-minute change of heart. He was set to commit to 
Miami until the fatal shooting of linebacker Marlin Barnes and 
departure of coach Dennis Erickson for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penn State ended up being the better pick for me,'' he now  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes would like to say otherwise Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Senior Golfers Visit With Nelson  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- As they approached the first tee for Friday's  
first round of the Senior PGA Tour's Bank One Championship, the 
look of focus and determination players brought from the driving 
range quickly was replaced by one of joy and admiration. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in a chair near the first tee of Bent Tree Country Club  
was Byron Nelson and every player in the field of 78 stopped by to 
say at least a word or two to one of the sport's best and many 
seemed to forget they were about to play a competitive round of 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading money-winner Hale Irwin kneeled next to Nelson's chair  
and talked with him for about 10 minutes. Dallas native Lee Trevino 
hung around to talk to Nelson even after hitting his tee shot. 
Several players were close to holding up the group behind them just 
to get in a few extra words. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson stayed until the last group was gone, then talked about a  
wide range of topics from the success of the senior tour to the 
Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the state of the senior tour, the 87-year-old  
said he was surprised at how successful it has become and how much 
of an impact it has had on golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it adds a lot to the big tour because players keep  
playing as they look forward to the senior tour,'' said Nelson, who 
has a ranch in nearby Roanoke. ``That's one of the reasons why the 
senior tour is so good -- because the players haven't stopped 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it stays good because there are always players to fill the  
void as the seniors get older and their games slightly diminish. 
Look at it now. You have Tom Watson just coming out and later in 
the year Lanny Wadkins and Tom Kite will be out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson also attributes some of the senior tour's success to the  
everyday player. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 85-shooter can't relate to the 65s, 64s and 63s the guys  
on the big tour are shooting,'' Nelson said. ``But they can relate 
to the seniors because they don't hit it as far and the competition 
is keen, but not as keen as the big tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the senior tour's success, Nelson said he probably  
would not have played if it had been around when he turned 50. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't truthfully say no, but I really don't think I would  
have had much of an interest in playing the senior tour,'' he said. 
``When I played, I played as hard as I could. In my mind, I 
accomplished what I wanted to accomplish career-wise and I wanted 
to get on to other things. Golf has always been a big part of my 
life, but I never had any desire or inclination to play the senior 
tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson, who said he will be in Massachusetts next week for the  
Ryder Cup, would not comment on the play-for-money issue 
surrounding this year's matches, but did talk in general about the 
biannual matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've stayed away from that issue because I come from a  
different time than today's players,'' Nelson said. ``I was 
fortunate enough to participate in a couple of Ryder Cups, but I 
can't comprehend the kind of money these boys make now. I think the 
whole issue has been blown out a little more than the what the 
players really feel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson also had a theory on why the matches with Europe's best  
have become so close in recent years after the United States 
dominated for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf is so much worldwide now,'' Nelson said. ``Their players  
used to not play anywhere but England and Scotland and weren't 
accustomed to playing the way we played here. Now their players 
play all over the world and are exposed to as many varied 
conditions as the players here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson also had a prediction for this year's matches.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have a good team this year and will win,'' he said.  
``Ben Crenshaw has worked as hard as anyone who has been a captain 
and I think he will do a good job.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar rose against the yen Friday amid concern  
that Japan's central bank might intervene to stem the greenback's 
slide. Japanese stocks closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 106.40 yen, up 1.41 yen from its level of  
104.99 yen late Thursday in Tokyo and also higher than its late New 
York level of 105.19 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 50.68 points,  
or 0.29 percent, to 17,342.27 at the end of daily trading. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 485.63 points, or 2.73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After hovering lower early in Asian trading, the dollar edged up  
as some investors sold yen on worries that the Bank of Japan would 
buy dollars to keep the U.S. currency from losing further ground, 
dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's morning recovery came after Finance Minister Kiichi  
Miyazawa and Bank of Japan Governor Masaru Hayami talked Thursday 
about halting the dollar's lopsided fall against the yen in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai economic daily said Friday that the two  
Japanese officials agreed to ask U.S. and European monetary 
authorities to jointly intervene to curb the yen's strength, having 
concluded that single-handed intervention is having virtually no 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has reportedly sold about $35 billion of yen  
since June 10, fearful that the currency's strength might make 
exports from Japan too expensive abroad and smother the country's 
nascent recovery from a prolonged recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the sales, Japan's currency has gained 13 percent  
against the dollar since the beginning of June. Investors are eager 
to get aboard early for any economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the dollar fell to a 44-month low of 103.20 yen in

<HEADLINE> Female Circumcision Common in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. Nawal Nour's clinic rings with different  
languages, as women from Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan flock to see the 
Boston gynecologist and obstetrician. 
</P>
<P>
	Many are hunting a doctor who won't flinch or interrogate them --  
because they have undergone a procedure very few American doctors 
have ever seen: female circumcision. Or, as critics call it, female 
genital mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
	Female circumcision is a cultural practice in parts of Africa  
and the Middle East that involves cutting a woman's genitals, 
usually before puberty. It can range from clipping or burning the 
clitoris, to cutting off all the external genitals and sewing the 
remnant tissue to leave just a tiny opening. 
</P>
<P>
	It's quite a shock the first time a U.S. doctor sees one of  
these cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Women complain of leaving doctors who upset or embarrassed them  
with: ``Oh, you've been scarred!'' or ``How did this happen, who 
did this?'' 
</P>
<P>
	First reactions aside, many doctors also don't know what care  
women may need for complications like severe pain, infections or 
difficult childbirth, says Nour, who runs an African women's health 
clinic at Brigham and Women's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 130 million women and girls worldwide are estimated to have  
undergone the ritual cutting, and the last time U.S. officials 
counted -- in 1990 -- they estimated 168,000 had moved to this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers ``are a gross underestimation,'' contends Nour,  
saying a rapid rise in immigration means more American doctors need 
to know how to care for those women. 
</P>
<P>
	The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, faced with  
increasing calls for treatment advice, agrees. So this month, it is 
issuing the first recommendations on counseling and treatment for 
circumcised women. 
</P>
<P>
	Co-authored by Nour -- and accompanied by pictures to show what  
different forms of female circumcision look like before doctors see 
their first patient -- the recommendations are being sent to all 
medical schools and ob-gyn residency programs in the United States 
and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Nour spent much of her childhood in Sudan and Egypt, and has  
numerous relatives who underwent female circumcision. She became a 
gynecologist partly because ``I wanted to go back to Sudan, to 
provide good care for women in developing nations, and I really 
have been very adamantly against this practice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Boston, she gave medical lectures on female circumcision, and  
``the next thing I knew ... my clinic started filling up with 
African patients.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Step 1 for U.S. doctors, Nour says, is understanding female  
circumcision so the patient doesn't feel judged. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard if you've never seen this before not to  
react. ... It's a terrible act that's been performed,'' says Nour. 
``Of course it's shocking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I'm asking is (that) physicians sort out their own  
feelings first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many proponents say female circumcision promotes chastity,  
because sex can become painful. International organizations working 
to stop the ritual cutting say it's violence against women -- girls 
can die from bleeding or infection, and survivors can have years of 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of controversy abroad, the women who move here need  
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Some seek merely routine gynecologic care without condemnation  
of a ritual they accept. If they don't consider themselves 
mutilated, Nour warns, the actual terms doctors use become 
important in establishing trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Other women suffer pain during sex or menstruation, infertility,  
cysts, abscesses or recurrent infections, all long-term 
complications the ACOG recommendations address. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider a pregnant woman who has been infibulated -- the most  
severe circumcision, which leaves only a tiny vaginal opening. 
Corrective surgery widens that opening so she doesn't suffer a 
terrible tear during labor. It is not hard, says Nour, who wrote 
step-by-step instructions, but the scar intimidates some doctors 
into thinking such women's only option is a Cesarean section. 
</P>
<P>
	Some women want surgery to improve quality of life, Nour says,  
citing a newly married couple who sought her help because sex is so 
difficult -- while others will be insulted if such surgery is 
offered unasked.

<HEADLINE> Man Admits Sending Bomb to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Friday to charges that he  
sent pipe bombs to President Clinton and a Texas evangelist, then 
asked a judge to sentence him to life in prison because he didn't 
want to be homeless in his 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Darwin Alexander pleaded guilty in three cases to charges  
of attempted murder, mailing injurious articles and use of a 
firearm in a crime of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	One pipe bomb, addressed to ``W.J.C., 1600 Pennsylvania  
Avenue,'' exploded in a postal truck in Washington, D.C. A bomb 
addressed to Texas evangelist John Hagee exploded in the Dallas 
Bulk Mail Facility. No one was injured in either explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	A third pipe bomb was found in mail at a Las Vegas bus station  
addressed to an agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas O'Connell said the devices, all  
mailed in March, were powerful enough to have killed anyone nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was arrested March 28 in Las Vegas after he called the  
Southern Nevada Mental Health Institute and said he had mailed a 
bomb to the president. Police found 10 pounds of gun powder, eight 
pipes and electrical charging devices in his motel room. 
</P>
<P>
	After pleading guilty Friday, Alexander asked U.S. District  
Judge Lloyd George for a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 53,'' he said. ``I can't see serving 40 years, coming out  
and living on the streets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George, who didn't comment on the request, scheduled sentencing  
for Jan. 3.

<HEADLINE>  Anaheim Pitcher Going High Profile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Anaheim Angels reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa  
signed with Japan's largest entertainment agency to increase his 
offseason profile in his native country. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasegawa is the first athlete signed by Yoshimoto Kogyo Co., for  
its newly established sports division. He agreed to a one-year deal 
in which the agency will develop television and radio appearances, 
commercials, speeches and baseball clinics for him in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm always interested in being more than a ballplayer,''  
Hasegawa said through a translator. ``I always wanted to be a good 
role model for other athletes who may want to follow across the 
Pacific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasegawa, 31, is the second Japanese-born player to earn a spot  
on a U.S. major league roster after playing professionally in 
Japan's Central or Pacific leagues. Pitcher Hideo Nomo became the 
first when he made a splash with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasegawa is 2-5 with a 4.70 ERA and two saves out of the Angels  
bullpen this season, his third in the big leagues. Last year, he 
set career bests in wins, ERA and saves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels have struggled much of the season. Going into Friday  
night's game against Baltimore, the team was last in the AL West, 
27 games behind first-place Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasegawa will wait until after the season to raise his profile  
in Japan, where Nomo is generally regarded as the nation's biggest 
baseball star. Nomo, who was the NL rookie of the year in 1995 and 
made the All-Star team, now starts for the Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Next season, Hasegawa said he would like to do promotional work  
on off-days and game days as long as it doesn't interfere with his 
pitching. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen Ken Griffey Jr. shoot a three-hour strenuous  
commercial and then hit two home runs, so I see no problem with 
that,'' he said. ``If I can do it and get a good performance on the 
field as well, it would be a good asset for other players to 
follow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many clients of the Yoshimoto Kogyo agency are Japanese  
comedians, although the agency has no plans to market Hasegawa as a 
comedian. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very concerned about building his image,'' said  
Masaharu Aizawa, executive producer of the agency's sports 
division. ``Hasegawa's reputation is intellectual, smart 
businessman, so for him to sign with Yoshimoto, we will certainly 
gain in reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasegawa has worked to improve his English-speaking skills to  
better communicate with teammates. What he's learned as a member of 
the Angels could make him an attractive guest on Japanese talk 
shows, Aizawa said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot about what's going on and I have a lot of  
interesting stories to tell and I could make a show in Japan 
unprecedented in terms of this type of information,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Encryption Exports Allowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Largely reversing course, the Clinton  
administration will allow America's high-tech industry to sell even 
the most powerful data-scrambling technology overseas with almost 
no restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House said it will ask for $80 million for the FBI  
over four years to train experts in unscrambling digital messages 
that might be sent by criminals and terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision announced Thursday was an enormous concession to  
America's high-tech industry over law enforcement and national 
security objections. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the new policy was announced, Attorney General Janet  
Reno said at the White House, ``In stopping a terrorist attack or 
seeking to recover a kidnapped child, encountering encryption might 
mean the difference between success and catastrophic failure.'' She 
said the policy ``will mean that more terrorists and criminals will 
use encryption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision should help U.S. companies in overseas competition  
-- and help consumers worldwide guarantee the privacy of their 
e-mail and online credit-card purchases. Although Reno described 
dire consequences of criminals using encryption, she also readily 
acknowledged the technology ``is critically important for 
protecting our privacy and our security, and the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House's announcement comes as Vice President Al Gore,  
a self-described technology buff, courts the favor of the booming 
high-tech industry during his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``This decision by the vice president, who was really leading  
this effort, now is consistent with the views of virtually everyone 
in the technology community,'' said Robert Holleyman, executive 
director of the Business Software Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of restrictions on export sales said criminals and  
terrorists already could buy or download powerful encryption 
technology made in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who are going to misuse encryption for criminal  
purchases aren't going to limit themselves to U.S.-made encryption 
products,'' said Ed Gillespie, executive director of Americans for 
Computer Privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will allow high-tech companies to sell even  
the most powerful encryption technology overseas to private and 
commercial customers after a one-time technical review of their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said ``I'm obviously not going to tell'' whether the FBI  
already can decode messages scrambled using the newly permitted 
encryption strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to have a very significant research and  
development program in the months ahead of us,'' Deputy Defense 
Secretary John Hamre said. ``This is a complex environment, it's 
going to change every day and it's going to take us a fair amount 
of effort to stay ahead of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House will still require companies to seek permission  
to sell the scrambling technology to a foreign government or 
military -- a condition Hamre said the Defense Department insisted 
upon -- and it maintains bans on selling to seven nations accused of 
terrorism: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the administration allowed companies to sell the  
most powerful scrambling technology only to specific industries 
overseas; other foreign customers were generally limited to 
so-called 56-bit encryption products, meaning those with 
72-quadrillion unlocking combinations. 
</P>
<P>
	The export limits never directly affected Americans, who are  
legally free to use encryption technology of any strength. But U.S. 
companies have been reluctant to develop one version of their 
technology for domestic use and a weaker overseas version, so they 
typically sell only the most powerful type that's legal for export, 
even to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics cited more than 800 products available worldwide with  
stronger scrambling technology than the United States allowed its 
companies to sell overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pull it down over the Internet in less than 20  
minutes,'' said Gillespie. ``Having Japanese and German and Irish 
companies be at the forefront of this technology is not in our best 
interests.''

<HEADLINE> Zedillo Implicated in Suicide Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Mexico's one-time top drug prosecutor,  
believed to have committed suicide by overdosing on 
antidepressants, did not go quietly. 
</P>
<P>
	In a suicide note, Mario Ruiz Massieu implicated Mexican  
President Ernesto Zedillo and members of the country's ruling party 
in the slaying of his brother, a party official. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the PRI assassinated my brother Jose Francisco, and  
President Zedillo is well aware of this, since he had a lot to do 
with it,'' said the one-page note, referring to the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and I knew that he was not detached from both political  
crimes of 1994,'' Ruiz Massieu wrote, an apparent reference to the 
killings of his brother and presidential candidate Luis Donaldo 
Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
	The note was released Thursday by Ruiz Massieu's lawyer.  
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo's office denied the allegations. Zedillo, who had been  
Colosio's campaign manager, became the PRI's presidential candidate 
after the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cuellar also dismissed  
Ruiz Massieu's claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is the expression of a psychopath on the point of  
taking his life,'' Madrazo said Thursday. ``Mario Ruiz Massieu 
lived lying and he died lying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruiz Massieu, 48, was found dead Wednesday two days before he  
was to be arraigned in Houston on U.S. charges of laundering $9.9 
million in suspected drug payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been under house arrest in New Jersey for much of the  
past 4 1/2 years, battling efforts by the U.S. and Mexican government 
to return him to his homeland, where he was accused of covering up 
the 1994 murder of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
	He died of an apparent overdose of antidepressants at the home  
in Palisades Park where he lived with his wife, Maria Eugenia, and 
10-year-old daughter, Regina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am absolutely innocent of all charges against me,'' the note  
said. He urged Zedillo to ``leave my family in peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer in Mexico said the money-laundering charges may have  
been too much for him to bear. Javier Olea Pelaez told the Formato 
21 radio station Ruiz Massieu feared winding up in prison without 
enough money to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not determined the official cause of death.  
Results of toxicology tests will not be completed for six to eight 
weeks, said Ronald Calissi, Bergen County's public safety director. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found no evidence of violence or forced entry at the  
home.

<HEADLINE> LAPD Investigated Over Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES -- A policeman's conviction for stealing cocaine from  
an evidence locker has exploded into a wide investigation of a 
frame-up, drug dealing and other crimes allegedly covered up by a 
code of silence in the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten officers and a police supervisor have been suspended in two  
internal investigations into corruption within the department. 
</P>
<P>
	And federal authorities announced Thursday they would conduct  
their own investigation into what is believed to be one of the 
biggest corruption scandals in LAPD history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not like to label the LAPD as corruption-prone,''  
Chief Bernard Parks said Wednesday. ``I think we have a small 
number of officers that have chose to in some instances tarnish 
their badge'' 
</P>
<P>
	The police department declined to detail the allegations against  
the suspended officers, but unidentified sources quoted by the Los 
Angeles Times said they are suspected of a variety of crimes, from 
active participation in drug deals to code-of-silence violations 
that allowed delinquent behavior to go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, former Officer Rafael A. Perez pleaded guilty to  
stealing eight pounds of cocaine from an evidence locker. As part 
of the plea bargain, he is spilling details and naming names in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez reportedly told investigators that he and former partner  
Nino Durden planted a .22-caliber rifle on the an unarmed illegal 
immigrant after shooting him in October 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old immigrant, Javier Francisco Ovando, was released  
from prison on Thursday, three years after he was shot by police 
officers who authorities believe fabricated evidence used to 
convict him. It was unclear whether he would face a federal 
deportation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of shakes everything that you believe about in  
everything,'' Ovando's public defender Tamar Toister said. ``The 
system is not supposed to work like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another former partner of Perez's, Officer David Mack, was  
convicted earlier this year of robbing a Bank of America of 
$722,000 in November 1997 and sentenced Monday to more than 14 
years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Mack went on a spending spree after the bank  
robbery, including a Las Vegas trip with Perez and another officer. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the investigations have targeted the department's Rampart  
Station, which covers an eight-square-mile area just west of 
downtown Los Angeles that is home to many recent immigrants from 
Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the community hung a banner Thursday in support of  
officers: ``The community love the men and women of Rampart 
Station.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas Domingo, a 70-year-old Filipino-American, said he was  
surprised by the reports of corruption. ``It still doesn't change 
my faith in policemen. Some are good and some are rotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem throughout law enforcement is a culture that is  
closed and self-protective,'' said Terry L. Cooper, a professor and 
expert on ethics and law enforcement at the University of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard Parks is trying to  
change that but says the chief is bucking tradition that has been 
``sustained and compounded'' for years.

<HEADLINE> Bank Shares Rise in Europe Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bank shares were big gainers in European stock  
markets Friday as fears eased of an early rise in interest rates by 
the European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve and as three 
banks were added to a stock index. 
</P>
<P>
	The ECB issued its monthly report for September, saying that  
although inflation is likely to rise, it will level off below the 
acceptable level of 2 percent, which suggests an interest rate hike 
may not be required soon to prevent the economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	European stocks also got a lift from a sharp rise in the Dow  
Jones industrial average on Friday morning, while European 
exchanges still were open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 592 European companies rose 0.94  
point, or 0.3 percent, to close at 310.29. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 
Index, which tracks 297 companies in countries that joined the 
single currency known as the euro, closed up 0.32 point at 326.28. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index fell 26.49 points to 3,748.75,  
while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index closed down 8.68 points at 3,659.62.

<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Marooned at their home by floodwaters on a  
scale never seen here, Shaveda Shaw and her sister cradled their 
teen-age brother, who suffers from cerebral palsy, today and eased 
him into the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just came up last night,'' Shaveda said as utility workers  
pulled them across a flooded ditch that had prevented them from 
leaving their home. ``I've been here 20 years, and I've never seen 
it like this. It's rising real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, crews helped Curtis and Doris Whitehead and Curtis'  
mother, Bessie Whitehead, into another boat. Bessie Whitehead came 
aboard with trepeditation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so scared. I've never been in a boat before. I just want  
to get out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-year-old Trent Whitehead was worried about his teddy bear,  
but found it among the family's bags, brought over the ditch in 
another boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tar River, this eastern North Carolina town's namesake,  
flooded homes a mile from the riverbanks, reaching record flood 
levels Thursday after Hurricane Floyd brought more than a foot of 
rain to the region. It was expected to rise even higher today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 people were stranded today between here and Rocky  
Mount, said state officials, who mounted an evacuation effort by 
air and boat. Hundreds more were stranded in other eastern North 
Carolina counties, some on rooftops or in trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is get people off of rooftops today,''  
said Mark Van Sciver, a state emergency management official. ``Our 
biggest problem is that we can't vehicles into these areas. ... 
This is really bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're looking at is flooding of historic proportions,''  
added state meteorologist Ron Wall. ``There are levels of flooding 
that no one has ever seen in our state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	East of Tarboro on U.S. 64, Dina Gallinato of Conetoe couldn't  
get to her job at a pharmacy. ``I need to be there because people 
need their medicine,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Short of Williamston was stuck at the spot. He was headed  
for a Rocky Mount flea market where he planned to sell gospel 
cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out here for a while and saw cars going through and I  
tried it, but my car stalled out,'' he said. Short managed to get 
it started again and got out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the road at Williamston this morning, four gas stations  
were out of fuel and the motels were full. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like we're an island,'' said Holiday Inn clerk Betsy  
Hardison. ``We're cut off in all directions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a radio announcer in Ahoskie put it, ``If you're on the  
roadways today, you're going to have to be very creative. And in 
some places, it doesn't matter how creative you are, unless you 
have a boat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management  
Agency, said the damage in the state appeared worse than Hurricane 
Fran, which inflicted $6 billion worth of damage on the state in 
1996, the state's worst natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I's just incredible,'' he told reporters in Raleigh. ``The  
impact here in North Carolina, particularly with the flooding, they 
seem to have taken the full brunt of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near Kinston, Betty Cox and her neighbors were paddling around  
in bass boats Thursday, searching for mobile homes swamped by 
floodwaters from surging Southwest Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``My dad is crying right now at my brother's home,'' Ms. Cox  
said after returning from a trip to her parents' mobile home to 
retrieve her father's heart medicine. ``He's all to pieces. 
Everything that he's worked his whole life for is now under 
water.''

<HEADLINE> Financial Tips for New Year's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Suggestions by the nation's financial leaders and regulators for  
consumers to prepare for the Year 2000 technology problem: 
</P>
<P>
	--It's unnecessary except in extreme cases to withdraw more cash  
for the New Year's weekend than would be needed for most other 
weekends, and a mad rush will cause more trouble than the Y2K 
glitch itself. ``The safest thing for consumers to do with their 
money around year end is to leave it where it is,'' Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Keep up-to-date copies of financial records, in case of  
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't panic if the local ATM doesn't work that weekend and  
don't automatically assume the failure is Y2K-related: ``On any 
given day, 1 to 2 percent of the nation's ATMs are out of service 
for some reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Don't believe every rumor you hear about possible failures,  
especially as media scrutiny increases toward December. ``Facts are 
the only antidote for rumors,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be wary of possible scams about allegedly safe places to hide  
money during the date rollover, said Donna Tanoue, chairwoman of 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

	Indonesian Army Leaving East Timor  
</P>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- With peacekeepers poised to pour into  
East Timor just as thousands of Indonesian soldiers load up to 
leave, concern mounted today that there could be violent tension 
between the forces. As the international peacekeeping troops 
assembled in neighboring Australia, Indonesian soldiers put weapons 
and gear onto transport planes and ships and began clearing out of 
riot-scarred East Timor. Australian Prime Minister John Howard 
warned that any Indonesian army attacks against the peacekeepers 
could provoke a ``massive reaction'' from other countries -- 
including the United States.

	U.S. Sanctions Against North Korea Eased  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Clinton lifted a  
half-century of restrictions on trade, travel and banking against 
North Korea today, rewarding the impoverished communist nation for 
agreeing not to test missiles that could strike as far as Alaska or 
Hawaii. But Republicans, including Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New 
York, chairman of the House International Relations Committee, 
sharply criticized Clinton's move. ``Ultimately, we have no 
assurances that North Korea has halted missile development or its 
program for weapons of mass destruction,'' Gilman said.

	Thousands Rescued After Floyd  
</P>
<P>
	PRINCEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Emergency workers in boats and Marines  
in helicopters swarmed into flood-stricken North Carolina today, 
rescuing more than 1,000 people from roofs and trees after the 
torrential rains of Hurricane Floyd. In Bound Brook, N.J., serious 
flooding from the Raritan River forced police to rescue at least 
800 people, many of them from second-floor windows or off porch 
roofs. After rampaging up the entire East Coast, Floyd left at 
least 28 people dead, thousands of homes and businesses damaged and 
more than a million people without electricity or water.

<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Police said today they are examining  
two videotapes made during Wednesday's shooting at the Wedgwood 
Baptist Church, where seven people were killed and seven others 
were injured. Dozens of gunshots are heard on the tapes and people 
are shown diving under pews to avoid gunfire from Larry Gene 
Ashbrook. One tape stops when the gunman aims toward the camera.

Russia for its investigations of a growing money scandal and

	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft, Dell Computer and nearly 100  
other companies are banding together to challenge eBay Inc.'s 
dominance of the Internet auction industry by pooling their 
listings and bids. Web sites run by the members of the new 
alliance, which also includes the Internet gateway services Lycos 
and Excite at Home, will share millions of auction listings so that 
any item put up for bid on one site will appear on them all. eBay's 
stock tumbled 7 percent following today's announcement, falling 
$10.75 a share to $141 in active trading on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market.

	VATICAN CITY (AP) -- After two years of polishing and patching,  
the last scaffolding falls Saturday from the facade of St. Peter's 
Basilica -- revealing newly rediscovered tints that were hidden 
beneath centuries of gray grime. Pope John Paul II will inaugurate 
the freshly scrubbed facade on Sept. 30 -- presenting the face that 
St. Peter's will show the world during the Roman Catholic Church's 
Holy Year celebrations for the new millennium.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rules changes designed to reduce physical play  
and improve the flow of the game were approved today by the NBA's 
Board of Governors. The changes include tighter interpretation of 
foul rules, limitations on forearm checking and resetting the shot 
clock to 14 seconds instead of 24 on certain stoppages of play. The 
hope is the changes will also increase scoring, which dropped to 91 
points a game last season, lowest since the shot clock was 
introduced in 1954-55.

<HEADLINE> Churches Increase Security Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Churches and congregations are more conscious of security than  
they once were, but few could have anticipated a shooting rampage 
like that at Wedgwood Baptist Church in Fort Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``No church I know of would have been prepared to respond,''  
said James Cobble of Matthews, N.C., publisher of Church Law and 
Tax Report, a magazine that covers legal and financial issues 
related to churches. 
</P>
<P>
	A gunman shouting anti-Baptist rhetoric fatally shot three  
adults and four teen-agers at Wedgwood Baptist Church during a 
Wednesday night service. The man, 47-year-old Larry G. Ashbrook, 
wounded seven others before killing himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, churches have been places where people could  
enter quietly to pray and find peace,'' said the Rev. Joan Brown 
Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches in 
New York. ``Tragically, we now see churches locking their doors. 
Churches aren't willing to take that risk any more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Cobble's magazine posted a question on its Web site  
about church security. The majority of 50 respondents cited some 
sort of plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Security measures range from simple monitoring by plainclothes  
guards or uniformed attendants in parking lots to sophisticated 
video surveillance. Cobble said burglaries commonly trouble urban 
and suburban congregations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Large churches will almost universally be  
security-conscious,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Daingerfield, Texas, security has been an issue since June  
22, 1980, when a gunman interrupted Sunday services and opened fire 
in the First Baptist Church, killing five and injuring 11 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastor John Stone said Wednesday's shootings, while  
incomprehensible, should not deter the church from its spiritual 
mission, adding that churches should not rush to turn their 
buildings into fortresses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Panic shows that we don't have faith and trust in the Lord,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorene Swift, associate pastor at Broadway Baptist Church in  
downtown Fort Worth, said her church already has a roving security 
guard and cameras at all entrances. 
</P>
<P>
	She said that while staff will consider other measures, it is  
unlikely the church will install metal detectors or start locking 
its doors. 
</P>
<P>
	``That goes so much against what we feel about church,'' she  
said. ``It should be a place anyone can come at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But places of worship also have become a target for those  
motivated by hate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a white supremacist allegedly wounded five people at  
a Jewish community center in Los Angeles, then fatally shot a 
Filipino-American postal worker. The shootings prompted several 
Dallas-Fort Worth synagogues last week to hire off-duty police 
officers and guards to patrol parking lots for the start of the 
Jewish holy days. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, a man opened fire in the Mormon Family History Library  
in Salt Lake City, killing two people and wounding four others 
before police shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's shootings happened during a service for teen-agers,  
after the annual ``See You at the Pole'' gathering at local 
schools, where students affirm their faith by holding prayer time 
around school flagpoles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Joe Williams of Oklahoma said many congregations  
realize church ground may no longer be sacred. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought that people respected God but we know they do  
not,'' he said. ``I don't think any place is safe unless you have 
an armed guard at every door.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper Trying Out With Raptors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Master P's no-limits attitude has him dreaming of  
the NBA again. 
</P>
<P>
	The millionaire rapper, born as Percy Miller in one of New  
Orleans poorest areas, was invited to training camp by the Toronto 
Raptors on Thursday. He was waived by the Charlotte Hornets during 
camp last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very earnest about his dream of making it in the NBA,''  
Raptors general manager Glen Grunwald said. ``We know he was in the 
Hornets camp last year. He's been working hard since then. He knows 
it's a long shot but he's willing to give it a go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Miller has parlayed his rap records into a  
flourishing business with his own label, No Limit Records, and a 
financial interest in a sports agent business, No Limit Sports. His 
company represents NFL rookie Ricky Williams, and NBA players Ron 
Mercer and Derek Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	An all-state high school player in Louisiana, Miller's  
collegiate career at Houston was brief. 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing with the Hornets, he was with the CBA's Fort  
Wayne Fury. Miller is an acquaintance of Toronto coach Butch 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes Magazine lists Miller among the top 10 entertainers in  
terms of annual salary, at $56 million.

<HEADLINE> Floyd Spins Into New England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDWICH, Mass. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Floyd spun into New  
England today, pelting the region with heavy rain as it delivered a 
final blow from its whirlwind race up the East Coast. In its wake, 
floodwaters caused havoc in a New Jersey town and travelers 
continued to face problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm packing winds of 60 mph was falling apart after  
flooding states from South Carolina to New Jersey. At 7 a.m. EDT, 
the remnants were centered just south of Portland, Maine, and 
moving northeast at 30 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Left behind are millions of dollars in damage and at least 17  
deaths, including 12 from traffic accidents in the Carolinas, 
Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts. Two girls in Delaware 
drowned after they were swept into a sewage pipe, a woman in 
Virginia and a man in Pennsylvania were both killed by falling 
trees, and one man was presumed drowned in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people were missing today in Darby, Pa., where a foot of  
rain forced 700 people out of their homes Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where we are going to go. We have no money,''  
said Priscilla Johnson, 38, whose first-floor apartment was flooded 
to her waist. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bound Brook, N.J., today, serious flooding from the Raritan  
River stranded some terrified residents on rooftops and set off a 
raging fire downtown. A Coast Guard helicopter plucked at least a 
half-dozen people from roofs. 
</P>
<P>
	The floodwaters rendered firefighters helpless to extinguish the  
fire in a pair of adjacent businesses, which was out of control 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a very major situation here, and the river has  
not yet crested,'' Whitman said in an interview on NBC's ``Today'' 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 1 1/2 feet of rain fell in some areas, disrupting travel  
along most of the East Coast and canceling a formal, open meeting 
of the United Nations Security Council in New York for the first 
time in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic problems continued today across parts of the Northeast,  
with some commuter rail service still crippled in the New York City 
area. Amtrak service in the region also was disrupted. On Thursday, 
the storm grounded hundreds of flights, closed thousands of 
businesses and gave nearly 3 million students a day off from 
school, including all public schools in New Jersey and New York 
City. The city schools reopened today but there were scattered 
closings elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.1 million people were without power late Thursday  
and early today in eight states, from Maryland to Massachusetts. 
Some 360,000 customers in Maryland were expected to be without 
electricity into the weekend. Hundreds of thousands more remained 
without power in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Southeast picked up the pieces after Floyd blew ashore  
early Thursday with 110 mph winds and torrential rain, residents 
farther north agreed the storm didn't pack much punch. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a joke,'' said Morgan Paul Neff, a bartender at  
O'Murphy's in Montauk, N.Y. ``We get weather like this nine or 10 
times a winter. I didn't even take in my furniture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlantic City, N.J., the storm also threatened to disrupt the  
Miss America Pageant. The city's casinos were already grappling 
with a strike by thousands of workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, that Floyd's a bad boy,'' quipped an elderly woman walking  
on the Boardwalk and heading into a casino. ``It's terrible. I've 
never experienced anything like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere along the Atlantic coast did Floyd strike as hard as it  
did in the Bahamas. Authorities said hundreds of homes were 
flattened and roofless on several islands. Thousands of people 
faced weeks without telephone, electricity or reliable water 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in the South expect losses to rise well above $25  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd arrived on the U.S. mainland early Thursday, rolling  
through North Carolina and into New England 24 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 15,000 suburbanites were stuck in New York City when  
Metro-North Commuter Railroad shut down service from Grand Central 
Terminal on Thursday evening, blaming flooding and downed trees. 
Many businesses had heeded the city's call to close down earlier in 
the day, sending their workers home before the worst of the storm 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess it's my fault,'' said Herbert Browne, 48, who was  
trying to get back to Hastings-on-Hudson. ``Since 3 o'clock my 
wife's been saying get out of the city ... I said, `This is New 
York City. It doesn't close down.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Normally bustling Manhattan streets were nearly deserted  
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've never seen New York this quiet. I actually saw the  
pavement on Fifth Avenue, that's how few cars there were,'' said 
Chuck Dunning of San Diego, waiting out the storm at the New York 
Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm had a major effect before it arrived in New England,  
sending people rushing for batteries, provisions and wood to 
protect fragile windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of every four flights were canceled at Logan International  
Airport in Boston on Thursday, while Amtrak and ferry service to 
Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket were suspended or shut down. Most 
services were expected to resume today or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	That Floyd fizzled didn't surprise Massachusetts fishermen, who  
lashed up their boats and stowed their equipment as a precaution. 
Bob St. Peter, a commercial fisherman from Hyannis, headed for home 
Thursday evening after Floyd was downgraded from a hurricane to a 
tropical storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just hoping to take a charter out on Saturday,'' he said.  
``I'm not worried about it at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the winds howled and rain fell outside, Jean and Alan Bennett  
sat in the South Kingstown (R.I.) High School cafeteria playing a 
card game called ``aggravation.'' They were the only ones at the 
shelter Thursday after coming in from the beach cottage they are 
renting. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Haven, Conn., couple, who celebrate their 52nd  
anniversary on Sunday, managed to keep a sense of humor. They had 
plenty of room and the school cafeteria was ready to cook up as 
many pizzas and hamburgers as they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, this is exciting,'' Mrs. Bennett said. ``At least we'll  
always remember this anniversary.''

<HEADLINE> Floys Causes Little Beach Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hurricane Floyd's quick tear up the East Coast seems to have  
spared many popular beach resorts from severe erosion -- and might 
even have helped in some places by washing sand ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our beaches are there and in place. We never looked so good,''  
said a jubilant Harry de Butts, public works director in Avalon, 
N.J. ``We have no damage at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beaches typically lose sand to hurricanes. Some towns spend  
millions of dollars on replenishment, dredging up sand and 
depositing it on eroded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Avalon, the tide actually threw sand onto the south end  
of the 5-mile long beach instead of washing sand out to sea, de 
Butts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two helicopters traveled along two-thirds of the Florida coast  
Friday and revealed a similar story. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of our beaches did quite well,'' said Jacquelyn Griffin,  
a spokeswoman for the Jacksonville District of the Army Corps of 
Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Not every place escaped unscathed. For example, Virginia Beach,  
Va., had about $2 million in sand damage from Hurricane Dennis two 
weeks ago, and Floyd did another $1.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Phill Roehrs, a city coastal engineer, said the damage won't  
be permanent. ``Most of the sand will come back naturally,'' Roehrs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic City, N.J., had light to medium beach erosion, said Bob  
Levy, emergency services director. The damage may total about 
$70,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina beaches, just southwest of Hurricane Floyd's  
initial landfall near Wilmington, N.C., also fared well in the 
storm, said Mike Robertson of the state's Office of Ocean and 
Coastal Resource Management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're assessing, but it seems we're in pretty good shape,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina beaches, which took the strongest hit from  
Dennis, showed signs of some damage, but nothing major, said Warren 
Judge, a member of the Dare County Beach Nourishment Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean City, Md., also fared pretty well through both Floyd and  
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had severe winds and rains, but it was pretty impressive  
that there was no erosion,'' said Jay Knerr, owner of The Kite 
Loft, a retail store along Ocean City's beachfront. ``I don't think 
we lost as much as a shingle off our roof.''

<HEADLINE> Forest Wildcat Filly Sold in Ky. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- A filly from the first crop of Forest  
Wildcat brought a top price of $310,000 during Friday's session of 
Keeneland's record-breaking September Yearling Sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin L. Cherry bought the dark bay or brown filly from the  
consignment of Tom Evans' Trackside Farm, as agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly is a half sister to C B Account, winner of 15 races  
and $124,630. Forest Wildcat won nine races and $478,862 during his 
racing career, including the 1996 Phoenix Breeders' Cup Stakes at 
Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Colts by Unbridled's Song and Conquistador Cielo each sold for  
$300,000 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram, owner of 1998 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet and  
current 3-year-old standout filly Silverbulletday, bought the colt 
by Unbridled's Song. The horse was sold by Taylor Made Sales 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	James C. Spence purchased the colt by Conquistador Cielo from  
Longfield Farm, as agent. 
</P>
<P>
	During Friday's session, Keeneland sold 290 horses for  
$17,008,500, an average of $58,650. In the corresponding session 
last year, 304 horses brought $12,430,700, an average of $40,890. 
</P>
<P>
	Through five sessions of the 11-day sale, Keeneland has sold  
1,344 horses for a sales-record $188,482,500. The average is 
$140,240. At this point in the sale a year ago, 1,388 horses had 
sold for $139,630,200, an average of $100,598.

<HEADLINE> Jet Blue Gets 75 JFK Airport Slots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jet Blue Airways has received permission  
from the U.S. Department of Transportation to make 75 takeoffs and 
landings daily at New York City's John F. Kennedy International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made our case and got exactly the number of slots we asked  
for,'' David Neeleman, the Utah founder of the New York airline, 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Jet Blue, the highest number of takeoff and landing slots  
given to an airline in a single award was 16, Transportation 
Department spokesman Bill Mosley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet Blue received the slots because it plans to offer cheap  
flights and serve a market where no low-fare competition exists, 
Mosley said. It also was judged to have adequate financial 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The fledgling air carrier has been billed as the airline  
industry's first ``mega startup.'' It raised about $130 million in 
capital from well-known investors, including George Soros and the 
venture capital arm of Chase Manhattan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has not yet announced its final route structure, Jet  
Blue is considering service to 44 cities including Atlanta, Boston, 
Dallas-Fort Worth and Salt Lake City, where the company's 
reservation operations will be based. 
</P>
<P>
	``We start advertising for positions in Utah next week,'' said  
Gareth Edmondson-Jones, spokesman for Jet Blue. 
</P>
<P>
	Neeleman said Jet Blue is to take delivery of its first plane in  
December and its second in January. The company's fleet eventually 
will be made up of up to 82 new, 162-passenger Airbus A-320 
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Count Allowed in Marijuana Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. District Court judge on Friday ruled  
that the District of Columbia has the right to count votes from a 
referendum held last November on whether to legalize marijuana for 
medical uses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ruling by Judge Richard Roberts carried little weight  
because it came a day after the Senate approved a new D.C. budget 
allowing the vote tally. Vote counting for the referendum, held 
last November, had been blocked by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., in last 
year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate this year voted to allow the city to determine the  
results, but also prohibited use of the drug regardless of the 
outcome.

<HEADLINE> Wolfpack Has Seminoles' Number </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Don't panic, just run.  
</P>
<P>
	That's what Florida State coach Bobby Bowden wishes he would  
have done last year at North Carolina State. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his team was picking up yardage on the ground with  
great success a year ago against the Wolfpack, Bowden was impatient 
being behind and ordered his offensive coordinator to keep passing. 
They did. Six passes were intercepted and Florida State lost 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a tendency to panic,'' Bowden admitted this week as the  
top-ranked Seminoles (2-0) got ready for No. 20 North Carolina 
State (3-0). ``We should have run the ball more, but it was me 
insisting we get down the field quickly and score.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No school has dominated Florida State in recent years the way  
North Carolina State has during the teams' last 78 minutes of 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've just whipped us the last six quarters,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	In that span, the Wolfpack has outscored the Seminoles 45-14,  
including 21 of the final 28 points in a 48-35 loss in 1997 and 
then last year's 24-7 upset victory in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``N.C. State is not 3-0 because they are lucky,'' Bowden said.  
``They play hard and hustle for the entire game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the Wolfpack look to become the first Atlantic  
Coast Conference team to win a league game in Tallahassee and only 
the second team to win at Florida State this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Although its defense has been spotty so far this season, Florida  
State's offense has been balanced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles have averaged 156.5 yards on the ground and 276  
yards passing, calling seven more running plays in their first two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it has had great success against Florida State the past  
two seasons, North Carolina State is having a tough time getting 
the offense moving. 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Jamie Barnette has completed 52.7 percent of his  
passes, but for only 320 yards and one touchdown in victories over 
William and Mary, South Carolina and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were forced to hold back some of our game plan against  
South Carolina because of the weather, and we didn't have the ball 
enough against Texas to show anything,'' N.C. State coach Mike 
O'Cain said. ``Against William and Mary we were very basic and got 
done what we wanted to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bowden doesn't think the Wolfpack has been able to hide too  
much. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the time you get down around the third game, I'm not sure  
how much you can hold back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, Florida State has already tipped its hands on  
all kinds of unusual plays -- particularly in last week's 41-35 
victory over Georgia Tech when fullback Dan Kendra and wideout 
Peter Warrick -- both high school quarterbacks -- lined up at their 
old position in key situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 255-pound Kendra picked up two first downs on short-yardage  
situations while Warrick raced 19 yards for a touchdown on another. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles also have run several reverses with the wide  
receivers in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those plays usually don't beat you, but they will hurt you,''  
O'Cain said. ``They will run those just to take some of your 
aggressiveness away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's just what Bowden is counting on.

<HEADLINE> Program Vendor Sues Diamondbacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A Phoenix man is challenging the Arizona  
Diamondbacks off the field, alleging the organization is trying to 
force him out of the baseball program business. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Fader, owner of the ``Beat on Baseball,'' sued the  
Diamondbacks in U.S. District Court in Phoenix. The lawsuit alleges 
the Diamondbacks are violating federal and state antitrust laws by 
cutting the price of their program to get a monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks' official program was sold for $5 at the start  
of last season, then was cut to $3, and now sells for $1, the same 
price as the ``Beat on Baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks president Richard Dozer didn't return calls seeking  
comment on the lawsuit Friday. Dozer has said the program costs 
more than $1 to print, but that the price was cut to increase 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to accusing the ball club of being anti-competitive,  
Fader says the Diamondbacks have engaged in slander by calling his 
publication ``pornographic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The back cover of the ``Beat'' has an advertisement for an adult  
entertainment club but it shows only a woman's head. 
</P>
<P>
	Fader also accuses the Diamondbacks of improperly preventing him  
from selling his programs in the plazas leading to the stadium's 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims the area is a public plaza because the  
ballpark is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District, which 
leases the space to the Diamondbacks.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Adds To Shuttle Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Hurricane Floyd has forced NASA to  
further delay its next two space shuttle flights, which had already 
been postponed by wiring inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The next mission will be no earlier than Nov. 19, following the  
annual Leonid meteor shower, NASA spokesman James Hartsfield said 
today. NASA does not want shuttles in orbit during the meteor storm 
because of the potential damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttle managers had hoped to launch Discovery as early as Oct.  
28 on a Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. Endeavour was to 
follow in November on an Earth-mapping mission. Now they're not 
sure which mission will go first; one of the flights could slip 
into 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has been inspecting and repairing defective electrical  
wires in its space shuttle fleet for the past two months. A damaged 
wire caused a short circuit five seconds into Columbia's launch in 
July, knocking out computers in two main engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia would have had to make an unprecedented emergency  
landing if an engine had failed. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA was forced to interrupt its wiring repair work to prepare  
for Hurricane Floyd, which roared up Florida's east coast on 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Charles Keating Wins Federal Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- State fraud convictions will not be  
reinstated against Charles Keating, after the financier -- released 
this year from prison where he was sent for a federal fraud 
conviction -- won an appeal in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 Thursday that  
flawed jury instructions tainted Keating's convictions in Los 
Angeles Superior Court on charges of defrauding investors in the 
parent company of Lincoln Savings &AMP; Loan, American Continental 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said the trial judge improperly allowed the  
jury to convict Keating without deciding whether he intended to 
swindle the investors, the court said. A dissenting judge said 
Keating's fraudulent intent was established by ``absolutely 
overwhelming evidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, many elderly, lost nearly $200 million when American  
Continental's unsecured ``junk'' bonds turned out to be worthless. 
Taxpayers lost $3.4 billion in the collapse of Keating's Lincoln 
Savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Keating, who became a symbol of the S&AMP;L scandals of the 1980s,  
was convicted of separate charges in state and federal courts. He 
also owes $1.5 billion in damages to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	His federal convictions were overturned on grounds the jury  
improperly heard about his Superior Court convictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors accepted his guilty plea this April to three  
counts of wire fraud and one count of bankruptcy fraud. The 
75-year-old financier was freed after serving nearly five years of 
a 12 1/2-year federal sentence.

<HEADLINE> Two Buchanan Aides Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan's communications director  
resigned Friday, saying he was ``disgusted'' that his boss may soon 
bolt the Republican Party for a third-party presidential bid that 
could undermine GOP hopes of capturing the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``As an American, I'm disgusted at the prospect of electing Al  
Gore president of the United States,'' Bob Adams said in a 
telephone interview. ``As a Republican, I will do whatever it takes 
to elect our nominee to the White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, a three-time presidential candidate lagging in GOP  
polls, has accused party leaders of rigging the nominating process 
to aid Texas Gov. George W. Bush at the peril of social issues such 
as abortion. He is considering seeking the Reform Party nomination, 
with an announcement expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans worry that Buchanan's combative campaign style and  
deeply held conservative views could siphon votes from the eventual 
GOP nominee. Polls suggest that up to twice as many Bush voters as 
Gore supporters would migrate to Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of Adams is the first sign of division within the  
Buchanan camp, though other supporters have privately expressed 
reservations about his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, campaign treasurer Scott B. Mackenzie announced  
Friday that he had submitted his resignation to Buchanan on Monday 
in a letter that pledged his support to the conservative regardless 
of whether Buchanan leaves the party or not. ``I wish you and 
Shelley (Buchanan's wife) only the best and want you to know that 
my support is unwavering regardless of your course,'' the letter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mackenzie said in a telephone interview that he was leaving for  
``personal and family reasons'' that had nothing to do with 
Buchanan's potential Reform Party bid. The resignation is effective 
Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams gave no notice of his departure.  
</P>
<P>
	``In March 1992, I joined the Buchanan Brigades as a volunteer  
in Maryland. Mr. Buchanan then, as now, is an honorable man of 
unquestionable integrity,'' Adams said. ``The Buchanan family will 
remain in my prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adams, 30, said he did not know for sure whether Buchanan would  
leave the party. ``But I've not seen a single thing in the last 
several days -- or several weeks -- that would suggest otherwise,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Buchanan or his sister and top adviser, Bay Buchanan,  
had told him that the party switch was a certainty, Adams said, 
``That is a question best posed to Mr. Buchanan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Buchanans were unavailable. Adams was the only full-time  
aide in the press department. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the campaign after working for Creative Response  
Concepts, a public relations firm allied with GOP rival Steve 
Forbes. Adams said he hopes to remain in Republican politics, 
preferably with a presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole's communications director resigned this week to  
explore private sector offers, an action that raised questions 
about the viability of her GOP presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Report: Ransom Money Sparks Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An investigation into alleged money laundering  
through a U.S. bank began when ransom money in a Russian kidnapping 
case was traced by the FBI, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	American investigators believe that Russian mobsters may have  
laundered up to $10 billion through accounts at the Bank of New 
York over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation began in August 1998, the Journal said, when  
the Russian national police asked the FBI for assistance in the 
kidnapping of a Russian citizen, Edouard Olevinskiy. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian police asked the FBI to help trace a $300,000 ransom  
payment made to the captors, the newspaper said, citing 
unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI tracked the money from a San Francisco account  
maintained by Olevinskiy to an account at the Bank of New York, and 
then to an offshore bank and finally to an account at Sobin Bank in 
Moscow, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear what Olevinskiy did and the reasons for his  
kidnapping, but the ransom eventually made its way back to his 
account in San Francisco, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, a compliance officer at the Bank of New York alerted  
the FBI to unusual wire transfers involving an account controlled 
by Peter Berlin, the Journal said. Berlin controlled the Bank of 
New York account where Olevinskiy's ransom had passed through, 
according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the inquiry's start, the bank has fired a vice president  
in its Eastern European division, Lucy Edwards, who was married to 
Berlin. Neither has been charged with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Boston Globe reported today that more than $2  
million flowed through BankBoston Corp. to a company under 
investigation in the Russian bank-laundering scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the BankBoston money went to Bank of New York accounts  
held by Benex International Co., a trading company being 
investigated, the Globe said, citing unidentified sources. Berlin 
is listed as a director of Benex.

<HEADLINE> FAO: Global Cereal Outlook Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The outlook for world cereal production has improved  
in recent months, thanks to better crop prospects in Asia and North 
America, a U.N. food agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Revising its earlier forecast, the agency estimated the 1999  
global cereal crop at 1.8 billion tons. That's up 12 million tons 
from its June forecast, but 0.7 percent lower than in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Output will therefore remain below consumption needs, requiring  
use of cereal stocks, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture 
Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's monthly food outlook report said 37 countries  
remained on its list of those facing ``food emergencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among countries requiring assistance are those in east Africa;  
Honduras, Nicaragua and Haiti in Latin America; and the Balkans, 
including Kosavar refugees. North Korea remained the main country 
in Asia facing chronic food supply problems.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Failures Not the Worst Scenario </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stockpiling and inventory hedging against Year  
2000 computer failures could cause worse trouble than the Y2K 
glitch itself, the nation's top financial leaders warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If worried companies hold back more inventories than usual, said  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, ``bottlenecks could 
develop, and market pressure could ensue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan appeared Friday at a conference in Washington with  
other government leaders and regulators to discuss Y2K repair 
efforts by the financial industry, considered among the most well 
prepared of all sectors of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted that private companies have spent an estimated  
$50 billion on repair efforts, and said the chance for cascading 
failures in the most important computer networks seemed to be ``now 
negligible.'' The government reported earlier this week it had 
spent $8.34 billion on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The response of businesses and households to unwarranted fears  
of serious disruptions does give me pause,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers should prepare for the century date change as they  
would for any long weekend,'' he said. ``Those people who do cash 
out a significant part of their deposits only increase the risk 
that they will become victims of crime or fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the possibility that more Americans may start  
stockpiling is likely to rise as Jan. 1 nears and news media devote 
more attention to the issue. He urged the financial regulators to 
work hard to counter scare stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, facts are the only antidote for  
rumors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, said the financial industry was so prepared that 
``disasters that some originally predicted will not even get an 
honorable mention in the history books.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I see no reason why fear of a Year 2000 problem should cause  
investors to alter their investment or trading habits,'' Levitt 
said. ``Actions taken by investors based on unreasonable fear or 
bad information pose a greater threat to our economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has graded less than  
satisfactory only 27 of the nation's 10,922 banks and other 
financial institutions in their Y2K repairs -- including seven 
deemed ``unsatisfactory'' as of this week, FDIC Chairwoman Donna 
Tanoue said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC declined to identify those institutions, although  
Levitt said at the conference, ``Our industry flourishes in the 
sunlight of disclosure. Investors simply cannot make informed 
decisions in the dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC said it routinely publicizes any formal enforcement  
action but won't identify results of intermediate reviews. All 
deposits are insured regardless. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Unger, an SEC commissioner, said Friday that only 13  
trading firms -- all identified in commission documents -- were not 
adequately prepared, although all have indicated they will be ready 
my mid-October. The SEC has set a mid-November deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any firm that is unable to meet that deadline will be put out  
of business by the SEC,'' Unger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said there has already been a noticeable rise in  
interest rates for corporate borrowing as many companies move bond 
sales forward to avoid having to be in the market around the start 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates twice since  
late June in an effort to slow the economy enough to make sure that 
inflation pressures are not triggered by tight labor markets or 
possible bottlenecks in production that would cause firms to boost 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan didn't discount possible but minor failures caused by  
the Y2K problem, and said it was ``at least conceivable that, as a 
consequence of our current dependence on computers, some 
Y2K-related failures could have noticeable effects on the 
economy.'' But he also noted that failures occur every day, citing 
figures that 1 to 2 percent of ATM machines nationwide are out of 
service daily because of technical problems.

	PARIS (AP) -- The German airline Lufthansa has ordered 11 Airbus  
passenger jets and taken an option on six others, the European 
airplane manufacturing consortium announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lufthansa, one of Airbus' best customers, ordered eight  
long-range A340-300, and three single-aisle A320 aircraft. It took 
an option on six other A340-300 planes. Delivery is set to begin in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Airbus did not provide a value for the orders. The deal is worth  
about $2.1 billion, according to catalog prices for the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Juergen Weber, the president of Lufthansa, praised the  
``flexibility and operational reliability'' of the Airbus aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Russian Forces Reclaim Villages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops have reclaimed all  
villages in the southern region of Dagestan from Islamic militants, 
and were searching the area today for scattered rebel fighters, a 
top military official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees have started coming back to their homes in western  
Dagestan's Novolaksky region, after it was cleared of rebel groups 
who had invaded from the neighboring breakaway region of Chechnya 
on Sept. 5, army commander Gen. Gennady Groshev said. 
</P>
<P>
	The main Russian forces have been moved to positions nearer to  
the border with Chechnya, to repel possible new offensives by 
Islamic militants. Up to 1,500 of them have congregated on the 
other side of the frontier north of the latest fighting, Groshev 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and Defense Ministry troops joined in the search in  
Dagestan for remaining rebels. Thirty-one suspected rebels and 
their collaborators have been detained, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Islamic militants twice crossed the Chechen border and seized  
villages in Dagestan since the beginning of August, clashing with 
Russian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian police and Defense Ministry forces lost about 250 troops  
in the fighting since early August, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, deputy chief of the Army General  
Staff, claimed that Russian forces had killed more than 2,000 
militants. But rebels have said that the Russian claims are 
exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets also were bombing rebel bases in Chechnya to  
pre-empt new incursions. Moscow denied Chechen claims that the jets 
were hitting villages in the breakaway republic -- although some 
villages may have been hit inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Strikes have been delivered and will be delivered'' against  
rebel bases in Chechnya, Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there have been no and will be no strikes against  
residential locations in Chechnya,'' Rushailo was quoted as saying 
by the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen authorities say some 200 civilians have been killed in  
the raids by Russian jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen separatists drove out Russian troops in the 1994-96 war,  
winning de facto independence. Islamic militants from Chechnya now 
want to declare an independent Islamic state in Dagestan and other 
Caucasus Mountains regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian authorities say the fighting in Dagestan has been linked  
to a series of apparent terrorist bombings of apartment buildings 
in Moscow and other cities, which have killed about 300 people this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow police have raided subway stations, markets and other  
public places, checking people's identity papers -- with special 
attention to dark-skinned people believed to be from the Caucasus 
Mountains region. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin also has called for tightening security  
around the border with Chechnya. Russia's upper house of parliament 
on Friday voiced its support for that government plan, Prime 
Minister Vladimir Putin said. After appearing in the chamber, Putin 
said lawmakers had urged him ``to act harshly and rapidly'' to 
stabilize the situation in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is exactly what we are going to do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Scandal, Importers Linked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- At first, suspicion fell on Russian mobsters. Then  
it shifted to Russian officials accused of sneaking off with 
foreign aid. But many of the billions of dollars allegedly 
laundered through the Bank of New York may have had more mundane 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Russian tax officials and financial analysts say,  
the money could have come from thousands of small- to medium-sized 
Russian businesses who spirited funds through offshore companies to 
avoid enormous taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice is illegal but extremely widespread in a country  
where taxes are punitive, rules are ever-changing and tax police 
say up to 99 percent of businesses skirt some taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Capital flight is a huge problem. ... Importers and exporters  
who evade taxes are a significant part of that,'' tax police 
spokesman Vladimir Biketov said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials link the Bank of New York affair to  
tax-dodging traders rather than corrupt officials and mobsters 
allegedly laundering looted state assets, international aid and 
organized crime cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian businesses also like this theory, since it lifts the  
stain of organized crime that has tainted Russian companies since 
the scandal first broke. 
</P>
<P>
	Russians have long said that the reported U.S. probe into the  
bank is being overblown by Western officials and media seeking to 
smear Russia. The head of a Russian delegation visiting Washington 
to discuss the probe said Thursday that U.S. investigators have yet 
to provide any evidence of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. investigators have not commented on the tax-dodger theory.  
But commenting on the Bank of New York scandal during a visit to 
Moscow, the chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, James Harmon, 
said Thursday: ``I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't largely 
capital flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since media reports first emerged that up to $10 billion may  
have been illegally funneled through the bank, the key question has 
been: Where could that much money have come from? 
</P>
<P>
	Initial reports linked it to Russian organized crime. But  
Russian officials and analysts doubt even the richest of mob bosses 
has access to such huge sums. 
</P>
<P>
	Other reports have said some of the money came from a $4.8  
billion International Monetary Fund loan to Russia in July 1998. 
That version suggests Russian officials, girding for the financial 
collapse that hit the country last summer, looted IMF funds and 
laundered them through foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have fiercely denied any such foul play and an  
IMF inquiry found no misuse of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials believe that tax-dodging Russian importers  
probably account for most of the laundered money. 
</P>
<P>
	A key reported target of the probe is a company called Benex,  
with offices in London and New Jersey. Two Benex accounts in the 
Bank of New York have reportedly been frozen and Benex chief Peter 
Berlin's wife, Lucy Edwards, has been fired by the Bank of New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	The full extent of Benex's activities is unclear. But former  
Russian tax chief Boris Fyodorov and other officials confirm that 
Benex is among hundreds of companies used by Russian businesses to 
move money -- mainly to avoid import and export duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yulia Latynina, a Russian financial analyst who studies capital  
flight, said mob bosses and corrupt officials could be part of the 
alleged Bank of New York scheme. But she estimated that up to 70 
percent of Benex's business came from Russian importers who used 
the company to avoid import and export duties. 
</P>
<P>
	The way it works, she said, is that a Russian importer makes a  
deal with a foreign supplier for $1,000 worth of shoes. But the 
contract says the goods are worth $300. The importer pays the 
supplier $300 through his official bank account, and pays import 
and customs duties -- which can run up to 50 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The importer then quietly pays the supplier $700 through an  
illicit offshore bank transfer, Latynina explained. She said tax 
police are often in on the schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	Official imports to Russia ran to $60 billion in 1998, and  
Biketov estimated that up to 80 percent of importers use offshore 
companies to avoid import duty. Exporters use such companies, too, 
to hide profits in foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Capital flight has plagued the Russian economy for years, with  
Russians sending an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion abroad 
annually, much of it illegally. Some is from ordinary people who, 
after seeing their savings repeatedly swallowed by inflation or 
political turmoil, now put them in overseas bank accounts. Others 
are wealthy entrepreneurs trying to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a Russian, it is hard to understand how a sausage importer  
could be considered a drug baron just because he didn't give 114 
percent of his profits to the government,'' Latynina wrote in a 
recent analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fyodorov said nothing would change until tax laws are made more  
realistic. ``Our tax system is not reformed, not compatible with a 
market economy.''

<HEADLINE> Bahamas Hurricane Relief Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Bahamian patrol boats and U.S. Coast  
Guard choppers ferried food, water, plastic tarps and other 
emergency supplies Friday to islands devastated by Hurricane Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said a second person had been killed in the storm.  
Nikara Brown, a 19-year-old college student, was electrocuted when 
power that had been knocked out by Floyd was restored to her Nassau 
home Thursday, said Police Superintendent Douglas Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
	A Freeport man was swept out to sea during the storm on Tuesday  
in Grand Bahama Island, police said. There were no other reports of 
deaths in the Bahamas from Floyd, which barreled through the 
islands packing 150-mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Royal Bahamas Defense Force patrol boats and U.S.  
Coast Guard helicopters shipped tons of food, water and plastic 
sheeting to heavily damaged islands, including Abaco, Eleuthera, 
Cat and San Salvador, said National Disaster Organization 
coordinator Godwin Blyden. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the supplies had been donated. Thomas Carey, an official  
with the Aquapure bottled water company, said Nassau businesses 
were buying truckloads of water to send to storm victims in Abaco 
and Eleuthera. 
</P>
<P>
	The hurricane knocked out telephone, electricity and water  
supplies in many islands, and officials warned that repairs could 
take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	They were still not sure how many structures were lost, or how  
many people were left homeless. Hundreds of wooden homes were 
flattened, roofless or otherwise damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham toured the islands and planned to  
address the nation on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking care of people's immediate needs so they can have  
shelter, food and water, but we have to make a more detailed 
assessment to decide what kind of assistance they need,'' Blyden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several foreign governments were ready to send supplies, but  
were awaiting word from Nassau, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American Health Organization sponsored efforts to send  
generators to island medical clinics without power and engineers to 
help restore water systems. 
</P>
<P>
	With so much standing water, the organization also was studying  
the need for mosquito eradication to prevent mosquito-borne 
diseases, said representative Richard Van West Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists began returning to the main tourist islands, New  
Providence and Grand Bahama, lounging poolside under sunny skies or 
sipping cocktails in air-conditioned hotel bars. Major hotels were 
spared significant damage by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Considering how quickly we got back to normal ... things were  
in place and it worked,'' said Robert Sands, general manager of the 
Nassau Beach Hotel.

	Tampa Bay's Carlos Valderrama scored his fourth goal of the  
season in the 10th minute and Nowak notched his sixth 22 minutes 
later to tie the game.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Poole Questionable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts may have to play at  
New England on Sunday without starting right cornerback Tyrone 
Poole, coach Jim Mora said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole has been bothered by a thigh bruise for several weeks.  
While the injury was not considered serious enough to force the 
5-foot-8, 188-pounder from the starting lineup, Mora said his 
status for Sunday's game is questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Poole did not practice Friday, and a final determination of his  
status will be made Sunday, Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's not for sure yet. But if not, we've got guys  
who can go in there and play well,'' Mora said. ``You don't ever 
like to lose your starters. But that's why we have other players on 
the team so they can go in and play good. We always expect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the Colts re-signed veteran defensive back Monty  
Montgomery, who had been waived earlier in the week, and waived 
running back Tremayne Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery, Indianapolis' fourth-round draft pick in 1997, has  
started eight of 33 games for the Colts from 1997-99. Stephens, who 
had joined the Colts as a free agent this past Wednesday, started 
one of 13 games for San Diego in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a possibility that Tyrone might not be ready and we  
wanted to cover all the bases in case that occurred,'' Mora said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year pro Tony Blevins, who intercepted a pass and  
returned it 74 yards for a touchdown in the Colts' 31-14 win over 
Buffalo, could move into the starting lineup if Poole cannot play. 
Free safety Jason Belser, who had a minor knee sprain in the Bills' 
game, has responded well to treatment and is expected to be in the 
starting lineup against the Patriots this week.

<HEADLINE> Widow of Dead Ga. Arena Worker Sues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The wife of an ironworker killed in a fall last  
year at Atlanta's new Philips Arena has filed a lawsuit that 
contends the complex's design caused the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was filed Thursday in Fulton County State Court by  
Lavon McCord, the widow of worker Tracy McCord of Sharpsburg. 
McCord, 32, and Sammie Caraway, of Barnesville, were killed Oct. 2 
when they fell 50 feet to the ground while setting a concrete slab. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit names as defendants Turner Sports &AMP; Entertainment  
Development Inc., designers and contractors. McCord and Caraway 
were part of a crew setting a 38,000-pound beam that serves as the 
platform for upper deck seating. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit contends the deck design was unstable and  
construction methods were changed after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Gunnerson, senior vice president for corporate affairs at  
Turner Broadcasting, said Friday the company does not comment on 
pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The $213 million arena in downtown Atlanta was built on the site  
of the former Omni as the home for the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and 
NHL's Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first competition is Saturday when the expansion Thrashers  
play an exhibition hockey game against the New York Rangers.

<HEADLINE> Shalala Disappointed With States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Health Secretary Donna Shalala chastised the  
states for breaking their promise to use billions of dollars from 
the historic tobacco settlement for health programs and said she 
regrets that no federal strings were attached to the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm more than disappointed with the states,'' Shalala, who  
heads the Department of Health and Human Services, said Friday in 
an interview with The Associated Press. ``My hope is that at some 
point they will reconsider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wide-ranging interview, Shalala also addressed political  
questions, saying she considers former Sen. Bill Bradley a friend, 
but she has sent Vice President Al Gore a $1,000 check in his race 
for the Democratic nomination for president. She has also 
contributed $500 to Hillary Rodham Clinton for her expected Senate 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime Democrat also said she admired GOP hopeful  
Elizabeth Dole's work at the American Red Cross, particularly her 
success in cleaning up the blood supply after the emergence of 
AIDS. ``She did an excellent job,'' Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on health care, she said providers have gotten used to  
overpayments in the Medicare system and need to realize that the 
program is no longer willing to give them a ``slush fund'' to use 
to treat the uninsured, boost research and advance other laudable 
goals. She said hospital officials have admitted to her that they 
are paid accurately but they need the extra money they once 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we should overpay,'' she said. ``They're used to  
a government that does that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the tobacco money, Shalala issued her most pointed public  
criticism to date of the states' use of the $246 billion being paid 
by tobacco companies to settle lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of those states assured us that they were going to use  
this money for health purposes,'' Shalala said, without mentioning 
any particular states. ``I've very disappointed in their failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration argued that the federal government  
was entitled to a large share of that moneybecause federal as well 
as state money was spent to care for sick smokers, and it wanted to 
use that leverage to force the states to spend the money on health. 
</P>
<P>
	But President Clinton ultimately went along with Congress and  
the states, which argued that states should control it all. States 
promised to spend it on anti-smoking and health care programs, but 
so far, many of them have proposed using it for other things, too. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Idaho and California plan to put the money into  
general operations, North Dakota is eyeing water projects and 
education, Michigan wants to put most of it into college 
scholarships and West Virginia is considering spending on 
government workers' insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials, responding to Shalala's criticism, said most  
states plan to use at least a portion of the money on some sort of 
health or anti-smoking program. And most have not made final 
decisions about how to spend it, said Joan Henneberry of the 
National Governors' Association. The money won't actually start 
coming until next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Henneberry said, states can do what they want with it.  
</P>
<P>
	``The states took these cases and they settled (them) and it's  
really up to state policy makers to decide what the most critical 
needs of the citizens are,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Shalala:  
</P>
<P>
	--Said she doesn't know how much the administration will be able  
to accomplish next year, the last in Clinton's second term. ``You 
have to understand that my generation of Democrats has never had a 
second term, so I don't have a clue what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Predicted Mrs. Clinton would not have the same problems as  
other first-time candidates because she's been around politics for 
so long. ``She's a pro,'' Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said some cuts to the Medicare program, including payments to  
hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers, went too 
deep. ``Wherever we made mistakes, we want to put some money 
back,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Predicted Congress will find the money needed for HHS programs,  
even though it is short by some $16 billion, because the programs 
are incredibly popular. ``Which party really wants to cut 142,000 
kids out of Head Start?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Laments Congress' Aid Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional cuts in President Clinton's  
foreign spending requests are threatening to make the United States 
``a joke'' around the world, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	She urged union leaders to make their voices heard ``loud and  
clear'' on Capitol Hill. Among the programs at risk, she said, is a 
new one to promote fair labor standards around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright spoke at a meeting of an advisory committee designed to  
make more use of U.S. foreign policy to improve wages and 
conditions for workers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has cut Clinton's overseas budget by $2.4 billion and  
has not acted on another $2 billion in supplemental requests. ``It 
is very simple,'' Albright said. ``There is just no money to do the 
things we need to do. We will become a joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright called fair wages and working conditions a human right,  
and that globalization had widened the gap between rich and poor -- 
an argument used by critics of the Clinton administration's 
free-trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright indicated she lives by that rule, saying that when she  
buys a blouse she tries to make sure it was not manufactured by 
oppressed workers.

<HEADLINE> Top European Horses in Woodward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Godolphin Stables' Almutawakel, with one victory  
on dirt, nonetheless is a contender for the $4 million Breeders' 
Cup Classic on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	A victory in Saturday's $500,000 Woodward at Belmont Park would  
turn him into a serious contender. 
</P>
<P>
	For Running Stag, the 1 1/8th mile Woodward IS his Breeders' Cup.  
</P>
<P>
	The two European horses head a field of seven for the Grade I  
Woodward, which will be accompanied by the Grade I Ruffian for 
fillies and mares and the Grade II Jerome on the turf for 
3-year-olds Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The road to the Breeders' Cup continues Sunday when 2-year-old  
standout More Than Ready meets Bevo and six others in the $150,000 
Futurity and 2-year-old fillies are tested in the $150,000 Matron. 
</P>
<P>
	Almutawakel's lone victory on the main track was an impressive  
one as he beat some of the best horses in the world (as well as 
Running Stag) to win the $4 million Dubai World Cup in the spring. 
After a lengthy layoff, he came back to finish seventh, beaten 15 
lengths in the Juddmonte International at York in August. 
</P>
<P>
	The main goal, however, is the Breeders' Cup Classic.  
</P>
<P>
	``He should definitely improve off his first run over the soft  
grass,'' said Simon Crisford, racing manager for Godolphin Stables, 
the Dubai arm of Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's and Sheikh Mohammed al 
Maktoum's racing empire. 
</P>
<P>
	For Running Stag's connections, the Breeders' Cup Classic is not  
part of the equation for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	After criss-crossing the Atlantic in search of a victory,  
Running Stag took the Grade II Brooklyn Handicap at Belmont this 
summer and then the Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap on August 29. 
The goal now is to earn his first Grade I win. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our Breeders' Cup,'' said trainer Philip Mitchell.  
``At no point were we ever going to Gulfstream (Nov. 6). It's 
really important for him to win a Grade I race, especially one in 
New York, where he's become so popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag made his American debut in the 1998 Woodward,  
finishing third at odds of 48-1 to Skip Away and Gentlemen. He then 
finished fourth in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, seventh in the 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, and fourth in the Clark 
Handicap before finishing seventh to Almutawakel in Dubai. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse loves to travel,'' said Mitchell. ``The only thing  
he hates are short trips.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following the Woodward, Mitchell plans to send Running Stag back  
to England before heading to Hong Kong for a $2 million race at the 
end of the year. Next year, he plans to compete a full year in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old horse, the 2-1 morning line favorite, will be  
ridden by Shane Sellers in the Woodward, while Almutawakel will 
have the services of Jerry Bailey. Also starting will be Black Cash 
(Edgar Prado), Barter Town (Jorge Chavez), River Keen (Chris 
Antley), and a pair of 3-year-olds in Stephen Got Even (Gary 
Stevens), and Gander (Pat Day). All carry 126 pounds except Stephen 
Got Even and Gander, who will carry 121 pounds in the 
weight-for-age event.

<HEADLINE> Brigham Young Off to Solid Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVO, Utah (AP) -- Brigham Young coach LaVell Edwards expected  
to have a good team this fall. So far, he's right. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense is playing with last season's intensity, when the  
Cougars ranked fifth nationally. Quarterback Kevin Feterik has a 
firm grip on the offense and BYU has unveiled talented freshman 
running back Luke Staley. 
</P>
<P>
	If the No. 25 Cougars sharpen their special-teams play, there's  
reason to dream of a special season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like where we are right now,'' Edwards said after BYU beat  
No. 23 Colorado State 34-13 on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cougars (2-0, 1-0 Mountain West) held Colorado State (2-1,  
0-1) scoreless and allowed 129 total yards through three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams got 160 of 289 passing yards in the fourth quarter  
against BYU's reserves, scoring twice. The Cougars' defense forced 
Colorado State quarterback Matt Newton into three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to give a lot of credit to the BYU defense,'' Rams  
coach Sonny Lubick said. ``They were very tough early on and they 
looked like they're a real solid team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People in Utah are talking about the Cougars squeezing into the  
Bowl Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Rams played without injured running back Kevin McDougal  
and linebacker Ula Tuitele. Colorado State lost linebacker Rick 
Crowell when he hurt his shoulder on a second-quarter tackle. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Rams also had a short week to prepare after last  
Saturday's victory over Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without three of our four best football players ready to go,  
you really have to step up,'' Lubick said. ``We don't want to make 
any excuses, but it would have been nice to have a couple more days 
to get ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	BYU has struggled on special teams.  
</P>
<P>
	During a 35-28 victory over Washington, the Cougars misplayed a  
punt inside their own 10 and handed the Huskies a touchdown. Owen 
Pochman missed two field goal tries in that game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams blocked Pochman's first attempt Thursday, wiping out  
linebacker Jeff Holtry's 46-yard interception return. On 
first-and-goal from the 1, BYU tight end Carlos Nuno dropped a pass 
in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Pochman later connected from 38 and 43 yards, and Edwards said  
the Cougars are focused on fixing their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started out a little shaky at points, but we settled down  
and got the kicking situation taken care of,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Staley, last year's high school player of the year in Oregon,  
has been a great addition. He chose the Cougars over Nebraska, 
UCLA, Arizona State and several other Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring two rushing TDs against Washington, Staley ran for  
two more against Colorado State and caught a 7-yard TD pass from 
Feterik. 
</P>
<P>
	``He doesn't play like a freshman, does he?'' Feterik said.  
</P>
<P>
	Next up is Virginia on Sept. 25, BYU's third home game.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to have a letdown,'' said Setema Gali, a  
defensive end who had a fourth-quarter interception. ``There is a 
potential for a great season. That's what we're hoping for.''

<HEADLINE> Rodham Brothers Asked To Scrap Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration urged the  
president's brothers-in-law to get out of a business venture in the 
former Soviet republic of Georgia after an opponent of Georgian 
President Eduard Shevardnadze tried to use that deal for his own 
political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Berger ... suggested that, all things considered, that  
they should withdraw from this,'' White House spokesman Joe 
Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, told Hugh and  
Tony Rodham earlier this month that their efforts to establish 
walnut and tea processing businesses in western Georgia were 
``being misrepresented as somehow reflecting a change in U.S. 
policy,'' Lockhart said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers initially rejected the request, saying in a  
statement they had no reason to believe they are their associates 
were involved ``in any illegal activities.'' But their lawyer, 
James Hamilton, later told The Washington Post they had decided to 
withdraw because they did not want ``to do any harm to the first 
lady or the administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rodhams, brothers of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,  
spent eight days in Georgia in late August, looking into 
investments in Batumi, capital of the Ajaria region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ajaria area's local political boss, Aslan Abashidze, issued  
a statement a few days after the visit suggesting that the Rodhams' 
presence in the region represented ``political support rendered to 
him by U.S. President Bill Clinton,'' the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shevardnadze's government informed the Clinton administration  
about the visit only a few days beforehand. Once in Georgia, the 
Rodhams visited Shevardnadze in the nation's capital, Tbilisi, 
before heading to Batumi. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, declined to comment,  
deferring to Lockhart's remarks.

citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1997, Stevens has won  
three Kentucky Derbies, two Belmont Stakes and one Preakness along 
with six Breeders' Cup events. 
</P>
<P>
	He won the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Not Disney Show Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Facing pressure from Arab nations, Disney  
officials said Friday that a controversial exhibit on Israel for 
its millennium celebration will not designate Jerusalem as the 
political capital of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spokesman Bill Warren wouldn't say what role the Arab  
pressure played in Disney's decision, nor did he say if any changes 
had been made to the exhibit following Walt Disney World President 
Al Weiss' meeting with Arab leaders earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are sharing with you today is more detail about this  
exhibit in hopes that it will calm debate on this issue,'' Warren 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel captured the eastern sector of Jerusalem in the 1967  
Middle East war, annexed it immediately, and insists that the 
undivided city remain its eternal capital. The Palestinians want to 
make east Jerusalem the capital of their independent state. 
</P>
<P>
	No less than the prime minister of Israel weighed in on the  
theme park exhibit earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attempts to harm the standing of Israel and Jerusalem as its  
capital,'' Ehud Barak said in a statement, ``have failed in the 
past and will fail in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of his remarks was lost on no one. Earlier this week,  
Palestinians and Israelis launched final status peace talks and 
Barak hopes an ultimate deal can be concluded within a year. The 
thorniest issue by far is the status of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if agreement can be found on all other issues by September  
2000, many believe the question of Jerusalem will stall peace talks 
far past Barak's hoped-for deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Millennium Village'' is due to open Oct. 1 at the Epcot  
Center at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Israel's Foreign Ministry 
contributed $1.8 million to the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2,400-square-foot Israel Pavilion will offer a presentation  
that showcases the nation's agricultural, energy and high-tech 
industries. Visitors also can walk through a pathway lined with 
white Jerusalem stones and enter a huge structure built as a copy 
of the walls of Jerusalem's old city. There will be no mention of 
Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Arab representatives, including ambassadors from  
Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, met with Weiss, Walt Disney 
World's president, in Washington. They said later they were 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very interested to hear our input,'' said Dr. Hala  
Maksoud, president of the Washington-based Arab-American 
Anti-Discrimination Committee. ``They didn't realize the political 
impact of the exhibit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arab leaders will not be satisfied, however, if the exhibit  
designates east Jerusalem as part of Israel since Arabs consider it 
occupied territory, Mrs. Maksoud said. She left open the 
possibility that protesters might picket the exhibit when it opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren, the Disney spokesman, wouldn't say how the exhibit may  
refer to east Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier signs that Disney might be caving in to Arab demands  
infuriated Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Eitan Bentsur, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry,  
wrote to The Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner on 
Monday, expressing Israel's ``certitude'' that the Israeli pavilion 
would be presented in full, and that Disney would not submit to 
political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big guns came out Friday, after news reports about the  
meeting in Washington. Along with Barak, both Foreign Minister 
David Levy and opposition leader Ariel Sharon aired their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not tolerate the return of the dark days of boycott  
and those sorts of things,'' said Levy, referring to a long Arab 
League boycott against Israel that is no longer enforced. ``We had 
an agreement with Disney. Our pavilion was supposed to present 
Jerusalem in all its glory, through all its history.''

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Patients Can Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Ken McCann intends to be in Dublin, Ireland, soon, pushing his  
arthritic joints through a marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors consider McCann an unusual case. But they say the  
principle is valid -- people with arthritis should stay active. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't think I'd be running races, but I do,'' said  
McCann, 47, of Monroe, Conn. ``I'm totally obsessed with running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCann will take part Oct. 25 in the Dublin Marathon as part of  
the Arthritis Foundation's Joints in Motion program, a combination 
fund-raiser and marathon training system. Participants raise a 
minimum of $3,500 for the foundation. They get coached through five 
months of training designed for those who have never run 26 miles 
before -- and they get the trip to Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just follow the program,'' McCann said. His pace is not very  
fast -- a 10-minute mile -- but he's been running around 20 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say if you can run 20, you can run the extra 6 on the  
adrenaline,'' McCann said. And if it turns out he can't, he has a 
backup plan -- his wife will be waiting at the 20-mile mark, and 
they'll head for a pub, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	For 12 years, McCann has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, a  
disease that afflicts an estimated 2.1 million Americans. It 
develops when the immune system goes awry and attacks a person's 
joints. The disease can lead to scarring of the bone in the joints. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pretty much woke up with it one day,'' McCann said. ``All my  
joints were completely swollen up. I had no idea what it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed, the painting contractor who used to ski  
and play tournament racquetball settled into a life with recurring 
pain and without the athletics he once loved. 
</P>
<P>
	McCann credits a new drug with changing his potential for life.  
Arava is a member of a class called DMARDs, short for 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The drugs rein in the immune 
cells, although the process is not well understood, said Dr. Steven 
Abramson, chief of rheumatology at The Hospital for Joint Diseases, 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical advances should help people with the disease better  
tolerate activities such as running, Abramson said. But this does 
not mean all people with rheumatoid arthritis should start running 
distance races, he said: ``While it may be good for one person, it 
might not be good for another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The location of the afflicted joints has a lot to do with the  
choice of exercise. If the joints are in the legs, running may be 
out, but swimming or low-intensity biking may still be in, Abramson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The age at which the disease is spotted is an important factor.  
The foundation has started a public education drive to catch the 
condition early, so DMARDs can be used to control its development. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor is the state of the disease, in which the joint  
inflammation comes and goes. If the joints are sore, exercise can 
wait, Abramson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The type of exercise should be tailored by a doctor and a  
physical therapist, said McCann's rheumatologist, Dr. Robert Schoen 
of Yale-New Haven Medical Center. For McCann, running was OK, 
Schoen said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was at my rheumatologist, and I expected him to say, `You're  
nuts,''' McCann said. ``But he says, `Go for it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not necessarily absolutely typical,'' Schoen said. ``Many  
patients are not doing as well as Kenny, and their disease would 
tell them they have to slow down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, McCann is a good example of the value of exercise,  
Schoen said. People with rheumatoid arthritis should develop and 
preserve good muscle tone around their joints, and should keep as 
wide a range of motion in their joints as the disease will allow, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, people with this condition tend to become less physically  
active, which sets them up for other medical problems, such as 
heart disease, that can come with a sedentary lifestyle, Schoen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, patients with rheumatoid arthritis may not realize  
what they are physically capable of, Abramson said. ``Find things 
you like to do,'' he advised. 
</P>
<P>
	For McCann, this includes running. ``It's been really uplifting  
for me, because it's such a shock that I'm able to do it.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire Hits No. 513 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire moved into 11th place on the  
career home run list with No. 513, a grand slam Friday night for 
St. Louis against Houston's Jose Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had missed the last three games with a strained  
groin, broke a tie with Eddie Mathews and Ernie Banks on the career 
chart. The Cardinals slugger trails Willie McCovey by eight home 
runs for 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who had homered only once in his last 32 plate  
appearances, hit a 422-foot shot over the Houston bullpen in left 
field for his 56th of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	The slam, which put McGwire three behind Sammy Sosa for the  
major league homer leader, sparked a nine-run fourth inning for the 
Cardinals. Thomas Howard and Fernando Tatis, the next two batters 
after McGwire, also each homered. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand slam was the second for McGwire this year and the 13th  
of his career. The other grand slam this season was off Atlanta's 
Greg Maddux on June 25.
