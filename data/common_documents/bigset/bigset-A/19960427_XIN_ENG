<HEADLINE> Subaru Team Sends Three-car Side for Indonesian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The 555 Subaru World Rally Team
has officially entered three cars for the coming third round of
the FIA World Rally Championships, Bank Utama Rally Indonesia '96.
</P>
<P>
The strong line-up is headed by reigning FIA World Rally
champion Colin McRae who teams up with current FIA Asia Pacific
Rally champion Kenneth Eriksson, and talented Italian driver Piero
Liatti.
</P>
<P>
Eriksson and McRae, currently second and third in the WRC
points table, will both be driving all out to take victory in the
event, keeping them within striking distance of Mitsubishi's Tommi
Makinen, who leads the table.
</P>
<P>
With McRae's win in Thailand, he now leads the FIA Asia Pacific
Championship. Having won Bank Utama Rally Indonesia in 1995, he
has a good track record at the event. Eriksson, runner-up in
Indonesia last year, has considerable experience of the rally and
its tricky surfaces. Both drivers will be hard for others to beat
if judged on previous form.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Rally Sport have announced their strongest assault to
date on the event, with a three car team of two-time Australian
Rally champion Gregory Carr, 1994 Asian Pacific Formula Two
champion and runner-up in 1995 Wayne Bell and South Korean driver
Dong-Ok Kim.
</P>
<P>
But organizers warned the participants of a potential danger if
they get stuck on Stages 12 or 17.  "Please listen and look
around before you leap out the car...you would make a very nice
breakfast for a hungry tiger," said Indradjit Sardjono, a clerk of
the course.

<HEADLINE> US Average Incomes Up Faster Than Inflation in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The average incomes in the
U.S. grew faster than inflation last year but the gains varied
widely in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, income per person in the U.S. -- total personal
income divided by the population -- rose 5 percent to 22,788 U.S.
dollars in 1995 from 21,699 dollars in 1994, The Washington Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a report by the U.S. Commerce Department, the paper
said that the increase was 2.6 percent faster than the inflation
rate which was 2.4 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Disposable income per person in the country -- income after
paying the tax -- rose by 2.4 percent last year, almost double the
gain in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the national averages mask large differences in
incomes among individuals, families and regions of the country.
For instance, part of last year's income gains were due to large
increases in corporate dividend payments, personal interest
receipts, rental income and the government benefit program. And
wages grew less rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The report said income increases also varied largely at the
state level. While residents in Louisiana scored a 6.9 percent
gain, those in North Dakota got only a 0.3 percent increase and
residents in south Dakota suffered a 0.3 percent decline. Both the
latter states were hurt by declines of farm income.
</P>
<P>
"The wide variations in gains among workers in different
industries and different states could make it hard for President
Clinton and other politicians running in this fall's election to
paint a rosy picture of the economy," the paper said.

<P>
HANOI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam plans to export 600,000
tonnes of rice in the second quarter of this year, following
exports of 580,000 tonnes in the first quarter, official reports
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam plans to export two million tonnes of rice this year,
the same volume as last year.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in the Mekong delta have had a good harvest of more
than three million tonnes of rice after a bountiful spring-winter
crop.
</P>
<P>
Sources here said many foreign rice traders have tried to lower
the purchasing price and to prolong the actualization of
contracts, hoping prices will continue to go down.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has tightened management of rice
exports by reducing the number of licensed rice exporters from 40
to 15.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Finland Won't Guarantee Security of Baltic Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and Finland have ruled
out the possibility of giving security guarantees to other
countries around the Baltic Sea, said a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
During Prime Minister Goran Persson's one-day visit to Finland
on Wednesday, the two countries signed an agreement to enhance
security cooperation in the Baltic region, the Svenska Dagbladet
reported. But both countries ruled out providing a security
umbrella for their smaller neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that some NATO members, such as U.S., Germany
and Britain, have suggested that if the alliance expands to
include only Poland, the five Baltic states outside NATO - Latvia,
Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden and Finland - will have to take care of
their own security. In this event, Sweden and Finland should take
on greater responsibility for the security of the other three
states.
</P>
<P>
Russia has also proposed that the five Baltic countries form a
non-aligned security bloc.
</P>
<P>
But at their joint press conference on Wednesday, Persson and
his Finnish counterpart Paavo Lipponen made it clear that the two
countries oppose these ideas.
</P>
<P>
Persson said the idea that Sweden take special responsibility
for the security of its Baltic neighbors was out of the question.

KUALA LUMPUR, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries of the
South must cooperate for a stronger voice in the restructuring of
the United Nations, Malaysian foreign minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi said here today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting visiting Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia at his office here, Abdullah said developing countries
must coordinate their stand when participating in meetings to
restructure the world body.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said after the restructuring it was hoped that the
United Nations would become a body that was capable of giving
attention to issues affecting the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On his meeting with Lampreia, the Malaysian foreign minister
said both sides agreed that the private sector should play a role
in enhancing bilateral relations including economic ties between
Malaysia and Brazil.

Lamperia agreed to send a space scientist soon to look into
cooperation between the two countries in space industry.

During the meeting, they signed two agreements on trade and
partial visa abolition.

The trade agreement provides for the establishment of a joint
trade committee to diversify the scope of economic relations
between Malaysia and Brazil, while the partial visa abolition
agreement provides for the exemption of visa for up to 90 days for
citizens of Malaysia and Brazil to enter each other's country for
purposes of official duty, vacation and visiting relatives.

CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr

Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted Moussa as saying that
the step contributes to clarifying matters vis-a-vis the final

An Israeli spokesman had said earlier that the Labor Party
sanctioned a program for the upcoming election that does not rule

In a statement in response to the Israeli move, a modification

and prior to the final-status negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Liberation Organization has just decided to
amend its charter to remove the clause calling for Israel's
destruction so as to fit in with new circumstances.

Moussa said that the moves by both sides were appropriate and
reaffirmed the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination and establishing their independent state in the
West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The decision, Moussa noted, came along with a recognition
of Israel, whose ruling party revoked its opposition to the
principle of establishing the Palestinian state.
</P>

He called on the two sides to make efforts on paving way for
serious negotiations on pending issues, on top of which are

NEW YORK, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp. and Japan's
Casio Corp. agreed to work together on a new category of
consumer-electronic devices, a new indication of the software
giant's plan to move beyond personal computers.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported here today that they are
planning to develop both hand-held computers and appliance-like
products that can swap data with PCs running Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
They will combine each other's expertise in developing the new
gadgets, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Hand-held computers have proved a difficult task, the paper
said. Apple Computer Inc.'s products hit the market with little
success, partly because of problems in handwriting recognition.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the company has to develop small, but fast and
effective software for hand-held computers.
</P>
<P>
Japan's consumer products companies have established a series
of alliances to get closer to U.S. leaders in PC technology, such
as Sony Corp.'s arrangement with Intel Corp. to develop a home
computing appliance, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Hewlett-Packard Co., a printer and computer
maker of the U.S., also sells hand-held devices that can swap data
with Windows PCs.

Punsalmaagin Ochirbat said today that the on-going economic
reforms in Mongolia have made marked achievements in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Ochirbat, who arrived
here on Monday for an official visit, said that his country was
finally on the verge of long happiness after several traumatic
years of economic reforms
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the country's 6.3 percent economic growth
rate in 1995 was almost respectable even by the demanding
standards of Asian countries.

Reviewing the economic reforms over the past few years, he said
that moving from a planned economy to a free market economy was
never an easy task despite Mongolia's rich natural resources.

After overcoming various difficulties, he noted the country's
economy was now recovering and the capital investment in Mongolia
rose 25 percent to 190 million U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The inflation is officially forecast to fall to 35 percent this
year from 53 percent in 1995, he said.

separate talks with British Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind to exchange views

JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua)-- South African President
Nelson Mandela and Deputy President F W De Klerk are to lead the
African National Congress (ANC) and National Party (NP)
respectively in crucial bilateral constitutional discussions
scheduled on Sunday, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral constitutional talks, which will probably be

The ANC-NP bilateral talks will be the culmination of a number
of similar deliberations between the parties following the

final constitution at the constitutional assembly's
Constitutional Committee (CC) on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> ROK Bank Branch in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A major bank of the Republic of
Korea, the Development Bank, opened a branch in Shanghai today,
the second branch of a ROK bank in China.
</P>
<P>
Kyung-Ho Song, president of the bank, said that the branch will
focus on new and high-tech industries, machine building, and
infrastructure, and participate in key Chinese government and
financial institution projects.
</P>
<P>
"Economic exchanges between China and ROK have enjoyed
conspicuous development since the two countries established
diplomatic ties in 1992," he said, adding that his bank has
provided long-term support for ROK investors in China, and has
taken an active part in getting foreign funds for China.
</P>
<P>
The Development Bank of ROK, which opened a representative
office in Beijing in 1992, has so far provided 38 loans worth a
total of 630 million US dollars for ROK investors in China, and
loans to major Chinese financial institutions worth some 182
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Recently, it was authorized by China's State Development Bank
to serve as the leading bank in organizing a 100-million-US-dollar
loan project.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now tops the list of cities with foreign-funded
financial institutions, with a total of 40 branches and 120
representative offices.

<HEADLINE> Survey Forecasts Surge in UK Consumer Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain is set for a consumer boom
this year which will outstrip even the government's upbeat
forecast for consumer spending growth, a leading economic
forecaster said today.
</P>
<P>
Business Strategies Limited (BSL) said in its latest survey of
consumer attitudes that it expected spending to grow by four
percent to 4.5 percent in 1996, even outstripping Chancellor
Kenneth Clarke's upbeat forecast of 3.5 percent, which many
economists believed as overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
BSL said that the pick-up would be strong enough to threaten
the government's inflation target of 2.5 percent underlying
inflation, and it also meant interest rates would have to rise.
</P>
<P>
The survey will intensify the debate on whether a return of
consumer confidence would deliver strong economic growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The upbeat outlook for the consumer side of the economy is in
sharp contrast to gloomy surveys of manufacturing, which point to
stagnating industry.

<HEADLINE> Germany Ranks Third in Beer Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany ranks third in the world in
beer production, behind the United States and China, according to
a recent report issued by the German beer industry.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Germans each drank 140 liters of beer on
average last year, but this was not enough for them to retake the
world beer-drinking laurels, which were captured by the Czech
Republic in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, German beer still leads the world beer market in
quality although its production has fallen to third place.
</P>
<P>
Half of the Germans drink beer once or twice a week and most of
them are professional men. About 36 percent of German women and
44 percent of young men never drink beer, which is the second most
favorite "national beverage," next only to coffee.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,250 beer breweries with 49,000 employees in
Germany, producing 5,000 brands of beer in all. The country's
annual beer sales total 20 billion marks (about 13.5 billion U.S.
dollars), giving the government 1.8 billion marks (about 1.2
million dollars) in revenues every year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian government today
declared April 26 a Day of Mourning for victims of the Chernobyl
nuclear accident and its resulting radioactive fallout 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
At a public commemoration in Minsk, the country's capital,
President Alexander Lukashenko said that Belarus suffered economic
losses worth 235 billion U.S. dollars - equal to 32 annual budgets
- as a result of the world's worst nuclear disaster.
</P>
<P>
The no. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant exploded
on April 26, 1986, in neighboring Ukraine, sending a radioactive
cloud across much of Europe and contaminating a quarter of
Belarussian territory.
</P>
<P>
In a television address Thursday, the president called for
cooperation among the country's political parties and social
organizations to deal with the aftermath of the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's primary objective at present is
to look after the health and living conditions of people who are
living on the contaminated land.

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Achieved Between Israel, Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A ceasefire agreement was finally
reached today to end the fighting between Israel and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon
following intensive diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held here by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Hariri announced at 6:00
p.m.(15:00 GMT) today that the truce will take effect at 4:00
a.m. (01:00 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Lebanese people have been killed, hundreds of
others wounded in the Israeli bombardment of Lebanon since
Israel's "Operation Grapes of Wrath" started on April 11. Nearly
half a million Lebanese civilians were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's announcement of the ceasefire came simultaneously with
a similar declaration from Israel to stop the 16-day-old war in
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that under a written "understanding" reached with
the mediation efforts of the U.S., Syria and France, Israel and
Lebanon also would pledge to spare civilians on both sides of the
border.
</P>
<P>
But he said the key to a lasting peace on the Lebanon-Israel
border will be an Israeli withdrawal from an occupied border
enclave in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced the ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Commemorates Chernobyl Nuclear Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today called for more measures to step up safety at nuclear power
plants as the nation commemorated the 10th anniversary of the
nuclear accident at the Chernobyl power plant on April 26, 1986.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on Radio Russia marking the anniversary of the
world's worst nuclear accident, Yeltsin said April 26 is a sad
date not only in the history of Russia, but in the history of all
mankind.
</P>
<P>
"The most important lesson to be learned from Chernobyl is the
need to boost safety in operating atomic power stations. We must
unite the efforts of experts from different countries to create
reliable equipment," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 10 years since Chernobyl's reactor No.4 exploded after
an unauthorized experiment, between 3,000 and 10,000 deaths in the
former Soviet Union are said to have a direct link with the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
"Extremely stringent measures are needed to ensure that the
tragedy of Chernobyl will not recur under any circumstances,"
Yeltsin added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia to Test Missile Defense Jointly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon announced today
the United States and Russia will conduct missile defense training
in a joint exercise in June at the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Spring.
</P>
<P>
A mock scenario will be used for the exercises to coordinate
the two countries' missile defense systems against a common
enemy's incoming missile, said Ashton Carter, Assistant Secretary
of Defense for International Security Policy. That means the
whole testing will be carried out by computer simulators, with no
missile to be fired.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to test theater missile defenses that protect
forces in the field against short- and medium-range threats. Each
country will have a team of 15 members to participate in the
computer-simulated maneuvers, with the U.S. team operating a
Patriot PAC-3 battery and the Russians using the SA-12
anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
Cater said that U.S. and Russian military officials hope to
learn, through the exercises, how best to divide coverage of the
battle space with their missile defense weaponry to enable the
systems to work efficiently side by side.
</P>
<P>
The exercise was agreed upon by President Clinton and his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin at their 1994 summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Perry in a speech today
criticized a missile defense plan introduced by Congressional
Republicans, which he said could threaten nuclear treaties with
Russia and in turn "jeopardize the elimination of an additional
3,200 former soviet nuclear warheads."
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan calls for deployment of a national missile
defense system by 2003, while a Pentagon plan favors developing a
system over the next three years that could be deployable in
another three years if a future threat assessment proves it
necessary. The Republicans attacked the Clinton administration
for being soft on missile defense. The House of Representatives
will take up the issue next month.

JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is to introduce
legislation shortly to bring traditional courts into the main
stream of its judicial system, said a report by the South African

<P>
Permanent Secretary Secretary Albert Kawana told delegates in
a historic three-day Traditional Authorities Conference in
capital Windhoek that a Community Courts Bill would soon be

</P>
<P>
"The measure is aimed at bringing the courts presided over by
traditional leaders into the main stream of the judiciary," said
the official.
</P>
<P>
Kawana said as soon as the bill is promulgated, it will be
possible for traditional leaders, recognised by the government in
1995, to apply for establishing community courts.
</P>
<P>
He said the bill does not contravene the constitution or any
written law because the community courts would only have the
jurisdiction on civil matters.

<P>
SEOUL, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The mountain fire, which destroyed
more than 3,000 hectares of forest land in South Korea's Kangwon
Province in the past few days, started to get under control last
night, according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began at a United States army training range in
Kosong County of the province on April 23, stopped spreading
yesterday evening as firefighters succeeded in putting out blazes
that were once feared to spread to the Sorak Mountain area, a
famous tourist attraction some 220 kilometers east of the South
Korean capital Seoul, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest-ever mountain fire in recent years has
engulfed more than 150 houses in 20 villages, left about 200
residents homeless and killed over 300 heads of
livestock. Hundreds of villagers were evacuated to safe places,
and no casualties were reported, police sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 people, including army soldiers and local
government officials, and 30 helicopters were on the scene to
fight the blaze.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, seven South Koreans were killed when trying to
control a brush fire at a U.S. military base in Tongduchon, north
of Seoul. Some 37,000 American troops are currently stationed in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Defense Ministry has ordered all military
units to suspend their shooting drills till May 15 in woodland
area and to take precautions when burning wastes and garbages to
prevent the recurrence of brush fires.

<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa, who is also the commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, inspected the military guard of honour.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar President Salmin Amour, together with all the

</P>
<P>
The ceremony was also attended by foreign envoys including

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Achieved between Israel, Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A ceasefire has been worked out
along the Israeli-Lebanese frontier today after 16 days of heavy
fighting between the Israeli army and Hezbollah militants.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher made the
announcement at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres following their meeting in Jerusalem this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, on his seventh day of a shuttle diplomacy between
Israel and Syria and Lebanon, said the ceasefire will take effect
at 4:00 a.m. local time (01:00GMT) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Israeli inner-cabinet held a special meeting,
ahead of the Christopher-Peres meeting, and approved the
ceasefire arrangement mediated by the U.S. Secretary of State.
</P>
<P>
Christopher left Israel this morning for Syria after meeting
with Peres, who said following the meeting that the "situation
(in southern Lebanon) is apparently reaching a conclusion."
</P>
<P>
Christopher consulted Syrian President Hafez Assad and Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on the ceasefire arrangement in
Damascus, capital of Syria, before returning to Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the press conference, Peres praised Christopher for his
effort to bring a ceasefire in southern Lebanon, and to push
forward the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said new "understandings" reached between Israel,
Lebanon and Syria will end the Katyusha attacks on northern
Israel, and protect civilians in both Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the new understandings will stop Hezbollah to use
civilian populated areas as launching ground for attacks on
Israel, while Israel will not fire at civilians and civilian
targets in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The understandings, he said, will provide the establishment of
a monitoring committee consisting of U.S., France, Israel,
Lebanon and Syria to monitor implementation of the understandings.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. secretary of state pointed out that the
understandings will not be "a substitute" for peace agreements
between Israel and Lebanon and Syria, but lead to resumption of
peace talks between them.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of residents have fled towns and villages
both in southern Lebanon and northern Israel since the Israeli
military operation against Hezbollah targets started on April
11.
</P>
<P>
Israel stressed that the military operation, code-named
Operation Grapes of Wrath, was aimed at stopping Hezbollah
Katyusha rockets attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Katyushas continued to fire into Israel throughout
today, the 16th day of the operation, injuring two people
and causing several damages in the northern town of Kiryat
Shmona.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel Air Force (IAF) warplanes and artillery also
went on with their strikes against Hezbollah positions today in
southern Lebanon, before the ceasefire was formally announced.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 Lebanese civilians have been killed and over 300
others wounded in the Israeli strikes against Hezbollah, which
once reached deep into the suburbs of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official estimated that the operation had cost the
Israeli economy at least 100 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Uri Dromi, government spokesman, said earlier this week the
initial estimate includes lost work days, damaged property,
handling of thousands of evacuees, decreased tourism, and various
other indirect costs of the operation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Income and Property Tax authorities,
Katyushas have caused 7 million U.S. dollars in direct
property damage and another 17 million in indirect damage.

HARARE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert

free market economy and will take further measures to liberalise
the investment climate.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 37th Zimbabwe International Trade Fair in

protect local industry from unfair competition and prevent
dumping of cheap products.

<HEADLINE> Greece Draws Draft Law to Combat Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Greek cabinet today examined a
draft law to combat unemployment and create more jobs in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, entitled "Policy Measures on Employment,
Education and Training," provides for the setting up of a fund for
employment and vocational training at the Manpower Employment
Organization (OAED).
</P>
<P>
The scheme will require funds totaling approximately 220
billion drachmas (about 960 million U.S. dollars) which will be
secured from the state budget, European Union funds and the OAED
as well as the public investment program.
</P>
<P>
The new legislation will also gradually introduce the so-called
"employment card" for workers in Greece. The aim of the card
will be to "map" and modernize the labor market.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the unemployed will be given "monthly work
coupons" which they will be able to either cash in for
unemployment benefit or deposit with employees as an incentive for
hiring them for a minimum period of nine months.
</P>
<P>
Another innovation is a scheme which will provide financial
incentives to large companies wishing to implement training
programs for the unemployed, with the obligation to hire at least
30 percent of those so trained.
</P>
<P>
Incentives will also be given to employers to provide jobs and
practical training to young, unemployed graduates.
</P>
<P>
The draft law also includes the provision for the formation of
an inter-ministerial "Special Studies Committee" to examine the
problem of immigrant workers. at the same time, an "aliens"
temporary residence card" and a "limited residence card" will
be introduced.
</P>
<P>
The rate of unemployment in Greece currently stands at about 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> LSE to Delay Issuing Trading Reform Blueprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The Board of the London Stock
Exchange (LSE) agreed Thursday to delay issuing detailed plans for
its proposed electronic trading system by a few weeks to allow
more time to clear the new system's rules with regulators.
</P>
<P>
LSE officials said that the final trading framework would still
be ready by August as planned although the plans will not be
issued for consultation until June.
</P>
<P>
The board insisted that it remained on track to introduce its
new order-matching system by spring next year, although initially
only FT-SE 100 stocks will be covered.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, which followed Thursday's monthly board
meeting, comes two days after John Bridgeman, the director general
of the Office of Fair Trading, warned he would not tolerate an
indefinite delay.
</P>
<P>
The LSE is keen to settle various regulatory matters with the
Treasury and the Securities and Investments Board before issuing
its second consultation document.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the LSE wants to discuss the various privileges
enjoyed by marketmakers, including exemption from stamp duty and
the right to delay publishing certain large trades.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have all the answers before we go public," said
Giles Vardey, the LSE's director of market development and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
In the new system, orders will be entered on a central
electronic order book, and automatically executed when buyers and
sellers match.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, marketmakers quote prices on a
central Exchange screen but deals are struck separately over the
telephone after negotiation.

<HEADLINE> S. African Govt Urged To Intervene Into Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The South African Chamber
of Business today urged for an urgent meeting with President
Nelson Mandela to discuss the local currency Rand crisis
following its depreciation.
</P>
<P>
"Such a meeting would hopefully help to identify measures that
will be confidence-building," said Rudi Heine, president of the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
However, President Mandela has made it clear earlier in the
day that the government woill not intervene into the matter
because it is carrying out a free market currency policy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at his presidential residence in
Pretoria, Mandela said he is confident no Rand Crisis existed,
saying it is not the first time that the Rand plunged.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reiterated that South Africa has a very competent
finance minister, who is Trevor Manuel, and a smart Reserve Bank
Governor, who is Chris Stals.
</P>
<P>
"They have briefed me and they are quite confident the Rand is
going to firm," said the President, adding it should be kept in
mind that the U.S. Dollar has also firmed against many other
world currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Rand, which had been on the decline for the last few
weeks, plunged to a new record low of 4.4375 against the U.S.
Dollar on Wednesday in the local financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Heine said while several economical fundamentals are still
positive, there are three important factors for the present loss
of confidence which the market are reflecting. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- Fears over the extent to which the final constitution will
protect property rights and the balance of power in industrial
relations;
</P>
<P>
-- The proposed one-day national strike by the Congress of
South African Trade Unions on April 30 protesting against the
lock-out clause included in the bill of the final constitution;
</P>
<P>
-- Uncertainty and violence surrounding the forthcoming local
government elections in the strife-torn Province of Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
"The collapse of the Rand against all major currencies will
impact negatively on this country's growth prospects in the
future unless the government takes further steps to regain the
confidence of the markets quickly," said Heine.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs John
Kornblum held talks here today with Cypriot officials on the
latest development of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum described his meeting today with President Glafcos
Clerides as "very detailed, friendly and positive," saying he
briefed the president on his talks in Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
"We had a good run-through of issues," he said, adding that it
was "extremely useful for me. It gave me a very good background
for my further discussions."
</P>
<P>
The American official reiterated that he is here "to listen
and to learn to form an impression about what is possible and what
needs to be done and what the difficulties and opportunities are."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the meeting, government spokesman Yiannakis
Cassoulides said the purpose of kornblum's visit was "to be
briefed on the government positions," adding "there is nothing
new."
</P>
<P>
Kornblum also met with Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides
today for talks on the Cyprus problem, European issues and
bilateral relations between the U.S. and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides described the talks as "useful" and noted that "it
was of a clearly fact-finding nature but it signals the
preparation for an initiative on the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
"We were given the opportunity to set out our position that any
effort on Cyprus should be based on an overall settlement of the
problem and the finding of common ground on the basic issues," the
minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum was accompanied by Carey Cavanaugh, Director of the
Office of Southern European Affairs at the State Department, and
the State Department Special Coordinator for Cyprus Jim Williams
on the visit to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He arrived here Thursday after his visits to Ankara and Athens,
in a bid to probe the possibilities of achieving progress toward
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
After his meetings with officials of Cyprus Republic, he is
expected to cross into the Turkish-controlled northern part of
the island to meet Turkish Cypriot representatives.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum stated upon his arrival that 1996 offers a "unique
opportunity" to move toward a solution to the Cyprus problem,
which has remained unsolved despite the U.N. and international
peace efforts for the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Releases Funds For Repatriation Of Togolese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today released a 9.1 million U.S.
Dollars in its operation today to repatriate 100,000 Togolese
refugees remaining in Ghana and Benin.
</P>
<P>
According to a UNHCR press release reaching here today, the
International Organisation for Migration (IOM) is UNHCR's
implementing partner in the project.
</P>
<P>
It said an initial group of 9,000 refugees began departing
from Ghana in the operation which is expected to last for the
next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Each Togolese returnee received a three-month food ration and
a 50 U.S. Dollar grant for transport and household utensils.
</P>
<P>
The returnees are expected to make their own arrangements to
go back to Togo while the UNHCR and the IOM are providing
transport for the sick and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The report said most of the 75,000 Togolese refugees in Ghana
and the 26,000 in Benin are returning to Lome, capital of Togo.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 Togolese refugees fled army abuses in 1993.
Most of them who went to Benin stayed with local families, while
others were accommodated in the reception centers of the Ghanian
government.
</P>
<P>
Other refugees are also settled in villages near the Togolese
border and in UNHCR camps.
</P>
<P>
Since the promulgation of an amnesty law in in Togo in
December 1994, some 200,000 of the refugees have returned to Togo
spontaneously.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR opened an office in Lome last December to oversee the
repatriation operation in collaboration with the Togolese
government.

would put an end to their 16-day artillery exchanges in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the agreement would also
enable Syria and Israel to sit again at the negotiation table on
the stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced the
ceasefire agreement at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ceasefire Understanding Achieved Between Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A ceasefire agreement of
understanding was finally reached today to end the fighting
between Israel and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in
southern Lebanon following intensive diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held here by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and French
 Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Hariri announced at 6:00
p.m. (15:00 GMT) today that the truce will take effect at 4:00
a.m. (01:00 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Lebanese people have been killed, hundreds of
others wounded in the Israeli bombardment since Israel's
"Operation Grapes of Wrath" started on April 11. Nearly half a
million Lebanese civilians were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told reporters the countries concerned have agreed to
form a monitoring committee to make sure that the ceasefire
understanding would be honored.
</P>
<P>
The committee will consist of the United States, France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mechanism that will ensure nobody will violate the
understanding," the Lebanese prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced hope that all the parties concerned would work
hard to achieve peace in the region "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"But now we have to see what is happening in the south, to see
the displaced to return home and to see the cease-fire be
implemented at 4 o'clock Saturday morning," said Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Despite the announcement of the ceasefire understanding, the
Israeli warships in the Mediterranean waters were still shelling
the main coastal road this afternoon, cutting off links between
the Lebanese capital Beirut and the south of the country. The
shelling could be heard every three minutes around 6:30
p.m. local time (15:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At the Lebanese port city of Sidon, some 43 kilometers south of
Beirut, most of the shops were open and more people were on street
than in the previous days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Aisa, a worker, told Xinhua that he was happy to hear the
news of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"Thank Allah, peace comes at last," he said, adding that in
the past two weeks, he was in panic and never slept well.
</P>
<P>
"The windows in my house were shattered by the Israeli
shelling," he added.
</P>
<P>
At Sidon Official Secondary Elementary School for Girls where
318 refugees were taking shelter, Hadia Sabaa Eini, the
principal, cautiously welcomed the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy because a ceasefire was achieved at last, I am
cautious because I don't know the specific terms of the ceasefire
understanding," she said to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
All the displaced civilians in the school had watched the live
broadcast of Hariri's press conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A refugee named Darweish Darweish told reporters that his
17-member family will leave the school for home at 4:00
a.m. Saturday, when the ceasefire takes effect.
</P>
<P>
He was a farmer at Al Klaila village in Sour, some 85
kilometers south of Beirut. His house had been destroyed by the
Israeli bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Mariyan Abdallah, 65, told Xinhua that she wants to go home
tomorrow and live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
"But only Allah knows how can I live," she said and began to
weep. Her four sons and one daughter-in-law had died in the
Israeli shelling of a U.N. peacekeeping force post in the southern
Lebanese town of Kana last Thursday.

Some 110 Lebanese civilians were killed and 100 others wounded
near Kana last Thursday.

<P>
Security sources said that an Israeli bomb-fighter fired
missiles at the road linking Sidon and the southern market town of
Nabatiyeh at 7 p.m. (16:00 GMT), only one hour after the
announcement of the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The missile caused a hole of five meters in diameter on the
road. The bomb site was about 25 kilometers southeast of Sidon. A
BMW car was hit and no reports of casualties were available. The
traffic between Sidon and Nabatiyeh was cut off.
</P>
<P>
Nabatiyeh, some 75 kilometers southeast of Beirut, is a small
town near the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in southern
Lebanon.

<P>
When journalists were driving on their way from Beirut to the
southern port city of Sour this evening, the Israeli shelling
could still be heard sporadically.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-president Godfrey
Miyanda today warned some donor countries against interference in
Zambian internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally in Northern Province, Miyanda said
Zambia appreciated assistance from donor countries, but they
should not use the aid as means to interfere in Zambia's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome suggestions, advices and help from others, but the
final decision on national issues should be made by ourselves
only," Miyanda said.
</P>
<P>
Relations between donors and recipient countries should be
a partnership, never that of masters and servants, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Britain and a few other western donors
have held their assistance to Zambia in attempts to force the
African country to adopt the controversial constitutional
amendment bill by a constituent assembly or national

spokesman today praised his country's efforts in leading to the
ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
He said Syrian President Hafez al-Assad had held several
meetings with Lebanese leaders since the start of the Israeli
bombardment on south Lebanon on April 11.
</P>
<P>
For more than a week, al-Assad had also held intensive
consultations with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher,
leading to the ceasefire agreement to be effective early Saturday

ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Pro-Islamic groups today staged
protests in Ankara and Istanbul against the killing of Dzhokhar
Dudayev, leader of breakaway Chechnya of Russia, after the holy
Friday prayer.
</P>
<P>
Necmettin Erbakan, Chairman of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) and Alparslan Turkes, leader of the Nationalist Movement
Party (MHP), attended a special funeral prayer for Dudayev at
Kocatepe mosque, the biggest mosque in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of protesters held a march along the
city's main boulevard and arrived at the parliament building. They
shouted slogans such as "Chechnya will be a grave for Russia" and
"Martyrs never die."
</P>
<P>
There are millions of Caucasus-origin people living in Turkey
who sympathize with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent troops and tanks into breakaway Chechnya in
December 1994 to crush Dudayev's independence drive. There has
been no sign of an early end to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Dudayev was killed by air-launched rockets as he spoke by
satellite telephone to a Russian member of parliament on Sunday
night. The Russian forces in Chechnya have denied involvement in
the strike against Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, demonstrations reportedly took place in a number
of districts today. The demonstrators also shouted slogans
supporting Hezbollah, or Party of God, and in protest of the
Israeli attacks in Lebanon.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Contact Group on Liberia Meets in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-initiated international
contact group on Liberia held its first meeting here today to
assess the situation in Liberia and to study how the international
community can help restore peace in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was chaired by U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State George Moose, and attended by representatives from Belgium,
Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS), the Organization of African Unity, the United
Nations and the European Commission also attended the meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the meeting, the contact
group identified three issues critical to peace in Liberia:
restoring security to the capital city of Monrovia, reinforcing
the West African peacekeeping force in Liberia and encouraging
faction leaders to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction with the plan to hold a meeting of
the ECOWAS in Accra, Ghana, on May 7-8 and affirmed their hope
that the meeting would achieve significant progress toward a
permanent peace in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The group also appealed to the donor nations which had made
pledges for the peace process in Liberia at the U.N.-sponsored
Conference on Liberia in New York in October 1995 to redeem them
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they noted that the ability of the international
community to continue to assist, including the provision of
humanitarian aid to the victims of the conflict, would depend on
the re-establishment of suitable conditions inside the country.
</P>
<P>
In that context, the group deplored the wholesale looting of
vehicles and other equipment of aid agencies by factions in
Monrovia and called for their immediate return by faction leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming visit to Egypt by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin will be of special importance in
consolidating friendship and cooperation between the two
countries, Egyptian Deputy Premier Youssef Wali has said.
</P>
<P>
Wali, also President of the Egyptian-Chinese Friendship
Association, made the statement in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president will visit Egypt in the middle of next
month to promote relations between China and Egypt, which
established diplomatic ties 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wali, also Minister of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, said
that the visit will afford an opportunity to exchange viewpoints
and experiences on the economic reforms currently underway in the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that bilateral economic cooperation will be
boosted.
</P>
<P>
The visit, he added, will also afford an opportunity for the
leaders of the two countries to discuss various international
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Wali stressed that Egypt and China hold identical views on a
majority of international issues.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian official said in the interview that mutual respect
and peaceful coexistence have always prevailed in the
Egyptian-Chinese relations, which he described as "deep-rooted."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is particularly interested in
the development of relations between Egypt and China in all
fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wali said that Egyptian-Chinese relations are steadily and
firmly developing, particularly in the economic field which is the
central axis of international relations at the present stage.
</P>
<P>
On Egypt's role in the Middle East peace process, Wali said
that his country is making efforts for a just and comprehensive
peace, calling on Israel to withdraw completely from the
territories it occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israel to respect the Palestinian people's
right to self determination.
</P>
<P>
On Egypt's economic reform, he said that it has fully
liberalized Egyptian agricultural economies.
</P>
<P>
Wali said the forthcoming stage of the economic reform would
focus on increasing investment in all fields of production and
services.

<HEADLINE> US President Signs Final Spending Bill Into Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton signed
the final 1996 federal spending bill into law today, about seven
months after the U.S. fiscal year began on October 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
It marked the ending of months of the U.S. partisan struggle
over the budget which had resulted in two partial government
shutdowns, the longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The bill would provide 159 billion U.S. dollars to finance nine
Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies, which had been
operating under one or another stopgap spending bills in the past
seven months, for the five months left in fiscal 1996.
</P>
<P>
With broad support from both parties, the U.S. Senate approved
the bill with a vote of 88-11 Thursday after the House of
Representatives voted it with 399-25.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and Republican-controlled Congress
eliminated their difference over the budget Wednesday after two
days' closed-door negotiations.
</P>
<P>
With this fall's president election as their goal, both sides
claimed victory over the budget battle which lasted several
months and shut the government down for 27 days.
</P>
<P>
Even before the U.S. Congress had finished with the bill
Thursday, President Clinton appeared in the White House briefing
room to laud it as "a real victory."
</P>
<P>
"The American people... know that I cannot claim full credit
for a bill that goes through a Congress that is majority
Republican," said Clinton, who's running for re-election as the
kind of Democrat who can work well with Republicans but at the
same time curb their excesses.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that they forced Republicans to reorder spending
priorities to provide more money for education, environmental
protection, job training and other domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
But Republicans also claimed a win because the bill is the
culmination of a 1996 budget process that saved 20 billion
dollars, according to Congressional Budget Office figures.
</P>
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich called it "a remarkable
achievement" given that "we have a liberal president trying to get
more spending and trying to get more bureaucracy."

<HEADLINE> Iranian Ambassador Criticizes Turco-Israeli Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Ambassador to Turkey told
reporters here today that his country was unhappy with the
Turco-Israel military training accord and Iranian President Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani would discuss the issue with his Turkish
counterpart Suleyman Demirel next month.
</P>
<P>
Demirel is scheduled to attend a ceremony in Mashhad, Iran on
May 12 to mark the completion of a railway linking Europe to China
through Central Asia, or the "new silkroad railway."
</P>
<P>
Last week, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayeti visited
Ankara and brought the invitation to President Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Ambassador Muhammad Reza Bagheri said another aim of
Velayeti's visit was to discuss the recent Turco-Israel military
agreement which permits Israeli war planes to use Turkish air
space for training purpose.
</P>
<P>
"Turkish officials said that this accord is not against any
one but Velayeti was not satisfied and convinced," said Bagheri.
</P>
<P>
That's why president Demirel has decided to send a written
message very soon to Rafsanjani on this issue, which is expected
to be taken during his visit to Iran, the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that like other Moslem countries, Iran was very
sensitive about the military accord and warned of harm to Turkey
from close ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept Israel planes near our border. We cannot
accept Zionist planes snooping against us," said Bagheri.

WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. law enforcement agents
today uncovered a bomb plotted by a militia group and arrested two
people after raiding their homes in central Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The bomb plot has no connection with the Olympic Games, federal
officials told the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"This is a couple of militia types who built things that can be
made into pipe bombs, but we have no information of any plan to
use them for the Olympics" Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern
said.
</P>
<P>
The two members of a small militia group were arrested on
charges of conspiracy and possession of unregistered explosive
devices in Georgia, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
The two arrested were identified as Robert Starr, who owns an
electrical company in Macon, Ga., and William James McCranie Jr.,
a plumber who lives in Crawford County, Ga., and works in Macon.
</P>
<P>
An informant told Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) agents
April 5 that he had attended a meeting with McCranie, Starr and
others at which McCranie talked about blowing up a bomb on his
property and said he had enough chemicals to make 40 bombs, the
Associated Press said quoting an affidavit filed in federal court
by ATF agent Brad Donnelly.
</P>
<P>
Stern identified the group as the Georgia Republic Militia and
said it is believed to have 11 to 15 members and the two men
arrested are leaders of that group.

<HEADLINE> Sunlight Breaks Down Mercury from Water, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have discovered
that sunlight breaks down mercury compounds in water, a finding which
is touted as having global implications for treating
mercury-contaminated waters in a natural way.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the University of Manitoba and the Freshwater
Institute of Winnipeg report in the latest issue of the British
journal Nature that when bottles containing a mixture of methylmercury
and lake water were exposed to sunlight, there was dramatic decrease
in the amount of mercury compound.
</P>
<P>
Methylmercury is a molecule in which mercury, carbon and hydrogen
are bound together. It poses danger to human beings because it easily
enters the food chain, and excess amount of it can result in the loss
of muscular functions, blindness and birth defects.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that a week's worth of sunlight lowered the amount
of methylmercury in the water anywhere from 40 to 66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Until this experiment, scientists had believed that microbes alone
broke down methylmercury in lake water, according to today's Globe and
Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The sunlight would seem to operate 350 times faster than the
previously known microbial process, it said.
</P>
<P>
After it has been degraded by sunlight, scientists believe a
volatile form of the mercury goes into the air. While this would
eventually return to earth as part of rain or snow, only 10 percent of
it would eventually return to its methylmercury form. The rest would
be bound up in soil and not enter the food chain.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Hezbollah Reach Ceasefire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 26 (Xinhua) -- A ceasefire agreement of
understanding was finally achieved today to end the 16-day-old
fighting between Israel and the guerrillas of pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held here by Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Al-Hariri, Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Hariri announced at 6:00
p.m. (15:00 GMT) today that the truce will take effect at 4:00
a.m. (01:00 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 Lebanese people have been killed and hundreds of
others wounded in the Israeli bombardment since Israel's
"Operation Grapes of Wrath" started on April 11. Nearly half a
million Lebanese civilians were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Hariri told reporters that the countries concerned have agreed
to form a monitoring committee to make sure that the ceasefire
understanding will take effect.
</P>
<P>
The committee will consist of the United States, France, Syria,
Lebanon and Israel, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a mechanism that will ensure nobody will violate the
understanding," the Lebanese prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that all the parties concerned would work hard
to achieve peace in the region "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"But now we have to see what is happening in the south, to see
the displaced return home and to see the ceasefire be implemented
at 4 o'clock Saturday morning, in 10 hours from now," Hariri told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that Hezbollah guerrillas have the right to fight
against Israel's occupation of Lebanese territories as long as the
occupation exists.
</P>
<P>
"But they don't have the right to use civilian villages to
launch rockets at Israeli territories," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ceasefire understanding was aimed to "avoid
the escalation" of military actions in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody violates the understanding, there will be a
procedure to deal with the violation," he added.
</P>
<P>
After the press conference, Hariri held an extraordinary
cabinet session this evening to discuss the current situation.
</P>
<P>
Despite the announcement of the ceasefire, Israeli warships in
the Mediterranean waters were still shelling the main coastal road
in Lebanon this afternoon, cutting off links between Beirut and
the south of the country. The shelling could be heard every three
minutes around 6:30 p.m. local time (15:30 GMT).
</P>
<P>
At the Lebanese port city of Sidon, some 43 kilometers south of
Beirut, most of the shops were open and more people were in the
street than in the previous days.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Aisa, a worker, told Xinhua that he was happy to hear the
news of a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"Thank Allah, peace came at last," he said, adding that in the
past two weeks, he was in panic and never slept well.
</P>
<P>
"The windows of my house were shattered by the Israeli
shelling," he added.
</P>
<P>
At Sidon Official Secondary Elementary School for Girls where
318 refugees were seeking shelter, Hadia Sabaa Eini, the
principal, welcomed the ceasefire cautiously.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy because a ceasefire was achieved at last, I am
cautious because I don's know the specific terms of the ceasefire
understanding," she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
All the displaced civilians in the school had watched the live
broadcast of Hariri's press conference late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A refugee named Darweish Darweish told reporters that his
17-member family will leave the school for home at 4:00
a.m. Saturday, when the ceasefire takes effect.
</P>
<P>
He was a farmer at Al Klaila village near the southern port
city of Sour, some 85 kilometers south of Beirut. His house had
been destroyed in the Israeli bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Mariyan Abdallah, 65, told Xinhua that she wants to go home
Saturday and to live a normal life.
</P>
<P>
"But only Allah knows how can I live," she said and began to
weep. Her four sons and one daughter-in-law had died in the
Israeli shelling of a U.N. peacekeeping force post in the southern
Lebanese town of Kana last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 110 Lebanese civilians were killed and 100 others
wounded near Kana last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that an Israeli bomb-fighter fired
missiles at the road linking Sidon and the southern market town of
Nabatiyeh at 7 p.m. (16:00 GMT), only one hour after the
announcement of the ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The missile caused a hole of five meters in diameter on the
road. The bomb site was about 25 kilometers southeast of Sidon. A
BMW car was hit and there have been no reports of casualties. The
traffic between Sidon and Nabatiyeh was cut off.
</P>
<P>
Nabatiyeh, some 75 kilometers southest of Beirut, is a small
town near the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
When journalists were driving on their way from Beirut to the
southern port city of Sour this evening, the Israeli shelling
could still be heard sporadically. One shell just exploded near
Xinhua correspondents' car. Fortunately, there was no damage to
the car and nobody was hurt.

<HEADLINE> UN Human Rights Commission Ends 52nd Session in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The UN Commission on Human Rights
concluded its 52nd session Friday afternoon after six weeks of
meetings and the adoption of more than 100 of resolutions and
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures agreed upon, the Commission called for the
establishment of an expert group to develop a strategy for
promoting the right to development. It was also agreed to create
an open-ended working group to develop policy guidelines for
economic structural adjustment programmes and their effects on
economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The Commission also adopted resolutions to appoint a special
rapporteur to study situations of systematic rape and sexual
slavery during armed conflicts and agreed to hold a seminar of
experts to develop guidelines on the subject on forced evictions.
</P>
<P>
An important trend evident during the meetings was the mounting
opposition of developing countries to the Western pursuit of power
politics through confrontation and applying double standard in
human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
They called on the Commission to promote human rights through
cooperation, dialogue and consensus instead of by confrontational
approaches such as by passing a resolution against any specific
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commission this time still adopted a number of
country resolutions, most of them were drafted by Western
countries against developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Supported by most of the developing countries, China succeeded
in blocking a vote on a draft resolution against it co-sponsored
by the United States, the European Union and some other western
countries. A no-action motion tabled by China was carried by 27 to
20 votes with 6 abstentions on April 23.
</P>
<P>
The Commission session also discuss human rights situation in
some hot-spot regions, such as Burundi and southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a special meeting on the situation in Burundi, the
Commission urged the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jose
Ayala-Lasso to increase immediately the number of human rights
observers dispatched to the country.
</P>
<P>
On southern Lebanon, a resolution was adopted calling upon
Israel to put an immediate end to the bombardment of civilian
targets and to release all Lebanese citizens abducted and
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,000 delegates from 53 member states and some 70
non-member states, as well as from non-governmental organizations
have attended the six-week session at the UN Office in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Manitoba Jail Riot Ends Without Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- After a day of rioting, the
Headingley jail in Canada's Manitoba Province is now back to the
hand of prison officials and police, with no death reported.
</P>
<P>
The rampage ended last night when the remaining inmates gave
themselves up to police, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
Police cars were seen moving toward the prison and ambulances
bringing up the injured inmates to the nearest hospitals in
Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba province.
</P>
<P>
Many of the inmates had been badly beaten. As the lights began
to fade, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed that they had
regain control of the jail.
</P>
<P>
The jail riot began suddenly on Thursday night as prisoners
began to attack each other and guards. They set part of the prison
on fire and caused extensive damages inside.
</P>
<P>
There were 321 prisoners in Manitoba's largest jail, the
Headingley Correctional Institute outside Winnipeg, when the riot
started. The institute houses convicts serving sentences of less
than two years for crimes such as theft and assault.
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Vodrey, justice minister of the Manitoba province,
said her department will investigate what caused the riot and how
it was handled. She also wants the ring leaders punished.
</P>
<P>
"It is my firm expectation that those responsible will be
brought to justice and they will be dealt with with the full force
of the law," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports from prison guards suggested that an inmate had
been killed and another had been castrated, and the police now
said that none of that is true. However, they did say that at
least one prisoner had his fingers cut off in the riot.
</P>
<P>
Police said there are rival gangs in the prison, but this
uprising appeared to target prisoners who are segregated for sex
crimes or because they are informants.

<HEADLINE> Trip From Beijing to Great Wall Now Much Easier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The traffic snarls from Beijing's
city limits to the popular Great Wall and Ming Tombs will be
improved a lot after a new highway is completed this year,
according to a construction official.
</P>
<P>
Thirty percent of the work on the 31.2-km highway, on the
Madian-Changping section of the Badaling Expressway, has been
completed, said Cong Shijie, who is in charge of the project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the project, which started in January, has gone
well and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The highway is a state key project involving a total investment
of 1.98 billion yuan (about 240 million US dollars), and will
shorten the traveling time between Beijing and Changping, from
more than an hour to 20 minutes, and the time between Beijing and
the Great Wall at Badaling from nearly two hours, to 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Cong said that 450,000 vehicles use the Madian-Changping route
every day, and the number climbs as high as 700,000 on busy days.
</P>
<P>
The Madian-Changping road is the fifth highway Beijing has
built in recent years. Beijing has a total length of 11,811 km in
highways, and a density that ranks first in all cities in
China.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Economic Ministers from the
seven Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed the
Agreement for the ASEAN Industrial Cooperation (AICO) Scheme at
the end of the Third ASEAN Economic Ministers Retreat here today.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released after the signing ceremony,
the AICO Scheme aims to increase intra-ASEAN regional industrial
cooperation by encouraging investment from ASEAN and non-ASEAN
sources.
</P>
<P>
It provides an institutional framework within which the ASEAN
private sectors may collaborate on the basis of mutual and
equitable benefits, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the scheme also aims to increase resource sharing
among the ASEAN members, foster closer ASEAN economic integration
as well as enhance the technology base, economies of scale and the
competitiveness of the ASEAN industries.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members include Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Brunei, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"The main privilege of the scheme is to enable the
participating companies to enjoy the preferential tariff rates of
0-5 percent immediately upon approval," the statement said, adding
that this is equivalent to an accelerated ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) benefit.
</P>
<P>
The AICO Scheme was endorsed by the ASEAN Heads of Government
and the ASEAN Economic Ministers at the 5th ASEAN Summit in
Bangkok, December last year.
</P>
<P>
This new AICO will replace the existing Brand-to-Brand
Complementation and the ASEAN Industrial Joint Venture Schemes,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa's Debts Should Be Reduced Or </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The volume of world trade rose
by eight percent last year and the combined value of cross border
trade in goods and services broke the six-trillion-dollar mark although
Africa's share of global trade declined to only two percent.
</P>
<P>
The general pace of global development since the last UN
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD 8) has been uneven, with a
number of developing countries, particularly those in Asia, having
sustained the high rates of growth while Latin American nations have
definitely emerged from the debt crisis that had weighed on economic
performance in that region for a decade.
</P>
<P>
However, progress in Africa has been modest, if not too slow.
According to FAO figures, Africa's population grew by three percent
while its per capita growth stood at only 2.2 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Future prospects for Africa are "mixed and uncertain," the
UNCTAD said in a report, with much depending on the evolution of
commodity prices this year as Africa depends mainly on its
exports of minerals, oil and farm products.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD said that African countries as a whole remain
too dependent on primary commodities and are still suffering from "low
productivity, inefficient management, failure to diversify from a
narrow production and export base and vulnerability to external
economic environment."
</P>
<P>
Africa's share of global manufacturing value added (MVA) -- the
yard stick used to measure the manufacturing sector -- was always low.
The MVA of Africa was 0.7 percent in 1975 and it increased to just
0.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, the MVA share of other developing countries on the other
hand, had increased from 1.6 to 5.6 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti has accused developed
countries of double standard, saying, "past experiences indicate that
processed goods from the developing countries have been denied access
to the markets in the developed countries."
</P>
<P>
Africa has been left behind. So African countries and their friends
have strongly called for the establishment of a new and just
international economic order to address this situation.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa's Debts Should Be Reduced Or </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- They have also urged the
international community and the forthcoming UNCTAD 9 Conference
in South Africa to take measures to change this situation and
called on developed countries to reduce or write off Africa's
debts.
</P>
<P>
Africa is heavily in debt, and sub-Saharan Africa's total debt
had reportedly increased from 84 billion to 211 billion US
Dollars, equivalent to 82.8 percent of the region's Gross
National Product (GNP), between l980 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
And servicing such a huge debt is reported to "have greatly sapped
the region's capacity to invest and develop, leading to stagnation and
even regression."
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa's external debt rose by five percent last
year to 223 billion dollars, the World Bank said in its 1996 world
debt tables.
</P>
<P>
"Export growth did not keep pace with the growth of external
debt and many countries in Africa saw their debt-to-export ratios
continue to rise," it said, noting the debt of Cote d'Ivoire, for
instance, has now risen to nearly 600 percent, while Mozambique's
remains more than 1,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
The debt burden in Africa is so chronic that each and every
Zambian citizen, for example, is said to owe his external
creditors 1,000 US Dollars -- roughly three times what an average
Zambian expects to earn in a year.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, there were 16 the least developed countries in
Africa, but now, the World Bank said, 33 African nations have been
classified as severely indebted low-income countries (SILICS).
</P>
<P>
The United Nations in mid March promised to lend 25 billion
Dollars to Africa in ten years beginning 1996. And the World Bank
said it will try to provide 85 percent of the sum.
</P>
<P>
Nontheless, Africa Faith and Justice Network, in its 1995 issue's
papers, said that "sub-Saharan Africa spent more than 110 billion
dollars in debt repayment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the World Bank, commercial banks and the G-Seven governments."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Africa's Debts Should Be Reduced Or </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, Apil 27 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President of the World
Bank for Africa Edward Jaycox said industrialized nations,
especially members of the Paris Club, should act to forgive or
reduce their hard debts lent to African states.
</P>
<P>
The overall goal is to get each affected country's global debt
servicing to under 200 percent of exports, and this is attainable only
if the hard debts are forgiven first, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was revealed that "there are now some 25 African low income,
severely indebted countries whose debt obligations are more than 200
percent of their Gross Domestic Product and much more than their
export earnings."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, liberalized global trade offered bleak prospects for
Africa as cheap imports threaten local industry.
</P>
<P>
For example, cheaper textiles from Asia and second-hand garments
from Europe and the US had nosedived Tanzania's textile output from
30 million square meters of fabric in 1993 to 15.7 million square
meters in 1994, cutting the output nearly in half.
</P>
<P>
Foreign competition caused 12 of Tanzania's 15 state-owned textile
mills to collapse in 1994 and at least 18 textile companies in Zambia
to shut down and three textile manufacturers in Kenya to close their
doors, the newspaper "East African" disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) in an analysis
recently warned that African economies stand to lose around 2.6
billion US Dollars annually with the increasing global
liberalization of world trade.
</P>
<P>
The erosion of trade preferences for commodities such as coffee
and cocoa could be as high as 100 percent, with minerals and metals
also being hit hard, it said.
</P>
<P>
It complained, "the era of special treatments and generous
unilateral trade preferences will soon be over while concessional
resources flows are gradually drying up."
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD also estimated that the value of trade preferences for
developing countries would be substantially reduced, owing to a
general reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
For this, specialists advocate maintaining preferential margins
for developing countries, African states in particular, and
extending generalized system of preferences benefits to
agricultural products, minerals and textiles from those countries
after import quotas were eliminated, in accordance with the
trade agreement. enditem

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Enter China Step by Step: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Yin Jieyan, vice-president of the
People's Bank of China, said that the country will continue to
allow foreign financial institutions to enter the Chinese market,
"in planned and step-by-step manner", during the Ninth Five-Year
Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
This message came at the 16th Annual Session of the
Asia-Pacific Bankers' Club, which was held in Beijing this past
week.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will be made to create conditions for foreign banks to
deal in renminbi, along with national treatment gradually applied
to foreign financial institutions," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are in China 519 offices of overseas
financial institutions and 137 foreign financial businesses,
including 117 foreign bank branches, five Sino-foreign funded
banks, five wholy foreign-funded banks, five foreign-funded
financial firms, four foreign-funded insurance companies and one
Sino-foreign-funded investment bank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign financial institutions, which had 20 billion US
dollars in total assets at the end of last year, have contributed
to the development of China's banking system and services, Yin
said.
</P>
<P>
China's central bank will further expand its contacts with the
outside world to enhance co-operation with foreign organizations,
Yin said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Urges More Foreign Investment in Hi-Tech Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government has
called for more foreign investment in electronics and
telecommunications to help develop high-technology industries in
the country, an official report said here today.
</P>
<P>
If Vietnam is to keep up in the information and communications
age, more funds must come from the government and foreign
investors for high-tech industries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said TV and radio broadcasts should be extended to
cover the entire countryside, a national mobile phone system
should be set up and computerization should be encouraged to
increase precision and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government should give high priority to
developing the Internet to give the country access to a global
database.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam had 25 joint ventures assembling electronic home
appliances, telecommunications equipment and computers in 1994,
with a total investment of 344 million U.S. dollars. In 1995, 12
telecommunications projects worth more than 700 million dollars in
investment were approved.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry in Vietnam has come a long way in
recent years, but remains in its infancy, using outdated
technology. Joint venture factories use manufacturing processes
common in industrialized countries in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's demand for electronic goods is growing steadily,
averaging about 2.5 million TV sets and 2 million cassette
players a year.

exchanges of gunfire between Israeli forces and the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, in which some 200
Lebanese were killed and 400 others wounded.

<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
expressed the hope that a U.N. conference in South Africa will
promote trade and development of the developing countries and help
form a new global economic order.
</P>
<P>
Li, in a message to the 9th U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development which opened in South Africa today, said he hoped the
quadrennial event will contribute to the expansion of world trade
and development, particularly those of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that the gathering will push forward the
South-North dialogue, South-South cooperation and the
establishment of a new international economic order.
</P>
<P>
He said the world economy today is moving toward globalization
and state-to-state relations are getting closer.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the irrational international economic order
remains to be a serious obstacle to the economic development in
the developing countries and the gap between the poor and the rich
further broadened.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, he said, the 15-day conference in
Midrand near Johannesburg is of great importance.
</P>
<P>
China will, as always, attach importance to and support the
U.N. body's work and is ready to work with other countries to lead
a stable and prosperous world economy into the next century, the
Chinese premier added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Overseas Referees or Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Referees are one of the most
frequently talked topics for the sport of soccer in Hong Kong.
Many insiders and fans have blamed some local referees as of low
standard and of making decisions which caused controversy.
</P>
<P>
To stop the situation from deteriorating, the idea of inviting
overseas referees was gradually accepted.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of overseas referees started when the HKFA invited
Japanese FIFA referee Masayoshi Okada for the San Miguel FA Cup
final at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese was hired again for the Senior Shield final last
December, while Thai referee Pirong was invited to officiate this
season's FA Cup final last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Neutral overseas referees were also seen in the Carlsberg Cup
Lunar New Year tournament in February.
</P>
<P>
Viceroy Cup organizers are looking to have overseas referees
for the cup semi-finals and final next month. "We want overseas
referees because the local ones are not good enough," said the
spokesman of the organization.
</P>
<P>
South China and Instant-Dict have proposed inviting an overseas
referee for the league grand final on May 30.
</P>
<P>
But just as the introduction of overseas referees has helped
officiating some matches, it also brought about problems. Some
blamed the increasing inflow of overseas referees has taken away
opportunities from local referees in important domestic matches.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Football Association (HKFA) senior officials have
vowed to stop such inflow.
</P>
<P>
Both HKFA vice-president Veronica Chan Yiu-kam and technical
committee chairman Chan Tam-sun believe that there has been too
many overseas referees.
</P>
<P>
Chan said she would propose the HKFA not allow any more
overseas referees for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the phenomenon is a good sign for them (local
referees)," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Clubs always complain about the standard of local referees.
But the referees can only improve through matches. And it is
because they are inexperienced that we should give them more
opportunities to help them to improve," Chan added.
</P>
<P>
The HKFA technical committee chairman Chan Tam-sun said the
local referees had lost confidence after many requests for
overseas referees.
</P>
<P>
"Local referees are not respected by the clubs and players at
all. Some of the clubs even blamed the referees when they lost,"
said Chan, a FIFA referee instructor.
</P>
<P>
"I support the idea of bringing experienced referees one or two
times a season. Local referees can really learn a lot from these
opportunities. But we can't always have an overseas referee in
local matches."
</P>
<P>
While decreasing overseas referees does help producing more
chances to local referees, the standard of local officiating
remains to be improved, and it poses as a pressing issue.

NANJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's coastal Jiangsu
Province is to resort to the development of marine resources as a
way to enliven local economy.
</P>
<P>
With a coastline of nearly 1,000 km, the province has more than
37,000 sq km of sea areas, along with more than 66,000 ha of
polders, which accounts for one fourth of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to get 150 billion yuan in output value in
the sector by the year 2010, lifting its share of local gross
product from the present 2.3 percent to 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to develop into one of the nation's advanced
coastal areas in the coming 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have decided to allocate five million yuan
each year to exploit local marine resources, and inject 250
million yuan this year to newly develop 10,000 ha polders.
</P>
<P>
In addition to one existing polder development company, the
province will set up three multi-functional development zones in
Lianyungang, Yancheng and Nantong, respectively, to boost the
marine resources industry.

FUZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Construction will start in May on
the 152-km Longyan-Meizhou railway line, connecting Fujian with
Guangdong, which is expected to open to traffic in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are over 5.2 billion tons of proven mineral reserves,
including iron, coal and limestone, 72.9 million cubic meters of
forests, and 130 million bamboo, in the western part of Fujian

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Concludes Fact-Finding Mission in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State John Kornblum left here today after a two-day visit to
Cyprus for exploring possibilities of making headway in the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kornblum held separate meetings with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash to discuss the latest development of the Cyprus problem
following his talks in Ankara and Athens.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure, Kornblum said he found
"everybody" was committed to making headway in bringing forward a
settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy said that Cyprus, located in a region where huge
changes are taking place, cannot remain frozen in a time when the
world around the country is changing.
</P>
<P>
"We will see some further effort not only by us but by others
this year," the U.S. envoy said, but refrained from elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum told a press conference Friday evening that he
believed there is "pragmatic attitude" in Nicosia, Ankara and
Athens toward prospects for a true settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He also believed there is a consensus among the international
community to solve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum said that on his return to Washington he will assess
the impressions he got from his meetings and form a judgement on
how the U.S. can cooperate with the U.N., the European Union and
the parties concerned in helping bring forward the prospects of a
true settlement of the division of this island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops to
take control of one third of the island's territory following a
coup by the Greek Cypriots supporting union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared the
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which
was recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum was newly appointed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as
Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to succeed
Richard Holbrooke who resigned in February.
</P>
<P>
His current regional tour took place following reports that
Washington was planning to launch a fresh initiative on Cyprus in
June in a bid to break the current stalemate in the Cyprus problem
which has remained unsolve despite the U.N. and international
peace efforts in the past 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Hamburger-Loving Girl of 15 Becomes Youngest CJD Victim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A girl of 15 has become Britain's
youngest suspected victim of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the
human equivalent of mad cow disease, which rots the brain.
</P>
<P>
Her doctor last night claimed that she contracted the fatal
disease through eating hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
The girl, from Glasgow, is said to be in very poor condition
in the Institute of Neurosciences at Southern General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC2's Newsnight program, her doctor,
Professor Peter Behan, said that she had the new BSE-pattern
strain of CJD and had only months to live.
</P>
<P>
He added that he believed the girl had picked up the disease
through eating hamburgers. "Her parents have told me she had a
predilection for hamburgers", he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the doctor said that the girl's disease had not been
confirmed since she had only undergone a spinal fluid test, not a
brain biopsy. That, and a post-mortem examination of brain, are the
only ways to confirm a CJD diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The girl is the latest and youngest victim of the new strain of
CJD which was first publicized last month and is thought to be
linked to mad cow disease or bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE).
</P>
<P>
So far there have been 15 reported cases of the new strain of
CJD, which attacks people under 40 and can take a year or more to
kill them. There is no cure for either the new strain or a
previously-diagnosed older strain of CJD, which affects older
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today welcomed the
ceasefire realized Friday between Lebanon and Israel, ending
the latter's 16-day aggression on the small Arab state.

the news on achieving a written understanding on a ceasefire in
Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The source said that while Kuwait welcomed the deal and
expressed its deepest appreciation for the good offices that led
to it, it hoped that the deal would help in reinforcing security
and stability in Lebanon and enable the Lebanese from resuming the
reconstruction of their country.
</P>

The conflict starting april 11 with Israel's bombardment on
Lebanon killed and wounded over 600 people, mostly women and
children, and cost a loss of hundreds of millions U.S. dollars in
material damage.

The written understanding, that was exchanged, but not signed
beteen Lebanon and Israel Friday, was sponsored by U.S. Secretary

SUZHOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A herpetologist is scouring the
world for a suitable partners for a female striped turtle, because
there are only three of the animals in captivity in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Kentang, who is with Suzhou's Railway Teachers' College,
said that only three of the animals are known to be living in
China, the female in the Suzhou Zoo and two in a garden in Suzhou,
a scenic city near Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Zhao explained that, with three turtles, there are just too few
to get them to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
The turtle is found only in the lower reaches of China's
Yangtze River, though there may be a few living in the Yangtze
River or being kept in some zoos outside China, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to institutions with striped turtles for
cooperation in saving the species through the use of artificial
breeding techniques.

<HEADLINE> Anti-"Taiwan Independence" Fight Fruitful: Commentary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people on the
mainland and overseas have scored major achievements in the fight
against separatism and "Taiwan independence", Since June of last
year, a commentary of the Xinhua News Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The achievements will surely have a far-reaching influence in
containing the forces of "Taiwan Independence" and safeguarding
state sovereignty and territorial integrity, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
In reiterating the consistent position of the Chinese Communist
Party and Government on the Taiwan issue, the commentary noted
that the fight against separatism and "Taiwan Independence" since
last June is meant to show to the whole world with actions and, in
a firm and clear-cut manner, that "our determination to safeguard
state sovereignty and territorial integrity remains unshakeable."
</P>
<P>
The fight dealt a severe blow to those openly preaching "Taiwan
independence" on the island, the articale said, pointing out that
Peng Ming-min's defeat last month clearly indicated most people in
Taiwan have come to see that "Taiwan Independence" is nothing but
"a dead end."
</P>
<P>
During this struggle, some Taiwanese authorities attempting to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the
international arena were strongly criticized, with their intention
for separation, rather than reunification, exposed in true colors.
</P>
<P>
Under public pressure, the commentary said, "he had to declare,
on many occasions, his support for reunification and pledge to
improve relations between the two sides of the Taiwan straits."
</P>
<P>
The fight against "Taiwan Independence" won wide-ranging
understanding and support from the justice-holding public opinion
of the world, the commentary said, noting that many countries
believe that no foreign country should interfere in the
reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan straits, which is of
the internal affair of China.
</P>
<P>
Also, many countries hold that the military exercises China
conducted for the purpose of safeguarding state sovereignty are
nothing to find faults with, as China has legal principle on its
side.
</P>
<P>
However, the deployment of naval forces by the United States
during China's military exercises, which was apparently intended
to embolden the Taiwan authorities, exposed the US' real intention
to take Taiwan as "an insinkable aircraft carrier" and to
interfere in China's internal affairs, thus obstructing China's
reunification, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary quoted some Hong Kong and Macao press as saying
that the United States' attempted to renew its gunboat policy
towards China practiced in the past, obviously having forgotten
the historical lesson it learned from interfering in Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements made so far, "our struggle against
separatism and 'Taiwan Independence' will not stop for even a
single day, so long as attempts at creating 'two Chinas,' 'one
China, one Taiwan' or 'Taiwan Independence'" exist for a single
day," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
As for the Taiwan authorities, "we will not only listen to what
they say, but more important, also watch what they do," the
commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of China represents an irreversible
historical trend, which no forces can possibly block, the article
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Goh to Campaign on Vision for Singapore in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong has said that he would be campaigning on the vision for
Singapore in the 21st century at the next General Election, local
television reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the prime minister told Asiaweek
magazine that he intended to build on the vision he set for
Singapore in 1984.
</P>
<P>
On the key issues for the election, which is to be held
sometime before April next year, he said he would approach them
from two angles, namely, issues as seen by the people and those as
seen by the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The issues as seen by the people, Goh said, boiled down to the
daily cost of living. It was aspirations, and not the cost of
living, that were high, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that Singapore had survived because the government's
policy of not subsidizing services other than health, education,
and housing, was right. This was a market-oriented philosophy, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister noted that when costs went up and companies
had to raise prices, and they did so. But the people were
irritated, thinking that the government was taking money from them
and not giving back.
</P>
<P>
The government had to explain the market-oriented philosophy to
the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the government, Goh said, its main concern would be how to
achieve a better home for Singaporeans.

Speaking about the ceasefire agreement reached by Lebanon and
Israel Friday, Velayati said that the conclusion of the talks
between the parties concerned were desirable, adding that "the
result was acceptable to us."
</P>
<P>
He said the recent Israeli aggression proved the legitimacy of
the defenseless people of Lebanon and the Islamic Resistance, the
military wing of Hezbollah, in defending their home country
against aggression and occupation.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah has been leading a guerrilla war to
drive Israeli forces and their client South Lebanon Army
militiamen out of the southern part of Lebanon, the so-called
security zone, established in 1985 to shield Israel's northern
towns from cross-border raids.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister claimed that a new chapter has
been opened in multilateral cooperation among Iran, Lebanon and
Syria with the EU and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"This would help in establishing security and stability in the
whole region," he added.
</P>
<P>
As to the plan introduced by the U.S. Administration, he
noted, it corresponded with the Israeli way and idea, which gave
the privilege to Israel to destroy Hezbollah and its military wing
Islamic Resistance and gave the permission to Israel to attack any
place inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the U.S. plan was rejected by all sides
except Israel.
</P>
<P>
There was another plan introduced by France, which was better
than America's, but it was not desirable.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made a nine-day visit to Lebanon and Syria aimed at
achieving tranquility and peace in Lebanon. He had meetings with
senior Syrian officials, as well as with the foreign ministers of
Russia, Italy and France.

WARSAW, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Poland's National Assembly Friday
approved a new law which guarantees the status of teachers in the
country and gives them better benefits.
</P>
<P>
The law was passed by a vote of 220 to 12 with 83 abstentions
after an almost year-long debate.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Education Jerzy Wiatr said that the new law made
important amendments to the old one.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, teachers have obligations to teach and train
the young people to love their homeland and abide by the
constitution as well as live in harmony with different
nationalities and races.
</P>
<P>
The law also stipulates seven-weeks' annual leave for
teachers. But teachers who are not engaged in teaching for five
years will no longer enjoy their previous benefits.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government will also set up a foundation, under the
ministry of education, for further training of teachers, said
Wiatr.

<HEADLINE> Last 150,000 Peasants in Xi'an to Shed Poverty by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an's 150,000 remaining peasants
are expected to say goodbye to poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Officials have drawn up plans to ensure that the poorly off
peasants will start the 21st century with a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was made in a "help the poor" project which
started this month to help families without enough food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
The peasants, mainly living in mountainous or hilly areas, have
been beset by a single-product economy which brings little profit.
</P>
<P>
The new project aims to broaden the channels of wealth for the
peasants by encouraging them to plant cash trees and engage in
various types of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At a conference on the implementation of the project, 14
companies from Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province in mid-west
China, vowed to help either by providing necessary equipment or
through donations.
</P>
<P>
Since the municipal government launched a "help the poor"
program in 1994, the average annual income of people in 67
underdeveloped townships has jumped to 657 yuan (80 U.S.dollars),
up from 353 yuan in 1994.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Celebrates Second Freedom Day (by Ye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua)-- South Africans together had
made their mark to bring into being one of the truly remarkable
events of this turbulent century, President Nelson Mandela said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the second Freedom Day celebrations in Pretoria,
Mandela said the Freedom Day came at a time when South Africans
were making progress on all fronts to build the country into a
land of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
For generations to come, the abiding image of a patient
citizenry in long voting queues on April 27, 1994 would remain
deeply etched in the collective memory of the nation, said
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
On April 27 two years ago, South Africa started the first
all-race general elections in its history, announcing a birth of
a new democratic nation and marking the death of the apartheid
regime.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations, under the banner of ''unity in diversity'',
included colourful display cultural and religious gatherings
throughout the country for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Mandela stressed that striving for a better
life in the future required all South Africans join hands to
build a climate necessary for the growth and development of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
''Like any truly historic act of creation, this has not been
and will not be easy. But we have the leaders and the collective
wisdom to weather any storms,'' said Mandela, adding all the
projects undertaken thus far had confirmed that success depended
on community initiative and participation.
</P>
<P>
The president added that South Africa affirmed once more a
truism of human history that people are their own liberators.
</P>
<P>
Dignitaries attending the celebrations included United Nations
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Jordanian King Hussein
bin Talal, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa, Switzerland
President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, and senior officials in South
Africa for the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, to be opened officially by Mandela this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply Project for Old Revolutionary Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A project will be launched this
year to solve the water shortage problem for Yan'an, an old
revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving a total investment of 185 million yuan
(about 22 million US dollars), will be built by the Ministry of
Water Conservancy and the province, and is scheduled to be
completed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
At present, the water supply capacity there is only 30,000 tons
daily, half the amount needed. In dry seasons the shortage of
water is particularly acute.
</P>
<P>
Shortage of water has long plagued the daily lives of the
180,000 people of Yan'an, not to mention the city's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The project will divert water from the Wangyao Reservoir, 65 km
from the city's urban area. It includes the construction of a
water pipeline, a water purifying plant, and a water supply network
in the urban district, and improvement of the Fangta Reservoir.

<HEADLINE> From Camel Trains to Freight Trains on Old Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The ancient silk road has created
a boom for the Chinese town of Alataw.
</P>
<P>
The camel trains that once journeyed the silk road have now
been replaced by the iron horse - a thriving railway link.
</P>
<P>
Now the railway station at Alataw Pass, linking China with
Kazakhstan, has become one of the busiest ports of entry into
China as the flow of goods between China and the Commonwealth of
Independent States on the ancient "Silk Road" is on the constant
rise.
</P>
<P>
The station opened in 1991 connecting China with the
"Euro-Asian continental bridge". Now it is capable of handling 3.5
million tons of goods and over 100 rail cars daily.
</P>
<P>
Goods passing through the station this year has been
diversifying from merely fertilizer and steel, to cotton, consumer
electronics, foodstuffs, clothing, machinery and livestock
products.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid growth expected to continue, a new construction
program is in full swing at Alataw station, which has already
drawn about 600 million yuan (72.28 million US dollars) of
investment.
</P>
<P>
The boom of the railway port has turned Alataw from a small
town into a newly-rising city, which has drawn over 200
enterprises from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong to
set up offices in the new railway city.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:  UNCTAD Meets Again To Face Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The ninth session of the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD ) meets in
Midrand, South Africa today to discuss opportunities and challenges
toward the developing countries posed by the Uruguay round.
</P>
<P>
It meets as spectacular technological advances, coupled with
liberation, are moving the world toward the globalized market place
with unprecedented gains in productivity, wealth creation and movement
of capital flows across countries, a UNCTAD press release issued here
said today.
</P>
<P>
However, the promise of growth, development and affluence could
co-exist with the continued deprivation and backwardness of two
billion men and women risking to be excluded from this process.
</P>
<P>
So the challenge before the conference is to reduce the risk of
marginalization of developing countries, African states in
particular, and to help integrate the excluded in the mainstream
of the world economy, said UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubens Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD was set up by the U.N. general assembly as one of its
permanent organs in December 1964. Its role is to promote
international trade, particularly that of developing countries, with a
view to accelerating economic development.
</P>
<P>
Trade and financial liberalization are the hallmarks of the world
economy today. Globalization of economic activity is the direct result
flowing therefrom.
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the temptation is to try to slow down or reverse
these processes. Unemployment in industrialized countries is fuelling
protectionist tendencies, while developing countries which have not
had a head start may face being marginalized in this process.
</P>
<P>
Annual incomes of 550 million people living in the developing
world are less than 300 U.S. Dollars. They live in what the U.N.
calls the "leased developed countries". In the developing world as a
whole, average per capita annual income is below 1,000 U.S.Dollars,
compared with some 22,000 dollars in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
While the responsibility of development lies in the first instance
with the developing countries themselves, it is recognized by all that
their efforts can produce optimal results only if the international
community ensures them access to markets, finance, technology.
and related issues of international economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to UNCTAD figures, in 1995, Africa, with about 12 percent
of the world population, received only 2 percent of world foreign
direct investment and accounted for merely 2 percent of world trade.
</P>
<P>
African countries must make their economies more competitive in
order to meet challenges posed by the Uruguay round, said Kingsley
Amoako, Head of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay round, a set of world trade negotiations started in
1986 and ended in 1993 under the auspices of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, allows for a steady increase in trade
liberalization and a reduction of international tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
The eighth UNCTAD session held in Cartagena, Colombia, in February
1992, identified four priority areas for the four-year period up
to 1996, when the ninth UNCTAD session was to be held. These comprised:
</P>
<P>
1. The realization of a "new international partnership for
development";
</P>
<P>
2. Global interdependence with its objective to strengthen this
interdependence and to reduce global economical imbalances;
</P>
<P>
3. Paths to development; National development experiences are to
be examined with a view to deriving useful lessons to inform future
action, and
</P>
<P>
4. Sustainable Development.

<P>
(by Li Sizhi, Ye Xingzeng)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG,April 27 (Xinhua)-- The UNCTAD favors the
establishment of a new and just international economic order, and
has played an active role in promoting negotiations between the
north and the south and a south-south dialogue.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD is responsible for the Generalized System of
Preferences (GSP), initiated in 1971, whereby a certain
proportion of both agricultural and manufactured goods that are
exported by developing countries receive preferential tariff
treatment by 27 developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, trade amounting to 77,000 million US Dollars was
conducted under the GSP. By mid-1994, 16 schemes were in
operation under the system, benefiting some 160 developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the GATT Uruguay Round Trade
Agreement in April 1994, UNCTAD estimated that the value of trade
preferences for developing countries would be substantially
reduced, owing to a general reduction of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
It advocates maintaining preferential margins for developing
countries and extending GSP benefits to agricultural products and
textiles from those countries after import quotas were
eliminated, in accordance with the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD aims to give particular attention to the needs of the
world's 48 leased developed countries (LDCS), as defined by the
U.N.
</P>
<P>
The eighth session of the conference requested that detailed
analyses of the socio-economic situations and domestic policies
of the LDCS, their resources needs, and external factors
affecting their economies, be undertaken as part of UNCTAD's work
program.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD provides assistance to developing countries in the area
of debt-management, and in seeking debt relief from their
creditors.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD and the World Bank have begun a joint program to extend
technical cooperation to developing countries in the field of
debt management, where UNCTAD is responsible for soft-wave
component of project.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD conference of the heads of state and government
ministers concerned with trade and development,has been held
every four years in different capitals of member states.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD has 188 members, including all the U.N. member states,
and a number of organizations have observer status.

<P>
AMMAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today welcomed the
cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon and expressed the hope that
it will signal the resumption of peace talks between Syria,
Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Marwan Muasher told "Radio Jordan" that he
 hoped the cease-fire would be the base of peace negotiations
that would enable Lebanon to regain its sovereignty over its
territories as stipulated in U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire agreement, which was brokered by the United
States and France to end the 16-day fighting between Israel and
Lebanon, was reached Friday and went into effect as of 4
a.m. (0100GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
During the Israeli bombardment and air raids, more than 200
people, mostly women and children, were killed and about 400
wounded and more than 500,000 displaced from their homes in
south Lebanon, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The truce will be monitored by an international committee
drawn from the U.S., France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, the deal was "not a complete solution", said U.S.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher who hammered out the
cease-fire in seven days of shuttle diplomacy between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his hope that Israel, Lebanon and Syria will resume
their talks soon.

<HEADLINE> Wild Swans Well Cared For in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Rare wild swans have flocked back
to their old home in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Now the graceful birds have found that a local nature reserve
is a safer place to live.
</P>
<P>
The rare swans are well cared for in Xinjiang today, with the
number reaching nearly 6,000 from the original 2,000.
</P>
<P>
In 1980 China established the country's first nature reserve to
provide special protection for swans. Within the reserve shooting
of the rare wild swans is banned, as well as any destructive
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
The regional government adopted effective measures to ensure
the wild swans maintain a high reproduction rate. Xinjiang also
made a comprehensive investigation in 1992 into the migration
habits of the swans. Scientists also studied the reproduction,
habitats, and they collected a large amount of rare and useful
data.
</P>
<P>
During winter seasons staff members scatter enough food in the
reserve for over 1,000 swans, to prevent them from dying of cold
and hunger. And they also set up a breeding center to provide
special protection for sick birds.
</P>
<P>
Ten herdsmen work as voluntary guardians to spread knowledge
and regulations about swan protection among local people, as well
as preventing illegal shooting of the swans.

<HEADLINE> Pudong New Area Top Choice Site For Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, one of
China's major economic development zones, has become a top choice
site for overseas investment in China since its founding in April
1990.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported that the area, a
Singapore-sized zone wedged between Shanghai proper and the East
China Sea, has drawn nearly 10 billion US dollars in overseas
investment in the past six years, with investors coming from 55
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
By last March 3,748 overseas-funded projects have been
established in Pudong, with an agreed overseas investment of 9.85
billion US dollars, compared with only 17 projects and 47 million
US dollars before 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the past six years an average of 1.7 million US dollars in
overseas funds flowed into Pudong each day, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Economic returns for overseas-funded businesses has been rising
along with the surge in overseas investment. Now, overseas-funded
businesses contribute one third of the area's total industrial
output value and half of its newly-added industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the 2,320 overseas-funded businesses already in
operation turned out 56.4 billion yuan in income sales, 4.1
billion yuan in profits and earned foreign exchange totalling 1.64
billion US dollars, growing by 74.6, 17.1 and 57.7 percent,
respectively, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The businesses also paid 1.9 billion yuan in taxes, up by 43.2
percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report analyzed the factors behind the high economic
returns.
</P>
<P>
Many of the projects, especially those in the high- and
new-technology field, are joint ventures between major
transnationals and leading local enterprises with sound business
performances. The 180 businesses in the field yielded an output
value of 12 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
With Shanghai's advantages in talent, the productivity of
overseas-funded businesses in Pudong is higher than those in any
other areas in the country. The present per capita productivity
level is 229,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai-made products are popular throughout China, which
provides those businesses with a vast market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city's efforts to improve Pudong's
infrastructure has created a good environment for business
operations.

towns on each side of the border, which are linked by water,
railway or road.
</P>
<P>
An agreement between China and Russia allows Chinese vessels to
enter the Sea of Japan and the Pacific via the Russian part of the
Heilongjiang River. And since then a Chinese vessel has
transported 3,000 tons of corns from the Jiamusi Port to Japan.

<HEADLINE> Low-Price Stores Welcomed in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A number of low-price shops have
appeared in this, China's largest commercial metropolis, which are
displaying a sharper competitive edge than their numerous
luxurious counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The secret of their success lies not only in low prices but
also in good quality, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A low-price shopping center in the populous Luwan District is a
good example. Covering 2,600 sq m, the outlet deals in daily
necessities that are much less expensive than the market
price. For example, one kg of rice here costs only 3.36 yuan
(0.404 US dollar) while the market price is 3.7 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"We not only promise good prices but also good quality," the
shopping center claims.
</P>
<P>
In suburban Qingpu County there is also such an outlet selling
over 3,000 varieties of commodities at lower prices. Its daily
sales have been kept at about 60,000 yuan since it went into
operation.
</P>
<P>
To ensure good quality, the outlet promises to pay compensation
ten times higher than the original price for any counterfeit
commodity discovered by customers.
</P>
<P>
These stores usually rely on lowering the costs to offer
relatively low prices by measures, such as renting less-expensive
sites and by running production bases of their own.

<P>
SHANGHAI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Pudong has emerged as a new
commercial center of this, China's largest metropolis, after two
years of construction.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of tall commercial buildings have already sprung up in
this new area in the eastern bank of the Huangpu River, in
parallel with luxurious shops in the famous Nanjing Road and
upbeat financial offices on the Bund, on the western bank.
</P>
<P>
These new properties housing leading domestic and overseas
retailers and major Chinese and foreign banks and trust and
investment companies helped push the retail sales of the new area
to 11.02 billion yuan (about 1.327 billion US dollars)-worth in
1995, which accounted for one ninth of the municipality's total,
while the population of Pudong makes up one sixth of the total.
</P>
<P>
One of them, the Shanghai Shangye Cheng (Commercial City), has
become a symbol of the modernization of Shanghai's traditional
commercial sector.
</P>
<P>
Covering 14.5 ha, and with a total floor space of 800,000 sq m,
the city accommodates 18 office buildings with an average height
of 20 stories along a 600-m-long ring road. The high-rises
surround a 10,000-sq-m park.
</P>
<P>
Under an ambitious plan the Pudong commercial area will
eventually have five groups of buildings: an international
commercial exhibition center, a shopping and service center, a
commercial plaza, a comprehensive commercial city and a
supermarket center.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Stresses Need for Turkish Shift on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
has urged the U.S. to launch a peace initiative directed at
changing of Turkish position on the fundamental aspects of the
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday night to mark his three years in office,
President Clerides warned that "there must be some change in
Ankara's position on the fundamental issues that make up the
Cyprus problem. Otherwise, it might be better if this effort
were not to take off the ground."
</P>
<P>
"We want Ankara to outline specifically its position on
basic issues such as the demilitarization of Cyprus and the
guarantees of a future federal Cyprus," the president said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. initiative, combined with European
moves and other proposals, "will be a very serious event".
</P>
<P>
The President was referring to a fresh initiative on Cyprus,
expected to be launched by the U.S. in June in a bid to break the
current stalemate over the Cyprus problem, which has remained
unsolved despite the U.N. and international peace efforts for the
past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said a failure would create the impression that
the Cyprus question cannot be resolved. This in turn could
have other repercussions.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his forthcoming meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, scheduled for mid-June, the Cypriot President said he
does not expect to discuss in detail how fundamental issues
could be settled.
</P>
<P>
"I will reiterate my belief that we cannot reach a Cyprus
settlement unless the two communities feel their future secure,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the appointment of a new U.N. chief's special
representative for Cyprus, a former Foreign Minister of the
Republic of Korea, Han Sung Joo, President Clerides said "we
do not object to Han's appointment because of his origin."
</P>
<P>
"The fact that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros Ghali has
 chosen him indicates that Ghali has full confidence in
him. Mr. Han is a distinguished academic, considered to be an
independent individual," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ghali has announced the appointment of Han Sung Joo as his
special representative for Cyprus, effective on May 1, to succeed
former Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark who has served as
special representative for Cyprus since may of 1993.
</P>
<P>
Summing up his policies, the Cypriot President said his
government would continue to strengthen the economy, upgrade the
Republic's defense and stand firm on its European orientation
through promoting Cyprus' bid for membership of the European
Union.

<HEADLINE> Australian Parliamentary Brawls Set to Have Calm Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The 38th federal parliament of
Australia is to open without an immediate clash between the
coalition government and the opposition Labor Party over
contentious policy issues Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament will resume on April 30. But the coalition
government failed to put forward a legislative timetable for the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the first pieces of legislation to be
debated in the Senate would be bills left over by the previous
Labor government, including health, therapeutic goods and
hazardous waste. These bills lapsed when the last parliament was
dissolved by Governor-General William Dean before the March 2
election.
</P>
<P>
The most contentious legislations, such as industrial relations
and the sale of the government-owned Telstra company, were not on
the schedule of debate in the parliament next week, the Australian
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has criticized the coalition government of its
management of parliamentary business. Opposition leader in the
Senate John Faulkner said that the government was "crass" by
threatening to force the Senate to keep sitting until legislation
were passed.
</P>
<P>
Possibly, bargaining over sitting patterns of the Senate could
become an important factor in overall bargaining over legislation
in the first week of the sitting of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the Governor-General would officially
open the Parliament Tuesday, with the rest of the day devoted to
ceremonial functions, the election of a speaker in the House of
Representatives and a series of condolence motions.

<HEADLINE> NGOs to Hold Consultations on Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- About 100 representatives of
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 20 Asian-Pacific
countries are to meet in Bangkok next week to discuss durable and
long-term food security, it is announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will take place on April 29-30.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific of
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization said the
meeting is called because the NGOs' views on this vital subject
are important although they do not always coincide with those of
governments and international aid organizations. The NGOs are
usually in closer contact than officialdom with farmers and other
food producers at the grass-roots level.
</P>
<P>
The NGO consultations will cover such topics as a sustained
access to food by the poor, and coherence of regional policies,
and aid and development programs.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the NGO consultations will be passed on to the
FAO Regional Conference, to be held in Western Samoa on May 14-18,
and the Conference's conclusions will in turn go to the World Food
Summit in Rome on November 13-17.
</P>
<P>
FAO estimates that 800 million people in developing countries
around the world still suffer from chronic under-nutrition and
almost 500 million of these under-nourished live in Asia and the
Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Finland Call for EU's Stronger Crisis Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Sweden and Finland proposed
today to enhance Europe's crisis management capabilities by using
the Western European Union (WEU) as its policy implementation tool.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the two Nordic nations, both members of the
15-nation European Union (EU), was contained in a memorandum and
sent to other nations in the regional alliance.
</P>
<P>
Crisis management through military means, either peacekeeping
missions or humanitarian aid and relief operations, should be
included in the EU's external and security policies, they said.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, of which Finland and Sweden are not members, was set
up as a military organization in 1954. Under its Constitution, if
a member country is invaded, other members must come to assist.
</P>
<P>
However, the WEU has not been able to play its military role as
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been serving as
the cornerstone of western Europe's defense.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the WEU has been reduced to a mere forum on
defense issues.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen and Swedish Foreign Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen suggested
on April 21 that the topics be discussed at the ongoing EU
inter-governmental conference.

NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ram Dijit and his wife got up
at 7:00 this morning and went to the nearby polling booth to cast
their ballots.
</P>
<P>
They said that they did not want to vote at the beginning. "For
every time almost all the same faces were elected and they have
done little for the people," they said, adding that it is their
hope that "new faces will be voted into power this time."
</P>
<P>
L. Gupter, a shop owner, said that there was no difference
among various political parties and candidates. "It is very hard
for us to choose. We hope that some young and clean people will
come to power this time."
</P>
<P>
He added, "In India, politicians are very greedy. They try to
get as much money as they could soon after they are voted into
power."
</P>
<P>
A. Kumar cast his vote and went out. When asked which party's
candidate he supported, he said: "This time I cast Bharatiya
Janata Party's (BJP) vote, because previously I always supported
the Congress Party. No reason really, just for a change."
</P>
<P>
Sixty-year-old L.A. Survender, owner of a garage in Delhi,
refused to go to polls. He said, "I have been taken in in the
past. This time I don't want to be fooled again, for all the
politicians are money-grabby."
</P>
<P>
According to the latest poll survey by the Delhi-based Center
of the Media Studies (CMS), there is a clear preference for change
in the country, for voters are fed up with corruption. The
preference for change is strongest in the north where 65 percent
want a new government.
</P>
<P>
Amid unprecedented security arrangements of 300,000 security
personnel, more than 161 million voters went to polls today
throughout the country to elect their representatives to 150 Lok
Sabha (lower house) and 532 assembly seats.
</P>

<HEADLINE> India Extends CBI Chief's Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- India's Supreme Court Friday
extended the tenure of Central Bureau Investigation (CBI) Director
Vijaya Rama Rao up to July 31 in order to avoid any interruption
in the progress of investigation in a number of scandals, the
Indian Express reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rama Rao's term of office expires on April 30. The CBI
director has been playing an important role in the investigation
of a number of scandals, including the hawala case, an
18-million-US-dollar bribery scandal which has rocked the entire
political arena of the country over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
The court believed that Rama Rao's demitting office on the
scheduled date of April 30 would create a gap in the investigation
into the scandals which may not be in public interest.
</P>
<P>
The Apex Court granted the three-month extension to facilitate
a permanent appointment to the office by a new government that
takes over after the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties have repeatedly expressed their
objection to a possible extension of the CBI director's tenure in
the past few months.

<HEADLINE> China's Chemical Industry to Introduce 3.5 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's chemical industry will
introduce 3.5 billion US dollars over the next five years, thus
bringing the total overseas investment in this sector to 10
billion US dollars by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He Guoqiang, deputy minister of chemical industry, told the
ongoing "Conference on the Chemical Industry and Technology
Opportunities in China" here that in the 17 years since the policy
of reform and opening-up was initiated, China has introduced 6.5
billion US dollars in overseas funds for the sector.
</P>
<P>
The funds were mainly pumped into such construction and
technical renovation projects as fertilizers, rubber, ethylene,
organic chemical raw materials, synthetic materials, and fine and
specialty chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the chemical industry also spent 9.5 billion
US dollars of foreign exchange on the import of nearly 1,000
advanced chemical technologies and key items of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total trade volume of the chemical
industry reached 29.7 billion US dollars-worth in 1995, of which
the import volume stood at 18.1 billion US dollars-worth and the
amount of foreign exchange generated from exports was 11.6 billion
US dollars, up 16 billion and 8.7 billion US dollars,
respectively, from 1990.
</P>
<P>
There are now 5,500 overseas-funded chemical joint ventures in
China.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that China's chemical industry has now
established an industrial system with relatively complete
categories and varieties with the ability to meet the basic
domestic needs, having laid a solid groundwork for its further
development in the 1990s and into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of international co-operation, he said the development
of China's chemical industry is now plagued by such problems as
shortage of capital and advanced technologies. "We must therefore
continue to unswervingly implement the policy of opening up to the
outside world, and fully use resources, funds and markets at home
and abroad."

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report On Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange closed the week slightly higher, maintaining
its resistance level of 1,170 points reached last week.
</P>
<P>
The composite index Friday reached 1,173.43 points, 11.29
points higher from last week's close, and the all share Emas index
gained 3.67 points to 338.77 while the industrial index rose 20.23
points to 2,107.36.
</P>
<P>
The market's composite index managed to touch 1,180 points
Tuesday morning. But on Wednesday the market was jolted on
speculation of an announcement by the authorities for a tighter
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Investors were also sidelined ahead of the long weekend as the
market will be closed Monday and Wednesday next week for holidays.
</P>
<P>
After two days of selling pressure, the market underwent a
technical rebound Friday on bargain hunting and talk of a trade
surplus in the February 1996 trade data, which sparked some buying
interest.
</P>
<P>
The main board turnover in the week was 1.457 billion shares
worth 10.295 billion Malaysian ringgit (about 4.11 billion US
dollars) from 2.149 billion shares worth 8.967 billion ringgit
(about 3.48 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover stood at 333.751 million shares worth
3.274 billion ringgit (about 1.3 billion dollars) from 445.364
million shares worth 4.174 billion ringgit (about 1.66 billion
dollars) previously.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals amounted to 171.36 million shares valued at
1.207 billion ringgit (about 482.8 million dollars) compared with
130.814 million shares valued at 916.488 million ringgit (about
366.59 million dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Bonded Zone Takes Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tianjin Bonded Zone, which
was built on saline-alkali land in the north China port city of
Tianjin five year ago, has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
The five-square-kilometer fenced zone with rows of storehouses,
office buildings and trade centers, is home to 2,900 enterprises
from 61 countries and regions and 20 provinces, cities and
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The zone has invested 2.5 billion yuan (300 million US dollars)
in building infrastructural facilities, and absorbed 2.1 billion
US dollars worth of investment so far.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that the zone has generated gross domestic
product (GDP) totalling more than 600 million yuan, collected
taxes amounting to 200 million yuan and tariffed 600 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial Bonded Storage Company, set up by the Tianjin
Port Administration and the Royal Nedllyd Group of the
Netherlands, is one of the oldest such businesses in China. It
has four warehouses each with a floor space of 5,000 square
meters for sundry goods, and a 4,000-square meter automobile
warehouse at the zone.
</P>
<P>
Its annual turnover has topped four million US dollars since
1993.
</P>
<P>
Another large enterprise engaged in storage facilities and
transport has gone into operation at the zone. It was co-funded
by the Ministry of Railways and a Hong Kong company
</P>
<P>
It has built the largest warehouse, storage yard and the first
special railway line at the zone.
</P>
<P>
At present, 2,000 enterprises at the zone have carried out
international trading business with the total import and export
volume topping 2.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the zone has made rapid progress in transit trade
with trade volume hitting 70 million US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of Mongolia, an inland nation in Eastern
Asia, has decided to use the zone as its external port.
</P>
<P>
And large planes from the Russian Federation often make a
stop-over on their way to Hong Kong.

here when the Hong Kong team was preparing for the Asian
Championships held earlier this month in Bangkok, Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Retired after the 1992 Asian championships in Hiroshima, Wang
went to study in the Takushoku University in Tokyo, majoring in
business. He is to graduate next April.
</P>
<P>
Chan Yiu Hoi, HKSI's head swimming coach, played the key role
in recruiting the Chinese star. "He not only had been through a
lot of tough training when he was in China, but also he knows the
western style of training which Japan adopted," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
"There are only a handful of swimmers in the world who know
this form of training," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said he hoped Wang's hard work and perseverance would make
an impact on Hong Kong swimmers.

<P>
HAIKOU, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Haikou Canned Food Factory,
founded in 1956, had long been in the red until it built a coconut
milk production line and a mineral water production line several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Technology upgrading quickly bailed the factory out of
difficulties. The factory now ranks among the largest canned food
manufacturers and has become one of most profitable enterprises in
the island province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years this provincial capital has developed
242 products by investing 690 million yuan in technology upgrading.
</P>
<P>
A number of local products, such as natural coconut milk, a
coffee blend and Lugui wine, have been rated as country's
brand-name products and are welcomed in the markets both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) technology
upgrading contributed 30 percent of Haikou's economic growth rate,
industry officials said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Witnesses Slight Price Rise in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's price index of services,
gold and the dollar rose by 0.1 percent this month, signalling the
end of a period of unstability in prices that often occurs during
the spring festival, according to the General Department of
Statistics(GDS).
</P>
<P>
The total increase in the price index in the first four months
of this year was 4.3 percent, said GDS.
</P>
<P>
It added that if this could be maintained throughout this year,
Vietnam would succeed in keeping the rate of inflation under 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
Prices of grain and foodstuff increased slightly this month in
the north. However, they dropped by 0.1 to 0.7 percent in the
south, the GDS said.
</P>
<P>
But the situation was reversed in the two major cities, with
Hanoi prices dropping by 0.9 percent and Ho Chi Minh city's
increasing by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The prices for transportation and construction materials have
fallen by 0.5 and 0.9 percent respectively, while fuel and oil
prices rose nation-wide by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the price of gold increased by 0.6 percent, and
U.S. dollar rose between 0.1 and 0.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Shandong to Protect Cultivated Land Strictly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province, a
major granary in the country, has vowed to put a halt to the
shrinking of cultivated land in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
The province aims to control the annual decrease rate of
cultivated land within one unit per thousand, against three per
thousand at present.
</P>
<P>
The province faces an urgent task in farmland
protection. During the past four decades Shandong's population has
jumped from 45 million to 87 million, while the amount of
cultivated land has shrunk from 130 million mu to 100 million mu
(about 6.7 million ha).
</P>
<P>
To guarantee each person 500 kg of grain annually, the
province's cultivated land has to be kept at 100 million mu.
</P>
<P>
The province has pledged to curb the encroachment of
construction on land and at the same time reclaim 200,000 mu
annually so that by the year 2000 the decrease and increase of
arable land will have struck a balance.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Li Chunting said that, starting this year,
the provincial government will tightly regulate the supply of land
and work out a strict land protection system.
</P>
<P>
"Misuse of cultivated land will be severely punished," Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan Period (1991-1995), by adopting
strict protective measures, the province safeguarded 95 percent of
its farmland. Last year its grain output rose to 42 million kg,
ranking the country's second only to that of southwest China's
Sichuan Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Government has told
the Rwandan Government to close its Embassy in Nairobi if Rwanda
will not waive diplomatic immunity on her diplomat arrested on
criminal charges in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Friday, the Kenyan Government said it has
urged Rwanda to allow its arrested diplomat Francis Mugabo to
face criminal charges in a court of law for involving an
attempted assassination of former Rwandan Minister of Interior,
Seth Sendashonga in Nairobi two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, Kenya reached the decision to close the
Embassy on April 9, but held back after a request from Kigali
that the matter be solved through negotiations, "Daily Nation"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Government accused the Rwanda Government of
contravening this agreement and instead accusing Kenya of
violating conventions governing diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
In its recent statement, the Rwanda Government said the arrest
of Francis Mugabo was wrong and accused Kenya of harbouring
Rwandese implicated in the genocide which left about a million
people dead.

<P>
LUSAKA, April 27 (Xinhua)-- The Zambian government has observed
that from the 108 companies that have been privatized so far, no
worker has been declared redundant by new managements, "Times of
Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry Syamukayumbu
Syamujaye was quoted as saying that it was unfortunate that the
people mistook privatization for liquidation. The government was
cautious about the status of workers during the privatization
process.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye urged workers to work hard and not to engage in acts of
indiscipline, so as to increase production.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he advised the new managements of the sold companies to
strike a balance between motivation of workers and gaining profit,
adding that this was the only way production could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
Some clauses of the Zambia Privatization Act stipulate that new
management should retain all labour force after privatization of
a company. enditem

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cease-fire Enforced in South Lebanon (by Huang Xingwei and Shao Jie) (I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOUR, LEBANON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Today is a special day for
Abas Sabah, one of the 500,000 refugees, as he finally returned
home in southern Lebanon after seeking shelter in Beirut for 15
days.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old taxi driver told Xinhua that "it is a great
joy that all my family retuned home in safety and began to live a
normal life."
</P>
<P>
The return of the refugees was facilitated soon after a
cease-fire was enforced at 4:00 a.m. local time (01:00 GMT) today,
following 16 days of fighting between Israel and the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At 00:36 a.m. local time today (21:36 GMT Friday), Israel again
fired heavy artillery shells at the southern port city of Sour,
which was shaken amid the deafening sounds of explosions. Sour, 85
 kilometers south of Beirut, is only 18 kilometers away from the
nearest point on the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
And at 3:55 a.m. this morning (00:55 GMT), all of the Israeli
warplanes, which had been hovering over the city, flew away, and
the cease-fire began to be enforced at 4:00 a.m..
</P>
<P>
Journalists driving from Sour to the southern Lebanese market
town of Nabatiyeh this morning encountered three lanes of
vehicles in traffic, passenger cars and trucks crammed with men,
women and children -- mostly whole families -- snaked along the
main coastal highway from Beirut toward the south.
</P>
<P>
These travelers are the displaced southern Lebanese who came
back from Beirut, Sidon or other northern cities. The Israeli
bombardment of southern Lebanon since April 11 triggered an exodus
of up to half a million refugees, one eighth of the country's
population.
</P>
<P>
The fighting left more than 200 Lebanese dead and 400 others
wounded in the Israeli "Grapes of Wrath Operation" which started
on April 11.
</P>
<P>
A long queue of cars was seen at the northern entrance post of
Sour since 4:50 a.m. (01:50 GMT). The Lebanese civilians, though
tired, were all happy with smiles in their faces.
</P>
<P>
Masr Saraj, a doctor, told Xinhua that he was greatly relieved
upoun hearing the news of the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I will do is to hold a party to celebrate the
family reunion," he said.

"Even if it was destroyed, it doesn't matter. I can rebuild
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The southern market town of Nabatiyeh, which was still a
"ghost town" Friday, was full of life today with a lot of
people in the streets celebrating the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Nabatiyeh, 75 kilometers southeast of the capital Beirut, is a
small town near the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in
southern Lebanon. It became the chief target of Israel's
consecutive air-strikes and shellings since April 11.
</P>
<P>
The heavy Israeli bombardment had turned this thriving market
town into a "ghost town," with shops shuttered and the lights out
in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
On April 13, Israel issued warnings to the residents in most
southern Lebanese towns and villages to leave their homes. 75,000
of Nabatiyeh's 85,000 residents fled to Beirut, Sidon and other
northern cities.
</P>
<P>
Mohmoud Haj Ali, a 62-year-old grocery store owner, told
Xinhua that his family will return home later today. He stayed in
the town despite the Israeli bombardment. "The fighting is over
at last. I am happy because I can have a reunion with my family,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But not all Lebanese civilians were as happy as Ali despite
the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Mahmoud Abed, a pale-faced 48-year-old doctor, was
listless and dejected, because his wife and eight children were
killed in an Israeli bombardment of Nabatiyeh Fauga village on
April 18.
</P>
<P>
On that day, Israeli helicopter gunships carried out strikes
on the Nabatiyeh Fauga, the eastern vicinity of Nabatiyeh, and
destroyed a three-storey-building, killing 11 civilians and
wounding 10 others.
</P>
<P>
Nabatiyeh Fauga, located on a hillside, is only 1,200 meters
west of the Israeli Al Taher position in the so-called "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
"I had the greatest, greatest tragedy in the world. I
don't have any feeling now," the heart-broken Abed said.
</P>
<P>
When passing through the three-storey building where his wife
and eight children were killed, Abed went ahead even without
raising his head.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Calls For More Foreign Investment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 27 (Xinhua)-- The Vietnamese government calls for
more foreign investment in electronics and telecommunications to
aid its drive to modernize and develop high-tech industries, said
an official report here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that developing the industries will require
funds from government and foreign investors, if the country is to
keep up in the information and communication age.
</P>
<P>
It needs to make further efferts to computerise measures and
controls to make production more precise and accurate.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that tv and radio broadcasts should
extend to blanket the entire countryside and a national mobile
phone system will have to be set up.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government should also give high priority to
develop the internet to provide the country with access to
world-wide data and information.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has 25 joint ventures assembling electronic home
appliances, telecommunication equipment and computers in 1994,
with a total investment capital of 344 million U.S. dollars. And
in 1995, more than 700 mill ion U.S. dollars in investments were
approved in 12 telecommunication factories.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry in Vietnam has come a long way in
recent years, but it remains in its infancy. Much of the
technology is outdated with joint venture factories using
technology common in industrialised conutries in the 80s.
</P>
<P>
The demand of Vietnam for electronics is growing steadily,
averaging about 2.5 million tv sets and 2 million cassete players
a year.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A light aircraft belonging
to Tanzanair is reported to have crashed into the Uluguru
Mountains, about 300 kilometers from here, aviation sources
confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The plane left here on Wednesday morning for Morogoro,
Tabora and Ngara and lost communication with the Dar es Salaam
Air Control Centre shortly after departure.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the aircraft has been spotted. The fate of the
pilot is still unknown, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Captain Richard Mutayoba, must have rammed into the
mountains minutes later, most likely because of bad
weather, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Director General of the Civil Aviation, Charles Mgana
said, "I have received some information that the accident
happened at Pangawe area".
</P>
<P>
"This area is very steep and if the weather was bad, anything
could happen. However, I have not yet received official information
about the accident from the search and rescue operation team",
Mgana added.
</P>
<P>
Aviation sources further said the search and rescue team
most likely faced the problem of accessibility due to the
physical features of the hilly area.
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter has been searching for the whereabouts
of the missing plane but so far no official statement was made
on the accident. enditem

<HEADLINE> Peres Stresses Complete Peace With Syria, Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres last night reaffirmed Israel's desire to have a complete
peace with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television following an
announcement of cease-fire understanding between Israel and
Hezbollah, Peres said that the understandings to end the war are
a kind of draft for a border agreement between Israel, Lebanon
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this was the first accord between Israel,
Syria and Lebanon with the participation of the U.S. and
France.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the peace process, suspended following suicide
 bus bombings launched by Hamas in major Israeli cities, has been
resumed.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the border areas in the north, calm
and peace have been restored. Peres said the residents of the
north can return to their homes beginning from this
morning. Finance Minister Abraham Shohat is due to have a
fact-finding tour of the north later today so as to allocate funds
for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The residents on the whole expressed welcome to the peace
though most still have doubts about how long the ceasefire will
last.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the ceasefire, Yossi Sarid, Chairman of the
left-wing Meretz Party and government Minister of Environment, said
that the understanding is very positive. He hoped that all
sides will learn that there is nothing worth in a war, in
which civilians have paid the price and all efforts should be
made to achieve a full peace.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing parties think otherwise. Likud, the major opposition
party, issued a statement accusing the government of giving in
completely to international pressure. The party said that Israel
had officially handed over the security responsibility for
northern Israel to Syria and Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Peres promised to improve the 1993
understanding, Likud claimed that he is now telling the residents
that from now on their fate depends on Hezbollah madmen.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette will come to Israel today, the fifth mission in his
shuttle between Israel, Syria and Lebanon since the Lebanese
crisis. The French official is due to meet with Peres and his
counterpart Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, after seven days in
the region, left Israel for home last night.
</P>
<P>
Peres, with an abolition of clauses in the Palestinian covenant
calling for Israel's destruction and a ceasefire agreement between
Israel and Hezbollah, is scheduled to travel to Washington
tonight, among other things, to sign a new agreement with
President Bill Clinton on enhancing security relations between the
two countries.

<HEADLINE> EU Discusses Unemployment With Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The top official of the
European Union (EU) has discussed unemployment issue with Swedish
Prime Minister Goran Persson and Finance Minister Erik Asbrink.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, President of the Commission of the EU, arrived
here today, for a visit to this Nordic nation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides exchanged views about the plan which was proposed by
the European Parliament in January to resolve the unemployment
problem faced by the EU's 15 member countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU has reportedly planned to allocate 17 billion Swedish
kronas, or about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars, to provide the
unemployed with more job opportunities, but it has been opposed by
Sweden and some other EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Prime Minister proposed that the EU borrow money
from member countries to bring down the unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Ex-President Continues Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi ex-president Hossain
Muhammad Ershad has been continuing hunger strike in jail for the
last 4 days to press for his release to lead his party's campaign
for the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here Friday by Mizanur Rahman Chowdhury,
Acting Chairman of the Jatiya (National) Party (JP) in which
Ershad has been the chairman.
</P>
<P>
Concerning about the deteriorating of Ershad's health
condition, Mizanur called upon the party chief to call off his
hunger strike "because there is no response from this inhuman
authority."
</P>
<P>
"We repeatedly requested the authority and the caretaker
government to shift Ershad from the Central Jail (in Dhaka) to
hospital for better treatment but the caretaker government was
behaving like the deposed BNP (Bangladesh Nationalist Party)
government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ershad was forced to step down in 1989 and has been in jail
since then for corruption cases alleged by the BNP authorities.
</P>
<P>
Following the dissolution of the last parliament and the
resignation of the BNP government on March 30, the JP has launched
a movement to press for Ershad's release to lead the party for
polls campaign.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the immediate family members of the
ex-president including his wife Raushan Ershad Friday failed to
meet him in the jail.
</P>
<P>
The family was to meet Ershad under prior permission of the
jail authorities. But a dead lock developed when the family
members were told that the interview will be held through
intercom, according to Ershad's counsel.

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River Being Tamed, Says Expert (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As it flows along its course the river carries 1.6 billion tons
of silt, surging towards its lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The river bed in the lower reaches of the river has been lifted
by the sand, bursting the river banks twice in three years, and
changing its course.
</P>
<P>
The river, as a result, has been dubbed the world's most
complicated and difficult to control waterway, hence being known
as the "sorrow of the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
Now the Yellow River has become a hanging river, with the river
bed 20 meters above Xinxiang City, and 13 meters above Kaifeng
City, both in Central China's Henan Province, and five meters
above Jinan, capital city of East China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
If the river bank bursts it would change its course, disturbing
the Haihe River in the north and the Huaihe River in the south,
affecting areas of up to 40,000 square kilometers, and a
population of ten million people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1946 when flood control was placed at the top of the
Communist Party's agenda, the turbulent river has been gradually
tamed.
</P>
<P>
The effort has been eulogised by people along the river
as a "historic miracle."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhuang Jinglin, China has undertaken massive
control efforts, consolidating 1,400 kilometers of embankments on
three occasions, and building a number of flood discharge zones
and major reservoirs along the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
In the Loess Plateau, the official said, China has planted over
seven million hectares of trees, and 2.2 million hectares of grass
in a major water and soil conservation program.
</P>
<P>
The effort has brought 150,000 square kilometers of soil and
water erosion under control, reducing sedimentation from the
Yellow River by 300 million tons each year.
</P>
<P>
Eight large and medium-sized water conservation projects and
power stations, such as Longyang Gorge, Liujia Gorge and Sanmen
Gorge, have been completed in the main stream. The reservoirs have
intercepted silt flow, and readjusted water flows.
</P>
<P>
The 3.74 million kilowatts of electricity capacity from the
reservoirs have made the river China's major hydroelectric power
base, which provides large amounts of energy for the Northwest and
North China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 people work on the Yellow River flood control. The
flood control and development of the Yellow River has helped
develop a special research field-- Yellow River Study --in which a
great number of scholars have put forward suggestions and research
findings about the river.
</P>
<P>
After a battle already spanning almost half a century, China's
Yellow River has finally been tamed.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Belarus, Russia Mark Chernobyl Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Belarus held
commemorations on Friday marking the 10th anniversary of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster which Ukraine said killed about 4,300
people.
</P>
<P>
In Ukraine, thousands of tearful mourners observed a minute's
silence in Slavutych, a town 35 kilometers east of the Chernobyl
plant, in memory of all the victims of the world's worst nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
During the minute of silence, some 10-year-old children who
were born in the year of the disaster put candles at a monument
dedicated to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said this accident would
constantly remind mankind of the safe use of nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine pledged to shut the plant by the year 2000 and
U.S. President Bill Clinton wrote to Kuchma hailing the pledge as
a goal of the highest order.
</P>
<P>
In Belarus, downwind from the blast and worst hit by the
fallout, at least 40,000 nationalists took part in the
commemorative activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a speech
broadcast on Radio Russia on Friday, thanked those who fought to
control the fire at the nuclear plant 10 years ago and called
for more and stricter measures to ensure nuclear safety.
</P>
<P>
A nuclear reactor at the Chernobyl plant exploded and caused a
fire during an unauthorized experiment on April 26,
1986. Thirty-one people died shortly after the explosion, mostly
rescue workers and firefighters. The explosion also sent out a
cloud of nuclear dust which contaminated vast areas in northern
Europe.

<HEADLINE> PNG to Treat Australian FM As Private Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Papua New Guinea (PNG) has
stated that it would treat Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer's forthcoming visit as a private one, because he was not
formally invited.
</P>
<P>
The Australian today quoted PNG government officials as saying
that PNG had not been properly consulted over arrangements for
Downer's trip next week.
</P>
<P>
Although PNG Prime minister Julius Chan has referred in his
letter to David Irvine, the Australian High Commissioner in Port
Moresby, to an early visit from Downer, but the PNG government had
not been consulted in the timing and duration of the visit, PNG
officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the PNG government is unhappy with the
Howard government's approach so far to it and the South Pacific
region, Julius Chan had written to Australia's new government
setting out a number of issues in the bilateral relations which he
hoped could be addressed urgently.
</P>
<P>
However, the PNG government received three rebuffs in the first
seven weeks of the Howard government in crucial policy areas.
Last month, Downer made clear that Australia did not endorse the
lifting of the ceasefire on Bougainville, and urged PNG to seek a
peaceful resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister McLachlan also declined to provide
any additional logistical support for PNG troops stationed there.
</P>
<P>
And Australian Treasurer Costello has denied a request by PNG's
Finance Minister Chris Haiveta for an additional loan.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Canberra confirmed the Downer's visit today and
believed the visit would have official status, but the dates for
the visit will be announced Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentina and Chile today
reaffirmed their commitments to the integration of the two
countries by signing a string of agreements.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem and his Chilean counterpart,
Eduardo Frei, signed a document for cultural integration after

</P>
<P>
They agreed in the document to create a joint cultural

<HEADLINE> Feature: TAZARA: Bridge Of Sino-African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, 27 (Xinhua) -- Built as "the Great Uhuru
Railway" 20 years ago against the blockade of the apartheid South
Africa and South Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), the Tanzanian-Zambian
railway (TAZARA) has witnessed the development of friendship
between China and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Friendship, that is what impressed me most during my travel
along the 1860-kilometer TAZARA in early April this year.
</P>
<P>
This is a beautiful season in Tanzania, with crops turning
yellow and ripe for harvesting and a happy and peaceful
atmosphere covering the landscape of the cultivated plots, green
hills and quiet cottages.
</P>
<P>
With slight knocking at the door, a middle-aged gentleman
appeared in our compartment, beaming at passengers. A polite
stewardess made a brief introduction: Senior Conductor
Mr A. Mandale is coming to see everyone.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mandale has been serving on TAZARA ever since he graduated
from a Tanzanian railway technical school in the late 1970s. He
became an assistant senior conductor in 1982 and was promoted to
the current post two years ago.
</P>
<P>
As a veteran serviceman, Mr Mandale valued the "political
railway" as a great contribution in the years of struggle for
national independence in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He praised China for funding the railway, recalling "without
the support of China, southern Africa could never have
accomplished its task of national independence so quickly."
</P>
<P>
"Tanzanians, Zambians and peoples of other African countries
got to know better about China and take her as their real
friend," Mandale said.
</P>
<P>
A "road of freedom" became a dream of Tanzania and Zambia upon
their founding in 1964. The fledgling countries of national
independence were suffering an economic blockade imposed in 1965
by South Africa and South Rhodesia because of their support for
the anti-apartheid struggle.
</P>
<P>
With the closure of their traditional passages through South
Africa and South Rhodesia to sea outlets, Tanzania and Zambia
turned to China for a try -- after their appeal for help with a
wayout declined by western countries.
</P>
<P>
A friend in need is a friend indeed. Mandale said they could
never forget that the People's Republic of China, a developing
country herself, took courage to build TAZARA at the time of
China's own economic difficulties.

A businessman told me that as far as he knows, there have been
at least 300 companies doing business through TAZARA in Tanzania,
Zambia and neighboring Zaire and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The railway is also providing business opportunities to more
than 500 peddlers all the way through, the Tanzanian friends said
after they know that I am a Chinese correspondent.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA serves as a promoter of regional development as well,
according to locals.
</P>
<P>
The train stopped at the Makambako Station in the southern
Iringa Region. When I took off the train for a break at the
platform, I was fortunate enough to meet with a Mbeya regional
development director, Mr D. M. Badi.
</P>
<P>
Mbeya, the capital of Mbeya Region south of Iringa, used to
be a township of 20,000 people. It has become a city of 350,000
today, the fourth largest throughout the country, with an
industrial system of coal mining, cement making, textiles
production, coffee processing and a number of other trades.
</P>
<P>
TAZARA has much to do with all these developments in the
region, Mr Badi told me.
</P>
<P>
On my way on to Tanzania's border town of Tunduma, I had a
chance meeting with my old friend Mr J. Mwaulambo, who is the
regional administrative officer of TAZARA in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He was happy to see me on a business tour about the
development of TAZARA and its far-reaching significance.
</P>
<P>
"What I feel utmost is that China proves to be a real friend
of us Africans. Unlike some western countries, China has never
imposed any preconditions in her assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned last year's visit by Chinese Vice-premier Zhu
Rongji, saying Zhu's visit brought new life into TAZARA after
20 years of operation.
</P>
<P>
It was China who rushed to our rescue 20 years ago, and it is
China again today who has granted us new assistance when TAZARA
needs some urgent repair work, he said.
</P>
<P>
Because of an unexpected change, I returned to Dar es Salaam
instead of continuing my planned travel into the section of
TAZARA in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
But my friends told me both Tanzanians and Zambians are
confident that TAZARA will remain a success of cooperation with
the backing of a real friend.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Exports Down in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's exports reached 917
million dollars in the first quarter of this year, 20.2 percent
down from the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the exports, the biggest since 1992, was directly
affected by the control of foreign exchange, said the Statistics
and Information Central Bureau in a report published today.
</P>
<P>
It said mineral exports were 321 million dollars, or 35 percent
of the total, which was followed by chemicals of 134 million
dollars, 14.6 percent of the whole exports.
</P>
<P>
The report said the oil exports did not slip without giving
details. Oil is the largest export in this South American country.
</P>
<P>
Exports in March stood at 324 million dollars, a 30.6 percent
drop compared with 467 million dollars in the same month of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Venezuela's exports went to Colombia, the
United States, Italy, Britain, Mexico, and Japan. The U.S. and
Colombia are Venezuela's major export markets.

<HEADLINE> China's Yellow River being  Tamed, Says Expert (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's mighty Yellow River is
finally being tamed after a massive science-versus-nature battle
to bring it under control.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and engineers say they are winning the battle
using engineering and biological measures as their key weapons.
</P>
<P>
Massive projects to be completed by 2010 will mean that
serious flooding will be reduced from once in 60 years to once in
a 1,000 years. It could mean an end to flooding well into the
22nd century.
</P>
<P>
With some cities up to 20 meters below the river bed the
prospects of flood control mean an end to constant worry during
the rainy seasons.
</P>
<P>
 Zhuang Jinglin, deputy director of the Yellow River Water
Resources Commission described how China's second longest river is
finally being brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Although the river is still poses a threat of flood, silt,
growth of river bed, and soil erosion in the Loess Plateau, he
said, China can tame the Yellow River as far as the understanding
of the river and the current science and technology levels are
concerned.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang listed a number of measures such as the construction of
a series of large capacity reservoirs on the river to control
flooding and reduce sedimentation so that enough time can be found
to engage in water and soil conservation work in the Loess Plateau.
</P>
<P>
According to the expert, China can adjust silt flow to the
Yellow River by consolidating dykes and dredging the river course.
</P>
<P>
The Xiaolangdi Water Conservation Project which is being built
on a section of the river near Luoyang, a city in central China's
Henan Province, is one of such effort.
</P>
<P>
The project, costing 30 billion yuan, is also the largest
water conservation project paid for with loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Some 12.65 billion cubic meters of water capacity can prevent
the river bed from sedimentation for at least 20 years, said Wang
Chengyi, head of the Xiaolangdi Project Administration Bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's current account
deficit for the last fiscal year (from April 1, 1995 to March 31,
1996) is expected to be below the official projection of 7.9
billion US dollars, The Jakarta Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Our actual current account deficit for the last fiscal year is
likely to be lower than the government's projection of 7.9 billion
US dollars as a result of the government's efforts to cool down
the overheating economy," the newspaper quoted Bank Indonesia
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government had been quite successful in tackling a set of
problems by establishing a special team to review state projects
with high import content, added the sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government also took some effective measures
including the contractive fiscal policy through the
intensification of tax collections as well as the limitation of
banking credit expansion.
</P>
<P>
The measures would also probably help reduce the country's
current account deficit for the current fiscal year, which the
government has projected at 6.9 billion dollars, said the sources.

BANGKOK, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of Thailand
plans to cut import duties on 13 groups of luxuries to end
widespread smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be submitted to the cabinet for approval next
month.
</P>
<P>
Among the luxury items targeted for import duty cuts are
cosmetics, leather goods, glass and crystal ware, cameras,
electrical appliances, garments and footwear.
</P>
<P>
The plan, if approved, may cost the government some 47 million
US dollars in lost revenues.
</P>
<P>
But the import duty cuts will put a halt to widespread
smuggling, and more people are expected to bring luxury goods in
through proper customs channels, which will eventually help
compensate for the loss in revenue, according to Deputy Finance

NANNING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- The third and last
water-diversion tunnel for the Tianshengqiao Power Station, a key
state project located in southwest China, has been put through.
</P>
<P>
The three tunnels, parallel to each other, are 9,700 m long on
average and 9.7 m to 10.8 m in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The geological conditions in the area made the drilling of the
tunnels both difficult and dangerous, engineers said.
</P>
<P>
The tunnels will help the station generate power by taking
advantage of a 181-m natural drop in the Nanpan River.
</P>

The power station is of great significance for the transmission
of electricity from western part of the country to the east.

YANGON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanma Port Authority is arranging
to upgrade freight-handling services at Yangon Port by improving
facilities and building a new port nearby.
</P>
<P>
Yangon Port, the country's main gateway to the world, handles
nearly all of Myanmar's imports and over 90 percent of exports.
</P>
<P>
The port had the capacity to handle 5.383 million metric tons
in the pre-independence period before 1948.
</P>
<P>
It handled 7.037 million tons of cargo in 1995-96, up from
6.541 million tons in 1993-94. It also handled 73,198 containers
in 1995-96, up from 44,790 in 1994-95, according to the latest
official figures.
</P>
<P>
However, the volume of cargo, both conventional general and
containerized, has been increasing annually due to increasing
commercial transactions. The present facilities are far from
meeting the growing need.
</P>
<P>
Myanma Port Authority has invited local and foreign partners to
participate in the construction of the port.
</P>
<P>
Four container jetties are being built at Thilawa Port, a new
port nearby. Plans are under way to build four jetties to handle
conventional general cargo and to improve infrastructure at
Thilawa.

Companies from the Republic of Korea, China and Singapore,
private enterprises and Myanma Five Star Line will simultaneously

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Big enterprises from the east
coast of China have set up hundreds of firms in the Three Gorges
area, using mergers, renovations, leases, or joint ventures and a
total investment of more than one billion yuan (about 120 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over 20 large enterprises, such as Zhejiang's Wahaha, Jiangsu's
Yanwu, and Shanghai's Baimao have put a combined investment of 600
million yuan into the area.
</P>
<P>
Wahaha, the largest confectioner in Zhejiang, has set up a
joint venture with Fuling City in the reservoir area, and has
renovated three unprofitable enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory, the world's biggest
producer of small and medium-sized diesel engines, has established
a joint venture with the Three Gorges Diesel Engine Factory, as
the first step in southwest China's market. The venture is
expected to produce 100,000 engines with a total output value of
200 million yuan next year.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the big enterprises has given a shot in the arm
to local enterprises' technology and industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yichang and Fuling cities have renovated several
enterprises with low technology content and have set up several
pillar industries in machinery, electronics, chemicals, and
foodstuff with support from coastal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
For historical reasons, the economy is less-developed in the
Three Gorges area, where the world's largest water-control project
is under way. By the time the project is completed by 2009, over
one million people will have to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
By setting up new businesses, the large enterprises have
solved the resettlement problem for thousands of people. Wahaha
has provided jobs for over 900 workers waiting for proper
resettlement and the company will help relocate 1,500 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's Jinyi Group and the Fangyuan Company have merged
nine money-losing enterprises, a move that will help with the
resettlement of 1,500 people.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Factory Uncovered in Central Georgia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal agents uncovered
a bomb plot and arrested two members of a militia group in central
Georgia after raiding a bomb factory and several houses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) discovered
components for making pipe bombs during raids on houses in
Knoxville and Americus, south of Atlanta near the city of Macon.
</P>
<P>
Two men, electrician Robert Starr and plumber William McCranie,
of the "Republic Militia," were arrested on charges of conspiracy
and possession of unregistered explosive device.
</P>
<P>
Local news media reported earlier that the bomb plot may has
some relations with the upcoming Olympic Games. But federal
officials said that it has no connection with the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"This is a couple of militia types who built things that can be
made into pipe bombs, but we have no information of any plan to
use them for the Olympics," Justice Department spokesman Carl
Stern said.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) stated that
"law enforcement officials -- including the Georgia Bureau of
Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
-- have now reported to ACOG that there is no connection between
the bomb plot uncovered today and the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
However, the discovery of the clandestine bomb factory prompted
a major security alert in Atlanta, the city that will host the
Olympic Games this summer.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
agents have held a series of anti-terrorism exercises in and
around Atlanta, dealing with potential crises ranging from
hostage-taking to aircraft hijackings.

BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A survey showed that Chinese
press's environmental consciousness is in general still weak.
</P>
<P>
An investigation conducted by the Friends of Nature, a
non-governmental environmental protection organization, looked at
52 major newspapers including 14 national, 30 provincial and
municipal, four evening, two youth papers and two for special
economic zones, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Although compared with 1994, newspapers' average coverage of
environmental issues has increased by 16.6, only 0.46 percent of
total newspaper coverage was devoted to environmental reports.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection is one of China's basic national
policies. And the co-ordination of economic development,
population, resources and environment is officially recognized as
an important aspect of the nation's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
But the low media coverage of environmental issues fails to
reflect the significance of environmental problems in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Friends of Nature report calls on journalists to improve
their environmental knowledge to help promote the public's
environmental awareness.

<HEADLINE> Border Agreement Called Focus of Worldwide Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- China's leading newspaper, the
People's Daily, published a commentary today calling China's
border agreement with Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan signed yesterday focus of worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on confidence building in the military field in
border areas was signed by Chinese president Jiang Zemin and his
counterparts from the four countries yesterday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It is a document of "important immediate and historic
significance," and will play an active role in promoting China's
friendly relations with the four countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the agreement itself is a "good model for
Asia-Pacific Region countries to go by in establishing friendly
neighboring relations, and will insert deep and far-reaching
impact on maintaining peace, stability and development in this
region," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
This agreement will, in addition, be conducive to the stability
in the border regions, as well as economic development and
people-to-people exchanges and cooperation in the border regions,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper stressed that the signing of this agreement
strongly proves that China is an important factor in maintaining
world peace and stability, and is a powerful counterattack against
those who spread the "China threat" rumors.
</P>
<P>
Though the Cold War has ended, the world is far from peaceful,
and peace and security are still major concerns of people of all
the countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
It expressed the belief that the five signatories will make
their bordering areas links of peace and friendship among
themselves based on the agreement, and usher in a new era of
comprehensive development of relations among the five countries.
</P>
<P>
The multi-lateral political and military agreement were reached
after years of negotiations and other efforts of all sides.
</P>
<P>
The Agreement stipulates a non-attack policy for the military
forces of all countries stationed along border areas, and rules
out conducting military exercises aimed at any other signatory.

<HEADLINE> Experts Stress Urgency of Saving Water, Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua) -- Local experts have urged that
more attention be paid to water saving and pollution control in
the Beijing area, where water is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that per capita water in Beijing is only 400 cu
m, one-25th of the world's average, and one-sixth of the national
average.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that with current water resources facilities
Beijing will be short of 200 million cu m by the year 2000 if the
rainfall is normal; it will be short of 1.17 billion cu m if the
year is dry.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, the city will be short of 990 million cu m or
1.98 billion cu m, according to the journal "Beijing Economic
Information"
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the shortage of water resources to excessive
exploitation and pollution.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that Beijing can protect its water resources
through saving water, readjusting the industrial mix and
improving management in this regard.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 27 (Xinhua/OANA) -- With less than three months
before the Olympic Games, all the qualified men's and women's
teams are shaping up to be in peak form at the first ever Olympic
Beach Volleyball tournaments in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
As IOC decided to add two more places for an enlarged 18-member
women's Beach Volleyball tournament, the FIVB has alloted the
spots to Mexican Huerta-Velia Soto and French Lesage-Prawerman.
</P>
<P>
In the men's version, the FIVB has replaced the European
champions Klok-Van der Kulp of the Netherlands with the Estonian
Keel-Kreen to complete the 24 teams' roster, as the Dutch Olympic
Committee informed the governing body that its squad was totally
out of condition.
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the United States that fields in a
maximum of six pairs, the top countries in term of participating
teams are Brazil with four pairs, and the trio of Australia,
Canada and Japan with three teams apiece.
</P>
<P>
The remaining countries that have qualified one or two teams to
the Olympics are Argentina, the Czech Republic, Cuba, Britain,
Estonia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Thus, a total of 21 countries will compete in the Olympic Beach
Volleyball tournaments in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The 84 athletes, including 36 women, were qualified out of a
total of 587 men's and women's competitors from 46 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Although with its first international steps stamped only 10
years ago in Rio de Janeiro, the new sport has enjoyed applauses
in all the five continents.
</P>
<P>
The drawing of lots will take place in Marseille on June 29
when the Men's World Series are to be held.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Beach Volleyball tournaments will be held in
Atlanta beach in Clayton county, some 20 miles from the Olympic

<HEADLINE> UN Council Demands Sudan Comply with Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today demanded that Sudan comply with resolution 1044 and take
immediate action to ensure extradition to Ethiopia the three
suspects connected with assassination attempt on President Mubarak
of Egypt last June.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted this evening with 13 votes in favor,
none against and two abstentions, the council also demanded the
government of Sudan desist from assisting, supporting and
facilitating terrorist activities and from giving shelter and
sanctuary to terrorist elements.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided that all states shall
significantly reduce the number and the level of the staff at
Sudanese diplomatic missions and consular posts and restrict or
control the movement of the remaining diplomats there while they
shall take steps to restrict the entry into or transit through
their territory of Sudanese officials.
</P>
<P>
The council called on all international and regional
organizations not to convene any conference in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
It also called on all states, including states not members of
the United Nations, to act strictly in conformity with this
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before vote at the Security Council, Chinese
Ambassador Qin Huasun said that the Chinese Government has always
opposed and condemned acts of terrorism in all forms and expressed
strong indignation at the terrorist assassination attempt on the
life of President Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In dealing with this incident as in other international
disputes, however, the Security Council should observe the
purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, act
strictly according to the law and make its judgment in a fair and
objective manner by respecting facts and attaching importance to
evidence, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation are against imposing sanctions on Sudan
by invoking Chapter 7 of the Charter as practice has proved that
sanctions may intensify the contradiction rather than helping
solve it. Moreover, sanctions will bring a lot of hardships to the
people of the target country and affect the neighboring countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Security Council has set a bad precedent in
imposing diplomatic sanctions against Sudan before it has enough
sound evidence. Based on the position above, the Chinese
delegation abstained in voting of the draft resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation also cast an abstention in the voting.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Reserves Rise to 312.6 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Central Bank Governor
Dragoslav Avramovic said today the country's hard currency
reserves had risen by 14.6 million U.S. dollars last week, to
stand at 312.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This has been mostly due to a rise in supply of hard currency
sold by local people to the banks," Avramovic, Governor of the
National Bank of Yugoslavia, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
And with the strong reserve, the black-market exchange rate of
the national currency, Dinar, is now on a par with the official
exchange rate, Avramovic added. The black-market exchange rate had
been higher than the official rate until last month.
</P>
<P>
Monetary stability and the drop in prices recorded in April may
give reason for satisfaction, but interest rates were still high,
the bank governor warned.
</P>
<P>
"Although the interest rates are down to 16 or 17 percent a
month, they still double the debt every three or four months,
which no rate of profit can be high enough to compensate for," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Avramovic also urged further talks with world financial
organizations and launched an initiative for setting up an
investment fund from foreign sources.
</P>
<P>
The fund should provide working capital for purchasing
commodities and semi-manufactures at the interest rates prevalent
in the world which, with the Dinar's stability, should bring the
prices and interest rates down, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, which has been kept out of the international
community for the past five years, is eager to rejoin the leading
international financial bodies, such as International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, so as to revive its devastated economy.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Reform Blood System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada's federal and provincial
health ministers have agreed to overhaul the country's existing
blood system and create a new single agency to manage the supply
and distribution of blood and blood products.
</P>
<P>
Although details of the overhaul has not be disclosed, the
decision marks a major shift in direction because it is the first
official reaction to the blood scandal and is tacit recognition
that a systemic failure was behind the public-health disaster.
</P>
<P>
In the last decade, 1,200 Canadians contracted the AIDS virus
and another 12,000 suffer from hepatitis C because of tainted
blood and blood products, according to today's local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
There are three major players in the current Canadian blood
system. The Red Cross is responsible for the collection and
distribution of blood as well as blood products; the Canadian
Blood Agency finances and sets policy for the Red Cross on behalf
of provincial and territorial health ministries; and the Bureau of
Biologics of Health Canada regulates safety.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Canadians' confidence has plummeted in
the blood system, which is often battered as "a bureaucratic and
jurisdictional mess", with no one clearly in charge.
</P>
<P>
The health ministers echoed Thursday the calls for change and
sound structure in their statement, saying that dealing with the
governance of the blood system is essential and that a national
approach requires an "appropriate single agency", one dubbed by
some proponents as Transfusion Canada.
</P>
<P>
Options are to be submitted to the health ministers in six
weeks, and a blueprint for the new agency is expected to be
approved in September, according to the reports.

<HEADLINE> International Trade Agencies To Assist Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Three international trade
organizations today announced the first phase of a combined
technical assistance program for African countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD), the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the
International Trade Center (ITC) have joined in a program to
integrate the least developed countries of Africa into world
trade.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three of the 48 countries described as "least
developed" are in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made at a joint press conference in
Midrand near Johannesburg by the heads of the three agencies on
the eve of the ninth session of UNCTAD, scheduled to start in
Midrand tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The assistance program would initially be targeted at eight
countries, namely Benin, Burkino Faso, Tanzania, Uganda, Cote
D'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya and Tunisia. It was aimed at expanding and
diversifying their trade, and integrating them with the
multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
The program would also emphasize human development and
institutional capacity building, as well as the strengthening of
export capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the program was estimated to cost 1 million
US dollars in the region.
</P>
<P>
The program would not be an aid package, but rather a
practical exercise in educcating the local privatee and public
export-related sectors on business development and trade-policy
options, said UNCTAD Secretary-general Rubens Ricupero.
