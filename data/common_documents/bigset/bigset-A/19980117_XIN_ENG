<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes blasted a
number of villages in south Lebanon Friday afternoon after three
Israeli soldiers were wounded by Lebanese guerrilla attack, the
local radio Voice of the People reported.
</P>
<P>
The two successive air raids were carried out between the
villages of Aein Bouswor and Aein Gaonan in the Iqlim al-Touffah
area, just north of the Israeli occupation zone in south Lebanon,
the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Those targeted places were suspected by Israelis of the
strongholds of Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
However, the radio said that the raids did not cause any human
casualties, except that a villager's house was hit and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The air raids came in response to the earlier attack by
guerrillas on an Israeli position at the village of Soujud inside
the occupation zone in which three Israeli soldiers were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army sources admitted the casualties, saying that one
guerrilla was killed in the attack, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with an aim to protect its northern areas
from cross-border Lebanese guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Prospects Bleak for German Retail Business in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Wiesbaden-based Federal
Statistics Office today reported a fall of 1.5 percent in the
retail sales in the first 11 months of 1997, raising a gloomy
outlook for the German retail business this year.
</P>
<P>
The fall was far steeper than earlier expected, and was blamed
on continued weak domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
German retailers have also complained about unsatisfactory
turnover over the Christmas period. The statistics office expects
a drop of 1.7 to 1.8 percent in sales for the whole year of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the German retail association HDE reported that
Germany's retail sector had seen depression for the fifth
consecutive year in 1997, with turnover dropping to 714 billion
marks (397 billion U.S. dollars), 1 percent lower in nominal terms
and nearly 2 percent down in real terms.
</P>
<P>
It was also believed that the 1 percent increase in value-added
tax in 1998 would harm the retail business.

<HEADLINE> US Records Strong Industrial Output Growth in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. industrial output
grew steadily in December, helping 1997 that saw production rise 5
percent over 1996, the strongest in the last three years, the
Federal Reserve reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose
a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent last month as compared with a
robust 0.8 percent rise in November and 0.7 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
The 5 percent increase for the year compares with a 3.5 percent
gain in 1996 and was the best since a 5.4 percent increase in
1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the nation's industry operated at 83.4
percent of capacity in December, which was the highest rate since
September 1995 and up from 83.3 percent in November and 82.5
percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
At factories alone, the operating rate climbed from 81.5
percent at the end of 1996 to 82.5 percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. economists believe the strong investment uptrend of
recent years has enhanced the economy's ability to grow strongly
and provide new jobs without touching off increased inflation.
</P>
<P>
In December, the strongest production gains included advances
of 3.1 percent for semiconductors, 1.3 percent for metal products,
1.3 percent for clothing, 2.8 percent for tobacco, 4.2 percent for
coal mining and 1.7 percent at natural gas utilities. Auto, truck
and parts production sank 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Computer production rose 0.8 percent, which didn't match
previous months' rapid increases. Computer production at the end
of 1997 was 32.8 percent higher than the end of 1996. And
automotive production was 8.8 percent higher, even after the
December slump.
</P>
<P>
Other strong December-to-December production gains included
aircraft, 13.8 percent; semiconductors, 40.1 percent; industrial
equipment, 11.1 percent; iron and steel, 9.2 percent; and
electrical machinery, 19.5 percent. But leather products, down 9.5
percent December-to-December, and tobacco, down 1.1 percent, were
among the few sectors showing decline.

BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, who is also defense minister, Friday requested that the
United States extend the payment period of Thailand's debt owed
for the purchases of American arms and military equipment.
</P>
<P>
Chuan sought the extension during talks with visiting US

understands the economic problems Thailand is facing and that the
U.S. will be cooperative with Thailand on the debt repayment
issue.
</P>

Cohen said the US will send a negotiating team in 10 days to
Thailand to discuss the matter in detail, according to Thai Deputy
Defense Minister Gen Vattanachai Wuthisiri, who was present at the
talks.

Thailand owes the United States hundreds of millions of US
dollars for the purchases of aircraft, frigates, tanks and
communications equipment.

<HEADLINE>   Daimler-Benz to Re-Launch A-Class Cars on February 9 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Daimler-Benz AG said Friday
its car unit Mercedes-Benz will resume its delivery of its ill-fated
A-Class subcompact car on February 9 after improving its safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
The company made the remarks in an interview with German press
agency DPA.
</P>
<P>
The A-Class car, dubbed "Baby Benz", made its market debut last
autumn but was recalled later after several of them flipped over on
sharp turns during safety tests last October.
</P>
<P>
Mercedes-Benz has since refitting about 10,000 A-Class cars with
an electronic balancing system as well as lowered bodywork and wider
tyres.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the basic price for the improved version of
A-Class would remain unchanged at about 30,000 marks (some 16,500 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In December, Mercedes said that it had 100,000 orders on its books
for the car, while 4,000 customers had cancelled their orders.
</P>
<P>
The Mercedes' factory at Rastatt near Stuttgart planned to start
out at 200 cars a day and raised the production to 800 daily as
quickly as possible.

<HEADLINE> UK to Publish Name List of Wartime Assets Confiscated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The British government is to
publish a full name list of some 25,000 companies, partnerships
and individuals whose assets were confiscated by Britain during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
All these names to be unveiled were nationals of Germany or
countries allied with Germany in the war, but many of them were
victims of the Nazis, according to a report in today's Financial
Times.
</P>
<P>
Campaigners have been urging the British government to
compensate up to 25,000 victims of the Holocaust whose assets
worth some 600 million pounds (about 990 million U.S. dollars) had
been confiscated by Britain after the war.
</P>
<P>
Lord Haskel, a government official, said that the government
would also publish a detailed report outlining the history of
Britain's handling of property owned by nationals of enemy
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1939 Trading with the Enemy Act, all assets invested
in Britain by enemy nationals, including victims of the Nazis,
were seized by the Custodian of Enemy Property.
</P>
<P>
Lord Janner, chairman of the British Holocaust Education Trust,
hailed the government announcement as a "landmark in the campaign
for justice and restitution for Holocaust victims."
</P>
<P>
"We want the names to be published very swiftly. The (British)
government should establish a procedure at once to enable any
victims, heirs or families who believe they lost money to make a
claim," he said.

<HEADLINE> Police Bugging Law Approved by German Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany's lower house of parliament,
the Bundestag, Friday approved a bill to allow German police to bug
criminal suspects in combating the country's rising crime.
</P>
<P>
The bill was worked out by the ruling party and the main opposition
Social Democrats (SPD) a week ago. Some deputies voted against it for
fear of police abuse. The opponents included the Greens Party and some
members of the Free Democratic Party, which is the smaller partner in
the Bonn ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Prospects remains yet uncertain for the legislation which still
needs the approval by parliament's upper house, the Bundesrat, which
represents Germany's 16 federal states. The five states co-ruled by
SPD and the Greens are expected to either abstain or vote against it.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, which requires a change in the German
constitution, judges could approve police installing listening devices
in homes of suspects of serious crime, and of people who might carry
out major crimes, such as terrorism against the public.
</P>
<P>
However, police would be barred from bugging conversations between
criminal suspects and religious figures or their lawyers. The use of
information bugged from doctors and lawyers would also be limited.
</P>
<P>
The issue of police bugging had been debated in Germany for years
and such a need was made more acute only in the 1990s by increasing
organized and violent crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
Violent crime in Germany increased by 5.5 percent in 1996, showed
the latest available data. The number of crime cases involving the use
of firearms grew to 13,479 in 1996 from 12,855 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
German police launched 845 investigations into suspected organized
crime in 1996, compared to 787 in 1995. The economic losses organized
crime incurred were estimated around 2.7 billion marks (1.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Make Test Tube Aurora </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- British scientists announced
today that they've actually produced an aurora, the phenomenon
usually observed at the Earth's north and south poles, in the lab.
</P>
<P>
The results, achieved by researchers at University College
London (UCL), bear a striking resemblance to images seen on giant
planets, the UCL said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Auroras on earth are formed when fast-moving electrons, thrown
out in the solar wind from the Sun, hit the Earth's upper
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
In the experiment, which carried out in a vacuum chamber,
electrons from a filament are accelerated towards a charged sphere
which imitates the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Inside the sphere is a magnetic coil which, when switched on,
concentrates light towards the "poles" just like a real aurora.
</P>
<P>
The experiment also shows how magnetized planets are shielded
from solar winds by their magnetic fields which, in turn, funnel
electrons into high latitude auroral zones to create the aurora
effect.
</P>
<P>
Pictures produced recently by the Hubble space telescope show
that auroras are also available on the planet of Jupiter and
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
"The results from this experiment will throw more light on how
Saturn's aurora forms," said Dr Andrew Coates, who leads the
aurora lab project at UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- National Secretary of the French
Communist Party (PCF) Robert Hue said today that the PCF intends
to become "a pole of social success" to push the Socialist
government to respond to the demands of the people.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the press, Hue said that the PCF has "a
vaster ambition" than being the "itching powder" or the "prickle"
of the leftwing majority, and instead it wants to "create the
condition for the success of change."
</P>
<P>
"We will work for the success of the majority... and play a
constructive role. The PCF is determined to do its best in playing
this role during the year 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that with the arrival of "a new phase of national life"
after the leftwing came to power in June 1997, the PCF, which has
joined the government for the first time since 1981, is the
intermediary between the government and social movements.
</P>
<P>
He again called on the government to raise the minimum social
welfare aid, which he described as "an agonizing social
emergency."
</P>
<P>
He described as insufficient the recent offer of 1 billion
francs (166 million U.S. dollars) by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
to the unemployed, but expressed his confidence in the prime
minister's "capability to understand."

HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced today it was releasing 450 million Zimbabwean Dollars
(27 million U.S. Dollars) in crucial balance of payments support
to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission, the executive arm of the European
Union (EU), also gave stern warning that Zimbabwe's 1997/98
budget deficit should not exceed 8.2 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The money comes after intensive consultation between the
commission and Harare to help reinforce market confidence.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a statement released by the EU office in
Harare, "the European Commission expects the government of
Zimbabwe to pursue its program of economic reform and fiscal
consolidation and strongly stresses that sound business
confidence and increased private investment are key elements for
sustained economic growth and poverty reduction."
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean cabinet a few weeks ago approved a document
detailing strategies of implementing a plan on the economic
structural adjustment program (ESAP) which ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe program for economic and social transformation
(Zimpest) set to rejuvenate the employment creation and
investment and it also has the task of fulfilling some targets
missed during the first phase of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
Zimpest seeks to achieve an annual six percent GDP growth in
a drought year and a whooping 10 percent in a good year as well
as bring down the budget deficit to 6.5 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Price of Mealie-Meal Goes up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The price of mealie-meal,
Zimbabwe's staple food, will go up by 21 percent Monday, the
third increase in two and a half months, a senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
National Foods Managing Director Ian Kind told the Zimbabwe
News Agency that the recent increase was prompted by the drying
up of maize sources, forcing the grain marketing board to release
maize to millers from the strategic grain reserve.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FSA Announces New Rules on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Services Authority
(FSA) announced today it has made rules extending cancellation
rights to investors buying shares in Open Ended Investment
Companies.
</P>
<P>
The FSA, launched last October by Chancellor Gordon Brown, has
the responsibility for regulating banks, insurance and other
financial organizations.
</P>
<P>
The new rules it announced today will allow more flexibility
for firms when providing "cooling off" for the sales of life
products and units in regulated collective investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
The new rules with effect from 1 March 1998 will allow firms to
introduce more cost effective ways of informing investors of their
right to cancel investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
They will be able to combine their descriptions of cooling off
arrangements with other information, for example, "reason why"
letters, contract notes, key features documents or marketing
documentation.
</P>
<P>
Firms will also be able to give investors a range of options as
to how they exercise their right to cancel.
</P>
<P>
While allowing firms to exercise more discretion as to how and
in what form they disclose cancellation rights to investors, the
FSA's priority has been to make sure the rules offer the same
level of investor protection as before.
</P>
<P>
Firms will, therefore, be required to comply with certain
investor protection standards when describing cooling off rights
to customers.
</P>
<P>
All the descriptions have to meet four key criteria on clarity,
prominence, timeliness and comprehensiveness, the FSA said.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Leave Dozens Dead in Southeastern S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of corpses are now
littering on strategic highways in the interior, particularly in
the southeast of the country, commuters arriving in the capital
early today told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We are alarmed over this development," said one trader from
Bo, in the south.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities said the corpses were mainly those of
civilian passengers whose vehicles have been either ambushed by
Kamajor militiamen active in the southeast under the code-name of
"Black December" or those of soldiers and Kamajors killed during
clashes.
</P>
<P>
According to one report, over 25 corpses were lying on the
Bo-Freetown Highway by Thursday morning, near burnt out vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Kamajors ambushed a civilian truck, killing six
passengers suspected to be soldiers wearing plain-clothes. They
were stripped naked and abandoned 10 miles to Bo, one driver
said.
</P>
<P>
Eight naked corpses were also abandoned five miles to Bo on
Tuesday. A military communique said the discovery was made by
soldiers on foot patrol.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, "identifications are out as some
of the corpses are badly decomposed and it is not certain whether
it is safe to stay longer in such areas which are prime targets.
</P>
<P>
Few vehicles are now plying roads in the southeast although
buses of the State-owned Road Transport corporation are making
the runs.
</P>
<P>
Heavily armed soldiers are making routine patrols along the
highway, particularly the Bo-Kenema road which leads to the
diamond mining areas of Tongo and the country's breadbasket
District of Kailahun.
</P>
<P>
According to the Military High Command in Kenema in the east,
the Kamajors "have resorted to hit and run tactics making it
difficult for the army to engage them in direct righting."
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors are tribal hunters backing President T. Kabbah
who was ousted by the military regime now in power in Freetown.
They are fighting to restore the rule of Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Reveals Nuclear Industry Reprocessing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace today released a
confidential report presenting the actual figures for spent fuel
and plutonium to be reprocessed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, a total of 14,126.55 kg of plutonium
will be reprocessed by Cogema (France), while 4,180.84 kg are
planned to be reprocessed by British Nuclear Fuels Limited at
Sellafield (UK) during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Out of the quota to be reprocessed at La Hague, 6,953.71 kg
will be from the French utility EdF (Electricit de France), while
7,172.84 kg will belong to Swiss, German, Belgian and Japanese
utilities, Greenpeace said.
</P>
<P>
By far the largest quantity of plutonium will come from German
reactors, with 4,256.01 kg reprocessed during the year, it added.
</P>
<P>
In the case of reprocessing at the French plant of La Hague,
Japanese utilities will have 1,306.95 kg of plutonium reprocessed
during this year, said Shaun Burnie of Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
"This is despite the fact that there is no commercial demand
for plutonium in Japan at this time," added Burnie.
</P>
<P>
As little as five to seven kg of plutonium would be enough to
produce one nuclear weapon, Greenpeace believes the report will
allow those opposed to reprocessing to have a better insight into
the operations of the secretive plutonium industry.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Trying to Rejuvenate Sugar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique is aiming at an
annual production of 45,000 tons of sugar this year after its
sugar output dropped from 29,000 tons to 25,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Tiago Wandschneider, adviser for the Institute of National
Sugar Industry revealed that the heavy rain which flooded about
1,000 hectares of sugarcane farm last year was the reason for the
production decrease, reported Mozambican News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
Wandschneider said that the lack of a national policy for the
industry is another reason for the production drop.
</P>
<P>
The policy vacuum has enabled the country to import sugar from
abroad, thus squeezing out the national sugar plants from the
domestic market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic sugar market is estimated at 100,000 to 120,000
tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to unfold a new policy to levy
extra taxes on imported sugar, setting their imported price at
about 385 U.S. Dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
This will help the domestic sugar industry attract foreigners
to invest in the country's sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's sugar production reached its peak in 1972 with an
annual output of 325,000 tons, with only 45,000 workers. But now
there are 130,000 workers in the industry.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls to Achieve Peace Goal in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team ended three days
of talks with the military junta in Sierra Leone today calling on
all partners to the Conakry Peace plan including ECOWAS and OAU
"to redouble their efforts to achieve the goals" of the Accord.
</P>
<P>
The team's leader, Francis Okello said at the press
briefing, "we are now half way toward the six-month plan but
there is still a lot of work to be done."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do that we will fall behind the deadline (April
22 ) that was specified in the Accord," he said.
</P>
<P>
Okello said, "there is too much suffering around, too much
fear. We need to give Sierra Leone a sense of direction to get
the constitutional order in place so that the era of peace can at
least dawn on Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy described the three days of talks as "good,
useful, open and constructive."
</P>
<P>
"We did not come here to negotiate or give or compromise any
thing but to discuss within the framework of the Peace Plan," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Five Foreign Ministers of the Economic Community of the West
African States (ECOWAS) signed the Conakry peace accord with
the military Junta in Sierra Leone which toppled a civilian
regime led by President T. Kabbah in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Conakry accord signed last October demanded that the junta
hand over its power to the ousted civilian government by April
this year for a final end of the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Refutes Iraqi Allegations Over Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Friday categorically
rejected Iraqi statements over an Iraqi opposition leader's visit
to Kuwait, saying it is normal to receive religious scholars from
various Islamic countries during the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
This stance came in response to an Iraqi Information Ministry
spokesman's claim that "the visit implies a plan of aggression on
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi opposition leader Muhammad Baker Al-Hakim arrived
here last Sunday and is still staying. He has been received by
Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, Crown Prince and
Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah and a
number of religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the statement, an authoritative source in Kuwaiti
Foreign Ministry declared through official Kuwait News Agency that
the visit of Al-Hakim to Kuwait comes in the framework of Ramadan
month reception of religious leaders from various countries.
</P>
<P>
The source, who declined to be identified, said Al-Hakim used
to visit Kuwait during the holy month of Ramadan to meet Muslims
in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The source said that "categorically rejecting the Iraqi
statements, the demeaning way and intentions as well as the
insolence as to objective realities, Kuwait is aware that Iraq is
still determined to fabricate justifications for its aggression
and threats against Kuwait and its people."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iraq have tense relations since the seven-month
occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi troops in 1990. Kuwait was liberated
by the allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> EU to Extend Funding Program to Palestine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
expressed its preparedness to extend for another five years a
funding program to Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Marin, vice-president of the commission in charge of
external relations, told the press that the commission thought it
proper to extend the funding program.
</P>
<P>
"The extension can be justified politically," said Marin at a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
The European Union turned out to be the largest donor toward
the Mid-East peace process ever since the peace accord was signed
in Washington in 1993, with an amount of 1.68 billion ECUs in the
1993-1997 period, accounting for 54 percent of the total outside
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
The current aid program ends by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The commission vice-president said that it was just like a
company. The shareholders have their seats on the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
The commission was of the opinion that its assistance has been
instrumental in keeping the peace process alive and has helped in
the establishment of a Palestinian institutional capacity that
allows the Palestinian authority to carry out its basic functions
in a satisfactory way.
</P>
<P>
And the funding program has guaranteed a complementary role for
the EU in the Mid-East peace process apart from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the massive outside assistance, the Palestinian
per-capita gross national product has fallen by over 35 percent
over this period, unemployment more than doubled to over 42
percent from 20 percent and yearly trade losses amount to almost
300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though the commission intended to extend the funding program,
it also said that the extension can only be made on the basis of
analyses of the situation in Palestine and of risk assessment.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African navy
has for the first time appointed two black commodores, the
highest-ranking black members in the history, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issued by the navy as saying
that Brigadier J Mudimu and Brigadier M. Magalefa were being
transferred from the army to the navy on January 19, becoming the
navy officers equivalent of brigadiers in the army.
</P>
<P>
Mudimu was in charge of the integration of the ruling African
National Congress military wing, Umkhonto We Sizwe, into the
defense force.
</P>
<P>
Magalefa was a senior member of the Pan Africanist Congress
military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
"Their appointments to the management echelon of the South
African navy is a further step in the representation program of
the South African navy," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the next two years, both Mudimu and Magalefa will
undergo intensive naval training. The former is in the interim
being appointed as naval inspector general, and the latter chief
of naval staff intelligence, the report said.

<HEADLINE> EU Welcomes WTO Ruling on Hormone Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
hailed as a victory the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling on
the European Union's hormone ban.
</P>
<P>
The WTO's Appellate Body ruled that the EU has the right to
establish on a scientific basis a level of consumer protection
which it considers appropriate and which is higher than the level
resulting from international health standards.
</P>
<P>
The Appellate Body also upheld the EU view that the ban is not
inconsistent with other EU policies.
</P>
<P>
It found that the EU prohibition has not resulted in
discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.
</P>
<P>
But it maintained that the hormone ban in the EU is not based
on a risk assessment because the scientific studies do not focus
specially on residues in meat of hormone-treated cattle.
</P>
<P>
The Appellate Body agreed with the EU that the assessment of
the risk to human health is not a quantitative scientific analysis
by empirical or experimental laboratory methods associated with
the physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
The commission said today that it will now examine carefully
together with the other EU institutions and member states how to
implement the EU's international obligations, in particular with
respect to a new risk assessment along the indications given by
the WTO Appellate Body.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the Appellate Body ruling has made a
valuable contribution to the development of clearer rules for the
conduct of dispute settlement which should be pursued further at
the upcoming reviews of the relevant WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the Appellate Body report is an important
contribution to clarifying the rights and obligations of members
and is likely to increase the confidence of members in the dispute
settlement system of the WTO," said the commission.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Presses Peace Plan for S. Leone to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations special envoy
to Sierra Leone, Francis Okello, today called on all parties of
the Sierra Leonean crisis to redouble efforts for a peaceful
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The deadline of April 22 to end the peace process in the
country might not be met if all the parties concerned with the
implementation of the Conakry peace plan do not redouble their
efforts, Okello said.
</P>
<P>
Okello made the remarks at a press conference in Freetown,
capital of Sierra Leone, at the end of the three-day visit by a
UN fact-finding team led by him.
</P>
<P>
According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here, the envoy called on the partners of the peace
plan to get together and assist forcefully and drastically in the
implementation of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace plan signed in Conakry, Guinea last October,
the ruling military junta, which seized power in a coup last May,
will hand over power to ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by
April 22 this year.
</P>
<P>
But the junta said later the plan had become unrealistic,
citing hurdles such as the disarmament of its armed forces, the
release of the former rebel leader Foday Sankoh and Nigeria's
dominance in the west African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
However, Okello said: "I continue to hope that there is a
strong commitment on both sides that the accord should be
implemented within the framework that would be available to
restore peace to Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
That means the constitutional order should be actually brought
back in place and the legitimate government of President Kabbah
restored to power, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the main purpose of the visit to Sierra Leone, Okello said
the eight-member team had had three days of successful working
visit to assess the infrastructures in Sierra Leone for the
deployment of UN military observers.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Delegation Visits Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Congressman John Porter
has expressed the view that Cyprus' European Union (EU)
accession process may help move negotiations for a political
settlement forward on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides
Friday, Porter, who is heading a four-member delegation visiting
Cyprus, said Cyprus' EU prospect would help achieve the
reunification of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, he described as "very difficult" the situation after
the EU Luxembourg summit meeting in December. The meeting decided
to open accession talks with Cyprus in April and keep Turkey out.
</P>
<P>
Porter said he discussed the issue during a meeting with
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congressman said his country has placed the solution
of the Cyprus problem "at a very high priority".
</P>
<P>
"Congress will make it a very high priority doing whatever we
can to help provide the environment that can make for successful
negotiations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Porter pointed out that there are suspicions and mistrust
between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"What we think is to alleviate those suspicions and get people
understand that they are in a secure position and can work through
negotiations," the Congressman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress delegation, part of the U.S. Commission
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, has already visited
Athens and will visit Ankara after it ends its trip to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
landed troops and seized the northern third of the island in the
wake of a coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> EU to Fund Cambodia Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today said
that it would contribute 9.5 million ECUs (10.5 million U.S.
dollars) to the preparation and implementation of elections in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to train Cambodian election officials,
to provide independent observers to the electoral process, and to
train local journalists to ensure valid coverage of all opinions.
</P>
<P>
But the 15-nation union has reserved the right to suspend these
activities if other key factors that would permit free and fair
elections are not put into place.
</P>
<P>
The EU has contributed to the electoral processes in South
Africa in 1994, in Palestine in 1996 and in Bosnia-Herzegovina in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Paris Peace Accords in October 1991,
the EU has sought to support the reconstruction process in
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Financial, technical and humanitarian assistance worth over 170
million ECUs has been channeled into such priority areas as
agriculture, education, health, the environment and institution
building in the Asian country.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Boost Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is taking measures like
introducing preferential tax rates to boost the crestfallen stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Friday after a meeting with the heads of the Cyprus
Stock Exchange (CSE), stockbrokers and the Cyprus Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, Finance Minister Christodoulos
Christodoulou announced four measures to increase the volume of
transactions at the CSE.
</P>
<P>
Under the first measure, he noted, offshore companies will
be allowed to invest in listed companies' stocks, keeping their
status as offshore companies.
</P>
<P>
The second measure provides that the tax rate of companies,
which will seek listing within the four coming years, will be cut
by 50 percent for five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The third provides that the cost of acquisition of new-listed
shares will be partly exempt from tax.
</P>
<P>
The fourth is that Greek companies will be allowed to seek a
CSE listing, which will offer new opportunities to Cypriot
investors, Christodoulou said.
</P>
<P>
According to CSE Chairman Dinos Papadopoulos, the new
incentives would lead to the listing of new companies.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus stock market, which became official in March 1996, saw a
bad year in 1997 as investors feared a slowdown in the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, local economists have forecast a better year for the
stock exchange in 1998 as the Cyprus economy is expected to have a
better performance with growth rate predicted at a four percent.

<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- British investment in Nigeria
has amounted to 3.48 billion U.S. dollars, the British High
Commission (embassy) said today.
</P>
<P>
The figure comes from a recent survey of 39 major companies
with significant amount of British interest, according to the
current edition of "The Trade", a British embassy publication.
</P>
<P>
Only companies each with a turnover of one million dollars are
incorporated in the survey, it said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 39 companies, 22 are quoted and 17 are private ones,
with those engaged in the field of oil and gas having the highest
level of British interest at 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the publication, the combined market
capitalization of British interest represented by the shares of
the 22 listed companies on the Nigerian stock exchange stands at
570 million dollars, accounting for about 13.2 percent of the
total in the bourse.

<HEADLINE> Four Soldiers Sentenced to Death in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The military high court,
sitting in Gitarama, central Rwanda, has sentenced four army
soldiers to death today, according to Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The four, all privates, were charged with the murder of a
former Rwandan government officer, Captain Theoreste
Hategekimana, in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the time of his murder, Captain Hategekimana was commanding
the Gilarama-Kibuye Gendarmerie Brigade.
</P>
<P>
The four soldiers ambushed his vehicle at Kabgayi, 5 kms south
of Gitarama, on the Kigali-Butare road, killing him and his
escort.
</P>
<P>
Security forces had then arrested the murderers as well as
four army officers on suspicion that the latter were the real
masterminds while the soldiers were executants.
</P>
<P>
In their defense, the four officers rejected charges
connecting them with the assassination of their colleague, while
the soldiers claimed they killed an enemy.

THE HAGUE, the Netherlands, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-nine
specialists from 37 countries today gathered at Ypenburg to attend
a training program of the Organization for the Prohibition of
Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
</P>
<P>
The training course, to conclude within six months, includes
extensive traveling to various institutions specializing in
chemical weapons as well as in chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The OPCW expects to select from the trainees highly qualified
professionals from a broad range of member states to make them an
integral part of the organization's inspectorate.
</P>
<P>
It is the second such training course organized and conducted
by the OPCW. The first one organized last year resulted in the
recruitment of 122 inspectors and four inspection assistants.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,500 applications for the second training course
were received by the OPCW. The applicants included specialists in
chemical weapons and munitions, chemical production technology,
chemical production logistics, medicine and emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The OPCW is expected to finally employ 211 inspectors. It now

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Prepares Proposal on Turkish-Cypriot Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will
put forward a proposal on Turkish Cypriots' participation in
Cyprus' membership talks with the European Union (EU), due to
start in April, Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Kasoulides said "there is
no chance that we shall ever accept to start accession talks
under the banner of two communities."
</P>
<P>
He explained that the EU itself also stresses that such a
procedure is legally unacceptable as the European body does not
negotiate with communities but with recognized states.
</P>
<P>
During his recent talks in Athens, Kasoulides said, the
parameters of how to achieve Turkish Cypriots' participation in
accession negotiations were set out. But he refrained from
revealing any details.
</P>
<P>
This, however, he said, should be done without contravening EU's
position that it will carry out negotiations with the
internationally recognized government of the Republic of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU full membership in
1990. The EU summit in Luxembourg last December decided to begin
accession negotiations with Cyprus in April.
</P>
<P>
But Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash reportedly refused to
recognize the membership application the Cypriot government has
submitted to the EU and also refused to participate in the
official delegation of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also expressed welcome to recent statements by EU
Council President, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook that a
solution to the Cyprus problem is not a condition for the
republic's accession to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island following a
failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Increase Market Share in W. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to increase its
market share in west Africa and a new company has been set up
with the support of the British government for the endeavor in
the oil and gas sector.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the U.K. West African Action Group
(UKWAAG) is an initiative in response to a growing interest from
international oil and gas exploration companies in the tremendous
potential in the west African market, the British High Commission
(embassy) in Nigeria said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the current edition of "The Trade", an embassy
publication, UKWAAG is a market initiative formed through a
partnership between British industry and government to promote
British capabilities and interests in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The main focus was initially on oil and gas sector in Nigeria
and Angola markets, it said.
</P>
<P>
UKWAAG, which is less than a year old, has a number of British
oil and gas supply and service companies as members, and more
companies are being encouraged to join and take advantage of the
combined resources, market information and export initiatives
from the group.
</P>
<P>
The aims and objectives of the group also include coordinating
action between British companies in pursuit of large oil and gas
projects.
</P>
<P>
One of its first action in Nigeria would be to mount a trade
mission to the west African country, expected to take place in
Lagos in late March this year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Croatia to Dedicate Itself to Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- It is for the people and
the Republic of Croatia to dedicate themselves to the permanent
reintegration and reconciliation of the whole population, UN
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the ceremony marking the end of the mandate
of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern
Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES), Annan said this
ceremony marks the return of the region to the sovereign control
of the government of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said the return is only the beginning of
a greater, more important return: the return of civility,
democracy, and the respect for life and liberty in the region.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief stressed the reintegration and reconciliation of
the whole population will not be easy or immediate. It is fraught
with dangers and will always require the good will of those
affected. It is the central, deciding condition of a lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted it is for the people and the Republic of Croatia to
dedicate themselves to the permanent integration and
reconciliation of the whole people.
</P>
<P>
On November 12, 1995, following four years of hostilities and
suffering, the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia,
Baranja and Western Sirmium was signed. In January 1996, the
UNTAES assumed the authority over the region.
</P>
<P>
The UNTAES ended its mandate on January 15, 1998 after having
accomplished its key objective of peacefully reintegrating the
region into Croatia within the prescribed time frame of two years.
</P>
<P>
From January 16, 1998, the UNTAES will be succeeded by a
supporting group of 180 civilian United Nations police monitors,
mandated for a single period of up to nine months. The group is to
continue monitoring the performance of the Croatian police in the
Danube region and the return of displaced persons.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Demand Forecast to Fall Due to Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Total world oil demand this year
is forecast to fall significantly because of the recent Asian
economic and financial crisis, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports were based on figures offered by the Pairs-based
International Energy Agency's monthly oil market report.
</P>
<P>
The agency, which monitors global oil trends on behalf of the
main Western industrialized countries, was quoted as having
lowered its forecast of total world oil demand this year to 75.34
million barrels a day, 280,000 barrels a day less over last
month's estimate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency cut its forecast for demand in Asia,
excluding Japan and China, by 230,000 barrels a day to 9.39
million.
</P>
<P>
It had earlier before expected world oil demand to grow by
about 2.5 percent this year to 76 million barrels a day after
nearly 3 percent growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency said in its latest report that this year's
global growth is now expected to be slower at 1.64 million barrels
a day or 2.2 percent because of Asia's financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
It added that the oil demand could be affected even more if
Asian economies deteriorate further or the impact of the Asian
crisis outside the region becomes significant.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's RP Leader Barred From Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Turkey's largest
political party and the former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan is
barred from politics for five years under a Constitutional Court
rule Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court, the top justice in Turkey, declared the closure of
Erbakan's Welfare Party (RP) on charges of destroying the nation's
secularism.
</P>
<P>
The court's decision was made after a eight-month-long
controversial campaign against the pro-Islamic party.
</P>
<P>
The President of the Constitutional Court Ahmet Necdet Sezer
announced that the court members voted for the closure of the
party with nine votes for and two votes against.
</P>
<P>
Six other RP members were also deprived of their rights for
engaging in political activities for five years, according to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
Sezer said that the court shuts down the RP as it seriously
violated the constitutional principles of secularism, adding that
"It is unthinkable to have a democracy without political parties,
but it does not mean that no limits should be put on them."
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the RP closure, a new pro-Islamic Virtue
Party was set up on December 17, 1997 by some people with close
ties to the RP.
</P>
<P>
The veteran politician Erbakan and five other RP deputies will
lose their seats in the parliament and immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
On the court decision for the RP closure, Erbakan, 71, said
that "such a decision is an incident of the grave law."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu Ciller, who
served as deputy premier during the joint government led by
Erbakan from June 1996 to June 1997, said the DYP is against the
RP closure.
</P>
<P>
The RP won 21.32 percent of the vote in the general elections
in December 1995 with the basic support from villages and urban
slums.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan resigned as prime minister last June under pressure
from the pro-secular military and other Western-style leaders who
criticized him for his reluctance to take tough measures against
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was borne in Sinop, northern Turkey, and he started his
political career in 1967 and later became the chairman of the
National Order Party. After this party was banned by the
Constitutional Court, Erbakan went abroad and stayed out of
politics for a while.
</P>
<P>
He returned to Turkey and continued his political career with
the National Salvation Party. This party was also closed with
other political parties during the military coup on September 12,
1980 and Erbakan was imprisoned in a military jail for a few years.
</P>
<P>
Following his release, Erbakan joined the RP, which was
founded on July 19, 1983, and became the leader of the party in
1987.

<HEADLINE> Greece Willing to Help Resolve Kosovo Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Greece today expressed its
willingness to help resolve the Kosovo problem which often leads
to violence due to renewed calls by the Albanian minority for
independence from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at parliament today, Greek Alternative Foreign
Minister George Papandreou said that Athens would be willing to
host Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Albanian Prime
Minister Fatos Nano and the leader of the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, within the framework of any effort to
resolve the problem of large Albanian minority living in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
As for Greece's position towards the Kosovo problem, he said
that Greece opposed Kosovo's independence from Yugoslavia and
respected the borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
coupled with prospects for wide-ranging autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million people and
violence there has been escalating recently following the
non-implementation of an education agreement reached between
Milosevic and Rugova.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Milosevic revoked Kosovo's autonomy.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, Milosevic and Nano had for the first
time in 50 years discussed the Kosovo problem on the sidelines of
the first summit meeting of the Balkan leaders, which took place
on the Greek island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
No substantial progress had been made during their meeting, but
both sides agreed to continue their contact on the problem.

UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The 18th session of the
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the
only United Nations human rights treaty body that deals
exclusively with women's rights, will take place at the UN
Headquarters in New York from 19 January to 6 February.
</P>
<P>
During its forthcoming session, the committee will review the
reports of eight states parties to the Convention on the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which

1981.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which as of January 1998 had been ratified or
acceded to by 161 countries, requires states parties to eliminate
discrimination against women in the enjoyment of all civil,
political, economic and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
Countries that have ratified or acceded to the convention are
legally bound to put its provisions into practice. They are also
committed to submit national reports, one year after becoming a
state party and then at least once every four years, on measures
they have taken to comply with their obligations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to reviewing reports and evaluating the progress
made, the committee will formulate general recommendation to the

<HEADLINE> Canada Welcomes WTO's Report on EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Canada welcomed Friday the
ruling by the World Trade Organization (WTO) that the European
Union's (EU) on imports of Canadian beef violates international
trade obligations.
</P>
<P>
Canada has not been able to export beef to the lucrative
European market since 1989, when the EU imposed a ban on beef
produced with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
Canada requested a WTO dispute settlement panel in 1996 after
direct talks with the EU failed to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
A WTO panel ruled in favor of Canada last summer. The EU
appealed, arguing that it has a right to set higher standards for
food safety.
</P>
<P>
Again, the WTO appeals body ruled that the EU didn't fully
justify the ban with its arguments.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important step forward toward resolving this
long-standing issue," said Canadian International Trade Minister
Sergio Marchi.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the EU to act quickly on the Appellate Body
findings," the minister was quoted as saying in a government
statement.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue every avenue to have the EU market reopened to
Canadian beef," vowed Canada's minister of agriculture Lyle
Vanclief.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has worked out a new
housing initiative by setting up a revolving housing fund to
construct new houses and upgrade old ones, President Frederick
Chiluba announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He told the opening session of the parliament that new houses
to be built will be sold to public workers like soldiers, health
workers, teachers and other people who will not benefit from the
on-going sales of council and government houses.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will continue to implement its policy
to empower people to own houses, adding that the private sector
should take the lead in the provision of houses so that every
Zambian can have decent accommodations.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme will also involve upgrading shoddy
townships that have mushroomed due to high urbanization.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted with sadness that while the government's
intentions to sell houses to sitting tenants is well meant, some
selfish individuals want to take advantage of the exercise and
amass wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will open housing market to public and
private and make housing prices affordable for Zambians.
</P>
<P>
The council and government started to sell houses to sitting
tenants late 1996 as part of its new housing policy to support
home ownership.

In the interview broadcast on January 8, Khatami called for
dialog between the Iranian and American nations while stating
that Iran "feels no need to have ties with the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Khatami's remark was considered as a signal from the Iranian
government for resumption of relations severed in 1980 following
the occupation of the American embassy in Iran by Iranian students.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. Administration announced no change in its
policies towards Iran and conditioned any official dialog between
the two governments on an end to Iran's sponsorship of terrorism,
its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and opposition to the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei today rejected
talks or ties with the U.S., saying that any talks or ties with
the U.S. would be harmful to the Iranian nation and the Islamic
system.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the claim that Khatami's interview was an
indication of Iran's desire for rapprochement with the U.S.,
lashing out at the U.S. Administration and the American media for
making "hue and cry" over Khatami's interview.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here said that Khamenei's harsh remark was a
response to the repeated accusation of the U.S. government
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
Reza Khatami also said Friday that Washington's "repetition of
the empty claims against Tehran is a clear signal that the
U.S. is not willing to make any changes in its policies towards
Iran."
</P>
<P>
He termed the recent U.S. government's decision to study the
subject of sanctions on Iran, easing of visas for the citizens of
the two countries and the release of the frozen Iranian assets in
the U.S. as "minor steps in the direction of good intentions."
</P>
<P>
However, even if such measures were to materialize, they were
but minimal in nature for the removal of the bulky wall of
mistrust existing between the two nations, brother of the Iranian
President added.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese, Syrian Presidents to Meet on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
is scheduled to visit Syria Saturday to discuss with his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al Assad the Middle East peace process and
Lebanese internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders will address Israel's
proposal on conditional withdrawal from south Lebanon and
coordinate their positions on the issue, independent Central News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Israel proposed that it will withdraw from
south Lebanon provided arrangements are agreed by Lebanon to
protect Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected Israel's proposal, saying it is aimed at
separating the Lebanese track from the Syrian track in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he knew from
Lebanese sources that Lebanon is willing to accept the Israeli
offer if Syria allows it to do so, adding that Lebanon is in fact
a satellite of Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has 40,000-strong troops stationed in Lebanon, has
been enjoying special relations with Lebanon. The two countries
have vowed to conduct peace talks with Israel simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
During Hrawi's stay in Damascus, Assad will brief Hrawi on his
recent meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak which was
held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Mubarak discussed the latest developments in the
region and the upcoming separate talks between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat next week.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's internal affairs, especially the cooperation among
the country's troika, namely, Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berry
and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, will be also on the agenda of the
talks between Hrawi and Assad.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has rejected a proposal to set up a coalition government in
Russia, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the presidential spokesman told a
briefing in the Kremlin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The president does not regard the idea of a coalition
government as plausible or interesting," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal for a coalition government to represent the
parliamentary majority was made by Speaker of the State Duma
(lower house of the parliament of Russia) Gennady Seleznyov in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov said recently the proposal would be submitted to
Yeltsin before the president and the Prime Minister hold their
next routine meeting with the heads of both houses of parliament,
scheduled for late January.

ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek fishermen and sponge
divers today continued to blockade island and mainland ports in
protest against the new tax regulations.
</P>
<P>
Before the new tax regulations, Greek fishermen were exempt
from paying value-added tax (VAT) on their catch, but under new
tax regulations they would have to pay an estimated one to two
million drachmas (about 3,500 to 7,000 U.S. dollars) a year in
additional taxes.
</P>
<P>
Five days ago, the fishermen began blocking the ports of the
eastern Aegean islands of Leros, Patmos, Naxos, Kalymnos, Iraklion
and Santorini.
</P>
<P>
The blockades would be extended to the islands of Ikaria, Samos
and Fournoi as of today, a fishermen's union spokesman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has withdrawn cases which accused several religious leaders of
ridiculing other religions, in a move to avoid conflict between
different religions.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Police (IGP), Omari Mahita, said in a
statement issued in Dar es Salaam today that the government's
decision follows an appeal made by Christian and Moslem leaders
to Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed when they met on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mahita said in the statement that the religious leaders who
have got involved in the cases include those who may soon appear
before the court and those who are still being investigated by
the police.
</P>
<P>
The religious leaders pleaded with the home affairs minister
for mercy at the Karimjee Hall in the city so as to open a new
chapter of co-operation between believers of the two different
creeds.
</P>
<P>
The government has announced that it will take stern measures
to punish people insulting religions of others, which is against
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at the meeting that the government has
become fed up with irate preachers bent at sowing hatred among
the people in Tanzania, a country which enjoys prevailing peace
and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting the religious leaders appealed to the
government to withdraw criminal cases facing some preachers, and
the minister promised to consider their request.
</P>
<P>
Mahita said he believes the government's decision to withdraw
the cases will act as a reminder for the preachers to refrain
from going too far.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 32 percent of residents in Tanzania
are Christians or Catholics, 30 percent are Moslems, while the
rest holding indigenous beliefs.

ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish civil court Friday
ordered that the opposition True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu
Ciller will be fined 101 million Turkish Liras (5,000
U.S. dollars) for defaming army corporals.
</P>
<P>
Ciller was accused of using the words "dishonorable corporal"
when accusing Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz for his collaboration
with the generals, semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court in Kayseri province said the fine is in compensation
to Corporal Idris Ciftci, who is serving in Anatolia, central
Turkey, for defaming his character.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, a former prime minister, has insulted the characters of
corporals, the court said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Ciftci, six other corporals have also sued Ciller for
the same amount of money as compensation, said the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ciftci said that he will donate the money to the Mehmetcik
Foundation in the armed forces.

<HEADLINE> 86 Kenyans Die in El Nino-Related Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 86 Kenyans have died
in floods in the last 24 hours caused by torrential rains which
have been hitting the eastern African country since November due
to the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"The death toll now stands at 86, with Coast (province)
reporting 38, Nairobi eight, and other provinces 40," police said
in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
The reported damage appeared to be the worst in recent years
in the country, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims were four children killed when their house
in Machokos district nearby Nairobi, was washed away and then
buried by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
In Garissa, North-Eastern Province, the Tana River burst its
banks, displacing 2,300 people.
</P>
<P>
"Garissa airstrip is under water and only helicopters can land
in Garissa. Mandera has reportedly 155 displaced families.
Further reports say that communication between the three
districts of Garissa, Mandera and Wajir is only possible by
aircraft," said the police statement.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-Mombasa highway, a major highway in the country,
was closed down last night after a 30-kilometer stretch was cut
off due to the raging floods.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpours since Wednesday evening have flooded the
already collapsing roads in many parts of Nairobi and submerged
houses in some middle-class neighborhoods and shacks in teeming
shanty towns for several hours.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also added to a deteriorating sanitary
situation in Nairobi, and initiated a fresh cholera outbreak in
western and eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi called for international help on
Thursday, adding that the government was starting emergency food
distribution to all areas under floods.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts said earlier this week that this year's long
rains season, which should start in Kenya in late March, may also
be replaced by a spell of drought.
</P>
<P>
Global forecast indicated that the El Nino weather phenomenon
has been on a downward trend worldwide since December and was
likely to end in May.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Iraq Ready to Resolve Disputes: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Iraq Saturday voiced
readiness to resolve their remaining disputes and differences, the
Iranian official news agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi stressed that
resolving the remaining disputes and differences between the two
neighbors would have positive effects on the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He further underlined that the two countries would need to show
political will and national inclination to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf, who arrived here Friday night for an official visit,
also expressed the will and political willingness of Iraq to
resolve disputes with Iran.
</P>
<P>
"We seek to improve relations between the two Muslim countries
and we wish to overcome our differences through peaceful
negotiations and in a friendly environment," said the Iraqi
minister.
</P>
<P>
Close relations and cooperation between the two countries will
lead to the establishment of regional peace and stability, besides
securing their national interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two ministers exchanged views on the
issue of prisoners of war, dating back to their brutal bloodshed
in 1980-88. Both agreed that the issue should be settled as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that al-Sahhaf's visit here coincided with the
rising tensions between Iraq and the United Nations Special
Commission over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad improved relations with Tehran in 1990 before the
U.S.-led coalition forces drove its occupation troops out of
Kuwait in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf was believed to have asked the Iranian government to
help in lifting the seven-year-old, crippling U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Announces Amnesty to Surrendered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A general amnesty for all
Kamajor militiamen who are willing to surrender to government
forces was declared in the southern Sierra Leonean city of Bo
Saturday, State Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Details of the amnesty were not made known but the radio said
the declaration was made by Captain Abubakarr Kamara, the
Secretary of State for the South, at a public meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to Kamara, "misinformation" has caused the strife
between Kamajors and government forces which led to a series of
violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary of State presented a captured Kamajor, Sennesie
Koroma to the meeting, saying that all captured Kamajors "will be
humanely treated and would not come to any harm."
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said it is unlikely that the Kamajors will
accept the amnesty offer which comes at a time of intense buildup
by the militia group mainly in the southeast under the code name
"Operation Black December."
</P>
<P>
Army officials admitted to Xinhua that the Kamajors "pose a
threat to peace and stability in the Bo-Konoma District axis."
</P>
<P>
"If this is not quickly contained, the situation can evaporate
to other areas in the east including Kailahun where there is a
strong presence of former rebel combatants of the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) now allied to the Sierra Leonean army," said a
military commander.
</P>
<P>
Casualty figures in various clashes are high and fightings
were sometimes brutal, according to human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
They recalled a recent incident near Zimmi in the south around
the border with Liberia where the heads of 16 soldiers cut off in
an ambush were paraded by dancing Kamajors.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this to frighten our adversaries to make them
scared," one activist quoted a Kamajor leader as saying over the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Kajamars are traditional hunters backing former President T.
Kabbah who was ousted in a coup last May by the military junta
now in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Military Commanders told Xinhua that they have "strictly
warned soldiers to deal with captured Kamajors as political
prisoners and not to ill treat them."
</P>
<P>
"We must not act as a warring faction but as a disciplined
force to defend the lives and property of all civilians," one
Commander said.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Airport Operational
Readiness (AOR) Program has moved into full gear following the
government's announcement that the new Hong Kong International
Airport at Chek Lap Kok will open on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the program is to provide a seamless
transition from construction to relocation and operation, said the
Airport Authority (AA), which oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
The program has been in place for many months to ensure that
all opening phase facilities are ready for operation, and that
some 45,000 personnel from the AA, 17 government departments and
more than 80 business partners are recruited and trained for their
duties.
</P>
<P>
The completion and commissioning of all opening phase
facilities, the mobilization and move to Chek Lap Kok and the
recruitment and training of staff are three broad areas of the AOR
program, each requiring a high degree of planning and
coordination.
</P>
<P>
A complex 90-day operation will take place for facilities and
staff to move from existing Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The "Night Move" will be the most challenging phase of the
operation. During the move, staff and equipment essential to both
airports' operations will be relocated in the few hours between
the closure of the old facility and the opening of the new one.
</P>
<P>
All modes of transport will be used during the relocation,
including derrick lighters, barges and roll-on roll-off vessels,
and hundreds of trucks. Low-bed trailers and even aircraft will be
used to move extremely large vehicles and loads such as aircraft
engines, foam tenders, push-out tractors, loaders and passenger
steps.

BRUSSELS -- With the Franco-Dutch row over the presidency of
the future European Central Bank (ECB) still not resolved, a new

The cause to the new row was the appointment of the six members
of the executive board of the ECB. The appointment was feared to
take into account the size of the EU member states and the

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and France will sign
three agreements this year to improve bilateral trade and
investment.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Zimbabwe Hadelin de La Tour-Du-Pin said
today that the two countries would soon sign a financial
protocol, under which over 240 million Zimbabwean Dollars (14
million U.S. Dollars) would be made available to the Zimbabwean
government to buy telecommunications and water supply equipment
from France.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries have already agreed on the protocol and
what is only left is the signing ceremony," he said, adding the
financial package would be part loan and part grant.
</P>
<P>
The second agreement, the ambassador said, would be an
investment and trade promotion accord which seeks to provide
security to investors from both countries.
</P>
<P>
"All the paper work has been done and we are hoping to sign
the agreement in the coming few weeks," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The third agreement, he said, would be for the establishment
of a French development fund to finance Zimbabwean rural water,
electricity and telecommunications projects.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and France have already signed a double taxation
treaty to protect investors from both countries from being taxed
by both governments.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade is currently in favor of France with
exports of mainly telecommunications and electronic equipment
worth approximately 700 million Zimbabwean Dollars (40 million
U.S. Dollars) while Zimbabwe exported in 1996 mainly
horticultural and agricultural products worth 350 million
Zimbabwean Dollars (20 million U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Rift Valley Fever Claims More Lives in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Amid the anarchy and
lawlessness in Somalia, the death toll by the Rift Valley Fever
is increasing as it is being seen in new places and towns around
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Southwestern region of Gedo records the highest number of
death due to the disease.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 people are reported to have died of the disease
in the town of Luq, about 350 km west of the capital Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to Ibrahim Mohamed Nur, the district commissioner of
Luq, the new fatalities have taken place in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the disease are mainly those who already lost their
properties during the recent floods that hit the region, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"They lost everything from farms to livestock," said Nur,
adding, "the situation is critical."
</P>
<P>
Also in the central region of Galgudud, five to eight people
die daily of the Rift Valley Fever, said Yussuf Mohamed Eyow, one
of the elders of the region. In the districts of Adado, El-Bur,
Galhareri, Guri-El and Abudwaq, 80 percent of the fever victims
are children under five.
</P>
<P>
One of the chief elders of Galgudud region who contacted the
journalists via VHF radio here in Mogadishu said people don't
know what they're dying of.
</P>
<P>
"Some people complain about liver pain and vomiting, malaria
and diarrhoea or any other disease they heard before," said Ugas
Abdulkadir Ugas Hashi, "It is a mysterious sickness which has
never been seen in history."
</P>
<P>
In the capital where cholera is also persistent, the Rift
Valley Fever is killing people in a sporadic way in many parts of
the city. Three people die of the disease in Mogadishu daily.
Doctors in the capital say the Rift Valley disease is now
spreading much faster than malaria.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Rift Valley Fever, the cholera epidemic is
still killing people in Mogadishu despite efforts by local health
authorities to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
The international aid agency of MSF-Spain and ACF-France have
provided large quantities of sodium solutions to fight
dehydration caused by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Each 500 ml. of sodium infusion which used to cost 15 U.S.
Dollars in the market is now sold a little more than three
Dollars, a relief for the cholera patients who could not make to
the four isolations camps which are operating with an overflowing
number of people.

<HEADLINE> Uganda States Its Stance on Sanctions on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda does not differ from
Rwanda on sanctions against Burundi, a spokesman of the Ugandan
president's spokesman said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni's position ''has been
consistent'' and it is aimed at bringing back Burundi and its
people into the democratic process and stopping the conflict in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denied there is a rift on this matter between
governments of Uganda and Rwanda, saying, ''I am not aware of the
disagreement with the Rwandan government.''
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an earlier Reuter report which claimed
that there is a rift between Rwanda and Uganda on the sanctions
against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an unnamed African diplomat as saying that
Uganda President Museveni wanted a tougher stance on the
sanctions forcing the Burundi authority to negotiate with Hutu
rebels in the country, but Paul Kagame, the Rwandan
vice-president, asked for a reprieve on the embargo during recent
visit by Museveni to his country.
</P>
<P>
The regional sanctions committee on Burundi is to meet in
Kampala soon to review the progress on implementation of the
embargo, said Steven Nabeta, the Permanent Secretary in Foreign
Ministry yesterday.
</P>
<P>
East and central African states backed by the Organization of
African Unity imposed sanctions in August 1996 on the Burundi
military regime which staged a coup on July 25 toppling the
civilian legitimate government in Bujumbura, forcingi it to start
talks with the Hutus in the country.

Administrative Region (HKSAR) government.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR's Chief Executive, Tung Chee Hwa, in his inaugural
policy address last October, put emphasis on information
technology, which he said is the tool that will shape the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
In a chapter titled "Connecting to the Information Age," Tung
said: "...the uses to which we are putting information technology
today in Hong Kong are only a foretaste of what will be possible."
He pledged to make Hong Kong a leader, not a follower, in the
information world of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Another keynote speaker at today's forum, To Cheuk Wah, an
entrepreneur of a Hong Kong-based high-tech company, told the
participants: "Recruiting the best and the brightest talents is
the key to the information age." One of Hong Kong's advantages is
that it can continue to attract the best experts and professionals
in the field.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers shared their views on how to apply the new
technology more efficiently and widely in all different sectors
ranging from business to public services and personal life.
</P>
<P>
Today's seminar was part of a series of events under the "Hong
Kong -- Connecting with the Information Age" campaign, organized
by Hongkong Telecom, Hong Kong's leading supplier of
telecommunications services.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong, Hong Kong and
Macao held their 12th annual seminar on hazardous weather which
closed here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hosted by Lam Hung-kwan, director of the Hong Kong Observatory,
the two-day meeting focused on the effect of El Nino on the
weather pattern in southern China and selected hazardous weather
cases experienced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The three parties also took the occasion to consolidate the
arrangement relating to the South China Sea Monsoon experiment and
the South China Rainstorm experiment to be carried out this
summer.
</P>
<P>
The South China Sea Monsoon experiment, an cooperative
scientific project involving many countries and endorsed by the
World Meteorological Organization, is to study the weather systems
associated with the southwest monsoon affecting the East Asia
region in spring and summer every year.
</P>
<P>
The South China Rainstorm experiment is a joint project
involving China's southern provinces and Hong Kong and Macao. It
focuses on the mesoscale rainstorm systems embedded within the
southwest monsoon and the monsoon troughs.
</P>
<P>
The annual seminar is held in turn in Guangzhou, Hong Kong and
Macao. The next seminar will be held in Macao.

SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics for
Shanghai's Pudong New Area show a GDP of 60.8 billion yuan for
last year, up 18.2 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The area, where flexible policies are being pursued to

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Allot Loans to Fight Water Hyacinth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
spend about 30 million Shillings (520,000 U.S. Dollars) on the
eradication of water hyacinth, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The money will be released in the next financial year starting
July 1, Natural Resources Minister Francis Lotodo was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Consultations were being held with the World Bank and other
experts on how to fight the weed and tenders for the procurement
of mechanical harvesters were opened last week, Lotodo said in
Kisumu Friday on a tour of the weed-infested Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The procurement of the harvesters is part of the 77.6 million
Dollars the World Bank is to offer Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
under the Lake Victoria Environment Management Program.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has so far got 32 million Shillings (554,600 US Dollars)
out of its 2.6 billion Shillings (45 million Dollars) share.
</P>
<P>
Sources said six firms have applied for the tenders, with
winners required to harvest 1,500 hectares of the weed at an
unspecified cost.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Farm Engineering Industries of Kisumu said
the company is capable of harvesting a hectare of the weed in
three hours.

NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A fresh cholera outbreak in
Busia and Kwale in western Kenya has claimed 54 lives in the past
two weeks, the Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
As many as 500 cholera patients in critical condition are
admitted to the local hospital in Busia District, Dr. Seth
Lifede, the Busia medical officer of health, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to control the outbreak of the epidemic in
Budalangi in the district due to the current floods and failure
by residents to observe hygiene, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the medical team was working round-the-clock to
ensure the disease do not spread to other parts of the district,
the doctor added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, operations at the Busia District Hospital are still
paralyzed as none of the institution's 185 striking nurses has
reported to work.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rains Cut Off Kenya's Major Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's a major road, the
Nairobi-Mombasa highway, was closed down on Friday night after a
30-kilometer stretch was cut off due to the raging floods caused
by the torrential El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The road, serving thousands of commuters daily, is a life line
between Mombasa and sections of the hinterland in Kenya, Uganda,
northern Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Congo (K). Mombasa
is one of the busiest African ports bordering the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The swollen Kambu River swept away a bridge near Kibwezi,
leaving no road link between the two largest cities in this east
African country until a new bridge is constructed, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Peter Kimanthi last night warned owners of
public and private vehicles against using the road until further
notice.
</P>
<P>
The police then had a hectic time controlling the heavy
traffic as vehicles coming from either Mombasa or Nairobi side
were turned back.
</P>
<P>
Two other bridges -- Athi River bridge connecting Kibwezi and
Kitui and Sofia Bridge linking Thika and Garissa -- were also
swept away during Thursday's downpour, said Kimanthi.
</P>
<P>
The only means of transport to Mombasa now is by air or train,
said the local press, adding that few people can afford the air
fares while transport by train is slow.
</P>
<P>
Heavy cargo from the Kilindini Harbor which is usually ferried
to the mainland in trucks will be badly affected following the
collapse of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Hours before the road was cut off, the Kenya Association of
Manufacturers warned that the collapsing infrastructure was "a
danger to the country's economic development" and asked the
government to take emergency action to save the road.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpours since Wednesday evening have flooded the
already collapsing roads in many parts of Nairobi and submerged
houses in some middle-class neighborhoods and shacks in teeming
shanty towns.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also added to a deteriorating sanitary
situation in the Kenyan capital, which was once rated one of
Africa's best-kept cities.
</P>
<P>
Nairobi was spared last November when the El Nino rains first
hit Kenya and wreaked havoc in Coast and North Eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
President Daniel arap Moi said Thursday the government was
starting emergency food distribution to all areas under floods.
</P>
<P>
This year's long rains season, which should start from late
March in Kenya, may also be replaced by a spell of drought,
experts predicted earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Global forecast indicated that the El Nino weather phenomenon
has been on a downward trend worldwide from December and was
likely to end in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has called for an intensified battle against countrywide
poverty, saying there is no liberty nor freedom in poverty, Times
of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in parliament Friday, Chiluba said his government is
determined to change Zambia for the better by fighting to
eradicate poverty.
</P>
<P>
There is no growth in an atmosphere of pervasive poverty
unless poverty was fought through responsible citizenship and
commitment, said the president.
</P>
<P>
However, Chiluba added that development is not an overnight
event but an incremental process that takes time and effort and a
clear vision.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also stressed the role of education, particularly in
economic and social development, saying without education, the
younger generation would not play their role as responsible
citizens and be able to contribute fully to the development of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The head of state challenged members of parliament to take a
keen interest in the education boards to arbitrate between the
competing and partisan interests of educators on the one hand and
policy makers on the other.
</P>
<P>
There is need to urgently resolve the conflicts that are
threatening the education system, he noted.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Commercial Airship Built in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg-based
Hamilton Airship Company will sell the world's largest commercial
airship to a South African company, local daily Saturday Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the airship will be secured within the next few
days. The buyer has expressed an interest in buying at least two
others in the near future, the report quoted an unidentified
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The engineering design of the 55,000 cubic meter airship is
now more than 80 percent completed, and assembly of the first
prototype is due to begin within the next few weeks, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that with a length of 129 meters, the airship
will be twice the size of a Boeing 747 aircraft and will be
capable of lifting loads of up to 60 tons. It costs about 25
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Project engineers believe that the first airship, which has
already been named "Nelson", will finally put South African
technology and engineering on the map.
</P>
<P>
"I think this (airship) will have the same impact that the
Concord had for Britain," said Graham Dorrington, chief engineer
of Hamilton Airship Company.

<HEADLINE> Mayors From Around World Meet In Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Winter in the northern part of
China can be a difficult season for most people, but the mayors of
some northern cities are meeting in Harbin, the capital of
China's northernmost province of Heilongjiang, to discuss how to
make their cities more appealing.
</P>
<P>
Mayors from the United States, Canada, Japan, Denmark, Finland,
and China are discussing ways to exploit their winter resources.
</P>
<P>
Shirley Rudolph Timm, vice-mayor of Canada's Winnipeg, said
that buses in her city have installed devices for the elderly and
children to help them avoid slipping. Emergency medical care is
also available round-the-clock, children can get computerized
teaching at home, and local newspapers encourage people to go
outside in winter, she said.
</P>
<P>
Harbin's Mayor Cao Guangliang says that the people of Harbin
are creative and can use ice and snow to produce a wonderland. In
winter, large chunks of ice are carved into human or animal
shapes, or in the shape of famous architectural structures and are
given color with modern sound and light technology. People can
easily ignore the chilly air by walking in this dreamlike world and
it keeps the winter season from being wearisome.
</P>
<P>
People can also be found swimming in a path of water cut from
the thick ice of the Songhua River, while others ride sledges, or
go skating on the ice. Youngsters can enjoy themselves in some
3,000 ice and snow sportgrounds.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, the city has sponsored ice and snow festivals to
attract tourists and to increase economic and trade exchanges with
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Rick Mystrom, the mayor of Anchorage in the American state of
Alaska, said that people in his city used to spend long and dull
winters, but in recent years, the local government and citizens
have been working to make the city bright at night.
</P>
<P>
Tourist projects with a distinct winter flavor have also been
introduced and entertainment facilities are being built to attract
tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
The idea about holding the conference among mayors of the
world's northern cities was first suggested by the mayor of
Sapporo in Japan in 1982. Up to now, such conferences have been
held eight times.

<HEADLINE> HK Plays Active Role in Protecting Intellectual Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- As an important financial and
trading center in the world, Hong Kong has been playing an active
role in the protection of intellectual property, Tung Chee Hwa,
chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a passing-out parade of Hong Kong's Customs and
Excise Training School, Tung said that after the establishment of
the SAR, Hong Kong continued to function effectively as a separate
customs territory under the existing trading systems and committed
itself to the successful implementation of the "one country, two
systems" concept.
</P>
<P>
"The Customs and Excise department undertakes a wide range of
responsibilities, including revenue collection, anti-narcotics and
anti-smuggling work, protection of intellectual property rights
and consumer interest, trade facilitation as well as trade
controls," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The department, which is also responsible for all operation for
the detection of pirated and counterfeit goods, works closely with
overseas law-enforcers as well as trademark and copyright owners
in its fight against acts of infringement.
</P>
<P>
"The service of the department in recent years has been
outstanding particularly in the area of protection of copyright
and trademarks," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Tung told more than 100 officers at the parade that he was
confident that they would continue to step up their action in
combating piracy and counterfeiting for the protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The Customs and Excise Department is a progressive and
forward-looking organization, moving forward into a new era and
will continue to play an important role in the SAR, Tung
concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Disappointed at Remaining on Copyright Watch List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government expressed its
disappointment on Saturday at remaining on the "Watch List" in
respect of protection of intellectual property rights (IPR).
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said that the SAR government had noted
that Hong Kong will remain on the "Watch List" according to an
"out-of-cycle" review just released by the United States Trade
Representative (USTR) on a number of countries which were listed
in the Special 301 Report for 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We note that the USTR has given due recognition to Hong Kong's
determination and effort to solve the piracy problem," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is not justified to include Hong Kong on
the 'Watch List,' in view of the considerable and persistent
anti-piracy efforts and initiatives the Government has made. We
are disappointed at such an announcement.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is totally committed to enforcing a robust IPR
protection regime, which is crucial to economic growth of Hong
Kong and our continuation as a leading regional and global trading
city.
</P>
<P>
"The Government has adopted a comprehensive strategy to combat
copyright piracy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy covers such elements as enforcement action at
retail, distribution and importation levels, implementation of new
legislative measures to strengthen enforcement capabilities,
tougher courts penalties on convicted copyright piracy offenders
and strengthened liaison with copyright industry and other IPR
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was referred to in the Special 301 Report for the
first time in April 1996 under the "Other Observations" category
and was downgraded to the "Watch List" in April 1997.

<P>
MACAO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao in the
whole year of 1997 dropped 13 percent from 1996, the Macao Government
announced.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Government Information Office said
Friday night that the number of tourists arrived in Macao added up
to 7,000,370 in 1997, down 13 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The release blamed the currency crisis in Southeast Asia and
less tourist arrivals to Hong Kong as the two factors leading to
the decrease.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of tourists from Hong Kong, including those
coming via Hong Kong, dropped from 74 percent in 1995 to about 60
percent in 1997, it said, adding that this means Macao's source of
tourists "becomes more multiple and internationalized."
</P>
<P>
A leading sector of the local economy, the tourism sector and
casinos contribute to about 40 percent of Macao's revenue income.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Government has decided to build more tourist and
cultural facilities, improve training of tourism professionals
and step up promotions overseas to woo more tourists in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Design for HK Government Complex to Be Chosen Through Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
announced Saturday that it has decided to choose the best design
for the proposed Government Secretariat to be built on the Tamar
basin reclamation site through open competition.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Pau Shiu-hung, director of the
Architectural Services of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
At a press briefing Saturday afternoon at the Government
Information Service Department, Pau introduced a model of the
proposed Government complex to reporters. The complex consists of
an attached building, two main towers and a square.
</P>
<P>
He said that the competition may be an international one but
the timetable and other details about the competition have not
been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Planning Bowen Leung said Friday that the Tamar
basin reclamation site will be withdrawn from the land sales
program and be earmarked for relocating the existing Government
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The site, located between the Prince of Wales Building and the
CITIC Tower, occupies an area of 2.56 hectares on the waterfront
of Victoria Harbor. About half of the site was scheduled for
auction in March 1998 under the 1997/1998 Land Sales Program.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that the Government Secretariat located in the
Central Government Offices at Lower Albert Road and Murray
Building at Garden Road has been experiencing a severe shortage
of space for some years.
</P>
<P>
The sites occupied by the existing Central Government Offices
and Murray Building have a total area of 2.43 hectares. They will
be considered for commercial use after the relocation of the
Government Secretariat.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain said here on Saturday Pakistan and China
enjoy special and time-tested relations which are role model for
the entire world.
</P>
<P>
Talking to a six-member delegation of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) led by Vice Minister Ma Wenpu, Mushahid said Islamabad
is grateful to Beijing for its support in times of test and on
issues pertaining to Pakistan's national security and economy.
</P>
<P>
"Pak-China friendship has not grown in greenhouse but it stood
trial and turbulence," he said, "it can be named as model
relationship between two neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Mushahid said Pakistan would never forget China's assistance
without attaching any political strings and conditions.
</P>
<P>
He said China, being a large country, has had good and friendly
relations with all its small neighbors and has never interfered in
internal affairs of other countries including Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The Information Minister greeted China on the peaceful return
of Hong Kong and termed it "victory for justice, human rights and
international law."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Islamabad's unflinching support to Beijing on its
position on the question of Taiwan, on so-called human rights
issue and on China's policies for preserving protecting its
territorial integrity against any foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation leader Ma Wenpu said in the meeting
Pakistan and China had all-weathered relations which remained
unaffected throughout the past decades.
</P>
<P>
Ma stressed the need for further strengthening of the
traditional ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for enhancing interaction between CPC
and the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N).
</P>
<P>
The visit of the Chinese delegation is aimed at promoting
mutual understanding and friendship between the people and ruling
parties of the two countries, Ma said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Official Says Austerity Measures Already </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary
Hector Villanueva said here Saturday that the Ramos Administration
has already taken concrete cost-cutting measures to bolster the
country's capability to cope with the current financial crisis
sweeping the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva was reacting to reports on various austerity
measures being proposed by some senators to ease the impact of the
currency crunch on the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Fidel Ramos has already issued strict
orders to all government offices to cut their expenditures by a
minimum of 25 percent as part of the austerity measures being
implemented by the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva said the different departments and agencies have
been tasked to determined on their own how such cuts would be
made, "but the bottom line is that such cost-cutting measures
should result in budgetary savings of at least 25 percent."
</P>
<P>
He said that while the government is not imposing a total ban
on foreign travel by government officials depending on the need
for such travels, "all unnecessary trips will be discouraged."
</P>
<P>
Exempted from the travel restrictions are diplomatic missions
arranged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and those involving
the World Trade Organization, International Labor Organization and
the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, all other travels that can be done away with will be
discouraged, Villanueva added.
</P>
<P>
He said the President himself has demonstrated the seriousness
of the government restrictions on foreign travels by canceling his
scheduled trip to Davos, Switzerland, late month to address the
World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Saturday, the Presidential Office
said that the president instructed Villanueva to explain the
austerity measures adopted by the executive branch in the wake of
reports that some senators have called for the scrapping of
"junkets" of government officials.
</P>
<P>
The office Saturday also re-published a series of
belt-tightening measures announced by President Ramos in his
administrative order early this month.

<HEADLINE> Intensify Bilateral Trade to Minimize Use of Dollars: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Malaysian Prime
Minster Mahathir Mohamad said here Saturday that Indonesia and his
country need to intensify their bilateral trade to minimize the
use of dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Because the quantity of dollars and other hard currencies is
limited, (our) bilateral trade must be increased," Mahathir told
newsmen after a one-hour meeting with President Soeharto at his
residence in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Saturday morning for a one-day visit to
discuss regional economic crisis with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also explained the results of the ASEAN
informal summit held in Kuala Lumpur last December where Soeharto
was absent due to heath reasons.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he is here to offer a solution to the ongoing
monetary crisis in Indonesia, he said the two countries should
stand together to increase their trade without using U.S. dollars
or other foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir did not make any comment on the just signed reform
package between Indonesia and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). "Indonesia decided these things on its own," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Indonesia will conduct a
wide-ranging economic and financial reform, including reviewing
the 1998/99 State Budget, curtailing government financial support
for the national car project and scrapping some agriculture
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, IMF agreed to provide 23 billion U.S.
dollars loans to Indonesia. In exchange, Indonesia vowed to
dismantle trading monopoly, overhaul the financial sector and
scrap or suspend costly infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF was reportedly dissatisfied over the
Indonesia's reforms in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, Malaysia agreed to provide a one billion
U.S. dollar loan to Indonesia to help the country resolve its
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir and Soeharto last met during the APEC (Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation) Economic Leaders Meeting in Vancouver,
Canada last November.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is the second ASEAN leader to meet Soeharto this week.
On last Tuesday (Jan. 13), the one-day visit of Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong also came here for an one-day visit to
discuss the economic situation in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, like other ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian
Nations) countries, has badly hit by the monetary crisis since
July last year. Its currency, the rupiah has lost more than 200
percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mahathir directly left the president's
residence for home.

<HEADLINE> Ski-jumper Goldberger Applies for Olympic Accreditation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Triple World Cup ski-jumping
champion Andreas Goldberger has applied for accreditation to
compete in the NAgano Winter Olympic Games, organisers said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese justice ministry has been studying documents on
the 24-year-old star, who was embroiled in a drug scandal, as
Japan usually prohibits anyone convicted of a drug offense from
entering the country.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of routine, we will consult the justice ministry
early next week," said Haruo Umegaki, head of the accreditation
section at the Nagano Olympic Organising Committee (NAOC), 21 days
before the opening of the Games.
</P>
<P>
"We will see if it is okay or not for us to proceed with
issuing an Olympic identification card for Goldberger," Umegaki
said.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Olympic committee submitted an application for
Goldberger's accreditation "only recently," the NAOC official said.
</P>
<P>
Applications for other Austrian Olympians have been filed
earlier, Umegaki said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Kokichi Shimoinabe said on Friday, "We shall
actively promote the Olympic Games but they should proceed under
rules. We have to check any problem that contraves rules."
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Vienna, Goldberger was fined 180,000
schillings, (about 13,000 dollars) by a Vienna court for
"possession of modest quantities of drugs" in 1996. He was
arrested with cocaine in his possession in a Viennese nightclub.
</P>
<P>
The court did not rule on whether Goldberger had taken the
drugs. Vienna authorities have since opened a judicial enquiry
against Goldberger for giving false evidence, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The management of a nightclub frequented by Goldberger said he
had taken cocaine on several occasions. Goldberger had said he
only took the drug once, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Goldberger attempted to compete for another country after he
fell out with the Austrian ski federation following his statement
on drug use.
</P>
<P>
But he rejoined the Austrian national team last month after a
seven-month suspension imposed by the federation.

<HEADLINE> Peg System Helps Stabilize Vietnam's Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the peg system
for the Vietnamese dong against U.S. dollar has helped stabilize
the country's domestic currency market, reported the "Vietnam
News" Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a year-end report by the State Bank of Vietnam
(SBV), commercial banks were allowed to widen the peg system from
plus or minus 10 percent of the official exchange rate last
October.
</P>
<P>
The report described the flexibility stemming from the widening
of the system as one of the bank's two major successes for 1997.
</P>
<P>
It had ensured no major fluctuations in the domestic currency
market, the report concludes.
</P>
<P>
The second success, says the report, is the bank's involvement
in settling Vietnam's commercial foreign debts through
negotiations with the London Club.
</P>
<P>
Also the bank listed its efforts in calling international
donors to grant Vietnam more official development assistance as
among its best performances for the year.
</P>
<P>
International and foreign donors have promised Vietnam about
2.4 billion U.S. dollars this year, almost the same amount as
provided the previous year, despite the regional economic crisis.

will be on the line in the next phase of development while
enterprises will be supported to innovate with multimedia. The
objective of the plan is to let France catch up in the field which

<HEADLINE> Iraq Threatens to Stop Cooperation with UN Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua)-- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
warned Saturday that the Iraqi government will stop cooperation
with U.N. inspection teams unless the U.N. remove the crippling
sanctions clamped on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide address marking the 7th anniversary of the
Gulf war on January 17, 1991, Saddam said Iraqi government has to
follow a recommendation by the National Assembly (parliament) and
is left with no other option to safeguard its interests and
expedite an end to the U.N. imposed embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's National Assembly last December set a six-month
deadline for U.N. Arms inspection team to close the files of
weapons of mass destruction or risk an end to their inspection
tasks in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi threat came at a time when a inspection team of the
U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) left Baghdad Friday as Iraq
suspended cooperation with the team accusing its leader, an
American, of being a U.S. spy. But other UNSCOM teams in Iraq
continued their work.
</P>
<P>
Last October, Iraq and UNSCOM were on collision course after
Baghdad expelled American members of UNSCOM teams, who it alleged
were implementing Washington's hostile policy and prolonging the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler responded by pulling
out all inspection teams from Iraq. The crisis was finally
defused by Russia who pledged to have Iraq's grievances
earnestly addressed by the U.N. Security Council and the U.N.
inspectors were allowed back into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Saddam urged Washington to reconsider its
policy against Iraq so that there could be a quick end to the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"America should not be disillusioned to believe it can harm
Iraq. They (Americans) would retreat day by day from the peak
which they thought they had attained when they ventured (to hit)
the impregnable Baghdad with the bombs and missiles of
aggression," said Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The president said that Iraq's call for the revival of Arab
solidarity is not motivated by a feeling of weakness or by fear
and concern about the future of Iraq alone, adding that this call
has made a favorable echo among some Arabs who understand Iraq
and its leadership.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq's struggle against American global domination is
a struggle for the interests of humanity, world states, First
and foremost third world countries must unite against American
oppression.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and expect our friends in the world would understand
us so that each would assume a role emanating from its
responsibility, towards what is necessary to bridle the evil and
establish justice", he said.
</P>
<P>
The president described the U.S. as an arrogant, selfish
blind force that seeks to achieve its narrow interests at the
expense of other nations and societies and called it a
spiteful new imperialism despite all the trappings that are
intended to hide its real evil and ruthless nature.

<P>
LONDON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading British newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Government is going to replace the practice of
sending psychiatric patients out into the community with a
mixture of hospital and community provision, saying that the
existing policy has led to the death of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair is preparing to make an official apology
for Bloody Sunday, when soldiers shot dead 13 people in
Londonderry on Jan 30, 1972.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and Britain stepped up pressure on Iraq after
France and Russia, which want to see the early lifting of
sanctions, sought to dilute the American presence in the
United Nations weapons-monitoring mission.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The world's biggest drugs companies are jointly
funding an international task force in an attempt to clamp
down on the spread of counterfeit branded drugs which have
left thousands of people in developing countries sick and
dying.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The prospects for European Monetary Union emerged from
the shadows this week as the Asian economies showed signs
of recovery.

<HEADLINE> EU Member States Divided Over ECB Executive Board </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- With the Franco-Dutch row over
the presidency of the future European Central Bank (ECB) still not
resolved, a new row has developed only a few months ahead of the
decision as to which countries will be included in the first train
of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The cause to the new row was the appointment of the six members
of the executive board of the ECB. The appointment was feared to
take into account the size of the EU member states and the
appointment mechanism has divided the members of the EU monetary
committee.
</P>
<P>
The matter will now have to be discussed, in a restricted
session, during the first council meeting of finance and economy
ministers of the EU.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is slated for next Monday in Brussels instead of in
London despite the fact that Britain is serving the six-month
rotating presidency of the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The Treaty of Maastricht states that the executive board of the
future ECB will be composed of six members of one president, one
vice-president and four other members.
</P>
<P>
The first train of the Euro will theoretically carry 11 of the
15 EU member states after Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece
either opted out or were dropped out due to financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
The number of participating countries in the single currency
obviously exceeds the number of places on the ECB board.
</P>
<P>
The Maastricht treaty also states that board members will have
to be chosen from "among persons of recognized standing and
professional experience in monetary or banking matters".
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said that all the board members could come
in theory from a single member state.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, therefore, has proposed setting up a system of
predetermined rotation or enshrining a principle of geographical
distribution among the larger and smaller countries in designating
the board members.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, that wants to reserve three places on the board for
smaller countries, fears that the larger countries will
automatically take up all the places within the board.
</P>
<P>
Usually, Germany, France, Italy and Spain are considered,
financially and economically, the larger countries to participate
in the single currency mechanism to be inaugurated on January 1,
1999.

<HEADLINE> Iran, France Express Concern over Algerian Massacres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran and France have expressed
their concern over massacres of defenseless people in Algeria,
calling for cooperation between the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) and the European Union (EU) to end the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Radio Saturday reported that Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi and his French counterpart Hubert Verdine
discussed the Algerian massacres Friday night in a telephone
conversation, calling on influential countries to help end
massacre of innocent people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that Algiers should not interpret interest
of other countries in halting the killing of defenseless people
in the country as intervention in Algerian domestic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Following the massacre of over more than 1,000 Algerian people
in recent weeks, Kharrazi have contacted with foreign ministers of
Italy, Syria, Morocco and Greece during the past several days,
expressing Iran's deep concern over the issue.

people.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Rejects Lebanese Interference in Its </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Algerian Ambassador to Lebanon
Hasan Bou Fares has rejected a recent Lebanese government offer to
help end his country's cycle of violence, saying Lebanon has no
right to meddle in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We reject any attempt by Lebanon to interfere in our internal
affairs," Bou Fares said at a meeting with Secretary-general of
Lebanese Foreign Ministry Zafer Hasan on Friday, the local paper
Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bou Fares accused some "parties and committees, with nothing
in common except their criticism of Algeria, of holding meetings
under the cover of solidarity with the Algerian people."
</P>
<P>
"Had the aim of these meetings been to express solidarity with
the Algerians, there would have been a condemnation of the
terrorist group and actions being committed against the people,"
Bou Fares said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri urged at a
regular cabinet session that Arab countries should play an
effective role in helping end the Algerian massacres and said he
was holding contacts with some leaders to agree on the action,
which includes establishing a committee seeking to end the
violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The next day, the offer prompted the Algerian government's
protest, saying Lebanon should not interfere in Algerian internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the ambassador assured that he believed that Lebanon bore
no ill will towards his country and denied bilateral relations
were tense.
</P>
<P>
At least 75,000 have been killed in Algeria since an Islamic
insurgency erupted in 1992 when the government canceled
elections which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was
set to win.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the Islamic holy month Ramadan, another
1,500 have been killed, according to press reports. The Algerian
government puts the figure at 254.

<HEADLINE> China Closes Down 573 Newspapers, Periodicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China closed down 227
newspapers and 346 periodicals in 1997, a national press and
publications meeting revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said that the move was to reduce the number of
poorly-run newspapers and periodicals, and only a few of them were
shut down because of violating government rules and policies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also revealed that last year, China closed down
some 1,000 illegal book wholesale markets and confiscated dozens
of thousands of books containing pornographic, violent and other
illegal materials. The fight against pirated CDs and books was
also intensified.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some high-quality newspapers and periodicals
had increasing subscribers. 1998's first issue of "Fortnightly
Chat", a political and news periodical edited by the Xinhua News
Agency, distributed 516 million copies, ranking first among the 21
periodicals with more than one million subscribers each.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government approved nine Chinese Communist Party
newspapers to increase their share on the market. Most Party
newspapers have achieved bigger distributions, with the sharpest
rise of 21 percent attained by the Shanghai-based "Wen Hui Bao".
</P>
<P>
The Press and publications Administration's principles in the
coming years are to further tighten management, adjust structure
and improve quality of the industry.

But he ruined his 3-1 lead in the second set when Rios, urged
on by a vocal band of supporters, broke back in the next game to
take the sting out of the Australian's fight.
</P>
<P>
Rios, after going ahead 4-3 with serve in the tiebreak in the
third set, broke Fromberg's serve twice to lead 6-3 then wasted no

<HEADLINE> Feature: Cold Wave Disturbs Normal Life in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Even Jaffir Hussain, the most
hard-working shopkeeper in his neighborhood, has been forced to be
a little lazy by a latest rare cold spell which gripped the
capital city last week.
</P>
<P>
It was already 10:30 a.m. when the 31-year-old man opened his
store Saturday in a small market in western Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"I used to be an early bird and usually open my shop at 8:30
a.m. But it's unnecessary now. It's so cold that few people go
shopping in the morning," Jaffir said with a shrug of
helplessness.
</P>
<P>
Jaffir does have an excuse for his recent laziness. In
Islamabad, like in most parts of Pakistan which were hit by a cold
wave, business activities have been much affected.
</P>
<P>
As the mercury continued to plunge and icy wind turned biting,
people here became "hostages" in their houses. There was thin
attendance in bazaars and shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
The latest freezing spell followed massive rains and snowfall
last week in most parts of Punjab, Balochistan and North West
Frontier provinces.
</P>
<P>
The minimum temperature recorded in Astore Valley in the
Northern Areas was minus 13 centigrade. Quetta, provincial capital
of Balochistan, was the second coldest place with temperature
dropping to eight degrees below the freezing point.
</P>
<P>
Normal life has almost been paralyzed by the inclement weather
especially in hilly areas. People just stayed indoor and turned on
the gas heater even before the sunset, leaving most of the streets
and markets deserted.
</P>
<P>
In some northern cities, the residents faced severe hardships
as water pipes in these cities burst due to low temperatures
brought by heavy snowfall.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the extreme weather turned out to be fatal. On
Tuesday night, a Russian-made Afghan plane crashed due to poor
visibility near Quetta, killing about 60 people on board. Also,
several people died of gas suffocation when they went to sleep
without putting off the gas heater in their house.
</P>
<P>
The cold wave in Pakistan is expected to continue for at least
another day as mainly dry weather was forecast to continue during
the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists here believe that the cold wave will not subside
until a rainy system hits the upper parts of the country in a
couple of days.

<HEADLINE> Christensen Beats Arbi To Reach The Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Top seeded Peter Gade Christensen
of Denmark edged Indonesian star Heryanto Arbi in their first
clash to secure a place in the final of the Yonex Japan Open
badminton tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Dane was one game and 0-2 down when he started hitting a
series of effective short serves to chalk up point after point and
shifted the momentum in his favour to win 4-15, 15-2, 15-6.
</P>
<P>
Arbi, the champion here in 1993 ad 1995, was quicker than
Christensen at the net, winning some clean points with his attacks
in the first game.
</P>
<P>
But Christensen's short serves surprisingly caused numerous
errors to Arbi's service return and the 21-year-old Dane won 15
points in a row to tie the contest at one game all.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles final Sunday, Christensen will take on Luo
Yigang of China, who beat Atlanta Olympic bronze medallist Rasid
Sidek of Malaysia 15-17, 15-7, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
In the women's semifinals which featured four Chinese players,
top seed Ye Zhaoying defeated Dai Yun 11-1, 11-9 while
second-seeded Gong Zhichao eliminated Wang Chen 11-3, 11-5.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan Vice President and
Defense Minister Paul Kagame is scheduled to pay an official
visit to Brussels next week for talks with Belgian government
leaders and the European Union (EU) officials.
</P>
<P>
The visit, due to be started on January 21, marks a growing
cooperation between Kigali and the EU, Rwanda's biggest donor,
according to a news release sent to Xinhua here today by IRIN, a
United Nations humanitarian information unit.
</P>
<P>
Kagame, a key figure in the Rwandan government, had
successfully put an end to the Hutu-led genocide in the country
in 1994 by leading troops to fight back from the neighboring
Uganda and defeat the Hutu troops in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The central African state of Rwanda was a former German colony
before 1899. In 1916, during the first World War, it was occupied
by Belgian forces, and from 1920 on had been administered by
Belgium under a League of Nations mandate and later as a U.N.
Trust Territory. It became independent on July 1 1962.

TEHRAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Muhammad Saeed as-Sahaf arrived here Friday night for his
first official visit to discuss normalization of Tehran-Baghdad
ties, Tehran radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival, Sahaf said that his trip to
Tehran was aimed at settling remaining issues and normalizing
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He termed the future of Iran-Iraq relations as positive,
saying that ample grounds exist between the two countries that
could turn bilateral ties into a good neighborly relations
based on reciprocal respect.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the eight-year bloody war in 1988, the two
neighbors have not been able to normalize their relations as
issues of prisoners of war (POW), 100 billion dollars of war
reparation demanded by Iran remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here believed that Sahaf would also try to
win Tehran's support for Baghdad to break out of the isolation by
the West.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi parliament speaker earlier forwarded a letter to
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, asking Iran, the present OIC
chairman, to help lift the U.N. sanctions on Iraq imposed on it
because of its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Two ground attack aircraft of
the Sri Lankan Air Force Friday bombed and destroyed a fortified
base of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the north,
Military Spokesman R.P. Vitana said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The attack took place near Mallavi in the Northern jungles at
Friday noon.
</P>
<P>
The base caught fire as a result of the bombing. Pilots of the
attacker planes said they observed thick black smoke billowing up
with dense flames, which indicated there could have been an oil
dump or ammunition store in the well-camouflaged semi-permanent
structures.
</P>
<P>
Vitana said rebel vehicles rushed in to evacuate the dead and
the injured following the attack. Casualties and damages of the
base are not available yet.
</P>
<P>
Government troops in Operation Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) are
conducting small group operations against the LTTE in the region.
</P>
<P>
The operation has been going on for more than eight months and
there is still no sign of ending it in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The major objective of the operation is to capture a land route

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Rejects Iraqi Charges of Prolonging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has refuted a
charge by the Iraqi government alleging that Kuwait was acting to
prolong international sanctions against Iraq since its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In a reaction to the Iraqi charge, a Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry
spokesman was quoted by Kuwait News Agency Friday as describing
Iraq as having adopted a pattern in making lies and camouflaging
realities.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Minister of Trade Mohammed Mehdi Saleh recently accused
Kuwait of paying money for keeping the international curbs set by
the U.N. Security Council on his country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "the latest of these lies were made public
by the Iraqi minister of trade holding Kuwait responsible for
the longtime extension of the blockade and charging that Kuwait
paid money via certain channels to influence the decision-makers
in the world and maintain the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the victim of the Iraqi aggression and such lies
cannot justify that crime that was condemned by the world, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman again differentiated the Iraqi people from the
Iraqi regime, saying that "the Kuwaiti people understand hardships
of the Iraqi people under international sanctions."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has welcomed the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food agreement as a
temporary measure to secure the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Kuwait backs continuation of the process according to
this agreement, it supports the current intention in the United
Nations to increase revenue of these oil sales to alleviate
hardships of the brotherly Iraqi people," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman asserted that the Gulf state cannot influence
the decision-making of the great powers, namely the five
permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council so far has held 37 regular sessions to
review the U.N. sanctions against Iraq, but decisions were made at
the end of each session to prolong the curbs on Iraq in
retaliation for its failure to comply with the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti official spokesman stressed that "the Iraqi regime
must abide by the Security Council resolutions and scrap the
policy of procrastination and dodging instead of holding the
others responsible for the Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait repeatedly urged Iraq to fully comply with all the
Security Council resolutions relevant to Iraqi aggression of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait also reaffirmed its stand that it was not against Arab
reconciliation, but there should be a "distinction between Arab
reconciliation and reconciliation with the Iraqi regime" and "the
two can never meet."

<HEADLINE> China To Set up Publishing, Newspaper Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China is to establish a number
of big newspaper and publishing groups by the year 2010, with some
of them being transnational corporations.
</P>
<P>
A national press and publications meeting revealed here today
that there will be five to ten of the new groups that can generate
an annual sale volume of about 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars) for each, and 20 to 30 capable of selling one billion
yuan of books a year.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that some powerful Party newspapers should
be merged and re-organized, and newspaper groups will be set up
with Party papers at the core.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, newspapers with annual income of more than 100 million
yuan for each will account for 10 percent of the national total,
and 80 percent of the income will come from advertising.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 2,000 newspapers and publishes 100,000
kinds of books a year. But the industry's efficiency is poor as a
result of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
For many years, a large number of Chinese publishing houses
have published books according to government mandates and ignore
readers' interest.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve the sector, China has decided to gradually
separate publishing houses from administrative departments, and
introduce various ownership systems into the industry.
</P>
<P>
The meeting asked publishing houses to pay attention to market
needs and consider readers' opinions, and create a sound
operational mechanism that goes in line with the socialist market
economy.

<HEADLINE> Persistent Rains Revive Crops in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Most crops in Zimbabwe which
had been severely affected by a long spell of dry weather, have
improved significantly since the arid period broke.
</P>
<P>
The crops are responding well to the rains which have fallen
almost daily in most parts of the country in the last two weeks,
The Herald daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies improved and significant inflows into dams have
been reported in most areas. Most rivers are flowing again. The
wet weather conditions also helped to improve the veld and
pastures in both quality and quantity, said the report.
</P>
<P>
In a crop and livestock report, the fortnightly Magazine
AGRITEX said agricultural activities increased throughout the
country with some farmers replanting while others weeding, hoping
the rains would persist.
</P>
<P>
The rainy weather was caused by the southern limit of the
inter tropical convergence zone, which was sitting on the
northern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with a cloud system from the west, has
maintained the wet conditions over most part of the country. The
airflow is expected to remain moist mainly in the northeast but
is getting progressively drier elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
AGRITEX said most of the early planted maize crop which had
been affected by dry weather was recovering following the current
rains. However, there are some areas where the maize crop is
suffering from moisture stress.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
Crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market and the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM)
both closed the week lower while the Malaysian rubber market was
bullish.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals started the week on a soft note which extended
until Wednesday, but rebounded on Thursday before closing the
lower on Friday.
</P>
<P>
January South closed the week 300 ringgit (71.4 U.S. dollars)
lower at 2,310 ringgit (550 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
A supportive set of palm oil statistics was released by the
Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority (PORLA) for
December.
</P>
<P>
According to PORLA, Malaysia's total palm oil stocks for
December, 1997, was down 15 percent to 962,490 tons from 1.135
million tons in November, the total output of crude palm oil
declined 22 percent to 623,759 tons in December from 800,723 tons
in November, and palm oil exports for December stood at 644,258
tons against 640,418 tons in November.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market is expected to perform better next
week in line with the rising trend in the ringgit which ended the
week at 4.1700 to the U.S. dollars on Friday from 4.5600 last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the KLTM, the week saw tin price fall significantly
following the recovery of the ringgit against the U.S. dollar and
the bearish undertone of the London Metal Exchange (LME).
</P>
<P>
After being depressed for four consecutive days this week, the
metal rebounded on Friday following strong buying interest and
ended the week at 21.52 ringgit (5.12 U.S. dollars) per kg, down
2.26 ringgit (54 U.S. cents) per kg from 23.78 ringgit (5.66 U.S.
dollars) per kg recorded last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, accumulated turnover for the week rose to 539 tons
from 508 tons last week with European, local and Japanese buyers
dominating the bulk of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The discount between the KLTM price and that of the LME
narrowed to 9 U.S. dollars per ton on Friday against 60 U.S.
dollars per ton last week.

(71.4 U.S. cents) per kg and SMR 20 rising by 18 sen at 297.50 sen
(70.8 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Technical adjustment as well as some buying interest especially
from Europe and the United States helped to push natural rubber
prices upwards this week, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
News that stocks of between 38,000 and 44,000 tons of rubber
stored in a warehouse in Hadyai, Thailand, were damaged when the
warehouse caught fire last week, also boosted market sentiment,
the dealer said.

indicator price for January 15 was 201.07 Malaysia/Singapore cents
per kg against 192.36 cents on January 8. The five-day moving

<HEADLINE> Kazak President Pledges to Build a Modern Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan should build its
army into a highly capable, efficient, professional and
well-equipped armed force, Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev made the remark while inspecting the Kazak College
for Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Kazak Telegraph Agency as saying
Kazakhstan is intensifying its efforts to construct a new
defensive military theory and a military reform framework will be
conceived by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said, with the growth of the national economy, the armed
forces will be able to receive sufficient funds for equipment and
technological innovation from 2000 to 2003.
</P>
<P>
The president said his country is currently working on an
outline for development of arms and military technology before the
year 2005, which involves separating the functions of the
department of defense and the army staff.
</P>
<P>
He said measures will soon be taken to reinforce the public
surveillance over the armed forces, which is an indispensable step
in safeguarding the legal system and order inside the army.
</P>
<P>
The people, he said, have the right to know the spending of the
national budgetary funds and the performance of their children in
service.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev expressed his dissatisfaction over the lack of
discipline and order within the army. The offenses recorded by the
Military Procuratorate last year increased by 7.6 percent over the
previous year to more than 1,800. There were also serious abuses
of power.
</P>
<P>
He asked the officers at all levels to be responsible for the
army's combat readiness and moral conduct.
</P>
<P>
The Kazak College for Armed Forces was founded on the basis of
the Alma-Ata Advanced Military School a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, the school has trained about 7,000
officers, and nearly 1,000 have graduated since the independence
of Kazakhstan.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Slovakian Karol Kucera came
from behind to upset No. 1 seed Tim Henman of Britain 7-5, 6-4 in
the final of the Sydney International on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kucera, ranked 25th in the world, won four straight games to
tie the set at 4-4 after Henman broke the Slovakian's first two
service games to take a 4-0 lead, and then broke in the 11th game
for 6-5.
</P>
<P>
The unseeded Kucera then held the 11th game, finishing on an
ace to take the set 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Kucera's comeback in the first set appeared to demoralise
Henman and he kept his winning momentum to finish the second set
6-4, leaving the British 17th in the world stranded.
</P>
<P>
In Women's final, Spanish fifth seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario
downed American teenager Venus Williams 6-1, 6-3 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Venus worked hard against her more experienced competitor, but
her every error was exploited.
</P>
<P>
"I think she is one of the players who is very consistent and
waits on you to make a mistake," Williams was quoted as
saying. "I'm more of a high-risk player."

COLOMBO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
soon to carry out a field survey, as part of a social security
network program, to look into problems that migrant woman workers
are facing, officials in the Presidential Secretariat said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They said currently there are at least 500,000 Sri Lankan women
working in the Middle East while many others are employed in other
regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
The majority of those migrant women are married and mothers of
young children and their absence from their families has created
certain problems for those families, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be first conducted in Kurunegala, North-Western
Province, Matara, Southern Province and the capital city of
Colombo to identify the social and economic problems of the
families in respect of the basic needs of children, education and
health and nutrition.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Filipino Official Urges Measures to Handle Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- One of President Fidel Ramos'
top economic advisers has called for effective confidence-building
measures to address serious economic problems in the Philippines,
a local newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Manila Chronicle, Socio-Economic Planning
Secretary Cielito Habito said the government "can no longer build
confidence by insisting that the country's fundamentals are good."
</P>
<P>
"Messages from the president and economic managers that the
economy is strong and that the country will easily weather the
regional crisis are no longer received positively," he said in a
memorandum to President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Habito said that what is needed is effective confidence
building to counter the "negative psychology" that has been
driving market forces more than true market fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
The more the government insists that the fundamentals are
sound, he said, "the more it is inviting skepticism and losing
credibility."
</P>
<P>
Habito said the measures that the government has put in place,
or is proposing "are either not well understood, or deemed by many
to be not enough, not working, or outright wrong."
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Presidential Palace said the points taken up by
Habito were tackled at a meeting four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Since a Thai financial crisis spread to the Philippines and
other Southeast Asian countries last July, the country's currency
peso has fallen by 40 percent against the U.S. dollar, prices of
commodities have been increasing, and thousands of workers are
expected to lose their jobs in the course of economic adjustment
this year.

<HEADLINE> European Diplomats Defend Position on Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- European countries and the
European Commission joined hands Saturday in taking issue with The
Straits Times, one of Singapore's main newspapers, on the role
Europe plays in the world's effort to solve the current financial
crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Recent days' reporting and comments in The Straits Times have
given the impression that Europe is not fully involved in the
search for a solution to the financial turmoil currently affecting
Asia. This is not true," they said in a joint letter to the
newspaper, which published the letter on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission, on behalf of the European Union
(EU) presidency, took the lead in signing up on the letter. The
others include ambassadors of France, Finland, Germany, Belgium,
Italy, Denmark, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and the
Delegation of the European Commission to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
They focused their criticism particularly on a Straits Times
report on Wednesday with the headline: Europe "cannot extend more
help to Asia" and charged that suggestions that Europe is taking a
back seat are clearly wide of the mark.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times used the headline when covering a lecture
delivered on Tuesday by Jacques Santer, president of the EU
executive arm, the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Europe's interests in Asia and its contribution to solving the
Asian countries' economic difficulties are far greater than you
imply," the letter argued, pointing out that EU exports to the
region in 1996 totaled 123 billion U.S. dollars, greater than
those from the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, since the EU governments hold 29.5 percent of the
IMF shares, the EU countries have contributed a significant
proportion of the resources made available by the fund and the
World Bank, the ambassadors said. They added that the EU countries
have also given strong support to the new IMF Supplemental Reserve
Facility while eight of the 13 bilateral contributions to South
Korea's second line of defense have come from EU countries.
</P>
<P>
In his separate letter to The Straits Times, Klauspeter
Schmallenbach, ambassador of the European Union and the Delegation
of the European Commission to Singapore, described the newspaper
headline as "absolutely misleading."
</P>
<P>
In reply, the editor of The Straits Times said Santer's lecture
was well reflected in the paper's report.
</P>
<P>
Santer "did indicate that 'we (EU countries) have to put our
own house in order in Europe. It is not easy', a point which

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes Calling of G-7, Asia Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi Friday welcomed the initiative to call a
meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized countries and
those Asian countries in financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar, Supachai said the meeting is much needed
to tackle financial problems including strengthening the Japanese
yen and weakening the U.S. dollar to stimulate growth, the Bangkok
Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said international cooperation is necessary to prevent an
economic collapse in Asia, which generates 60 percent of world
trade, and to save industries in the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the current Asian financial crisis would
affect global trade.
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. energy, aircraft and defense industries in
particular would not escape the impact of declining orders in
Asia, adding that there is also a large amount of European
investments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which holds the current presidency of G-7, on Thursday
affirmed support for the U.S. initiative for a top-level
international meeting on the crisis in Asia that would involve
leading industrialized countries and the affected Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
G-7 members are Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Anti-U.S. Sentiment Emerging in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Anti-American sentiment is
emerging in Thailand, according to a Bangkok Post report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay Yossuck, chairman of the Senate Finance, Banking and
Financial Institutions Committee, said his office has received
complaints from Thais who feel that the United States has taken
advantage of the economic turmoil to exploit Thailand.
</P>
<P>
He said an increasing number of Thai people are feeling that
the Americans are gaining benefit by forcing Thailand to open up
its market and that the United States is planning to take over
Thai companies at very low prices.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect much from the U.S.," he added. "Even our
efforts to seek a review of the IMF (International Monetary Fund)
program may not succeed because we know the Americans will turn it
down."
</P>
<P>
He warned that the anti-American sentiment may spread to other
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
During talks on Friday with Thai Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Suthee Singhasaneh, Suthee's visiting U.S. counterpart
and Republican Senator William Roth failed to make any positive
offer to help Thailand out of its economic crisis. He was just
concerned about how American interests would be affected in
Thailand and the region.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Thai Senate Speaker Meechai Ruchuphan said,
"You may now realize who our friends and foes are. So don't use
products made by the enemies and stick to those of our friends."
</P>
<P>
He said the current economic crisis should be a lesson for
Thais and they should remember "the bad things committed against
us by others."

YANGON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has worked out plans for
reducing crime in the country and urged writers and artists to
play a role in the bid.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with local writers and artists Friday, Minister
for Home Affairs Tin Hlaing briefed them on the plans for reducing
crime and called on the participants to provide assistance to the
move, the New Light of Myanmar reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Tin Hlaing as saying efforts have been made to enable

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Opposes Deep Involvement in Thai Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- William Roth, chairman of the
U.S. Senate Finance Committee, does not want Washington to become
deeply involved in the Thai economic crisis, according to a Thai
Senate committee chairman.
</P>
<P>
Suthee Singhasaneh, chairman of the Thai Senate Finance
Committee, held talks on Friday with Roth, who is on a visit to
Thailand to find out how the Thai economic crisis would affect
U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Suthee said he believed that Roth, a
Republican senator, does not want Washington to get too involved
in Thailand's efforts to solve its problems to affect the U.S.
government's budget spending plans, the Bangkok Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Suthee quoted Roth as saying at the talks that American bankers
have remained on the sidelines since the collapse of Thailand's
finance sector because they are waiting for a clear picture of the
economy and want to see how Thailand would treat American
creditors of 56 Thai finance firms which had been shutdown.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed on the talks, Thai Senate Speaker Meechai
Ruchuphan urged his colleagues to avoid using products made by
"enemy countries."
</P>
<P>
When asked to name the "enemy countries" and comment on what is
seen as an emerging anti-U.S. sentiment in Thailand, Meechai
became evasive, saying he was not referring to the United States
specifically but to any countries which are "hostile" to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Since the monetary turmoil hit Thailand in mid-1997, the U.S.
government has not made any specific financial commitment to
helping Thailand's economic recovery, reportedly because of
disagreement between President Bill Clinton's Democrat
administration and Republican senators.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Assets Total US$20.39 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia, the country's
central bank, announced Friday that the country's gross foreign
assets totaled 20.39 billion U.S. dollars as of January 15 this
year, down from 27.56 billion dollars as of last September.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the central bank defined the country's
official foreign reserves as gross foreign assets, or simply
called foreign assets -- the net amount of foreign currency assets
available to the central bank, the local press reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Previously the official foreign exchange reserves reported by
the central bank did not include the foreign exchange deposited by
commercial banks as a compulsory foreign exchange reserve
requirement or export drafts, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Director Miranda S. Gultom said in a statement
that the 20.39 billion dollars are the equivalent of the need for
importing non-oil and gas commodities for five months.
</P>
<P>
The gross foreign assets were based on a concept used
internationally in line with the special data dissemination
standards of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which has been
also applied by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
IMF in its publication, Balance of Payment Manual, says foreign
reserves are gross foreign assets that are available at any time
and controlled by monetary authorities.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Extends Autostrade Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government decided on
Friday to extend Autostrade SpA's concession to run the national
motor-way network till 2038.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the soon-to-be-privatized Autostrade came in a
decree law issued on Friday despite the Audit Court's objection that
the move ran counter to European Union regulations on free
competition.
</P>
<P>
The decision also overrode the opposition of Environment
Minister Edo Ronchi and drew an angry response from his party, the
Greens.
</P>
<P>
Autostrade, which is due to be privatized this year, at the
moment only has this right until 2018, the 20-year extension has
added considerably to the company's market value.
</P>
<P>
But the Audit Court, which examines every law entailing
government spending for legal hitches, pointed out last year that
under EU free market rules the government could not simply hand
Autostrade SpA a new concession to run Italy's motor-ways.
</P>
<P>
As with all government contracts, the moter-way concession
should be offered after a public tender operation, which allowed
companies from all over the world to bid for it, the court said.
</P>
<P>
By overriding the court's objection, the government lays itself
open to disciplinary measures by the EU, should Brussels decide
the move constitutes a breach of regulations.

<HEADLINE> March Against Child Labor Starts in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A six-month global march against
child labor began in the Philippine capital of Manila Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ten thousand children and their supporters from trade unions,
church groups and non-governmental organizations are converging on
different points in Quezon City, Manila, to hold day-long
activities, including a march on Quezon City Memorial circle. The
activities will kick off the Global March Against Child Labor.
</P>
<P>
Their program includes singing, dancing and cultural
presentations and discussions on how to better improve the plight
of children. The activities will be capped by a candle light and
torch ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The global march, which aims to become the largest single
social movement in history in support of 250 million child
laborers worldwide, is a sea/land odyssey of children survivors
and advocates who will travel from country to country in an
attempt to push the child labor debates beyond national borders.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 major organizations worldwide agreed to have the
kick-off in Manila.
</P>
<P>
From Manila, the core marchers will be sailing to Vietnam,

American and African countries.

<HEADLINE> Housing Sector to Act as New Catalyst of China's Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Yu Zhengsheng, vice-minister of
construction, urged China's builders to construct better houses
and improve after-sales service to encourage people to buy their
own homes, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national construction conference which ended here
Friday, Yu said the main task for the construction industry this
year is "to improve the hosing distribution system and fuel
housing consumption spending."
</P>
<P>
Calling residential housing sector a new "catalyst of economic
growth," Yu urged construction officials to "alter some of their
traditional concepts and emancipate their minds" to develop the
sector in line with the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Construction officials should not interfere in the bidding,
contracting or designing of construction projects. Rather, they
should enhance supervision to ensure a fair and open bidding
atmosphere, and the sound implementation of the new Construction
Law," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Li Zhendong, another vice-minister of construction, said the
country should make a substantial breakthrough in its housing
distribution system reform this year and stop granting houses as a
kind of welfare benefit.
</P>
<P>
He urged officials in the sector to adapt to the changes,
including bank loans for home construction.
</P>
<P>
Newly built homes in urban areas totaled 300 million sq m, and
those in rural areas amounted to 650 million sq m last year,
ministry statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Of the commercial residential houses sold during the
January-November period in 1997, more than 58 percent were
purchased by individuals, a rise of 27.7 percent from the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans Only Five Percent of Bank Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of bad loans in
China's banks is not as serious as many people believed, according
to Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China's central bank.
</P>
<P>
Dai was quoted by today's China Daily as saying that if
measured with the internationally accepted gauge, bad loans
account for 5 to 6 percent of the banks credits, far smaller than
the 25 or even 40 percent some people anticipated.
</P>
<P>
As the country plans to write off this year 50 billion yuan (6
billion US dollars) of bad loans and more next year, the amount
will greatly drop, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
However, Dai stressed that although Chinese banks have no
danger in payment, they need to improve their management.
</P>
<P>
Dai said China has a different standard in grading credit
quality. All loans are divided into two categories: normal and
non-performed.
</P>
<P>
The latter category includes three parts: overdue loans, unpaid
for fewer than two years; idle loans, unpaid for two years or
more; and bad loans, which cannot be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
The genuine bad loans which need to be written off are only 5
to 6 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the central bank will lead an overall clearance of the
bank loans and start to category them in accordance with
international practice.

<TEXT>
<P>

out tasks of national reconstruction and reforms consistent with
the changing times.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Deepen Economic Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia will deepen
economic restructuring and consolidate macro-economic stability
this year so as to lay a solid foundation for steady growth.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the national newspaper Onoodor (Today),
Finance Minister Puntsag Tsagaan said that the government will
take a series of measures to achieve the above goals.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate will
be raised to 4.5 percent and the inflation rate be lowered to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the exchange rate fluctuation will be contained
within five percent and the financial deficit be cut down to less
than eight percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Mongolia will further strengthen its
ties with foreign countries and international organizations,
particularly the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country will make special efforts to cooperate
with IMF for an early implementation of a medium-term economic
restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mongolia reversed economic declining and secured a
3.3 percent GDP growth. The inflation rate was lowered to 17.5
percent from 53.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This macro-economic stability has created a condition for
attracting foreign investment to develop the mining and light
industries.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Sea Lions Die of Hunger in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Fifty sea lions were found dead in
the last 72 hours along the beach in the Natural Reserve of San
Juan, near the port of Marcona, some 500 kilometers south of Lima.
</P>
<P>
Biologist Milena Arias Schreiber said thousands of sea lions
were starved to death recently in the Peruvian sea due to the El
Nino climate phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The dead sea lions are mainly puppies and females and the
survivers are hungry, the specialist said.
</P>
<P>
The warmer surface water caused by El Nino took away from their
habitat the fish they feed on, leaving the sea lions without food,
she said.
</P>
<P>
However, she dismissed the possibility that the sea lion could
be in danger of extinction because of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
El Nino phenomenon has occurred from time to time but the
species has survived, she said.

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Sales Stabilized in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Newspaper circulation in Canada
appears to have stabilized after years of decline, reports said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
About 32.96 million copies were sold each week across Canada in
1997, just slightly below the 33.03 million sold in 1996,
according to the Canadian Newspapers Association.
</P>
<P>
The 0.2 percent difference is within the range of reporting
errors, said the association, the main lobby group for Canada's
105 daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Until 1997, newspaper circulation in Canada fell every year in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"There may be a perception that circulation is falling, but
these numbers should put that notion to rest," the group noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Canada's weekend newspaper editions were up with
Saturday papers rising 0.3 percent and Sunday plus 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the weekday sales slipped by about 0.5
percent.

<HEADLINE> Johansson Officially Bids For FIFA Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lennart Johansson, the UEFA
soccer president, was to officially announce his bid for the job
of the FIFA presidency at the preliminary draw of the UEFA
European Championships in Ghent, Belgium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting his long opposition to Joap Havelange's 24-year
rule over the FIFA world soccer federation, Johansson said in his
election platform he will aim "to strengthen the democratic spirit
and establish a fair and accountable system" at FIFA.
</P>
<P>
The battle for the biggest job in the biggest sport seemed to
be a solo run as only the Swedish openly declared his candidacy,
although Havelange mentioned his sectretary general Sepp Blatter
of Switzerland would make an ideal candidate.
</P>
<P>
Johansson's support came even beyond Europe from the heads of
the Asian, African and Oceania federations and the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The FIFA President will be elected at a congress in the days
ahead of the June 10-July 12 World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Johansson said that as FIFA president, he would shed as much
power as possible to the continental confederations and limit
FIFA's presidential terms.
</P>
<P>
And he also opposes the landmark Bosman ruling which has
spawned professional free agency and a concentration of wealth and
talents within a handful of clubs and a few leagues.
</P>
<P>
"The Bosman ruling has been hurting soccer, endangering the
future," Johansson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Four crewmen were rescued from a
sinking ship Friday in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen bodies were recovered by Canadian coast guard near the
180-meter-long sinking Flare, a Cypriot-registered freighter.
</P>
<P>
"Four are rescued," Canadian coast guard Lt.Cmdr. Glenn
Chamberlain was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They are hypothermic. Another's got a broken arm. But they are
at least on dry land and in medical care," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Five crew members were still missing and there was no more sign
of life, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The four survivors had been taken to hospital on the island of
St-Pierre, a French possession some 80 kilometers off the coast of
Newfoundland.
</P>
<P>
The ship Flare seemed to have broken in half and slowly went
down stern-first in 40 meters of water off the French islands of
St-Pierre-Miquelon.
</P>
<P>
She was on its way to pick up grain from the Canadian city of
Montreal, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Creates Fund to Protect Stock Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Stock Exchange
(PSE) has set up a 200 million peso (5 million U.S. dollars) trade
and investor guarantee fund to cover for failed trade or delayed
payments for transactions between member brokers.
</P>
<P>
PSE President Jose Luis Yulo said here Friday that the PSE will
draw from the fund, which came from contributions by member
brokers and the PSE, to advance payments to clients whose brokers
fail to pay outstanding obligations.
</P>
<P>
It will also be used to cover for delayed payments for
transactions between brokers, he added.
</P>
<P>
"There is that fund so that all the investors are protected,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
According to Yulo, the PSE will hold on to the membership seat
and other assets of any cash-short broker until the advances have
been paid to the PSE.
</P>
<P>
Local brokers are struggling to stave off the effects of low
value turnover and rising overhead costs by cutting operating
expenses, including salaries of employees.
</P>
<P>
Yulo expressed his confidence that despite the on-going
financial crisis, the small brokers in the country, which account
for 60 percent of the total membership of the PSE, would remain
financially secure.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine stock market should improve by the latter part
of this year, he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Investing Heavily in Region's Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region allocated 200 billion yuan for
infrastructure construction and basic industries during the
1993-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the region invested 52.4 billion yuan (6.55 billion
U.S. dollars) in the sectors, said Cheng Kejie, chairman of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the region has built 7,738 kilometers of roads in
the period. Two expressways have been completed -- one links
Guilin City, a major tourist site, and Liuzhou City; the other
connects Qinzhou City and Fangchenggang City.
</P>
<P>
The region's three large ports -- Fangchenggang, Beihai and
Qinzhou -- have built 18 wharves with an added annual handling
capacity of 4.86 million tons. The region's coastal ports now have
an annual handling capacity of more than nine million tons, Cheng
said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-nine wharves have been built along the Xijiang River,
the main stream on the upper reaches of the Pearl River. As a
result, a total of 4.21 million tons of handling capacity has been
added.
</P>
<P>
The region has begun operations of airports at Guilin, Liuzhou
and Wuzhou and have increased capacity at Beihai and Nanning
airports.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997 the number of telephone and mobile phone
subscribers had expanded to 2.5 million and 630,000, respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the 1993-97 period, the region built hydropower stations
such as Yantan and Tianshengqiao for an additional installed
capacity of 2.66 million kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The region also built 1,463 kilometers of 500,000-volt power
transmission lines connecting the region with Guangdong, Yunnan
and Guizhou provinces.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the region also has added 50,000 hectares of
irrigated farmland in the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Restructuring of China's Textile Industry Continues in 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- This year will see
unprecedented and many painstaking reforms in China's textile
industry, when 4.8 million spindles are expected to be scrapped,
and 600,000 workers to lose their jobs as a result of cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
The industry expects to cut three billion yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 17.5 percent of the money-losing large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises were in the textile sector,
involving 19.6 percent of the employees. In 1997, deficits at
state-owned textile enterprises were estimated at as much as 10
percent of all state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Shi Wanpeng, president of the China National Textile Council
(CNTC), says that problems in the textile sector are typical of
state-owned industries as a whole, so, improvements in this sector
may serve as a guide in reforms for the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the government plans to cut 10
million spindles and reemploy 1.2 million laid-off workers and
expects to eliminate all deficits in the textile industry.
</P>
<P>
Getting rid of spindles is the most difficult but the most
important part of the reform, Shi said, and the government is
determined to tackle the problem. The State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC) will take charge of this in coordination with
CNTC, and local government will implement central government
policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ma Yuliang, head of SETC's management department, says that
cutting the number of spindles does not mean selling them
elsewhere, as in the past, and there are administrative measures
to ensure the reduction.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of SETC, says that the central
and local governments will give three million yuan for every
10,000 spindles eliminated, and two million yuan in interest-free
loans will be provided.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will also increase export rebates for
textile products, and allocate 15 percent of the quota of textile
agreements with North America and European countries directly to
textile enterprises that have a foreign trade license.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wang said, production and procurement licenses
will be required for loom production and trade, and the government
will give export credit and 100 percent of export rebates for
looms.
</P>
<P>
Equally important, he said, are capital reorganization and
restructuring. Mergers, bankruptcies, personnel reductions, and
improved efficiency should be given priority.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the government will use most of
the 10-billion-yuan allocation to write off bad debts in the
industry, especially in large restructuring projects.
</P>
<P>
The re-employment of workers is being handled with great care,
Shi said, and basic allowances for them will be guaranteed. He
also spoke highly of the re-employment centers in Shanghai, which
play an active role in the effort.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Coffee Exports to Fall in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Colombia, the world's
second largest coffee producer, will halve its exports of coffee
grains in February because of less harvest last year, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
Colombia used to expert 400,000 bags (60-kilogram per bag) of
coffee grains in the month of February, but only 200,000 bags will
be available to the international market next month.
</P>
<P>
Caused by the El Nino climate phenomenon, coffee output in the
South American country dropped to 0.7 million bags last year from
11.9 million bags in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, Colombia maintained a 14 percent share of
the international coffee market and the prices of its products
were the highest.

MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of workers in the

industries to either close shop or cut down on production.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times reported Saturday that in the last two weeks,
9,563 workers in Manila have either been dismissed or given

the paper said that during the period, 6,206 workers in the
capital lost their jobs outright, 1,440 were temporarily laid off
and 2,017 worked shorter hours.
</P>
<P>
The paper warned that more workers in Manila will be laid off
if the government fails to adopt measures to re-create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has lost 40 percent of its value against
the dollar since last July and is now hovering around 42 pesos to
the greenback. The steep devaluation has brought about high
interest rates and made production more difficult in the country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said more than 10,000 workers in North Mindanao
will become unemployed in the next few months if the currency
crisis continues.

<HEADLINE> Russians Rally to Win Ice Dance Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny
Platov rallied back to win the ice dancing title for their 21st
straight victory at the European Figure Skating Championships in
Milan on Friday.
</P>
<P>
From second place, the Russian duo scored four perfect 6.0s in
their free skate to Michael Nyman's "Memorial Requiem" to outpoint
fellow Russians Anjelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsyannikov.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy and relieved after yesterday's mistake there are
so much pressure," said the reigning Olympic and world champion
Platov who had a fall in the original dance.
</P>
<P>
With their difficult maneuvers and artistic touch, the Russian
pair, three-time European titlists, were surely hot favorite for
an unprecedented repeat of ice dancing Olympic gold medal next
month at Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Krylova and Ovsyannikov, second for the third straight time at
the Europeans, were innovative in their performance, but their
5.7s-5.9s were not enough to keep the lead they took Thursday.
</P>
<P>
France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat took the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
In the women's short program, France's Surya Bonaly was second
to Szewczenko, followed by two-time defending titlist Irina
Slutskaya of Russia. The medals will be decided in Saturday's long
program.
</P>
<P>
Bonaly, European champion from 1991-95, showed she still can
skate at a high level despite a ruptured Achilles' tendon that
disrupted her career in 1996.
</P>
<P>
She rushed her return last year and was ninth at the
Europeans. She was not placed on the French team coming here until
two weeks ago, when Letitia Hubert withdrew with an injury.
</P>
<P>
In a jumbled set of scores, three-time world silver medalist
Bonaly was rated first by two judges.

<HEADLINE> Tent Lab Operational in Lop Nur for Sylvite Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese geologists have
established a tent lab in Lop Nur, a lake dried up in a desolate
area in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region where
China's largest sylvite reserve has been discovered.
</P>
<P>
Qi Jixiang, senior engineer of the Chinese Academy of
Geological Science is the only scientist working at the analytical
chemistry lab with only a floor space of as large as half of a
badminton course.
</P>
<P>
He said the lab is installed for future development of the 63
million tons of proved sylvite reserve in Lop Nur where China's
nuclear testing site was once located.
</P>
<P>
Qi said he once worked for more than 60 labs, including 8 field
labs, this one has the most simple facilities.
</P>
<P>
On the 6-square-meter "bench", which is made of piled wooden
boxes and test tubs, reagent bottles and scales and balances are
placed.
</P>
<P>
The sylvite exists in the underwater in Lop Nur and Qi's work
is to find out the age of the groundwater, water's flow rate and
directions. He said the data will be used for guidance of
development.
</P>
<P>
Since the Lop Nur lacks fresh water, Qi has to use little
amount of water to wash the tubs for several times.
</P>
<P>
He said: "though the condition of the lab is quite difficult,
the work is very competitive."
</P>
<P>
Sylvite is badly needed in China for making potash fertilizer,
which is of great importance for crop cultivation.
</P>
<P>
China needs three million tons of potash fertilizer annually
and now about 2.7 million tons are imported from other countries.

Space is a good place for gerontological study because of
similarities between what happens to a body in zero gravity and
what happens naturally over time on Earth.
</P>
<P>
Glenn said he hopes medical experiments that will be performed
on him during flight will shed light on some of the diseases that
affect the 35 million Americans over age 65.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Investigae World Cup Ticket Sales on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The soccer's world governing body
FIFA said Friday it was investigating reports that tickets for the
World Cup finals were being sold at inflated prices on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking these reports very seriously," said FIFA
general-secretary Sepp Blatter in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The London Independent newspaper said earlier that the French
Organising Committee (CFO) was looking at sales on the Internet by
a U.S. company, offering tickets far above their face value.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said FIFA had asked national soccer associations to
provide a list of the agents appointed to represent them for the
sale of tickets to their fans.
</P>
<P>
"Once we have these details, we shall publish them, in order
that fans will be able to know which outlets are official and
which are not," Blatter added.
</P>
<P>
Results of the investigation will not be available before next
week.
</P>
<P>
The organisers' move comes amid growing criticism from several
national football associations over ticket allocations for the
finals to be held in France from June 10 to July 12.
</P>
<P>
England, Belgium and the Netherlands have officially complained
to FIFA about their low allocations.

BUDAPEST, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungary invested a record 371
million U.S. dollars in other countries in 1997, tripling the 67

The figures issued by the National Bank of Hungary show that

Hungary's neighboring countries, including Austria and Romania,
shared the remaining part of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
The "NAPI Gazdasag" (World Economy) newspaper Friday attributed
the increased overseas investment to the recovery of the Hungarian
economy, which has enabled many Hungarian companies to expand

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will return to
the ring in March as a referee in Wrestlemania, but will not
wrestle himself.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Sig Rogich said on Friday in Las Vegas that the
former heavyweight champion will not wrestle because he does not
want to violate his ban from boxing imposed in July by the Nevada
State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
Rogich said that Tyson did not want to jeopardize his
relationship with the Nevada boxing commission.
</P>
<P>
Rogich said Tyson viewed his appearance at the Wrestlemania
XIV, to be held in Boston on March 29, as an opportunity to get in
shape. He said the former champion has always enjoyed wrestling.
</P>
<P>
Although still barred from boxing, Tyson has begun training for
a possible rematch with Evander Holyfield, saying he doesn't want
to go down in boxing history just as a fighter who bit off a chunk
of Holyfield's ear in their championship meeting last June 28.
</P>
<P>
Tyson was stripped of his license after the notorious fight but
could regain it in July if Nevada boxing officials vote in his
favor. He will be out of the ring for at least another year if
the Commission votes against him.
</P>
<P>
Tyson said he is training in Phoenix so he can be prepared
physically and mentally if he gets his license back.

<HEADLINE> Large Ship Sailing on Lancang-Mekong River on Dry Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese 300-dwt ship recently
successfully made its maiden voyage on the Lancang-Mekong River,
ending the history of large ships unable to sail in dry seasons on
the river.
</P>
<P>
It took 12 hours for the super shallow-draft vessel "Hongyun"
to make the 254 kilometer-long trip from Guanlei, a port in
China's Xishuangbanna, to a port in Thailand, via Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The 4,880-kilometer river runs through China, Myanmar, Laos,
Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
Dry season arrives on the Lancang between January and April
when water level in some sections is as low as below two meters,
obstructing 100-dwt ships and larger ones. The sail of smaller
ships can hardly meet the growing cargo transport of China, Laos,
Myanmar, and Thailand along the river.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the situation, China has successfully developed
100-dwt, 200-dwt and 300-dwt super shallow draft vessels.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by 2000, the annual passing capacity of the
river will be raised to over one million tons from the present
400,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> 217 Families Missing in Snowstorms in Qinghai Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Two hundred and seventeen
families of herdsmen have been reported missing in the southern
part of Qinghai Province in northwest China, due to heavy
snowfalls there since last September.
</P>
<P>
The natural disasters have attacked Yushu and Guoluo, two
Tibetan Nationality autonomous prefectures in Qinghai, while
villagers in the neighboring Tibet Autonomous Region have been
combating the same kind of calamities in the same period.
</P>
<P>
The snowstorms, causing continuous low temperatures, as low as
minus 40 centigrade degrees sometimes, have brought huge losses to
local herdsmen in Qinghai's Yushu and Guoluo, two Tibetan
autonomous prefectures, next to the snowstorm-hit Nagqu Prefecture
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 117,200 heads of animals have been killed, and more
than 7,300 local herdsmen have been hurt or fell ill, due to the
snow and low temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Local experts attributed the heavy snowfalls to the unique
geographical conditions in these plateau prefectures, spotted with
mountains taller than 5,000 m, where warm fronts from the Bay of
Bengal and cold fronts from the Hymalayas meet. In the early 1996,
heavy snowstorms claimed 1.2 million livestocks.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government of Qinghai has paid great attention
to the situation by allocating five million yuan in relief funds
and sending work teams to the affected prefecturers, while the
provincial headquarters of People's Armed Police has also donated
relief goods worth 200,000 yuan to the victims.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 armed police soldiers have been dispatched to the
two prefectures, who have transported over 700 tons of relief
materials, rescued 274 local herdsmen, cleaned over 50 km of
snow-covered roads, removed over 20,000 animals to safe places,
donated 6,500 kg of food and 14,000 yuan worth of goods and
medicines.

<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's True Path Party (DYP)
Chairwoman Tansu Ciller may stand trial in the Constitutional
Court on charges of misuse of office, semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The High Appeals Court upheld a ruling by a lower court on a
case involving Ciller, the former prime minister between 1993 and
1995, leading to a possible trial of her.
</P>
<P>
The lower court ruling said that a man had swindled Ciller out
of thousands of U.S. dollars by purporting to be a close friend of
her.
</P>
<P>
Ciller took the sum of money from a slush fund controlled by
her when she was the prime minister, the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
Under the parliamentary regulations, it requires just one tenth
of the 550 deputies' participation to introduce a parliamentary
investigation to the Ciller case.
</P>
<P>
If more than half of the deputies vote for the report, Ciller
will have to stand trial in the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
Ciller had said in a letter to the lower court that she had
nothing to do with the case and demanded her name be deleted from
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference earlier Friday, Ciller said that
she and her party colleagues were afraid of nothing, adding that
such issues would only make the DYP stronger.
</P>
<P>
Some senior DYP leaders also accused the Higher Appeals Court
of taking a wrong attitude toward the issue, claiming that the
case was an ordinary one.
</P>
<P>
The Republic People's Party, one of the major parties in the
parliament, has announced that it supported a probe into the
case, demanding a lift of her parliamentary immunity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supports Team Withdrawal from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Friday said it supported to withdraw an American-led U.N.
weapons inspection team after Iraq refused to allow it to
carry out its duty, but adding it was not a victory for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We support the decision to withdraw ... that particular
mission, in the face of Iraq's refusal to allow the team to do
its work," State Department spokesman James Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in
charge of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction decided
to withdraw the inspection team, led by American expert Scott
Ritters, on Friday, a day earlier than scheduled, after Iraq
blocked the team to discharge its duty.
</P>
<P>
Rubin denied that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had won the
victory with the withdrawal of the Ritter-led team, saying it
was because "the international community was as united as it can
be in rejecting the premise that Saddam Hussein can deny a
particular group."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused Ritter of spying for the United States and
complained the unbalanced composition of his team with
substantial Americans and Britons in the team.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations on Wednesday unanimously adopted a statement
deploring Iraq's barring the inspection team from carrying out its
duty and required Iraq to allow U.N. weapons inspectors to do
their work unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, U.N. inspection chief, will be in Baghdad next
Monday and Tuesday for talks with Iraqi officials on the banning
of the Ritter-led team and the right of his inspectors to have
access to all sites.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Butler was to go to Iraq and to try to convince
the Iraqis that if they don't change their ways and don't allow
Ambassador Butler and the U.N. to do its work, then there is no
way for them to get out of the sanctions hole they've dug for
themselves," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has stipulated that the sanctions imposed
on Iraq following the Gulf War would be lifted only after Iraq
fully complies with U.N. Security Resolutions to dismantle
weapons of mass destruction.

ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A total of some 100,000 Greek
people suffer from schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms usually appeared among the patients aged between

patients usually suffered only one episode of the disease during
their lifetime, the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA)
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the symptoms usually appeared under the
influence of external factors such as stress.
</P>
<P>
It seems that heredity was involved in the causes of the
disease, as well as illnesses suffered by the mother during
pregancy, such as influenza, the experts said.

<HEADLINE> UN Arms Team Led by American Pulled out of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
told its weapons inspection team led by American Scott Ritter to
pull out of Iraq, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said at today's noon
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The team has been told to leave the country and return to
their home base," Fred said.
</P>
<P>
The team, which has been blocked by Iraq from carrying out its
weapons inspection, was originally supposed to leave Iraq on
friday if it could complete its work, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has prevented the weapon inspectors led by American Scott
Ritter from operating since Tuesday, saying the team is dominated
by Americans and Britons, and accused Ritter spying for the United
states.
</P>
<P>
Richard Butler, the head of the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, is on his way to visit Baghdad where he is
expected to have talks with Iraqi officials on Monday and Tuesday
on the banning of the team and the right of his inspectors to have
access to all sites.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Waives Helms-Burton Provisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today decided to suspend for an additional six months provisions
in the Helms-Burton law that would have allowed U.S. citizens to
sue third-country firms doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"Today I am notifying the Congress of my decision to suspend
for an additional 6 months the right of U.S. nationals to file
suit against foreign firms trafficking in confiscated properties
in Cuba," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Last Summer Washington made a deal with the European Union,
waiving for six months the controversial provisions of the 1996
legislation, while the EU froze its own claim before the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The law, which was enacted early last year, was condemned
worldwide even by the allies of the United States including Canada
and EU countries, who prefer a different approach towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton law penalizes third country companies doing
business in Cuba with assets that belonged to U.S. citizens or
corporations and were confiscated after the 1959 revolution.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and the United States have never settled the claims now
valued at more than six billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 18 months, we have worked with our allies and
friends to support concrete measures that promote peaceful
change in Cuba," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the U.S.-led international approach" towards
Cuba must be "preserved, expanded and strengthened."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Vice President Sir Leon Brittan of the EU
Commission said that the EU and the U.S. will continue to
negotiate a settlement over their dispute over the law.

<HEADLINE> Baltics, U.S. Sign Charter in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the three Baltic
nations today signed a partnership charter with the United States,
a step President Bill Clinton said could lead to membership of the
Baltics in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Presidents Lennart Meri of Estonia, Guntis Ulmanis of Latvia
and Algirdas Brazauskas of Lithuania joined Clinton at the White
House in signing the U.S.-Baltic Charter of Partnership.
</P>
<P>
The charter also includes a declaration of U.S. support for
eventual membership in the trans-Atlantic community.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Clinton said that NATO membership is
not guaranteed by the agreement. But he expressed hope that the
Baltics will in time walk through the door to NATO.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the America's security is tied to that of
Europe and Europe is "not fully secure" if the Baltics' security
is in doubt.

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Calls for More Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania intends to step up the
development of liberal trade with Russia, the Interfax reported
from Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital.
</P>
<P>
Gefiminas Miskinis, the Baltic state's deputy economic
minister, said that Lithuania had invited Russian government
delegation to Vilnius to discuss the bilateral trade and economic
cooperation between January 26 and 30, and continue the drafting
of documents aimed at creating a more favorable environment for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lithuanian side has suggested that the drafting document on
avoiding dual taxation be continued. The two sides have already
exchanged draft treaties on the protection and encouragement of
mutual investments.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the forthcoming meeting would focus on
reduction of customs duties and standardization and certification
of products to eliminate obstacles to trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Miskinis said that contacts between regions, cities, towns and
companies in Lithuania and Russia would promote trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized Russia was the main foreign trade partner for
Lithuania, but the potential of expanding mutually beneficial
relations had not been exhausted at all. "This is why Lithuanian
entrepreneurs want us to overcome problems faster and work out
treaties leading to more effective cooperation," the deputy
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, now in
Washington, are to sign with U.S. President Bill Clinton the
Partnership Charter on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian side expressed hope on Thursday that Russia
would not reproach Lithuania with the signing of the U.S.- Baltic
Charter, which, it said, should not infringe upon the good
relations between Lithuania and Russia.

</P>
<P>
He indicated that the America's security is tied to that of
Europe and Europe is "not fully secure" if the Baltics' security
is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
The document notes that the United States has a "real,
profound, and enduring" interest in their security and
independence of the three Baltic states.
</P>
<P>
The charter reaffirms U.S. policy that NATO's partners can
become members as each aspirant proves itself able and willing to
assume the responsibilities and obligations of membership.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and the Balitcs also establish a "Partnership
Commission" to review annually the activities of the bilateral
military and economic working groups.
</P>
<P>
"As part of a common vision..., the partners declare that their
shared goal is the full integration of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania into European and transatlantic political, economic,
security and defense institutions," said the document.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference on Thursday, presidents of
the Baltics also said that the charter moves their countries
"closer to NATO" but is not targeted against Russia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a substitute for NATO membership. On the contrary,
the charter is moving us closer to NATO," Estonia's Meri said.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly states the United States' policy agenda on the
strategic issues -- the security of the Baltic region and
Europeans a whole," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meri said the Baltic states' application to join NATO, which is
fiercely opposed by Moscow and has been shelved by the alliance
until an undetermined future date, was "the next big challenge to
NATO."
</P>
<P>
"Allies and partners, like NATO and Russia, do not need a band
of neutral states to stand in between them," Meri said.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Turkish Pro-Islamic Party Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Constitutional Court
announced the closure of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP)
Friday, dealing a heavy blow to the arising fundamentalism in the
secular republic.
</P>
<P>
Ahmet Necdet Sezer, president of the supreme judicial organ,
said there were nine votes for to two against towards the
shut-down of the country's largest political party, headed by
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Sezer said that the RP was closed because of its clear
violation of the secular principles provided by the Constitution,
adding that democracy does not mean "no limits on political
parties".
</P>
<P>
As a result, Erbakan and six other senior RP members were
deprived of their parliamentarian status and barred from politics
for five years.
</P>
<P>
The case against the RP was filed with the Constitutional Court
by Turkish High Appeals Court Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas last
May on the grounds of the party's strong anti-secular stance.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the court judgement for the RP closure, Erbakan,
71, told a press conference that "such a decision is a judicial
mistake."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that it would be unconstitutional to shut down the
RP because a political party should not be held responsible for
the personal statements and behavior of some individuals.
</P>
<P>
The veteran politician had threatened time and again that he
would call for a judgement of the European Court of Human Rights
if his party was closed on the grounds of anti-secular charge.
</P>
<P>
The RP deputy chairman Ahmet Tekdal said no matter what
happens, the party will continue to advance its course.
</P>
<P>
Temel Karamollaoglu, deputy chairman of the RP parliamentary
group, had also said that those who made wrong judgement on the
case would be judged one day by history.
</P>
<P>
Tansu Ciller, chairwoman of the opposition True Path Party
(DYP), said that her party is totally against the court decision.
</P>
<P>
The DYP was a former partner of the RP-led coalition
government which governed the country for one year and was forced
to step down from the pressure of the powerful Turkish military.
</P>
<P>
The RP, founded on July 19, 1983, enjoyed wide support from
the poor, especially in rural areas and urban slums, as it often
provides economic aids to them.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these voters, the RP won a sweeping victory in the
December 1995 general elections with 21.32 percent of the vote,
ranking the first in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, the RP's pro-Islamic tendency and its reluctance to
take tough measures against the fundamentalists annoyed the army
generals.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Turkish military, which regards itself as a
defender of Turkey's secularism founded by Mustafa Kemel, father
of modern Turkey, has repeatedly accused the RP of its support of
religious radicals.
</P>
<P>
It launched a nationwide campaign against the fundamentalism
since last year, also aiming to discredit RP's status.
</P>
<P>
While the RP-led coalition government was in power, the
Turkish military even sent tanks to Sincan, a city some 40
kilometers west of the capital Ankara, to show its determination
to defend Turkey's secularism. A pro-Islamic rally in Sincan last
February had caused grave concern among the military and other
secular forces.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the RP can by no means be seen as a last
victory of the secularists since its political followers might
emerge again under other names, observers said.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of the RP closure, a new pro-Islamic Virtue
Party was set up on December 17, 1997 by some politicians with
close ties to the RP.
