<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress is in no position
to exert political pressure on Russia regarding its cooperation
with Iran, said Yeltsin's Press Secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress intends to debate a bill on sanctions against
Moscow, claiming that Russia provided Iran with nuclear
technology, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia adheres to the principles of non-proliferation regarding
nuclear weapons and nuclear technology in its cooperation with
Iran, said Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
Moscow will never bow to political pressure from the
U.S. Congress on this matter, the press secretary stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is totally baseless to assume that cooperation between
Russia and Iran on nuclear energy will present dangers. And Russia
would not like to see its companies squeezed out of the world
markets by unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
Russia does not wish to see its neighbors become new members of
the so-called "nuclear club" or possess nuclear potential, said
the Kremlin official.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract worth 800 million U.S. dollars, Russian
experts are helping Iran build a nuclear power plant in Bushire,
which has drawn criticism from the United States.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Thursday said it welcomes dialog with President
Robert Mugabe to iron out differences between the organization
and the government.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU second Vice-President Shangwa Chifamba said workers'
representatives wished to meet the president as soon as possible
and resolve all differences which have resulted in labor unrest
over the past six months, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZCTU had sent the letter to Mugabe through Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro
requesting the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The workers have been demanding that the government scrap the
two-and-half percent increase in sales tax which was introduced
last year, the new 15 percent tax on pension profits and the five
percent development levy.
</P>
<P>
Last December and this March, the ZCTU organized the national
job stayaways to protest prices and tax hikes and on May Day, it
threatened that a longer job stayaway was looming if the
government did not heed its requests.
</P>
<P>
Chifamba said, "we are now waiting for a date to be set to
meet the president. We hope the meeting will not be too long
because it might be overtaken by events."
</P>
<P>
"The ZCTU welcomes this opening of dialog with the government
because we are searching for solutions to the problems," he said,
adding that further job stayaways would only be used as a last
resort.

JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Botswana recorded seven
percent growth in gross domestic product (GDP) for the year
ending June, 1997, which remained the same as in the previous

<P>
Figures released before showed that the country's GDP stood at

financial year, compared with the 14,631 million Pula (3,658
million Dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, Botswana's exports rose by 37 percent,
improving the balance of payments to 2,400 million Pula (600
million Dollars) against 1,650 million (412.5 million Dollars) in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's international reserves rose 13 percent to 21,600
million Pula (5,400 million Dollars) from 19,100 million Pula
(4,775 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank reported a 40 percent growth rate

Pula (368.8 million Dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese were wounded Thursday
in an Israeli air raid on Lebanon's eastern Province of Bekaa
Valley, the country's independent Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The five, including three civilians and two guerrillas of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, were wounded when Israeli warplanes
swooped down on a mountainous area in the western Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli jets fired a total of four air-to-surface missiles
at their suspected Hezbollah targets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The air raid, the 41st into Lebanon so far this year, also
destroyed some crops and caused fire, it added.
</P>
<P>
The attack brought to 31 the number of Lebanese civilians
wounded in Israeli military operations against Hezbollah
guerrillas since the start of this year. Nine civilians were
killed.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war trying
to dislodge some 2,000 Israeli occupying forces and its 2,500
South Lebanese Army allies from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.

<HEADLINE> Red-Light Running Leads to More Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Red-light runners cause 250,000
traffic crashes a year, causing an increased number of deaths in
the United States, said a new study.
</P>
<P>
The number of fatal crashes involving red-light running
increased 15 percent, from 702 in 1992 to 809 in 1996, the
Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
From 1992 through 1996, there were 3,753 crashes caused by a
motorist running a red light -- about 3 percent of all fatal
crashes. Those crashes killed 4,238 people, said study researcher
Richard Retting.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater announced a
nationwide campaign to educate drivers about the problem and
install more cameras at intersections to catch offenders.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the Insurance Institute based the study on two
government databases, including the Fatality Analysis Reporting
System containing details of nearly all police-reported fatal
motor vehicle crashes in the United States.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter of the 1 million traffic crashes at signals
each year involve running red lights.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official on
Thursday urged the United States to pressure Israel to accept its
proposal on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and warned of
violence if U.S. efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief peace negotiator Saeb Erekat called on
Washington not to allow Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to postpone again a decision on the U.S. proposal demanding Israel
to withdraw from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks as U.S. President Bill Clinton was expected
to meet with top foreign policy advisors to discuss Washington's
next steps in breaking the impasse of the peace talks between the
Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also minister of Local Government of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), expressed hope that Washington would
soon go public with its plan and press Israel to accept it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ahmed Tibi, senior advisor to PNA President Yasser
Arafat, told Israel Radio that if Israel continues to reject the
U.S. proposal and as a result the peace process dies, "widespread
violence" could erupt in the region.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has accepted the U.S. proposal, but Israel has not.
Citing security concerns, Netanyahu has said Israel will hand over
no more than 9 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Yediot Ahronoth daily reported on Thursday that the
U.S. has given Netanyahu a one-week ultimatum to accept the
U.S. proposal or to be blamed publicly for the failure in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government has denied the report.

<HEADLINE> EU to Consider Whether to Hold Mideast Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said Thursday that European Union foreign ministers will consider
next Monday whether there is a need to launch a new international
conference in a bid to restart the the stalled Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
The proposal about a Middle East peace conference was floated
by French President Jacques Chirac and his Egyptian counterpart,
Hosni Mubarak, during their meeting in Paris Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after talks with visiting
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Bonn, Kinkel said that EU
foreign ministers will discuss the proposal at their regular
meeting next Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"Given the current standstill in the Middle East peace process,
we must consider what we can do to get out of the crisis," Kinkel
said. However he also noted that a new peace conference was only
one of the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also stressed that the United States should remain as
"the main sponsor of Middle East peace" though it appeared now
necessary for the EU to play a stronger role.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern about the failure of the latest peace
initiative launched by Washington, Moussa said that the Middle
East peace "has not only reached a standstill, it has also reached
a major crisis point."
</P>
<P>
He also sharply criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu for rejecting all peace proposals and called on the
international community to increase pressure on the Israeli
leader.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the Middle East is not a regional issue. It
is linked to international peace and security. Therefore, it is up
to us all to stand firm against the policy followed by the Israeli
government," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Urged to Do More in Fresh Water Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese delegation Thursday
urged the U. N. Environment Program (UNEP) to play a more active
role in the management of global fresh water resources and make
greater contributions to the protection of these resources.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going fifth special session of the UNEP
Governing Council, a Chinese official proposed that an expert
group be established to study the situation of environmental
management of fresh water resources in the world.
</P>
<P>
The group should put forward policy framework and
methodologies for environmentally sound management of fresh
water, the official of the Chinese delegation added.
</P>
<P>
He said at the three-day meeting which opened Wednesday that
UNEP should assist the developing countries in strengthening
their capacity for fresh water management, especially in the
field of getting access to the practicable technologies.
</P>
<P>
The issue of fresh water is among the four main issues being
discussed at the special session in order to implement the
Nairobi Declaration adopted last year at the 19th session of the
UNEP Governing Council.
</P>
<P>
At the opening meeting, UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer
noted that "supply of fresh water would be a critical issue in
the years to come."
</P>
<P>
He announced that recently the Global Environment Fund (GEF)
had approved a Global International Waters Assessment which would
provide governments, the GEF and UNEP with information on Major
water issues.
</P>
<P>
UNEP is also exploring the possibility of developing a global
action program focusing on the environmental aspects of fresh
water management, the UNEP chief added.
</P>
<P>
During the discussions, the Group of 77 and China Thursday
urged UNEP to play a vital role in the sustainable development of
fresh water.
</P>
<P>
They noted that it was necessary to transfer applied
technology and related know-hows to the developing countries for
the sustainable development and management of fresh water
resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they urged UNEP executive director to take steps to
help the developing countries in collecting, interpreting and
disseminating information for water management decisions.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, the European Union also requested the
executive director in collaboration with other U.N. bodies, to
provide advice in support of national policies for integrated
water management.

<HEADLINE> One Killed, 24 Wounded in U.S. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- At least one person was killed
and 24 others were wounded when a student opened fire with a rifle
in a high school cafeteria in Springfield, Oregon, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The gunfire, the latest in a series of school shootings across
the country, began just before classes started at 8:00 a.m. in the
Thurston High School cafeteria. Among the wounded, seven were in
critical conditions.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, who was a freshman who had been expelled a day
earlier for trying to bring a gun to school, was taken into
custody about 20 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The school of 1,700 students was shut down immediately after
the shooting and parents waited for their children in church. A
school official read the names of students who were injured,
either in the shooting or its aftermath, according to the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of shootings at schools in the
United States. On Tuesday, a high school senior shot and killed a
student in a school parking lot in Fayetteville, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, a 14-year-old boy opened fire at an eighth-grade
graduation dance in Edinboro, Pennsylvania, killing a teacher and
wounding two students and another teacher.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, an 11-year-old boy and his 13-year-old friend
opened fire on classmates in Jonesboro, Arkansas, killing four
pupils and a teacher and wounding 10 others.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, a 16-year-old student in Pearl, Mississippi,
killed his mother, then went to school and shot nine students. Two
of them died.

<HEADLINE> Retired French Officer Expelled by Central African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A retired French army officer was
expelled by the government of the Central African Republic after
being detained for 15 days, because he was accused of threatening
the state security of the country.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported from Bangui that
Lieutenant-Colonel Michel-Paul Audigier was immediately arrested
on arriving at the Mpoko airport of Bangui on May 6.
</P>
<P>
Police said that Audigier was carrying a map of the airport
with "indications on the sensitive points of the site," but they
did not give further details on how he was threatening state
security.
</P>
<P>
He was questioned for several days by police before being
presented to President Ange-Felix Patasse himself. He was then
ordered to leave the country on the first plane available by the
interior minister.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that Audigier was arrested probably because he was
suspected to be a mercenary.
</P>
<P>
Patasse said in an interview with the French daily Liberation
in March that mercenaries were being recruited in France and
Belgium to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
"France, nostalgic of its past... wants to keep its colonial
stronghold at any price," said Patasse.
</P>
<P>
France has withdrawn its 1,400 troops from two military bases
in the Central African Republic, in the wake of a series of
mutinies by soldiers opposing Patasse last year.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reiterates Support for Palestinians in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Thursday reiterated its
support to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Senate Speaker Zeid Rifai told reporters here that the
kingdom sticks to a "firm and principled" stand in supporting the
Palestinians, especially at a time when the Palestinian-Israeli
peace talks are stalled due to Israeli intransigency.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after meeting a delegation from the
Palestinian Council that arrived here Tuesday on a three-day
official visit.
</P>
<P>
Jordan supports the Palestinians in their pursuit to realize
their national rights, the foremost of which is the establishment
of an independent Palestinian state on their national soil, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In a show of support to the Palestinians, the kingdom's
leadership always presses Israel to take "positive and
constructive" steps to restart peace talks with the Palestinians
and commit itself to the agreements it signed before, said Rifai.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's continuous intransigent policy will aggravate the
intense situation in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rifai expressed satisfaction over the
"distinguished, brotherly" ties linking Jordan and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The delegation is here to discuss with Jordanian officials the
political situation on the Palestinian-Israeli track and enhance
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiation has been deadlocked
since March last year due to Israeli government's hardline
policy. The PNA has set May 1999 as the time to declare an
independent Palestinian state, but Israel has warned the
Palestinians not to take unilateral actions.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin met
with World Bank President James Wolfensohn here Thursday to
discuss with him support for the efforts of the Russian government
and Central Bank, according to Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Yeltsin said that after six year's cooperation
with the World Bank, Russia has proved to be a reliable partner
and hopes to continue cooperation with the bank in future.
</P>
<P>
Deputy head of the Russian president's office Alexander
Livshits, who attended the meeting, quoted Wolfensohn as saying
that the World Bank backs actions by the new Russian government
and wishes that the Russian market should also back these actions.
</P>
<P>
Livshits told a briefing that the bank's president supports the
latest steps by the Russian government and the Central Bank to
normalize the situation on the financial market.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko Thursday also met with
Wolfensohn and discussed with him a program for Russia's
borrowings from the World Bank this year and ways of implementing
it.
</P>
<P>
The two sides focused on loans for social reforms, especially
for pension security in Russia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko meanwhile requested a loan for upgrading the coal
industry as part of a second "coal" loan he had tried to arrange
through the World Bank as a Fuel and Energy Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with State Duma deputies on the day, the head of the
World Bank said that discussion on World Bank financing for Russia
is impossible until the country has settled its social problems.
However, the bank is ready to continue to cooperate with Russia,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that he believes in Russia and, after his
meeting with the Russian president and prime minister, he saw that
they are ready to combat the economic difficulties facing the
country.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is ready to be a long-term partner of Russia and
appreciates the country's readiness to cooperates facing the
country, the president of the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs U.S. Ratification for Expanding NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Thursday gave formal U.S. approval for expanding the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to include Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony, Clinton signed the instrument of
ratification passed by the Senate on April 30.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to help to build a Europe that is undivided, free,
democratic, at peace and secure," Clinton said before putting his
signature to the document.
</P>
<P>
A larger NATO, Clinton said, will mean American troops "will be
much less likely to cross the Atlantic to fight and die in a war."
</P>
<P>
For the 60 million people in Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, NATO membership means they can "know that what they
build in peace they will be able to keep in security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Amendment to the treaty, which was signed on April 4, 1949,
creating NATO, will have to be ratified by all the current 16
members.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Germany and Norway
have ratified the eastward NATO expansion. It is the first
enlargement of the alliance since Spain joined in 1982.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are expected to convene a summit in Washington
next April to formally welcome the three new members.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 "Street Kids" Recorded in Moldovan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of fugitive and
homeless children, the so-called "street kids," reached a record
50,000 in the Moldovan capital Chisinau, reported the Moldovan
news agency BASA-Press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Many underage children have to beg or quit school because of
miserable conditions in their families, said Nelli Berezovschi,
head of the city hall's family and child protection direction.
Over 900 pupils have left the school, while the number of
abandoned children is on the rise, he added.
</P>
<P>
A total of 430 minors were caught in offenses last year, but
only 10 of them were under police supervision because of their
predisposition to crime, Berezovschi said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal fund of social protection allocated in 1997 was
some 1.7 million lei (about 360,000 U.S. dollars) in material
assistance for 6,136 families with three and more children under
18.
</P>
<P>
Joanna Rogers, managerial director of the European Children
Trust for Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova, said Wednesday during an
international seminar in Chisinau that the grave condition of
"street kids" confirms the need to introduce new, more efficient
forms of support in poor families.
</P>
<P>
The European Children Trust held on May 20-21 -- as part of a
trial project -- a seminar with the theme of "principles and
methodology of temporary protection in a family." The seminar
aimed at developing services for children in risky conditions.

CAIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt-Germany trade volume in 1997 stood at about 3.8
billion Germany marks (about 2.13 billion U.S. dollars), 900
million marks (504.2 million dollars) more than that in 1996, the
Egyptian Al-Ahram daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili said that
Egypt exported 468.3 million marks (263.35 million dollars) worth
of goods in the year, increasing by 14.4 million marks (8.07
million dollars) from the 1996 level.
</P>
<P>
Exports of cotton yarn and textiles rose to 147.3 million marks
(82.52 million dollars) from 112.9 million marks (63.25 million
dollars) in 1996, accounting for 31.45 percent of Egypt's exports
to Germany in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The value of German exports to Egypt was at 3.3 billion marks
(1.85 billion dollars) in 1997, the Egyptian minister said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Agriculture Youssef Wali has said that Egypt and the European
Union (EU) have reached in principle a trade agreement, the
Egyptian newspaper Al-Alam El-Youm reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Egypt will export to the EU 500,000 tonnes

<HEADLINE> Russian Mideast Envoy Pessimistic About Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 21 (Xinhua) -- After a shuttle visit to the Middle
East region, Russian special peace envoy Victor Possevalyuk
Thursday said he was pessimistic about the current peace process
in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The general impression I have got from the visit intends to
be pessimistic as the situation is quite complicated,"
Possevalyuk said at a news conference following his meeting with
Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz.
</P>
<P>
During his Middle East tour, the Russian envoy has visited
Egypt, Palestinian self-rule areas, Israel, Jordan, Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian track in the peace process has remained
in a stalemate while there has been no change on the Syrian and
Lebanese track.
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret about the outcome of the United States
efforts to advance the peace process which has been stalled since
March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The United States has so far failed to persuade Israel to
accept its proposal to hand over a 13.1 percent land of the West
Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Lebanese track has been deadlocked since the
hardline Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power
in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
But, Possevalyuk stressed that Russia would play an active
role in the next stage of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Israeli proposal of withdrawal from south Lebanon, he said
that he had repeatedly stressed during his visit that the special
relations between Lebanon and Syria must be taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
Israel has suggested that it would withdraw its troops from
south Lebanon if the Lebanese government agrees to provide
security guarantee.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria rejected the offer, saying that the
withdrawal must be unconditional as stipulated in the United
Nations Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also insisted that their negotiations with
Israel must be held simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which has some 40,000 troops in Lebanon, seeks a
comprehensive solution which will involve an Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Possevalyuk arrived here from Damascus Thursday morning and
has left for home.

<HEADLINE> Mauritius Keen to Engage in Mozambique's SEZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius is keen to participate in
developing a special economic zone (SEZ) in the Valley of Zambeze
of the central Mozambique, Mauritian Minister of Economic
Development and Regional Cooperation Manon Bheenick has said.
</P>
<P>
Bheenick said this in an interview during the Windhoek summit
of Southern African Development Community (SADC) on economic
issues, the Mozambican News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement with the Mozambican government
on the establishment of a Mozambican-Mauritian mixed committee
for the development of the special economic zone," Bheenick was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two governments reached the agreement in
February when a Mauritian business delegation paid a visit to
Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, Bheenick said that it is still too early to tell the
total amount of investment needed in the establishment of the
special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
But the Mauritian minister pledged that the project will cover
about 100,000 hectares, saying that "we will construct roads,
houses and other social infrastructures in this area."
</P>
<P>
"If things go smoothly, there will be Mauritians coming to
participate in the development in the Valley of Zambeze in
September and October this year," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Bheenick also disclosed that Mauritian government has approved
the program for the restoration and modernization of the Sena
Sugar States, the Mozambican state-owned sugar plant located in
the central Sofala Province. The restoration project will cost
about 80 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two governments also agreed that the business
people, investors and students can pass customs without visa.
</P>
<P>
Bheenick pointed out that through these moves "the trade
between our two countries will increase."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, FAO Sign Pact on Swine Fever Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) Thursday signed a technical cooperation
agreement for the eradication of the African swine fever (ASF) in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the United Nations agency will contribute
364,500 U.S. Dollars to the 541,000-U.S.-Dollar project, the
Nigerian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
FAO has earlier allocated 386,000 U.S. Dollars to finance an
ASF prevention and intervention scheme in nine west African
countries including Nigeria, according to FAO Representative in
Nigeria Hashim A-Shami.
</P>
<P>
The project, he said, is also expected to provide surveillance
training activities for ASF in Nigeria and initiate a systematic
eradication campaign on the disease.
</P>
<P>
ASF, according to Nigerian Agricultural Minister Malami Buwai,
posed astronomical economic loss to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The last epidemic of the disease in the country in 1973 killed
over 30,000 pigs.
</P>
<P>
Last year, an outbreak of the disease, which was then traced
to neighboring Benin, took a heavy toll on the seven-million pig
population in Nigeria.

California-Berkeley, was nominated three years ago, but has been
criticized as too liberal by some Republicans.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher's nomination now goes to the full Senate for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
One of his Republican opponents, Senator John Ashcroft, said
Fletcher's writings "display a disturbing tendency" toward
judicial activism that would lead him to follow his own agenda
rather than legal precedent once on the bench.
</P>
<P>
Democrats have criticized Republicans for slowing their
examinations of Clinton's judicial nominees, creating a backlog of
vacancies and clogging the courts with more work than sitting
judges can handle.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had agreed to also nominate Barbara Durham, a
conservative and chief justice of the Washington state Supreme
Court, to the 9th Circuit Court in exchange for a Republican
promise to end resistance to the president's choices for vacancies
on the federal bench, according to Republican Senator Slade Gorton
from Washington.

<HEADLINE> World Food Program Airlifting Food to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
said it has started to airlift 2,300 tons of food from Dar es
Salaam to Burundi to feed thousands of displaced and vulnerable
people in need of food aid.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the organization
Thursday, a Boeing 707 is serving the operation which began early
this week.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft makes two flights to Bujumbura airport with each
carrying 34 tons of food, including powdered milk, corn flour,
soybean flour, oil, rice and beans, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The airlift, which is funded by the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO) at a cost of 1.5 million U.S. Dollars,
will help WFP counteract the shortage of emergency food stocks
resulting from flooding early this year which paralyzed
Tanzania's transport network, it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release said continuing insecurity in Burundi has
caused large number of people to flee their land.
</P>
<P>
While WFP estimated that over 5,000 tons of relief food per
month is currently needed in the central African country to
assist some 345,000 people, the agency has been unable to deliver
more than 44 per cent of the requirement since the beginning of
the year due to transport constraints.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, at the beginning of last
month, WFP airlifted from Dar es Salaam to Bujumbura 685 tons of
food from Dar es Salaam to Bujumbura for 37,000 malnourished
Burundian children.

WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States and six Latin
American countries Thursday signed a dolphin protection agreement,
allowing the U.S. to lift tuna trade embargoes on participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed here by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and representatives of Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico,
Nicaragua, Panama and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Albright said that it would eliminate dolphin deaths associated
with fishing for tuna. "This is one of the strongest agreements
ever negotiated to conserve marine life."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement will ensure the effective conservation of these
marine resources (dolphins) well into the future. It will also
provide the basis for removing U.S. tuna trade embargoes for
nations which become parties to the agreement," State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He added it was fully consistent with a 1977 U.S. law which
requires a dolphin protection agreement as a condition for lifting
the trade bans against the affected nations
</P>
<P>
The accord will enter into force after being ratified by four
countries of the seven.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Shrugs at EU Proposal for Closer Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkey showed indifference on
Thursday to a proposal by the European Union (EU) to reestablish
closer bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said the EU has failed to
clarify "all the sensitive issues" included in Turkey's statement
last December.
</P>
<P>
"It would therefore be wiser to hold the meeting of the
(Turkish-EU) Association Council when the circumstances have been
made more appropriate by the EU," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after an EU meeting held in Brussels on
Wednesday on EU's position on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU members, except Greece, expressed support for the
Strategy Document submitted to the European Council in March,
which agrees to help Turkey get closer to the European body.
</P>
<P>
During his one-day visit to Ankara Tuesday, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, whose country holds EU's rotating
presidency, said the EU would sidestep Greek hurdles to fulfill
its promise for a 400-million-U.S.-dollar aid to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU is apparently trying to placate Ankara in return for its
attendance of the Turkish-EU Association Council meeting
scheduled for May 25 in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, said the time is not ripe for such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is dissatisfied with Cook's pledge that other EU members
would work out ways to overcome Greece's veto of the EU financial
aid package to Turkey,
</P>
<P>
"Turkey welcomes the fact that the EU has embarked on a serious
quest to overcome the illegal Greek veto. Yet, it also remains
true that this has not been achieved so far," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that Turkey would most unlikely take part in
the Brussels meeting aimed at bettering the Turkish-EU relations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-EU ties have been tense since last December when the EU
excluded Turkey from its expansion plan. Turkey has announced to
halt political dialog with the 15-nation group to protest what
Ankara says EU's discriminative attitude towards it.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Demand Release of Executive Privilege Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled House
of Representatives Thursday called for public release of all
documents related to U.S. President Bill Clinton's assertion of
executive privilege in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
Executive privilege is used to protect confidential advice that
a president receives from his advisers.
</P>
<P>
The non-binding resolution passed 259-157 after a highly
partisan debate.
</P>
<P>
Republicans complained that Clinton wrongly invoked the
privilege to protect his personal conduct rather than advice he
received on official matters.
</P>
<P>
Democrats countered that federal judges, not Congress, must
decide whether to release the information because the issue is
before the courts.
</P>
<P>
Democrats called the resolution as retaliation for an
unsuccessful Democratic resolution that sought last week to
criticize Representative Dan Burton, a Republican, for his
handling of a controversial campaign fund-raising investigation.
</P>
<P>
Clinton invoked the executive privilege to prevent two senior
aides from answering grand jury questions about his relationship
with former intern Monica Lewinsky. All documents were placed
under seal by Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who has reportedly rejected Clinton's claim and is considering
whether to release the documents and her ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration is expected to appeal, keeping the
issue before the courts.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Business Confidence Slides: Think Tank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian business confidence
continues to slide, hurt by slumping commodity prices, higher
interest rates and uncertain Asian markets, a leading economic
think-tank said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a seasonal review, the Conference Board of Canada said its
spring index of business attitudes dropped 4.2 percent in the
first quarter to 155.0, the third straight decline for the index.
</P>
<P>
The index has now fallen 10 points from its peak of 165 in the
second quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The uncertainty in the world commodity and financial markets
is taking a toll on Canadian business," said Paul Darby, director
of the board's economic services.
</P>
<P>
"Firms are concerned about the sustainability of the current
situation in Canada," he added.
</P>
<P>
The board's survey was conducted in March, when a number of
events forced respondents to lower their expectations. Commodity
prices weakened in the month, resulting in lower profits for most
large Canadian firms.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns about overall economic conditions, business
remain confident that both labor and inflation costs are under
control, according to the economic think-tank based in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
On the consumer front, the news is better. The board's index of
consumer attitudes moved up 1.8 points to 118.5, due to increased
optimism about job creation.
</P>
<P>
Close to 27 percent of respondents felt there would be more
jobs created over the next six months. This is up from 20 percent
in the fourth quarter of 1997.

<HEADLINE> LIFFE's Euro Market Strategy For Bond Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) Thursday unveiled its
strategy for its existing bond contracts in preparation for the
start of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The strategy ensures the smooth transfer and continuous listing
of the LIFFE's Bond contracts through and beyond the launch of the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
Three of the LIFFE's bond contracts will be affected by EMU:
the German Government Bond, the Medium Term Government Bond and
the Italian Government Bond contracts, according to an
announcement by the LIFFE.
</P>
<P>
Because of strong market demand, the board has decided that the
exchange will list euro-denominated futures and options contracts
in parallel with the existing national currency unit (NCU)
contracts.
</P>
<P>
For 1999 delivery months, all of the euro contracts will have a
nominal size of euro 100,000. In addition, the LIFFE intends that
most other elements of the contract specifications of the euro
contracts will be identical to those of the equivalent parallel
listed NCU delivery month.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Hodson, the LIFFE's chief executive, said, "These
initiatives for bond contracts complement the LIFFE's Euro Market
strategy for short-term interest rate (STIR) and for equity index
products."

<HEADLINE> Nippon Credit Bank's Rating to BBB- From BBB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international rating
agency, has downgraded the Long-term rating of Japan's Nippon
Credit Bank to "BBB-" from BBB, and the bank's Short-term rating
is affirmed at "F2."
</P>
<P>
The agency's Long-term rating of Nippon Credit Bank (NCB) has
remained unchanged since 1995, according to an announcement by
Fitch IBCA Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It had long recognized that the bank was likely to suffer such
large loan losses and had premised its securities ratings on
support from the Japanese authorities.
</P>
<P>
This support was duly provided in the spring of 1997 when the
Ministry of Finance coordinated a rescue for the bank, including a
capital injection by the Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Having supported the bank only last year, Fitch IBCA does not
expect the authorities to withdraw their support in the
short-term; it is therefore making no change to its Short-term
rating of "F2."
</P>
<P>
In the long term, however, the agency had some concerns over
the extent of support that may be given to various classes of
creditor.
</P>
<P>
It is therefore lowering its Long-term rating of NCB to "BBB-,"
Fitch IBCA said.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Villagers Return Home in Northwest Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- About 50,000 people who had fled
to bushes and volcano forests, or to the Democratic Republic of
Congo in the past months are massively returning to their homes
in the prefectures of Gisenyi and Ruhengeri, Rwanda News Agency
(RNA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The movement started about a month ago," the assistant
prefect in charge of administrative affairs in Gisenyi, northwest
Rwanda, Gerard Ngoga indicated. "With this week alone, we have
in some communes registered up to 2,000 displaced people flocking
out of hideouts everyday."
</P>
<P>
According to Ngoga, in a period of less than one month, 14,000
resettled in their villages in Mutura commune northeast of
Gisenyi town, another 10,000 were registered in neighboring
Rwerere, both on the fringe of the volcano mountains marking the
porous border with the DRC.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Gisenyi government officials dispatched 10 tons
of food items, and drugs to Rwerere where the returning
internally-displaced villagers are said to be faced with hunger,
and malnutrition-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Ruhengeri prefecture, about 26,000 villagers
from the communes of Nkuli, Kinigi, and Mukingo also left
hideouts in the forests of the volcano mountains.
</P>
<P>
Reasons pushing these people to return to their homes they had
abandoned months ago range from hunger and starvation in
hideouts, exposure and atrocities committed by the militia, RNA
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Security has returned in most of these communes," the prefect
of Ruhengeri, Boniface Rucagu was quoted as saying. "These
people had been forced to follow 'infiltrators' in the mountains,
but today they are massively dissociating themselves with the
enemy."
</P>
<P>
The word "infiltrator" is used by the Rwandan government to
indicate the Hutu extremist militia, made of the notorious
"Interahamwe" -- those who attack together -- and some former
government soldiers behind the waves of violence prevailing in
northwest and some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the villagers who are now breaking free from the
militia, local residents were told to follow them to the
territory under their control. The villagers were asked to flee
the "Tutsi" government army for a sanctuary in caves and forests.
</P>
<P>
Some returning villagers interviewed by RNA affirmed Thursday
that all was but lies, the militia are said to have used them as
mere human shields.
</P>
<P>
Although no one has visited these hideouts to know exactly
what the situation there looks like, the villagers accuse the
militia of extreme barbarity.
</P>
<P>
In one of the many recent cases of such atrocities, the
militia reportedly slaughtered 30 babies crying for food at
Bisate, a sector in Kinigi commune, in Ruhengeri on the foot of
Sabyinyo volcano.
</P>
<P>
"There are other numerous cases of such suppression of human
life," the returnees said.
</P>
<P>
"Even the old ones who fail to accomplish a special mission
are killed in cold blood,'' they added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Call for Additional Support for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Fed chief Alan Greenspan and two
senior officials of the Clinton administration Thursday called on
U.S. congressmen to give the green light to additional 18 billion
U.S. dollar assistance for the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The effects of the Asian crisis are just now being felt in the
United States and there is still a slim possibility that the
financial turmoil in the region could widen into a much greater
threat to the global economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan noted.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the U.S. House Agriculture Committee,
Greenspan and two government officials, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, stressed that the
U.S. economy had not yet absorbed the full impact of the financial
turmoil that struck Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have so far avoided the type of continuing downward spiral
that some feared," Greenspan said in his testimony before the
committee.
</P>
<P>
But he also reminded the congressmen that there remained a
"small but not negligible probability that the upset in East Asia
could have unexpectedly large negative effects on Japan, Latin
America, and eastern and central Europe that, in turn, could have
repercussions elsewhere, including the United States."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also stressed that there was a lag between the
financial meltdown in currency and stock markets and the impact of
those adverse developments on the overall world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The effects of the Asian crisis on the real economies of the
immediately affected countries, as well as on our own economy, are
only now just being felt," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the committee, Rubin said that the United
States has "critical economic and national security interests in
restoring financial stability in Asia". Nearly 40 percent of the
U.S. agricultural production is exported -- and 40 percent of
those exports go to Asia. In general, 30 percent of U.S. exports
go to Asia, supporting millions of U.S. jobs, and this country now
exports more to Asia than Europe, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also stressed that the United States also has critical
national security interest in seeing a restoration of financial
stability in the region. "We have 100,000 troops based in Asia,
37,000 on the Korean Peninsula alone. A stable and prosperous Asia
is more likely to be a peaceful Asia," he underlined.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for the United States to do everything sensible
to help these Asian countries get back on track, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan appeared Thursday with Rubin and Glickman as part of
a continuing effort by the administration and the Fed to win
approval for 18 billion dollars in additional support for the IMF,
whose resources have been depleted by the need to organize more
than 100 billion dollars in financial bailouts.

<P>
OTTAWA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Canadian ports, led by Vancouver,
handled a record amount of international cargo in 1997, Statistics
Canada said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The growth of international cargo pushed the total tonnage
handled by the ports to its highest level in nine years, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
Total international cargo reached 282.3 million tons, an 8.5
percent increase from 1996 and an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
Shipment of four bulk commodities -- crude oil, coal, iron ore
and wheat -- were responsible for the increase in international
marine cargo.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver is by far the busiest port in Canada. In 1997, it
handled a record 71.8 million tons of cargo, almost one-fifth of
the total cargo handled at Canadian ports.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Vancouver was the number one port in Canada for coal,
wheat and sulphur and the number two port for container traffic.
</P>
<P>
International shipments accounted for 99 percent of the port's
total traffic in 1997, and 92 percent of these shipments were
outbound to foreign ports.

Governing Council, the Chinese delegation member said that a
strong UNEP would make greater contributions to the global cause
of environment and development.
</P>
<P>
He proposed at the three-day meeting that a science and
technology advisor committee should be established to make
advisory recommendations to UNEP on emerging environmental
issues.
</P>
<P>
The committee consisting of experts of various disciplines
related to the environment will provide scientific basis for the
decision making of UNEP, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the UNEP Secretariat, he noted that the
Secretariat should undertake effective reform and the Chinese
government is of the view that the reform of UNEP Secretariat is
one of the key steps in UNEP's reform and revitalization.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that as the leading environmental authority
within the United Nations, UNEP must have the power to formulate
global environmental agenda, make recommendations on global
environmental policies, organize and coordinate global
environmental activities.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the regional offices, the Chinese delegation
noted, they should play an important role in the formulation and
implementation of UNEP programs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government supports the Task Force chaired by UNEP
Executive Director Klaus Topfer on the reform in the field of
environment and human settlement.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Suharto's Resignation "Wise Decision" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday called Indonesian President Suharto's resignation a "wise
decision" and pledged to support what he said was "democratic
reform."
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the wise decision made less than 24 hours ago by
President Suharto in Indonesia," Clinton said in the Rose Garden
at the opening of a ceremony about the expansion of NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The United States stands ready to work, as we have with other
nations in the past, to support Indonesia's leaders and people as
they pursue democratic reform," he added.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Clinton made comments on Suharto's
resignation. On Wednesday night, Clinton expressed his welcome to
the move by Suharto shortly after the Indonesian president
announced his resignation in Jakarta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in a statement that Suharto's decision "provides
an opportunity to begin a process leading to a real democratic
transition for Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
The White House took a cautious approach, however, on what the
United States would do after Suharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
"We're assessing what has happened," White House spokesman Mike
McCurry told reporters. "You all don't know and we don't know at
this point how events are going to unfold there in coming days."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States would be prudent "to look before we
leap."
</P>
<P>
McCurry said the United States would consult with other
countries about whether the International Monetary Fund should
renew aid to Indonesia.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa welcomed
Indonesian President Suharto's resignation, the Foreign Affairs
Department said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government has welcomed President Suharto's
decision to withdraw from his position as president of Indonesia
with immediate effect, as a bold and courageous step," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It believes that this decision was taken in the interests of
the people of Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the South African government urges
Suharto's successor, Baharuddin Jusuf Habibie, as well as all the
other Indonesian leaders, to use this opportunity to ensure a
speedy return to political stability and economic recovery in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, South African President Nelson Mandela said
Suharto's resignation was a matter for the Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
Suharto, who had been president for 32 years, announced
resignation Thursday among pressure from parliament and
opposition parties after his country was torn apart by riots.
</P>
<P>
Habibie has been sworn in as new president of the populous
southeast Asian country.

LONDON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- British shares on the London market

</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE-100 index of leading shares managed its third

<HEADLINE> Japanese Film Condemned in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Some historians and survivors of
the Nanjing Massacre held a seminar at the Jiangdongmen Memorial
Hall here today to refute a distorting Japanese film, which began
premier in Japan early in May.
</P>
<P>
Worked out by right-wing forces in Japan with an investment of
1.5 billion yen, "Pride, an Instant in a Lifetime" has whitewashed
Japanese aggressor troops, denied the Nanjing Massacre and sung
the praises of Hideki Tojo, the top Japanese war criminal during
the World War II.
</P>
<P>
The film makes people indignant for it denies the large-scale
massacre in Nanjing in 1937 and says that the testimonies of
witnesses are nearly valueless, according to Zhu Chengshan,
director of the memorial hall.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the witnesses who appeared at the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East as shown in the film did exist,
and some of them are still alive. However, the film has distorted
the testimonies of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the large amount of remaining bones of slain
Chinese soldiers and innocent civilians and the photos and video
tapes shot by a foreign clergyman provide irrefutable evidences to
breaking the lies of the film's scriptwriter and director, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am a witness of history," said 80-year-old Li Xiuying,
pointing the scars on her face. On December 19, 1937, then
pregnant Li was stabbed more than 30 times by Japanese soldiers
for refusing to be raped.
</P>
<P>
She managed to survive following treatment by an American
doctor. But her child was lost.
</P>
<P>
Historians Gao Xingzu and Sun Zhaiwei with the Nanjing
University and the Jiangsu Academy of Social Sciences said at the
seminar that the film, which confuses right and wrong and tampers
with history, will surely be spurned by the people all around the
world.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Flays India's Statements on Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government's recent
statements about its nuclear tests are "designed to weave further
webs of deception to conceal India's hegemonic and aggressive
designs," a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to reports that India had
announced a moratorium on nuclear testing and was prepared to
discuss with Pakistan its "no first use" of nuclear weapons
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"Evidently, the Indian government's statement is meant to
placate international opinion on the nuclear test issue and
designed to weave further webs of deception to conceal India's
hegemonic and aggressive designs," he said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
"The world has now seen India's true face. A country with
India's record of war, conflicts and subversion against each one
of its neighbors, (and) now armed with nuclear weapons is a threat
to global peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The sort of jingoism and chauvinism being displayed by India
bodes ill for the region and its own poor and suffering people,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on India's "no first use" proposal, the spokesman
noted that the Indian leadership has already categorically stated
they would not hesitate to use nuclear weapons, whereas all states
are obliged under the U.N. Charter to refrain from any threat or
use of force, conventional or nuclear.
</P>
<P>
Indian Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani's statements "are
indicative of the total recklessness and fundamentalists euphoria
generated in India by its nuclear tests," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Advani said on Tuesday that Dew Delhi would take a tough stance
over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
This "reflects India's desire to secure its occupation of
Kashmir through nuclear blackmail," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia Qualify for Thomas Cup Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions Indonesia
were on their way to a record eleventh victory when they won over
arch rivals China 3-2 in the semi-finals at the 20th Thomas Cup
Badminton Finals here Friday, which set a championship final
against five-time winners Malaysia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the semi-final defeat, four-time winners China would
finish at the current world team championships tied third placers
for a fourth time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia scored a hard-won 3-2 semi-final victory over
runners-up Denmark Friday afternoon, with the outcome remaining
uncertain until after the final singles match.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia held Denmark to a 2-2 tie on team scores in the
semi-finals in the afternoon and Denmark's world eleven Kenneth
Jonassen lost the decisive rubber 1-2 to Malaysia's 29th-ranked
Roslin Hashim.
</P>
<P>
Jonassen became the man of the day Wednesday when he brought
Denmark to a 3-2 victory over China, with his come-from-behind win
over world number five Dong Jiong in Group A final match.
</P>
<P>
The same scene repeated at Hong Kong's Elizabeth Stadium court
again Friday afternoon when the 23-year-old European championships
runner-up from Denmark was left facing a match he had to win to
keep his team's hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
Losing the opening game 15-18, Malaysia's Hashim won the second
with his persistent play and he kept pressing on his Danish
opponent in the third. An increasingly impatient Jonassen lost the
ground step by step and conceded the game 8-15 and the match. A
disappointed Jonassen smashed his racket onto the floor at the end
of the match, which lasted five hours.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a fifth triumph in 1992, the Malaysians
finished runners-up in 1994 but failed to reach the last four in
the 1996 tournament in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Seeking their first victory after coming out tied third in the
past three tournaments in a row, China faced a win-or-die prospect
when taking on the Indonesians in the other semi-final Friday
evening.
</P>
<P>
China's world number two Sun Jun floored Indonesian ace and
world number seven Heryanto Arbi 2-1 in the opening singles. But
the team score was soon leveled by the Indonesians when their
world number two duet Ricky Subagja and Rexy Sigit beat the
11th-ranked Chinese Liu Yong and Zhang Wei two games to none.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 12th-ranked Hendrawan downed world number three Luo
Yigang of China 2-1 in the second singles, for his second win over
Luo in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
The merciless Indonesians continued to take the following
doubles 2-0 to stand an unscalable 3-1 lead on team score, which
ensured a victory for the Indonesians in spite of a singles match
left.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia's 24th-ranked Indra Wijaya lost to China's
world number five Dong Jiong 0-2.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Indonesia will play runners-up China in the
Uber Cup final Saturday evening while the Thomas Cup final is set
for Sunday evening with defending champions Indonesia taking on
Malaysia.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Marion Barry, mayor of the
nation's capital, has announced that he will not seek a fifth
term.
</P>
<P>
Barry's announced Thursday that he would not seek re-election
when his current term expires next January 2.
</P>
<P>
Barry, 62, has been the city's mayor for 14 of the last 18
years. In 1990 he left office in disgrace after being videotaped
smoking crack cocaine in a downtown hotel. After serving a
six-month prison sentence, he staged a political comeback, first
winning a city council seat and then reclaiming the mayor's office
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Congress took control of most of city government from
the mayor and council as a condition for federal assistance to
solve massive financial problems facing the city. Since then, the
municipal government has been under the control of a
presidentially appointed five-member financial control board.
</P>
<P>
Barry did not say what he would do after leaving government.
But business leaders and longtime supporters have been reportedly
trying to line up financial commitments to help him make a smooth
transition from politics to private life.
</P>
<P>
Already four members of the city council are seeking to succeed
Barry.
</P>
<P>
A Republican member of the council, Carol Schwartz, who lost
the 1994 mayoral election to Barry, has said that she will again
seek her party's nomination.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia and Japan agreed to
establish a 21st-century-oriented "comprehensive partnership"
during Mongolian President Nachagyn Bagabandy's recent trip to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The partnership is considered one of Bagabandy's major
achievements during the May 11-15 visit to Japan, Director of the
Presidential Office Bayar told a press conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The "comprehensive partnership" covers such areas as bilateral
ties, a mutually beneficial trading partnership, cooperation in
science and technology, education, culture and humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest donor to Mongolia, with loans mainly
provided for Mongolia's infrastructure and mining sectors.
</P>
<P>
From 1977 to the end of last year, Japan donated 38.7 billion
yen (293 million U.S. dollars) to Mongolia and gave it technical
assistance worth 11.6 billion yen (88 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Key exports to Japan include copper concentrate and
cashmere. And imports from Japan account for 8 percent of the
total.
</P>

In 1994, Bagabandy visited Japan while he was a parliament
speaker.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rebuts Blame for Stalling Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said Friday that Israel has been unjustly accused of
stalling the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to foreign diplomats in Jerusalem, Netanyahu noted
that the peace process had collapsed two years ago in a wave of
terrorist attacks and the failure of the Palestinian self-rule
government to fulfill its commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"We had a collapse of peace, maybe not in the way this was
perceived in every capital around the world, but the way it was in
practice here," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that "we had the collapse of the basic deal of
Oslo," adding that the principle of Oslo Accords was put
forwarded by the former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who said
"we give the Palestinians the territory, they fight the
terrorists from their territory."
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said, "We give them territory, they did not
fight terrorists."
</P>
<P>
And as a result, he said, there has been an explosion of
terrorism, which was unprecedented in Israel. And in a period of
two and an half years, 250 Israelis were killed in terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Palestinian National Authority (PNA) fought
terrorism only in a "partial" and "incomplete" way.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu took power in June, 1996. And since his right-wing
government started the building of a Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem last March, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have
been deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have accused Netanyahu of intentionally stalling
the peace process. But Netanyahu insisted that the agreement with
the Palestinians should not endanger the security interests of
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Call for Balanced Interests Within WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy debates became a prominent
feature of the second ministerial conference of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Geneva on May 18-20, as the developing world
called for balanced interests within the organization, while the
developed nations tried to gain more through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
High on the list of their debates were issues such as the
implementation of the existing trade agreements, the built-in
agenda and future activities, as well as the date and venue of the
next ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
Members from the developing world have argued that the WTO
should put more emphasis on the needs of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 and early 1998, after reviewing trade policies of some
European Union nations and Japan, the WTO secretariat said their
tariffs were not at a satisfactorily low level and there were even
"tariff peaks" in sectors like agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, on the very first day of the conference, WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero called on all members to fully
meet their commitments.
</P>
<P>
"Full implementation is essential to the credibility of our
system and its potential to carry the weight of future
responsibilities," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"And we need to recognize that a great part of the answer to
this problem has to be found in improving the functioning of the
existing bodies of the WTO, notably the General Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the built-in agenda and future activities, there have
been apparent differences among the members.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the conference, Secretary-General of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Rubens
Ricupero, South African President Nelson Mandela, Cuban President
Fidel Castro and trade officials from Asia, Africa and Latin
America all urged the WTO to take into account the concerns of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the priority should be to enrich the poor
rather than to make the rich richer when new negotiations would be
launched.
</P>
<P>
"The building of developing countries' capacity to defend their
interests effectively in trade negotiations, and to establish the
universality of the WTO, is an essential task," said Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
Ricupero said that "priority should be given to trade barriers
targeting the exports of developing countries in both goods and
services" although the trade liberalization process must maintain
its momentum.
</P>
<P>
For their part, officials from the advanced industrialized
countries wanted to see the negotiations expanded to other
areas. Some members led by the United States wish to have an
agreement on electronic commerce as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer afford to take seven years to finish a trade
round as happened during the Uruguay Round," U.S. President Bill
Clinton told the conference during his one-hour stopover in Geneva
on May 18.
</P>
<P>
"We should explore whether there is a way to tear down barriers
without waiting for every issue in every sector to be resolved,"
he said. "I am confident we can go about the task of negotiating
trade agreements in a way that is faster and better than today."
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, the WTO members discussed the date of the
next ministerial conference.
</P>
<P>
As the ministerial conference is biennial, the third was
originally scheduled to be held in 2000.
</P>
<P>
However, under the WTO agenda, members are to negotiate
agriculture and services by the end of 1999 and early 2000
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Many members from the developing countries believe they are
encountering difficulties at home in implementing the existing
agreements so that it is unnecessary to have new negotiations
other than those already on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill those tasks will take a lot of time and resources,
said the members from the developing world. So they do not want to
have the third conference to be held one year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, to start new negotiations early would make it more
difficult for those applying to join the WTO. If they cannot have
their WTO memberships in time, they will have no say in the
negotiations and have to meet new terms set by their opponents.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, the U.S. agreed in its proposal that the
economic, financial and development needs of the developing
countries should be taken into account in future activities.
</P>
<P>
At its closing session, the WTO decided to hold its third
ministerial conference in the United States in the fourth quarter
of 1999. But the exact date and venue of the next conference will
await the decision by the WTO General Council.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the organization adopted a U.S. proposal on global
electronic commerce, suggesting that no customs duties be imposed
on electronic transmissions.
</P>
<P>
As head of the Chinese delegation at the conference, Long
Yongtu pointed out that when the multilateral trading system turns
50, the WTO must face two realities: the political reality that of
its 132 members, more than 100 are from the developing world, and
the economic reality that world trade is more and more integrated.
</P>
<P>
In such circumstances, he said, the WTO is facing a severe
challenge: how to ensure that all its members, big or small, rich
or poor, share the benefits of the economic globalization on a
justified basis in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Appeals to Coal Miners to Cooperate With Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday called upon coal miners to cooperate with the government in
solving the current crisis in the coal industry.
</P>
<P>
In a routine speech over the radio, Yeltsin said the government
is taking all measures possible to solve the coal industry
crisis. He believes the government and the coal miners can finally
solve all the problems.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that in dealing with problems in the coal
industry, the government can not borrow money from other accounts
in the budget and can not increase the circulation of the currency.
</P>
<P>
He told people that the government has taken a lead in reducing
half of its agencies and that the government, parliament and
presidential office will cut their administrative spending by 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the difficulties of the coal industry are
tremendous and can not be solved with one stroke, Yeltsin
expressed the hope that the coal miners will not take any action
that will exacerbate the situation.
</P>
<P>
Coal miners in the Pechora, Kuzbas, Kmerovo and Rostov coal
basins have staged strikes from May 13 since they have not been
paid for a long time.

<P>
BUDAPEST, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's Foreign Debt is
continuing on a downward trend with the net external debt
currently standing at 8.5 billion U.S. dollars from 18.2 billion
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Gross foreign debt dropped to 20 billion dollars now compared
with 27.8 billion in 1994.
</P>
<P>
State direct debts declined to 3.5 billion dollars as opposed
to 15.1 billion in 1994, a major change in debt structure.
</P>
<P>
Hungary was once plagued with a net per capita foreign debt
ranking the highest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The about face is due in some part to earnings from
privatization and increased exports thanks to upgrading and

PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- France said on Friday that the
rejection by Israel of a Franco-Egyptian proposal on holding an
international conference on Middle East peace process does not
seem to be the final stand of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"One should not conclude too quickly," said French Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux, who described the declaration
by Israel in rejecting the proposal as "interesting."
</P>
<P>
He did not exclude the possibility of a revision of the
proposal, presented Monday by President Jacques Chirac and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who called on all parties
resolved for peace in the Middle East to take part in such a
conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel Friday rejected the proposal, saying that it would not
participate in a conference to which the main parties involved in
the Middle East peace process are not even invited.
</P>
<P>
But Israel said it wishes to hold "direct negotiations" with
the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC to Lead 1999 Election, Says Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's African National
Congress (ANC) would remain the dominant party in the 1999 general
elections and the National Party (NP)'s position as the number one
opposition party could be seriously challenged, a local poll said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
While the ANC's support had dropped from 58 percent in November
last year to 54 percent in May, it was likely to maintain the leading
position for some time, said the Markinor's poll.
</P>
<P>
The NP's support fell from 12 percent to 10 percent over the same
period, which benefited the United Democratic Movement (UDM) and the
Democratic Party (DP), South African Press Association quoted the poll
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UDM's support had increased from four to five percent, and the
DP's backing gained from three percent to five percent.
</P>
<P>
Support for the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), the largest
black-based opposition party, remained at five percent.
</P>
<P>
The poll said the DP's further growth potential was questionable as
the party's profile was predominantly white, middle class South
Africans.
</P>
<P>
The UDM, which has a black and a white as co-leaders, seemed to be
potentially the only real competition for the ANC, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Other analysts echoed the sentiments of the poll, saying the NP was
under siege as the gap between it and the DP and the UDM was
closing.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE)-100 Index dropped significantly Friday as the bourse
continued its negative outlook despite the release of encouraging
economic indicators by the State Bank of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly report released by the State Bank shows a sharp
decline in inflation and predicts that the economy will achieve a
growth rate of five to 5.5 percent in the current fiscal year
(June 30-July 1) compared to 3.1 percent in the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Traders, however, said the State Bank report did little to lift
sentiments and trading remained dull throughout the day with heavy
selling in most stocks.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index lost 45.04 points Friday to close at 1,205.82
points against Thursday's close of 1,250.86. A total of 77.43
million shares were traded Friday against 80 million traded the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
Traders predict that the stock market will remain volatile in
the coming week as speculation continues on Pakistan's nuclear
plans.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- With the Sino-American Shanghai
Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd (SASS) receiving the ISO 14001
certificate, the number of companies with "green passports" in
China has reached 35.
</P>
<P>
The SASS is the first pharmaceutical firm in China to
pass the environmental management examination.
</P>
<P>
The ISO 14001 certificate, regarded as the "green passport" to
the international market in the next century, is issued to
enterprises that strictly control pollution and use resources
efficiently in production.
</P>
<P>
China established a national committee to promote
international environmental management standards ISO 14001 after
introducing them from the International Standards Organization
(ISO) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Chinese enterprises receiving the ISO 14001
certificates are in the electronic, chemical, metallurgical and
engineering industries.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists here say that the promotion of the standards
will help the country's economic activities comply with the
requirements of environmental protection, and is of great
significance for pollution control and energy saving.
</P>
<P>
China's first auditors of environmental management standards
have passed the required examinations and are now working at their

PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A hospital in Paris has conducted
open heart surgeries on six patients suffering from cardiac
diseases with a robot in the past two weeks, reported the daily Le
Figaro on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A team of doctors led by Professor Carpentier and Professor
Deloche at the Broussals Hospital here conducted their first open
heart surgery on May 7 with a robot.
</P>
<P>
Equiped with surgical instruments in its arms which were guided
by messages from the doctors, the robot completed four operations
of alteration of cardiac valves, one related on hearing, and one
heart bypass.
</P>
<P>
Doctors of Broussals Hospital began to use computers to conduct
surgery two years ago, because it could help increase skills and
precision and reduce the surface of thorax incisions on patients.
</P>
<P>
Operating with robot can solve all the problems of precision
and traumatizing in classical operations, reduce the surface of
incisions, and overcome the difficulties in operating on smaller
incisions, said the doctors.
</P>
<P>
"It is a hand within the human body, but which has a greater
skill than human hand," said Professor Carpentier.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's security forces are
on the alert for any possible insurrection on the eve of the
country's general elections after a massive arms theft from a
South African military base last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The move followed indications that South African police are
looking at Lesotho as the final destination for the large
consignment, Sowetan paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not ruling out the possibility that the arms might be
headed this way for the purpose of destabilizing the general
election planned for Saturday," a Lesotho security forces
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are on the alert and ready for any eventuality," Major
Bolutu Makoaba said.
</P>
<P>
A confirmed 117 items were stolen from the Tempe base near the
central South African city of Bloemfontein, the biggest arms
theft in the past five years. They included rocket launchers,
mortars, automatic rifles and two army vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Six black men, including a member of the South African
National Defense Force (SANDF) at the Tempe base, have been
arrested. The two vehicles have been recovered, but the arms
were still missing.
</P>
<P>
One of the two missing vehicles, a Mamba armored vehicle used
to transport the arms, was found between Bloemfontein and the
Lesotho border, the paper quoted army sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, South African police Thursday dismissed as
speculation stories that the arms could be headed for Lesotho or
be used for shady forces inside South Africa. They said
investigations were continuing.

HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) announced Friday that the official foreign currency assets
of Hong Kong were 96.2 billion U.S. dollars at the end of April
1998, 600 million U.S. dollars less than that at the end of last
month.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong
remains the third largest in the world, after Japan and China's
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency assets are held in the Exchange Fund and
the Land Fund. As at the end of April, the foreign currency assets
held in the Exchange Fund were 77.7 billion U.S. dollars compared
with 78.5 billion U.S. dollars at the end of March and the Land
Fund were 18.5 billion U.S. dollars compared with 18.3 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The fall in foreign currency assets held in the Exchange Fund
can be attributed to withdrawals of fiscal reserves to meet
government operational needs, said a spokesman for the HKMA.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expresses Concern over Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Seyed Mohammad
Khatami has expressed concern over India's nuclear tests and
voiced support for Pakistan's efforts to deal with the emerging
security scenario.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn all moves against nuclear non-proliferation and
development of weapons of mass destruction," Khatami said in a
telephone conversation with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, according
to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif briefed Khatami about Islamabad's concern over the
Indian nuclear tests and said: "They pose a grave threat to
Pakistan's security."
</P>
<P>
"We never wanted to explode nuclear devices and exacerbate
tension in the region by entering into an arms race," Sharif was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, Khatami pledged his support for Pakistan's efforts
and said Tehran is ready to work with Islamabad to maintain
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the Iranian government had already conveyed its
concern to New Delhi over its nuclear tests. "We are greatly
disturbed over the aggravation of the regional security
situation."
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazi also talked with his
Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan by telephone and reiterated
Iran's concern over the nuclear tests. "Such steps will accelerate
arms race and increase tension in the region," Kharazi said.
</P>
<P>
Underlining Teheran's efforts to keep the Indian Ocean and the
Pacific region free of nuclear weapons, Kharazi said: "In our
opinion nuclear proliferation is against peace and security of the
world."
</P>
<P>
Iran Wednesday summoned New Delhi's ambassador to Tehran to
officially convey its concern over the Indian nuclear tests.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items
in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- B.J. Habibie outlined a program of reforms, clean government
and economic responsibility that addressed criticisms leveled
against his predecessor, President Suharto, who resigned under
pressure. Habibie pledged to dedicate himself to democratization,
but many of the protesters remain unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
-- In a policy shift, the Clinton Administration has pledged to
sign the international treaty that bans anti-personnel land
mines. But the administration's pledge, made in a letter from the
national security adviser, Samuel Berger, has a caveat: the United
States will agree to sign the treaty only if alternatives to the
most powerful land mines can be found.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Marion Barry announced Thursday that he would not seek a
fifth term as mayor of Washington, D.C., relinguishing his hold on
an office he defined and used to dominate politics in the district
for most of the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Senate on Thursday overwhelmingly decided to strip all
special legal protections for cigarette makers from the national
tobacco bill, handing public health advocates both a key victory
and a new worry over the bill's future.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. House Speaker Gingrich said Congress would seek to cut
more taxes than the GOP's chief target, the so-called marriage
penalty that taxes spouses filing jointly at a higher rate than if
they filed as singles. The House five-year budget proposal calls
for about 100 billion dollars in cuts: the Senate's measure lists
about 30 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Pager service was restored to tens of millions of customers
after the failure of a PanAmSat satellite Tuesday disrupted
communications in the United States. The firm's contracts hold it
responsible for compensating customers only for the time service
was lost, not the consequences of missed appointments and spoiled
deals.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Rice Imports Hit Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has bought a record
1.35 million tons of rice to make up for the shortfall in domestic
harvests due to the El Nino weather phenomenon, local television
Citynet reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The television quoted officials of the Department of
Agriculture as saying the Philippines has contracted a record 1.35
million tons of rice from neighboring countries for delivery this
year.
</P>
<P>
Citing an earlier government report, Citynet said the country's
unmilled rice harvest in the first quarter of the year dropped to
2.22 million tons from the year-ago volume of 2.56 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department said earlier it did not expect the
rice harvest to improve in the second quarter because of
below-normal rainfall in the country's rice-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine meteorologists said there was a
possibility of a La Nina weather pattern which would bring
torrential rains to the country in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter rice harvest accounts for 40 to 45 percent
of the country's total rice production.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Decriminalizes Homosexuality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus decriminalized homosexuality
Thursday, a move demonstrating that Cyprus lawmakers have at last
given way to pressure from the Council of Europe (CoE).
</P>
<P>
A government-proposed bill decriminalizing homosexuality was
passed by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The CoE had given Cyprus until May 29 to comply with a decision
of the European Court of Human Rights, or face serious
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
The court, in response to a Cypriot gay's appeal, ruled in 1993
that criminalizing homosexuality was a violation of human rights
and one's private life.
</P>
<P>
Homosexuality was banned in Cyprus until Alecos Modinos, a
Cypriot gay activist took his case and won a ruling from the Court.
</P>
<P>
The ruling, however, has met strong opposition from the Cyprus
Church, which believes that homosexuality is against the Greek
Orthodox religion.
</P>
<P>
In order to reassure the Church, amendments were made to the
bill making certain aspects of homosexuality a crime.
</P>
<P>
A homosexual act between two men in public or involving a
person under 18 is an offense with a maximum penalty of five years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
Anyone found guilty of a homosexual act accompanied by violence
may be given a maximum 14-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
Indecent behavior intended to provoke a homosexual act between
two men is also a crime with a maximum penalty of one year in
prison.

DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Institute of Nuclear

(HYV) of crops, The Daily Star daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
These eight HYVs of crops, developed by BINA by using mutation
breeding techniques, include paddy, jute, mustard seed and tomato,
which not only can give higher yield but also make the life circle
of crops shorter, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
BINA has also developed a new kind of low-cost,
easily-applicable bio-fertilizer named Rhizobium, which can keep
the environment favorable and can be used as an alternative to
urea in the cultivation of leguminous crops.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, scientists at BINA have developed 19 HYVs of crops,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt Safer Vaccine Against Hepatitis B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medics will be armed with a
safer vaccine against Hepatitis B next year.
</P>
<P>
The new vaccine, made by a genetic engineering process, will
replace the old type of vaccine, which was produced from blood
supplied by Hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers.
</P>
<P>
"The old vaccine will be abolished next year, because it has
many shortcomings compared with the new one," said Wei Liang, an
official with the pharmaceuticals administration department of the
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
Blood supplied by HBV carriers carries risks of contamination,
Wei explained.
</P>
<P>
In fact, vaccine made from the blood of carriers was the
world's only choice in the fight against Hepatitis B before the
genetic vaccine appeared in the late 1980s. China introduced the
former one in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The new vaccine, which has been proved to be much safer and
more effective than the old one, has been phased into the domestic
market since it was developed by the Beijing Research Institute of
Biological Products in 1993.
</P>
<P>
China has over 120 million HBV carriers, accounting for about
10 percent of the country's population.
</P>
<P>
"If we take prompt measures to vaccinate as many newborn babies
as possible, the incidence of Hepatitis B will be controlled
within one percent in the coming 50 years," said Prof. Su Chong'ao
of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
He called for a stepped-up vaccination campaign in China's
rural areas, where only 30 to 40 percent of infants are vaccinated
at present, compared with some 90 percent in cities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has decided to raise the rural
vaccination rate to 60 percent by the year 2000. Some poor areas
will be given vaccines free, it is learned.

<HEADLINE> Taxation Growth Continues to Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate for China's
industrial and commercial tax revenue continued to slow in April,
according to the State Administration of Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
China collected more than 69.4 billion yuan in industrial and
commercial taxes in the month, up seven percent over the 1997 same
period. The real growth rate stood at 0.2 percent deducting
inertia increases of financial and insurance business tax and
stamps levies on security tradings.
</P>
<P>
The SAT attributed the slowdown to the low economic growth rate
which decreases the sources for taxation levies and the sliding
down of commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
The tax arrears also occurred during the property transforming
in the process of bankruptcy and merger.
</P>
<P>
SAT figures indicate that domestic value-added and consumption
tax revenue, two major tax items under China's tax system
introduced in 1994, stood at 30.7 billion yuan in April,
down 2.1 percent on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Business tax, income taxes collected from foreign-funded
enterprises, personal income taxes, stamp taxes, and taxes levied
on regulating the direction of investment kept rapid development.
</P>
<P>
During the January-April period, the country collected a total
of 241.8 billion yuan of taxes, up 9.1 percent.

China's Guangdong province is striving to have a 13-percent
increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The city's economy has a sound beginning this year,
with the GDP in the first three months increasing by 12 percent
over the same period of 1997, ranking first among the country's
top ten cities.
</P>
<P>
It will take measures to expand overseas markets and perfect
the export products structure, in a bid to increase its export
volume, which accounts for 40 percent of its GDP, according
to an official of the Guangzhou city government.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the city's export volume rose
by 13 percent in the first quarter of this year, and 70 percent of
its products were sold to Europe, Africa and South America.
</P>
<P>
To heavily invest in infrastructure construction and to
stimulate the citizens' consumption are the city's measures
to ensure the 13 percent increase, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said Guangzhou will soon launch six national-level large
urban construction projects, meanwhile, the city plans to make
efforts to foster its real estate market and encourage the
residents to buy commodity houses through reducing price and tax.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Improves Slightly in Major Chinese Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The air quality of some major
Chinese cities improved slightly this week, with Yinchuan
appearing to be the only city with medium pollution, according to
a release by the China Environmental Monitoring Center (CEMC)
today.
</P>
<P>
The air quality report on 33 major cities for May 8-12 shows
that no major city in China suffers from heavy air pollution, but
the atmospheric pollution index (API) of Yinchuan has gone above
200, or the medium level of air pollution, due to dust and sand
produced by construction activities and wind from the nearby
deserts.
</P>
<P>
The number of cities with only slight pollution reached 12 this
week, an increase of 300 percent over the previous week, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
The report gives, as well as the API, the index of sulfur
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and total suspended particles
(TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State Environmental
Protection Administration: An API from 0 to 50 is level I, meaning
excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or good quality; 101
to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to 300 is level IV,
or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or heavy
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The report says that among the cities with API above 100,
Guangdong, Beijing and Shanghai suffered mostly from NOX, while
Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Chengdu, Jinan, Changchun, Tianjin, Harbin and
Kunming suffered mainly from TSP, and Chongqing from SO2.
</P>
<P>
The air quality for the five coastal cities of Fuzhou, Ningbo,
Beihai, Xiamen and Zhuhai was excellent in the past week,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 16 cities of Shijiazhuang, Lianyungang, Shenyang, Hangzhou,
Nanjing, Guiyang, Wuhan, Qingdao, Changsha, Dalian, Hefei,
Nanchang, Shenzhen, Nanning, Suzhou and Shantou had good air
quality, according to the report.

<P>
KHARTOUM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has rejected the U.S. State
Department statement classifying it as one of the states which are
not cooperative enough in fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Khartoum daily "Al Rai Al Am" Friday quoted the deputy speaker
of the Sudanese National Assembly (parliament) Abdul Aziz Sheddu
as saying that the statement "lacks objectivity and reason."
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the Sudan is committed to combating terrorism
and signed the anti-terrorism agreement at the recent Cairo
conference of Arab interior ministers.
</P>
<P>
Sheddu said his country has amended law to bar Arab citizens
from entering the country without visa in an attempt to guard
against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
He called upon the U.S. to define the cases where the Sudan has
failed to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State issued a statement last Tuesday to
identify the states which Washington considered as being negative
and uncooperative with the U.S. in the combat against
terrorism. Eight countries were enlisted, namely, Afghanistan,
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, Sudan and Syria.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh Council meeting of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC) closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Qi Huaiyuan was re-elected president of the CPAFFC.
</P>
<P>
During the 3-day meeting, participants discussed ways to
advance cooperation between the CPAFFC and foreign friendly
organizations and to develop good-neighborly relations between
China and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the CPAFFC will serve as a bridge in promoting
economic and cultural cooperation between Chinese departments and
their foreign counterparts in addition to engaging in
people-to-people diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC, founded in 1954, has made a major contribution to
the enhancement of understanding and friendship between the
peoples of China and the rest of the world, and to the promotion
of normalization of state-to-state relations between China and
foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Railway Authorities to Coop in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania Railways
Corporation (TRC) and the Tanzania-Zambia Railways Authority
(TAZARA) will join hands in transporting cargo to and from other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
A container terminal is under construction at Kidatu in the
central region of Morogoro, a point close to both TRC's central
railway and the TAZARA line, Business Times Friday quoted Linford
Mboma, the director general of the company, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mboma said the proposed container terminal at Kidatu will be
operational in October if the rehabilitation of a 32 km section
of the railway from Kilosa-Kidete is to be completed. The
section was damaged by floods due to the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The container terminal will help the transshipment of cargos
to and from South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and
other countries in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
As the two railways have different gauges, a South African
private company is going to monitor the operation of loading and
unloading at the container terminal, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mboma said his company plans to hire 10 locomotives from India
in preparation for handling more cargos.
</P>
<P>
However, the transshipment service is not a joint venture
activity but a service agreed by both sides, Mboma said.
</P>
<P>
The central railway, built when Tanganyika mainland was a
colony in the early years of the century, runs from Dar es Salaam
on the Indian Ocean to Lakes Victoria and Tanganyika. The
Tanzania-Zambia railway was built with the aid of the Chinese
government in the 1970s.

PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- 95 percent of the French people
consider it an obligation of citizens to learn first-aid
techniques in case some one needs emergency help, said a poll
published on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the CSA for the French Red Cross and
published by the daily Parisien, said that among 1,004 people
polled, 95 percent of them said schools should open lessons on
first-aid and 86 percent think that learning first-aid should be
compulsory for all.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six percent of the people said that one should learn at
home a citizen's way of life in a community, while 53 percent said
that schools should also be the field to learn such things.
</P>
<P>
But most of the people said that the government, French
citizens, chiefs of enterprises, schools and trade unions have not
done enough to promote solidarity among citizens.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian groups and charitable societies have just done
what they should, said half of the people polled.

<HEADLINE> Indian Experts Criticize Govt Moratorium on N-Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Some Indian experts and
intellectuals have criticized the government's announcement of
moratorium on nuclear tests Thursday for its attempt to camouflage
the wider consequences of nuclearization, Press Trust of India
(PTI) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nuclearists have not been able to define what is a modest,
safe and minimum deterrent so far, noted expert on nuclear weapons
Achin Vanaik said.
</P>
<P>
A hydrogen bomb is not at all needed for a deterrent and "we
even don't need to go for nuclear testing," former army chief
General K. Sundarji said.
</P>
<P>
If the government is ultimately thinking of weaponization and
computer simulations, what kind of the moratorium it is talking
about? asked noted expert on South Asian affairs G. P. Deshpande.
</P>
<P>
Charging the government for encouraging a false debate among
the people, Deshpande said that the government should clarify the
costs involved in the nuclear tests and the development of
delivery systems.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar traded
solidly Friday before sliding late in the day in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The currency finished at 63.12 U.S. cents from 62.95 U.S. cents
at Thursday's close, while against the Japanese yen it was 85.76
yen from 85.23 yen.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the day the Australian dollar was also fetching
1.1110 German marks from 1.1125 marks.
</P>
<P>
Peter Whitley, manager of foreign exchange with Colonial State
Bank, said the Australian dollar made a good recovery during the
week, having returned from a low of 61.70 U.S. cents, ahead of
Tuesday morning's intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA), and rose to 63 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar started the week nervously, being
continually sold down over the preceding days as tensions in
Indonesia escalated, and the RBA moved in the early hours of
Tuesday morning to prop it up, driving the currency back one U.S.
cent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar also got a lift Thursday night from a
rebound in the gold price which recaptured the 300 U.S. dollar an
ounce level and was trading at 300.20 U.S. dollars an ounce on the
spot market Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Uses Nuclear Tests to Divert People's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- an Indian public figure charged
the Indian BJP government for using the nuclear tests to divert
people's attention from the inability of the government to address
serious national problems.
</P>
<P>
In an article in the forthcoming issue of "People's Democracy",
 organ of the Communist Party of India (Marxism) (CPI-M), General
Secretary H. Singh Surjeet said, "Faced with problems of running a
shaky coalition and unable to address serious problems being faced
by the country, the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is seeking to
divert attention of the people. The bomb has come as a handy
weapon to them."
</P>
<P>
"While the nation can take pride in indigenous development of
the nuclear technology, it is appalling that the country is being
asked to be in the forefront to take responsibility for the arms
race. It is only those wedded to communal and fascist philosophy
and ideology who can pursue this path," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Increased spending on armaments would lead to huge diversion
of funds from developmental activities," he further said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the BJP but the country that will have to pay the
price for this reckless policy being pursued by the government. It
will deteriorate relations with our neighbors, lead to an arms
race in the subcontinent and consequent tensions, and
simultaneously mount increased burdens on the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever be the cover, behind these tests lie the hidden
agenda of BJP - to advance the cause of Hinduism. The party is
adopting the very same methods that it adopted during the temple
agitation (in 1992)," Surjeet stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket closed
weaker Friday, with trading interest subdued by regional
instability and the prospect of new companies being floated.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries ended 7.6 points, or 0.28 percent, lower at
2725.9. It traded in a 16 point range.
</P>
<P>
The appointment Thursday of B.J. Habibie as new president of
Indonesia following Soeharto's dramatic resignation had only
served to leave investors waiting for the next development,
according to Macquarie Bank broker Lucinda Chan.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's upheaval, along with the prospect of 10 billion
U.S. dollars in share floats in the coming months, was weighing on
the Australian sharemarket.
</P>
<P>
"It's like watching paint dry," said Chan.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody is prepared to move their funds because people in the
speculative stocks can't get out because they are too weak."
</P>
<P>
The low key trading was reflected in national turnover, which
was valued at 495.5 million U.S. dollars, with the daily average
value of just under 631.2 million U.S. dollars, and volume was
265.6 million shares.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A relocation exercise will start
this month to move the police force stationed at Kai Tak airport
to Chek Lap Kok new airport, which is scheduled to open on July 6.
</P>
<P>
Senior superintendent Wong Ka-sing, commander of the Airport
Police District, told a press conference here Friday: "The move
will be proceeded in phases with the final phase to be completed
upon the commencement of the new airport."
</P>
<P>
Personnel at Kai Tak will be transferred step by step to the
new airport, with 60 officers by the middle of June and 80 by the
day of the new airport in operation.
</P>
<P>
The Chek Lap Kok police station will be in full strength with
417 staff in total on July 6, when the new airport is put to use.
Having started operation in September 1997, the police station now
has 80 officers.
</P>
<P>
Wong said: "Starting from the middle of June, both the Kai Tak
and Chek Lap Kok Airport police stations will be running parallel
for three weeks."
</P>
<P>
"When the new police station becomes fully operational, the Kai
Tak Airport Police Station will cease operation and its area will
be covered by another police division," he added.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc team was set up in January last year to ensure that
the Chek Lap Kok Police Station is to become operational on
schedule. "We will make the relocation a success," Wong said.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Puts Children at Risk of Inferior Education: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Internet and television may
provide instant access to information but such multimedia put
children at risk of losing their language and social skills, a
conference was told in Australia's port city of Adelaide Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sydney Writers Festival Director John Nieuwenhuizen said the
Internet and other forms of multimedia used in the classroom
relied more on imagery than on language.
</P>
<P>
In Australia, the Internet and other forms of multimedia are
available to residents, including children, at district libraries
and schools free of charge.
</P>
<P>
"In schools there are punishments or rewards for paying
attention, but there are no such punishments or rewards from
television," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both television and the Internet encourage children to sit
still and passively accept what is put in front of them.
</P>
<P>
"Both give the sensation just by watching a screen that you can
require information without work and without discipline."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Children's Book Council of Australia
conference, Nieuwenhuizen said this visual form of learning puts
children at risk of losing their language and social skills.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are likely, if we follow this path, to end up with
kids whose language skills diminish after years spent on this sort
of visual and image based activities that the multimedia pushes
you towards," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'll end up with kids who have no idea of how to go about
research without constant rewards, the constant rewards you get
from computers."
</P>
<P>
"They are learning that the world is a passive and
pre-programmed place, and that the click of a mouse is all the
effort required to get information," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nieuwenhuizen said the result was something everyone should be
worried about because reading and remembering things would
eventually become too difficult.
</P>
<P>
"Education is about teaching children how to use their brains
and not about telling them how to use a computer," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK, Canada Agrees on Information Technology Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and Canada signed on
Friday a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the two sides to
foster and promote cooperation on information and communications
technology.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting
K C Kwong and Canadian Minister of Industry John Manley signed the
MOU, which is the first bilateral arrangement of its kind Hong
Kong has made with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the ceremony, Kwong said, the MOU "is a positive
step in the further development of the close and long-standing
relations between Hong Kong and Canada."
</P>
<P>
It focuses on areas such as multimedia and software
applications and products, electronic commerce infrastructure and
policy, broadband networks and applications, and Internet
applications.
</P>
<P>
It will cover a period of five years and can be extended by
mutual agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Canada is advanced in IT development and applications. The
signing of the MOU will enable Hong Kong to benefit from the
experience and expertise of Canada. This will in turn help us
maintain our lead in IT and foster the growth of the local IT
industry," the Hong Kong official noted.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from both sides had met to explore
opportunities for joint ventures and cooperation. They are also
planning to organize joint activities under MOU, according to
Kwong, who was appointed to the current post earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Macao Stops Selling of Misprinted Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department (CTT) decided on Friday to stop
selling a set of misprinted stamps, causing speculations that the
stamps already sold will add value.
</P>
<P>
CTT announced early Friday morning that the set of stamps in
commemoration of Vasco da Gama's historical voyage to India, which
was issued on Wednesday, was found to have been misprinted.
</P>
<P>
While Gama arrived in India in 1498, the year printed on the
stamps is 1598.
</P>
<P>
It is not known how many stamps have been sold out already.
CTT's planned number of issues was set at 1.90 million pieces.
</P>
<P>
Macao stamps have been left in the cold since the beginning of
this year after a fever in late 1997. CTT has cut the number of
issues from 2.3 million early this year to the current number.
</P>
<P>
But, the misprinted stamps may turn out to be hot pieces, some
market watchers said. Some local stamp dealers reportedly raised
the price immediately on Friday.

JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Botswana's year-on-year
inflation rate rose to 7.3 percent in April from 6.9 percent in
March, ending a deflationary trend in the past two years, the
country's central statistics office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rise marked an end of a 28-month downward trend in
inflation, when the rate steadily dropped from 10.8 percent in
December 1995 to 6.9 percent in March this year, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The increase was largely attributed to price hikes in housing,
alcohol and tobacco, which accounted for 26 percent of the index
basket, the office said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Pays Heavily to Foreigners for Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has frowned at the inability
of local shippers to handle the country's oil, saying it has to
pay 2.6 million U.S. Dollars each month for foreign companies to
lift the crude to other parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is no country where this is done," said Alhaji Buba
Galadima, director-general of the country's National Maritime
Authority, quoted by the Post Express Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no American policy which will allow a foreigner to
carry out such goods for them," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigerian shippers should take up the
challenge of listing crude oil which if they succeed will enable
them to have vessels from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the leading oil producer in Africa, with an output
of 2.455 million barrels per day, most of which are for export.
</P>
<P>
Galadima noted if Nigeria ship owners wish to compete with
their counterparts in other parts of the world, they have to
comply with international rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
And his agency will leave no stone unturned while enforcing
all these rules and regulations, he added.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Li Peng said
here today that China is pleased to see the momentum of Thailand's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the belief that the Thai government and people would
overcome the temporary difficulties brought about by the financial
crisis.

</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Thailand enjoy a special friendly
relationship and the two countries could learn from each other
despite their different national conditions.
</P>
<P>
The high-level exchange of visits between the two countries
plays an important role in enhancing Sino-Thai traditional
friendship and good-neighborly ties, added Li.

long-standing and profound friendship. Thailand is very satisfied
with the smooth development of bilateral relations over the past

the two nations have no conflict of interests or problems
demanding prompt solution. The peoples of the two countries have
every reason to advance their friendship from generation to
generation, Li noted.

construction and the operation of NPC.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin on Settlement of Miner Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
on Friday that the federal authorities had no intention to print
money to pay back wages to the striking miners, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his regular radio address, Yeltsin resolutely opposed a
proposal to print a few billion rubles, saying "this would push
our economy far back."
</P>
<P>
The proposal was reportedly raised in a bid to put an end to
the explosive situation triggered by miners' strikes in protest at
unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president pointed out that miners' strikes in
various parts of the country have done great damage to the economy
and have threatened to do incalculable damage to the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The blockade of railroads has resulted in millions of rubles of
losses to transportation and factories which can not receive raw
materials, parts and fuels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The strikes began a week ago when miners bloked trains on
trans-Siberian line at Anzhero-Sudzhensk, north of the regional
capital Kemerovo.
</P>
<P>
The federal authorities "are doing their best to alleviate the
passions and pull the coal mining industry out of the crisis,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The president said Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko has sent a
bill to the State Duma under which the costs of the government,
presidential administration and Federal Assembly will be reduced
by a quarter and the saved amounts will be used to help the
miners.

<HEADLINE> EAGA Participants Urged to Harmonize Trade Practices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The governments of the Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines - East Asean Growth Area
(BIMP-EAGA) have been urged to agree on a harmonized set of trade
practices and procedures.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Sabah State Chief Minister Yong Teck Lee made the
appeal Friday at the two-day BIMP-EAGA Business Forum '98 - The
International Conference on Business Opportunities and Strategies
being held in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's capital, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"To overcome the currency problem, the governments are actively
pursuing greater use of domestic currencies in intra-Asian trade.
The Sabah state government is also pursuing the idea of expanding
barter trade within the region as a means to overcome the
problem," he was quoted as saying in his working paper entitled
"Government and Private Sector Partnership in the BIMP-EAGA."
</P>
<P>
He said the success of such a plan will be contingent on
regional governments agreeing to the idea and will open up a new
window of opportunities for the private sector in spite of the
present economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he said there is an urgency to harmonize a set of trade
practices, procedures and even institutions.
</P>
<P>
Actual projects on the ground, however, were slow in coming and
this low success rate of business formation amongst the BIMP-EAGA
member states could be the result of the economic crisis facing
the region, Yong said.
</P>
<P>
"To further the economic base and scope of BIMP-EAGA, we are
now exploring ways to link the region to other growth areas and
one example at hand is to establish air links with
Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) via Pulau
Pinang (southern Malaysia) to BIMP-EAGA through Kota Kinabalu
(capital of Sarawak State, East Malaysia)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once established, there would be immediate opportunities in the
areas of trade and tourism, he added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Qualify for Thomas Cup Badminton Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Five-time winners Malaysia
qualified for the final after a hard-won semi-final victory over
runners-up Denmark, with the outcome remaining unclear until after
the final singles match at the 20th Thomas Cup Badminton Finals
here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia held Denmark to a 2-2 tie on team scores after two
singles and two doubles matches in the semi-final. Denmark's world
eleven Kenneth Jonassen had struggled for 65 minutes before losing
to Malaysia's 29th-ranked Roslin Hashim 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Jonassen became his team's hero Wednesday when he brought
Denmark to a 3-2 victory over China with his come-from-behind win
over world number five Dong Jiong in Group A final match.
</P>
<P>
History seemed to repeat itself Friday when Jonassen had to
play the very same role after Denmark came to a 2-2 tie in the
semi-final against Malaysia, with the 23-year-old Dane, runners-up
in this year's European championships, left facing a match he had
to win to keep his team's title hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
After losing the opening game 15-18, Hashim played a persistent
game in the second, unleashing volleys and smashes which kept the
Dane on the run. The Malaysian took one game back 15-5 in the
second.
</P>
<P>
An impatient Jonassen gradually lost the ground in the decisive
third game and smashed his racket against the floor when he lost
the game 8-15.
</P>
<P>
The match lasted nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
After a fifth triumph in 1992, Malaysia finished runners-up to
Indonesia in 1994, but failed to reach the last four at the last
world team championships in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In the final of the current championships slated for Sunday
evening, Malaysia will play the winners of another semi-final
Friday evening between defending champions Indonesia and four-time
winners China.

The regulations stipulate overseas-financed enterprises are
entitled to refuse irrational levies and file their complaints to
economic and trade commissions of higher levels, or even resort to
legal means to safeguard their interests.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, overseas-financed enterprises should
strictly follow registration procedures for starting up businesses
and get preferential tax treatment accordingly upon the documents
of approval in a bid to avoid cheating in investment activities,
said the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Investors of the overseas-financed enterprises are also urged
to strictly observe the terms stated in the signed contracts and
make their due investment as stipulated, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the autonomous region had approved the
establishment of 1,057 overseas-funded enterprises, and 550 of
them had become operational, involving a use of 930 million
U.S. dollars of overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Smoking Linked to Serious Eye Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all the serious
ophthalmological diseases, some of which end in blindness, are
significantly worsened by smoking, according to a medical study by
Israeli researchers.
</P>
<P>
Compared to non-smokers, those who smoke are 2.5 times more
likely to develop macular degeneration, an incurable condition
causing full or partial blindness in middle-aged and elderly
people, the study says.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing related studies conducted around the world,
doctors of the Goldschlege Eye Research Institute at Tel Aviv
University concluded that of the 4,000 active substances in
tobacco smoke, many of them are toxic to eye tissues. Their study
was published in this week's Survey Ophthalmology.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also found that smoking is linked with Grave's
disease, which is caused by thyroid problems. Smoking constricts
the blood vessels and reduces the supply of blood to the eye,
making the condition more severe, they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, pregnant women who smoke increase the risk of
strabismus (crossed eyes) in their babies, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
In other researches, doctors have found that cataracts, in
which the lens become cloudy and which is the most common
condition causing blindness, has something to do with smoking.
</P>
<P>
As a result, "one must add to the list of smoking warnings the
direct damage smoking causes to the eyes, " said Michael Belkin,
one of the doctors who conducted the study.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the largest
aircraft maker in the world, Thursday delivered its first 777-300,
the world's longest commercial jet, to an Asian carrier.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific, based in Hong kong, took delivery of the huge
airplane, which is more than 10 feet longer than a 747-400 jumbo
jet and 33 feet longer than the 777-200 that entered service three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the 747-400 carries more passengers -- 420 in three
classes, weighs more and has a larger wingspan than the
777-300. It also flies farther than the 777-300.
</P>
<P>
With lower operating cost, the 777-300 is aimed at replacing
aging 747-200s and 747-300s on medium-length routes, such as the
ones within Asia. Boeing has 53 orders for the 777-300 so far from
eight Asian airlines.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Share prices resumed their fall
on the Singapore market after Thursday's surge, as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) shed 5.98 points to close
at 1313.67 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market eased on worries over whether
Indonesia's problem could be resolved under President B J
Habibie's new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Activity on the exchange slackened after the midday break as
shares gave up their earlier gains, they said, adding that the
market was also in consolidation after the wild gyrations seen
this week.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 204.62 million units, valued
at 325.32 million Singapore dollars (198.37 million U.S. dollars).
Declines overwhelmed advances by 240 to 80, while 272 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Telecom was the most actively traded stock as it
registered a turnover of 14.98 million units. It was followed by
Malaysia Resources which had 13.99 million shares traded. Renong
was next with 13.9 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.7 Singapore dollars to finish at 33.5

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Says Security Key to Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of Representatives
Speaker Newt Gingrich reiterated his position on the eve of his
visit to Israel that security concern should be "a critical
consideration" in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has learned from a shared experience with Israel that
"any lasting peace can only rest upon genuine security for those
who seek peace," Gingrich said in an article published on Friday's
Jerusalem Post. "We must support a peace process predicated on
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the continued possibility of a conventional
war, Israel today faces "the constant threat of terrorism and the
prospect that terrorist states develop weapons of mass
destruction", Gingrich said, accusing Iran of developing nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
In a new round of accusation against the Clinton
administration, Gingrich said that the Israeli security needs must
be defined by Israel alone and should not be determined by "those
who have never faced a threat to their survival."
</P>
<P>
The speaker has recently criticized U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for being "out of touch with reality" by
trying to pressure Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
their talks in Washington to accept the U.S. proposal for a
further Israeli redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In his article, Gingrich also blamed the Palestinian
Liberation Organization for its failure to remove from its
charter the call for Israel's destruction, which he described as
"a major stumbling block in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The speaker is expected to arrive in Israel this weekend,
together with U.S. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, to
participate in celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Even before his arrival he had already caused controversy by
saying that he would go with Gephardt to visit the proposed site
of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Senior Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat warned Thursday that Gingrich is "playing with fire"
and could trigger bloodshed by meddling in the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No issue is more sensitive in the Israeli-Palestinian peace
negotiations than the status of Jerusalem. Israel regards the city
as its capital, a claim only accepted by a number of countries,
while the Palestinians also claim it as the capital of their
future state. The U.S. Congress has ordered that the U.S. embassy
will be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I urge Mr. Gingrich to resort to sanity, wisdom, and
far-sightedness and not to pour oil on the fire," Erekat said.

NICOSIA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus Stock Market this week
appeared to succumb to profit taking pressures, but kept
registering losses at a slower pace than the one experienced a
week ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly market review prepared by the Cyprus
Investment and Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO), the CISCO
All-Share Index closed Thursday at 435.2 points, with daily

<P>
However, the market still sustains satisfactory gains so far
in the current year, which are estimated at 11.8 percent, the

</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the market retreated to this week's lowest level of
433.8 points, with banking stocks sliding to considerably lower
levels.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Efforts to Increase Farmers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China is trying every possible
means to increase farmers' income in a bid to develop rural
consumption market as part of the effort to accomplish this year's
economic development goals.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' per-capita net income was 2,080 yuan last year, a
year-on-year rise of 4.6 percent, but dropping from the 9 percent
growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the fall to difficulties of farm produce
sales and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Now, investment, farming infrastructure and industrialization,
township enterprises, and small town construction are top
priorities of the rural work of the government.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural industrialization is the top priority. Hebei
Province, one of the country's major grain producers, for example,
has developed 950 projects for agricultural industrialization,
contributing 30 percent to farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province in northeast China is another example. It plans
to increase 60 billion yuan in agricultural output over the next
five years by way of industrialization, including the formation of
farm produce processing businesses, production bases, imports of
stud bulls, and a project to process a million tons of maize a
year.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of laid-off workers in cities has slowed
down the exodus of rural surplus laborers. So, development of
small towns in rural areas has become a new source to employ
rural laborers and to increase farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 16,000 small towns, and each has
33 township enterprises on average.

BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Sun Life, the Canadian life
insurance company, has gotten approval from the Chinese government
to open a representative office in the municipality of Chongqing,
it is learnt from the company's representative office in Beijing
today.
</P>
<P>
The company is the first foreign life insurance firm approved
by the Chinese government to open an office in Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Dale Pounder, a VP of Sun Life International Business, said
that Chongqing has been found to have large growth potential after
having become China's fourth municipality in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Sun Life office there will be responsible for handling the
company's projects in southwest China and helping the Canadian
insurance industry to learn more about the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, which is on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
is the largest city in China, with an area of 82,400 square
kilometers and a population of 30 million. It is regarded as a
connection between eastern and western parts of China and an
industrial center for southwest China.
</P>
<P>
Sun Life opened its first China office in Beijing three years
ago. The company has 139.2 billion US dollars in capital and more
than 10 million private and corporate clients in Canada, the
United States, Britain and the Asia-Pacific Region.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Opens Financial Sector Wider to Outside (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The recent opening of a branch by
Citibank Corp. of the United States in this provincial capital has
further boosted the upbeat momentum of south China's Guangdong
Province in opening its financial sector to overseas businesses.
</P>
<P>
Confidence in China's long-term political and economic
stability and good prospects prompted Citibank to set up this
branch, according to Stephen Long, Citibank's North-Asia regional
head.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the branch indicated that China, especially the
coastal areas like Guangdong, will continue to open its financial
sector for overseas participation despite the Asian financial
crisis, local analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the opening of a branch by a Belgian bank are
now in full swing, and another 18 foreign banks and 13 insurance
companies have applied for opening business agencies in the province.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has one of China's most developed market economies,
and is home to a large number of oversease-funded enterprises. And in
recent years, not a few of Citibank's clients have increased
investment in the province, so a branch here is quite necessary
to provide better services, Mr. Long explained.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the province had 121 overseas-backed financial
institutions, accounting for 17 percent of the nation's total, and
those operational (except in Shenzhen) had 3.65 billion US dollars
in total assets, and 43 million US dollars in profits, accounting
for 10 and 17 percent of the national total, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
Guangdong began to allow overseas financial services in 1981
when a Hongkong-based bank opened a representative office in the
city. And in 1992, Guangzhou was chosen as one of the country's
two pilot cities to open insurance market to overseas companies.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed financial organizations play an increasingly
important role in local economic development. The Daya Bay Nuclear
Power Station, for example, was mainly financed by overseas
financial institutions, and some of them also granted loans to
China's Southern Airlines for aircraft purchases.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 85 percent of the 2.9 billion US dollars
of outstanding loans by foreign-funded banking businesses at the
end of last year went to domestic projects, while their deposit
savings that came from China only made up 11 percent of the
outstanding loans.
</P>
<P>
Increased involvement of foreign banks has made it possible for
the province to provide better financial services to 60,000
overseas-funded enterprises in terms of credit loans,
settlements, risk consulting, insurance business, and
creditability investigations.
</P>
<P>
Overseas financial institutions have also brought in advanced
management expertise, money-raising means and, more importantly,
competition, said Xiao Gang, head of a local branch of the
People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong will make greater efforts to open the financial
sector to foreign participation in a bid to promote the sector to
reach the internationally accepted standard, the official added.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian, in a meeting today with Gen. Hartmut Bagger, inspector
general of the German Federal Defense Forces, criticised India for
conducting five nuclear tests recently and preaching "so-called
China threat theory".
</P>
<P>
He called the idea, which has been expressed by some Indians,
"totally groundless" and said that China will not change its
development direction and will continue to pursue an independent
foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Japan recently made a movie that praises
Hideki Tojo, the military leader in the Second World War, and that
the Chinese people and other Asian people have strongly objected
to it.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and state councillor, said that China places great
importance on relations with Germany, and that the Chinese
People's Liberation Army (PLA) is ready to increase friendly and
cooperative ties with the German armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He told Bagger that the two countries have common interests
instead of a fundamental conflict of interests.
</P>
<P>
Bagger said that India's nuclear tests are not conducive to
regional stability and could destabilize the situation in the
region and that Germany strongly condemned India's actions.
</P>
<P>
He said that his China visit has allowed him to see the
highly-disciplined and well-trained Chinese soldiers. He said that
he views his visit as a positive step in advancing relations
between the two armed forces.

LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Most parts of Sierra Leone are now
safe for travel between towns apart from the east and north where
remnants of the ousted junta are reportedly killing and maiming
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
With the atrocities perpetrated by the rebel forces, people in
the country are worrying about traveling out of cities,
particularly at night.
</P>
<P>
However, a correspondent of the British Broadcasting

Bo, the second largest city in the south, to the capital Freetown
Wednesday night, according to a BBC report monitored here Friday.
</P>

Instead of safety, what needs to be worried about is the
quality of the road, the report said. Years of civil war and
lack of repair have left the road in a very poor condition.
</P>
<P>
It said the villages along the road are full of life, with
people walking on the street at midnight.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an ECOMOG commander as saying that most
parts of the ECOMOG soldiers at various check-points are very
polite and assistant, checking the car and the booth carefully.
But there is nobody asking for anything as bribe.

<P>
-- Indonesia's new leader B.J. Habibie was confronted by demands
for political reform yesterday, within hours of taking over from
outgoing President Suharto, who was forced to step down after 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Deborah Parry, the British nurse who faced execution in Saudi

PARIS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After 32 years of absolute power, the Indonesian chief of
state Suharto renounced power on Thursday. This departure does not

economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The nomination of Jusuf Habibie as Indonesian President by
Suharto has satisfied neither the students nor the Muslim leader
Amien Rais, who are demanding a rapid organization of elections.
The chief of the armed forces Geneal Wiranto has warned against any
more troubles in the streets.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde:
</P>
<P>
-- The announcement of the departure of Suharto, who ruled
without sharing the biggest Muslim country in the world for 35
years, was received by an explosion of joy in Jakarta and above all
the parliament, which was occupied by thousands of students from all
parts of the archipelago.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwest China
has started a pilot project to develop fruit-planting in arid and
semi-arid areas, using rainwater.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.25 million people and 980,000 head of livestock in the
Loess Plateau areas of the province have long been plagued by
serious droughts.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980s, local scientists have speeded up the research of
rainwater irrigation, and developed some practical methods to
collect the rainwater. The most commonly used way is to store
rainwater in wells and then use it whenever needed.
</P>
<P>
By last year, the province had been able to use the stored
rainwater to irrigate nearly 85,000 hectares of dry farmland.
</P>
<P>
Technicians with the province's forestry scientific research
institute also helped farmers develop cottage economy using stored
rainwater. And an increasing number of farmers are participating
in the effort.

<HEADLINE> Referendum Held in N.Ireland, Irish Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LONDON, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic began voting on Friday on whether to accept a peace
agreement designed to end 30 years of conflict in Britain's divided
province.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations across Northern Ireland opened on time at
0700 local (0600 GMT) and voting in the Irish Republic started an
hour later, making Friday's ballot the first all-Ireland election
since 1918.
</P>
<P>
The province's 1.18 million voters must answer "Yes" or "No"
to one question on the peace deal, while in the Irish Republic,
2.75 million electors will decide whether to back changes in the
Irish constitution proposed in the agreement. The agreement was
reached last month by eight major political parties in Northern
Ireland after 22-month hard negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal sets out new arrangements for the internal
administration of Northern Ireland and for new cross-border bodies
designed to improve cooperation between the north and south of
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for changes to the Irish constitution which
alter the Republic's claim to Northern Ireland, so that it talks
of uniting people rather than territory.
</P>
<P>
Latest opinion polls show a majority of voters would back the
peace deal but a significant number of Protestants in Northern
Ireland had still undecided.
</P>
<P>
Electoral officials in Northern Ireland said the early turnout
was "extraordinary high."
</P>
<P>
Final results from both votes are not expected until
Saturday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Efforts to eliminate Drug Sources Intensified in Southwestern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The director of the Public Security
Department in Yunnan Province, Jiang Pusheng, said the solution to
drug problems in frontier areas in southwestern China lies in
eliminating drug sources in the "Golden Triangle".
</P>
<P>
Yunnan borders the "Golden Triangle", which is one of the
world's major drug sources, and it has put a lot of effort into
fighting drug trafficking and smuggling. From 1992 to 1997, it
dealt with more than 30,000 drug cases.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of the heroin and about 70 percent of the
opium that China seized were caught in Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Yunnan's experiences of the past decade show
that increased economic growth and prosperity have a positive
effect on halting the growing drug menace.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Yunnan has allocated 300 million yuan (36
million US dollars) for agriculture and technical training to help
farmers in the the northern frontier region of Myanmar (Burma) and
Laos grow cereals crops to replace the opium poppy, and that
economic exchanges and development in the area can reduce the
reliance on the poppy economy there. More than 20,000 hectares of
farmland there have been changed from poppy raising to other crops.
</P>
<P>
An official of Myanmar's Special Region 4, on the frontier of
the Golden Triangle, said that China's economic reforms and
opening-up have also promoted economic growth in the region, which
has greatly benefited the from border tourism and trade that have
added some 40 million yuan (4.8 million US dollars) per year.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the Chinese government, three of the
six gangs involved in the drug business in northern Myanmar have
reduced their poppy-raising area.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Drug Control Program is planning to use 250
million U.S. dollars to aid farmers in the Golden Triangle grow
other crops, according to Pino Arlacchi, U.N. deputy
secretary-general and executive director.
</P>
<P>
Arlacchi said that the international community expects farmers
in the Golden Triangle to completely give up poppy raising in ten
years.

<HEADLINE> South China Tiger Gives Birth To Cub in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-year old South China tiger
gave birth to a male baby tiger over the weekend at a zoo in
China's largest metropolis of Shanghai, east China.
</P>
<P>
Being young, inexperienced and without much milk, the young
mother has refused to attend to her baby, leaving it to the hands
of the zoo-keeper Gu Wenyang who has been working in the Shanghai
Zoo for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Though still unable to open his eyes, the cub is said to be
alive and well, with his weight increasing to 1.5 kilograms from
1.15 kg at the time of its birth.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are approximately 50 South China tigers in
China, mostly in zoos. The newly-born tiger cub represents the
sixth generation bred by the Shanghai zoo since 1960s and has
increased the number of south China tiger to eight.
</P>
<P>
However, zoo workers are worrying about the inbreeding of the
animal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jetliner Hits Turbulence over Pacific, 7 Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Seven passengers and crew were
injured Thursday when a U.S. jetliner from Los Angeles to Hawaii hit
clear-air turbulence over the Pacific Ocean, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Two passengers and a 26-year-old steward were seriously injured
when the Continental Airlines DC-10 flight, carrying 285 passengers
and crew, was bounced around by the turbulence about 150 miles off the
California coast, said Mitch Barker, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Four others, two flight attendants and two passengers, received
slight injuries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Fire Dept. spokesman Brian Humphrey said the pilot
advised flight controllers at Los Angeles International Airport that
he was returning to the airport with injured passengers.
</P>
<P>
Paramedics boarded the aircraft when it returned to the airport.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that turbulence is unstable air that can make an
airliner bump, rise and fall. Storm clouds and mountain ranges can
cause it, but there also are invisible, unpredictable areas of
unstable air known as clear-air turbulence, they added.

for Marine Environmental Forecasts said today that the El Nino
breaking out last year will end between July and August this year.
</P>
<P>
The center's deputy director Song Xuejia said, " The obvious
change of the major indexes of the El Nino beginning from January
1998 indicates its prime time is over, and has been on the wane."
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the center found after long-term monitoring
that the abnormal warm water-body in central and eastern Pacific
Ocean along the equator has been shrinking eastwardly. Meanwhile,
the convection in the Pacific Ocean at the equatorial area has
also been weakening.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing with the sunspot activity cycle, scientists predict
that the El Nino will come to an end in about two months time this
year.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino, the strongest over the last century, has caused
unusual climate in the world, leading to frequent serious natural
disasters.
</P>
<P>
"It has also greatly affected China," said Song.
</P>
<P>
Northern China suffered unusual drought last summer, with a
big drop in the production of autumn grain and oil crops and a
record long dry-ups of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
Some regions in southern China was flooded, and the Typhoon
Winnie ravaging six provinces and two municipalities in eastern
China caused a loss of more than 50 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China experienced a remarkable warm winter in 1997
because of El Nino.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai branches of Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HKSB) and the Citibank of the
United States have been selected as the first two overseas banks
to join the city's ATM system, according to the Shanghai Branch of
the People's Bank of China, the central bank,
</P>
<P>
The move means that holders of credit cards issued by the two
overseas banks can draw Renminbi yuan from more than 500 ATMs
installed here by the local banks such as the Industrial and
Commercial Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai
Pudong Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the decision, Shanghai's credit card network has been
electronically linked with those of Visa International and
MasterCard Group. The local credit card network currently has
access to more than 2,600 banks in more than 200 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the participation of the HKSB and Citibank in
the local ATM network will significantly strengthen the link
between Shanghai and the international credit card market. HKSB
and Citibank are two of the nine overseas banks authorized to deal in
local currency business in the Pudong New Area on a trial basis.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Homework Deprives Students' Enjoyable Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Heavy school work has deprived
Chinese students of weekend relaxation and happiness, according to
a survey in Tianjin, a port city in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Tianjin Work Committee for Caring
Younger Generation among 2,300 students, 150 teachers and 1,000
parents, finds that 98 percent of the high school students and 92
percent of the elementary school pupils in the city have to spend
most of their weekends doing homework.
</P>
<P>
Apart from school assignments, 35 percent of the high school
students and 44 percent of the elementary school students also
attend various kinds of cram schools or have private tutors, the
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The students generally have little time to play, the survey
indicates, citing their main weekend pastime as watching TV,
listening to music and playing electronic games.
</P>
<P>
Education experts called for efforts to reduce students' burden
by changing the present exam-oriented educational mode into one
that focuses on fostering students' morality and enhancing
problem-solving capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The whole society should also create conditions to help the
students have a colorful and enjoyable weekend, the experts
added.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Takes Steps to Protect Ecological Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest China
will increase its financial input into environmental protection,
to the tune of one percent of its economic output, according to a
senior official.
</P>
<P>
It has already worked out a program to strengthen environmental
protection of the Qinghai Plateau, an important component of the
ecological system of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
</P>
<P>
The program covers working out environmental protection
policies, law enforcement, land erosion treatment and developing
clean energy.
</P>
<P>
A plan has been worked out to cope with land erosion and
develop ecological agriculture in the province's eastern region,
fight grassland degradation in the southern parts and
desertification of the Qaidam basin, promote afforestation at the
source of the Yangtze River and protect the natural environment of
the Qinghai Lake valley.
</P>
<P>
The natural environment of the Qinghai Plateau has declined due
to intensive human activities, and as much as 330,000 sq km of the
province's land -- 46 percent of the province's total land area --
has been eroded.
</P>
<P>
The severe land erosion has led to a sharp decrease in river
water flow, worsening drought and desertification. One third of
the province's grassland has been degraded, and pollution has been
worsening.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to develop such clean energies as water
power and natural gas. It will build a batch of medium-sized and
small hydro-electric power stations, and explore ways to utilize
wind, solar and subterranean thermal power.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Exploration of Large Oilfields in Bohai Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up its efforts to
explore simultaneously two large oilfields in the central part of
the Bohai Bay, in a bid to bring about an annual crude production
capacity of 4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Shaodong, president of the China Offshore Oil
Bohai Corp (COOBC), crude oil to be turned out by the two
oilfields -- Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Nanbao 35-2, will be piped
inland through the port of Jingtang in Tangshan city, north
China's Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield, with 170 million tons of verified
geological oil reserves, is 100 km east of Tanggu in
Tianjin. Presently, eleven wells have been drilled here.
</P>
<P>
Nanbao 35-2 Oilfield, lies 20 km south of Tangshan. Four test
wells have been drilled and geological reserves of 70 million tons
have been identified. Nanbao's reserves have been estimated at 110
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the distance between the two oilfields
is just 20 km, making it possible for their joint development in a
70-sq km oil-bearing area in the central Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
He said seven standard platforms will be erected in the two
oilfields, two pipelines be laid at the seabed to transport oil
inland, and terminals will be built in Jingtang Port.
</P>
<P>
And requisition of 650 meters of coastline will be made for
building oil transport berths. The entire construction will cost
7.29 billion yuan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The official forecasts that the Qinhuangdao 32-6 Oilfield will
begin production in the year 2003 and Nanbao one year later. By
2004, the two oilfields are expected to produce four million tons
of oil a year.

<HEADLINE> Burkina Faso Denies Aiding S. Leonean Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Burkina Faso has denied accusations
that it was supporting the remnants of the dislodged military
junta and allied rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Our people have problems with (lack of) water. With such a
situation, we are not going to find the means to get involved in
a country as far away as Sierra Leone," said the country's
Foreign Minister Ablasse Ouegraogo, quoted by a report reaching
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean refugees, who fled fighting at home, have
accused Burkina Faso of being "the main supplier of arms,
ammunition and food" to die-hard supporters of the junta.
</P>
<P>
Remnants of the junta and allied rebels have fled to the east
and north of Sierra Leone for guerrilla wars since the fall of
the military regime more than three months ago.
</P>
<P>
The west African peace keeping force, which drove the junta
out of the capital Freetown, is now carrying out operations in
northern and eastern Sierra Leone to mop up the anti-government
forces.
</P>
<P>
"Do you think we have the means to support a rebellion with
such financial obligations lying ahead?" Ouegraogo asked,
referring to the forthcoming June summit of the Organization of
African Unity in Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, it is intolerable to seek legality
through force in the case of Sierra Leone, one must use dialog.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps that is the cause of the opposition leveled against
Burkina Faso and Liberia," he added.

Russian officials reportedly said that they would reconsider
its deal with Cyprus after Karadayi promised to buy Russia's
combat helicopters and MIG fighters if Cyprus gave up the contract.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 2 Warring Afghan Factions Trade Fire North of Kabul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia and
the Northern Alliance exchanged heavy shells and mortars early
Friday on frontlines north of the Afghan capital, Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from Kabul quoted witnesses as saying
that the rumbling of rocket, artillery and mortar fire was clearly
audible in the Taliban-controlled capital city in the early hours
of Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report quoted local residents as saying that
forces loyal to Ahmad Shah Masoon, defense minister in the ousted
Afghan government, fired at least three heavy rockets into the
Kabul airport early Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second rocket assault on the Kabul airport in
recent days by the anti-Taliban forces who say they want to shut
down Kabul's only airfield.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage in the
strikes.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia, which control Kabul and about 85 percent
of the Afghan territory, have been sending dozens of fighter jets
toward the opposition-held north from the airport in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban Northern Alliance says it wants to close the
airport to stop the bombing of its positions.
</P>
<P>
According to another report from Kabul two Taliban fighter jets
and a cargo plane took off from the Kabul airport after the
rocketing, an indication that the runway was usable.
</P>
<P>
Military conflict in war-torn Afghanistan between the Taliban
and the Northern Alliance has been stepped up following the
collapse of peace talks early this month. The peace talks were
jointly organized by the United Nations and the Organization of
Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Trading Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong economy is highly
externally oriented and dependent on trade with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
The city was placed the world's eighth largest trading entity
in 1997 by the World Trade Organization (WTO), accounting for 3.6
percent of world total trade.
</P>
<P>
The value of Hong Kong's total merchandise trade amounted to
3,071 billion HK dollars (393.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997, or
around 230 percent of the GDP for the year.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that Hong Kong's position as an international
trading center has been well preserved after the handover. The
Basic Law guarantees continuation of Hong Kong's economic and
trading system, the free movement of goods and capital and its
status as a free port and separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
The constitutional document of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region of China also provides that Hong Kong may
continue to participate in relevant international trade
organizations and agreements. Hong Kong is now a member of the
WTO, the World Customs Organization and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 witnessed modest export growth of Hong Kong.
Government figures showed that the value of total exports in the
whole year of 1997 stood at 1,455.9 billion HK dollars (186.6
billion U.S. dollars), up 4.2 percent over the same period of the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports made up 85 percent of the value of total export,
reflecting the continued importance of Hong Kong as an entrepot
for China's mainland, Hong Kong's number one trading partner.
</P>
<P>
The value of re-exports in 1997 was 1,244.5 billion HK dollars
(159.6 billion U.S. dollars), 5 percent higher, while the value of
domestic exports, at 211.4 billion HK dollars (27.1 billion U.S.
dollars), dipped slightly by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The value of imports rose by 5.2 percent to 1,615.1 billion HK
dollars (207.1 billion U.S. dollars). Therefore a visible trade
deficit of 159.1 billion HK dollars (20.4 billion U.S. dollars),
equivalent to 9.9 percent of the value of imports, was recorded
for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland accounted for one-third of Hong Kong's
total merchandise trade, followed by the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Dampened by the regional financial crisis and a major downturn
in the tourism industry, Hong Kong's export of services showed
almost no increase in 1997 against the previous year, following an
8.6 percent increase for the whole of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Rebuilding City Wall to Restore Past Beauty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Dali, an autonomous prefecture in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, is rebuilding its city wall to
restore past beauty.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of rebuilding will cost three million yuan, and
is scheduled for completion at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Dali was first built in 779, serving a economic and cultural
center on the route from south China to India and Arab countries
in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Emperors of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) turned Dali into a
scenic spot with evergreen trees and blooming flowers, and built a
wonderful city wall of stones, 5,160 meters long, 6.66 meters
high and eight meters thick, with several rostrums on, according to
local chronicles.
</P>
<P>
However, visitors now can only find a broken wall there owing
to neglect of protection and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Local residents regard the city wall as a symbol of Dali and
donated 3.88 million yuan to support the rebuilding project.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous prefecture also decided to re-pave its
main roads with slabstones and remove modern-style buildings
around the city wall to further restore its past appearance.

HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong maintained its position
as the world's busiest container port for six years in a row in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Including container terminals, mid-stream and river trade, it
handled 14.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) of
containers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent, by weight, of Hong Kong's external trade is
handled by the port, according to Hong Kong's Port Development
Board (POB), which forecasts that, with the economic and trade
development of Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong has
to cope with a steady growth of container cargo well into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
A new container terminal, Container Terminal 9, is expected to
be completed in the early 2000s, which will expand substantially
the handling capacity of the existing eight container terminals at
the Kwai Chung/Stonecutters Island Container Port.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, work continued on both the new River Trade Terminal
at Tuen Men and the Permanent Mid-stream Facility at Stonecutters
Island. Both facilities are due to come into operation this year.
</P>
<P>
The throughput of the Hong Kong container port is forecast to
grow on an annual average of 5.8 percent in the next 10 years to
24 million TEUs in 2006, and Hong Kong will retain its role as the
major container port for import and export to the Chinese
mainland, according to the latest findings of the Hong Kong Port
Cargo Forecasts commissioned by POB.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hong Kong remains a prominent center for
ship-owning, ship-financing and ship-management. Latest figures
from the Hong Kong Shipping Register showed that a total fleet of
486 vessels, amounting to 6.13 million gross registered tons
(GRT), were registered under Hong Kong flag.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also stands as the hub of international and regional
aviation, with the status certainly to be enhanced by the
forthcoming opening of the new international airport at Chek Lap
Kok.
</P>
<P>
Having served Hong Kong for several decades, the existing Kai
Tak airport has been lauded as one of the safest and most
efficient airports in the world. In the financial year ending
March 31, 1997, the passenger throughput at Kai Tak grew by 7.5
percent to over 30 million while air cargo throughput jumped by
9.8 percent to over 1.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kai Tak overtook Tokyo Narita to become the world's
busiest airport in terms of international cargo. In respect of
international passengers, it remained the third busiest after
London Heathrow and Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate continued robust growth in air traffic, the
20-billion-U.S. dollar Airport Core Program was started in the
early 1990s. The world-class infrastructure project consists of
10 projects: the new airport, the airport railway, roads, bridges
and tunnels and even a new town.
</P>
<P>
Upon opening on July 6, with the first of the two runways in
operation, the new airport is able to handle 35 million passengers
and up to 3 million tons of air cargo annually.

<HEADLINE> Multi-Track Railway Project to Start Before Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a multiple-track
section of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, one of China's few
north-south railway arteries, is expected to start within this
year.
</P>
<P>
The 624-km-long section runs between Xiangtang and Longchuan,
both in Jiangxi province, and total construction costs have been
estimated at three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jianxing, director of the Nanchang Railway Bureau, said
that passenger and freight flow of the Beijing-Kowloon Railway has
surged steadily since the railway opened for traffic in September
1996.
</P>
<P>
In some sections, especially the Xiangtang-Longchuan section,
the traffic load has already reached 85 percent of the designed
capacity, Yang noted.
</P>
<P>
The multi-track project is also intended to help divert part of
the freight transport on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, another
north-south railway trunkline, he added.

HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, the regional entrepot
of finance and trade, is marked by the high degree of import and
application of advanced technology, particularly that related to
information industry.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of its status of free port, Hong Kong
maintains economic links with over 100 countries and regions,
making it a pivot of information, and now it is trying to build
itself into "the most informed city in the world" as described by
the Hong Kong Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Wired by satellite, optical fibers, cables, microwaves and
other media, Hong Kong has formed an information network,
particularly economic information network, both locally and
globally.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the first major city in the world to have a fully
digitized telephone network and the amount of its outgoing
international phone calls is much higher than both the United
States and Japan. Hong Kong now has a telecommunications network
comprising over 300,000 kilometers of optical fiber.
</P>
<P>
About one-sixth of Hong Kong's population or 1.1 million people
have subscribed to paging services -- the highest per-capita rate
in the world. And a total of over 1 million subscribers to
cellular phone services also is among the highest levels of
penetration in the world.
</P>
<P>
A recent market survey showed that the home penetration rate of
PC is over 50 percent and there are more than 850,000 Internet
users in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In March, the world's first-ever interactive TV (iTV) was
launched in Hong Kong, making it possible for people to see films,
listen to music or deal with financial affairs at any time with
clicks of a few buttons at home. And just two weeks ago, the
Internet service was added to the iTV network, enabling users to
get access to the worldwide web at a surprisingly high speed.
</P>
<P>
An international conference on the future of information and
communications technology in Asia had just concluded in Hong Kong.
Organizers of the conference said the city provides a dynamic,
technology-rich environment, whose government sees technology as a
critical component of Hong Kong's successful future. Also, the
regional hub provides an open location in which to examine the
various models of technology throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1960s, Hong Kong has brought in U.S. and Japanese
investment in electronic industry, which has become the second
largest industry in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Technology advancement is a key factor of economic growth in
Hong Kong. A research on the manufacturing sector in Hong Kong
shows that technology development accounted for an average of 42.9
percent in the sector's production during the period of 1969 to
1982.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's technology development is market-oriented and
characterized by high efficiency. For instance, it usually takes a
mere three months for general electronics and plastics from
product design to production.
</P>
<P>
There are several prestigious academic institutions in Hong
Kong, including Hong Kong University, the Chinese University of
Hong Kong, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and
they are well equipped and have absorbed talents from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Political and social stability ensures Hong Kong favorable
working and living conditions. In addition, Hong Kong's ability to
 develop technology-rich products has been well-complimented by
the abundant outcome of the ever-increasing scientific research in
China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka Rakes in $5 Million from House Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Lusaka City Council (LCC) has
raised about 9.2 billion Kwacha (about five million U.S. Dollars)
from the sale of its houses since the exercise began two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Friday quoted Lusaka Mayor Fisho Mwale as
saying Thursday that so far 9,214 houses, almost 60 percent of
the LCC housing stock, have been sold.
</P>
<P>
The money from the sale is being channeled to the housing
re-development fund, which has since released about six billion
Kwacha (about 3.2 million US Dollars) for the construction of 120
houses in the capital city, he said.
</P>
<P>
He complained that some tenants have not shown commitment to
finishing payment for their houses but said the council is
dealing with people facing economic difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"But that does not mean we will not be tough in order to
ensure that people meet the deadline," he said, adding that
tenants should realize that the houses remain the property of the
council until the money is paid out in full.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwale, the financial base for the LCC is sound
and it is still able to pay out salaries for its employees
despite disposing of its housing stock.
</P>
<P>
Sale of government and council houses to their sitting tenants
is part of Zambia's new housing policy to support home ownership
and make free housing the past.

ANKARA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 12 people were killed and
13 others reported missing in a ravage flood hitting the
northwestern Turkish region, TV and newspaper reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Strong rainstorms swept across the provinces of Zonguldak,
Bartin, Karabuk, Bolu, Aydin and Kars on Wednesday and Thursday,
causing an unprecedented flood in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Houses were inundated and many people were forced onto the
roofs to get a shelter. Several major highways were closed due to
landslides and the collapses of several bridges.
</P>
<P>
The 12 deaths were reported in different parts of the region,
and another 179 people surrounded by the flood were still in a
dangerous condition, according to local government officials.
</P>
<P>
In some cities in the region, electricity supplies stopped and
communications with the outside were cut off, making the rescue
work more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government had set up an emergency commission headed
by Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to take charge of the
rescue and aid work to the flood-stricken provinces.
</P>

<HEADLINE> L. Victoria Flooding Wreaks Havoc in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Kenyans and 7,500
animals have been displaced by the continuing flooding caused by
the rising Lake Victoria waters.
</P>
<P>
About 8,200 acres of crop have been destroyed in Nyando,
southwest Kenya alone, the Daily Nation newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which burst its banks last week for the first time
in three decades, has affected the entire shoreline in Busia,
Siaya, Bondo, Kisumu, Nyando, Rachuonyo, Homa bay and Suba
districts.
</P>
<P>
Many families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped by
the floods and drowned, entire villages and schools swept away
and other houses submerged as the lake waters engulf the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced have
been hampered by poor roads, made impassable by the floods, while
lack of communication also worsens the situation.
</P>
<P>
Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the
help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts
of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western
highlands.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year,
water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept
across the region, claiming scores of lives.
</P>
<P>
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in
Kenya although the country only holds about six percent of the
lake's 2,760 cubic km of water, with Tanzania taking up 49
percent and Uganda 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes
which some experts argue are a result of siltation due to the
blockage of river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
</P>
<P>
Among other explanations from experts are the shrinking
shoreline which has not been surveyed for more than 50 years and
the heavy El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has been asked to investigate a claim
that a blocked outlet near the Owen Falls Dam in Jinja, Uganda
could have caused the sudden rise in the levels of the lake
water.

<HEADLINE> 550,000 Households in Tianjin Owning Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Approximately 550,000 households in
Tianjin, which has a population of nine million, now own their own
apartments, with their combined floor space making up 43.8 percent
of the city's total volume.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 227,000 households in Tianjin
have bought government-subsidized apartments, with the floor space
totaling 14.38 million sq m, and some 323,000 households have
purchased open-market flats or privately-owned houses, with the
combined floor space amounting to 16.72 million sq m, over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
During the era of planned economy, China had practiced a system
of distributing government-subsidized apartments as a form of
welfare in urban areas, which had long plagued by a difficulty of
not having enough to go round.
</P>
<P>
China has announced the abolishment of the system of
distributing housing in kind and to monetize housing distribution
as a way to reform its housing system in the wake of expanded
market economy. It encourages more residents to buy the
distributed government-subsidized apartments.
</P>
<P>
To urg more households to buy their own apartments, Tianjin
decided to slash taxes for sale of government-subsidized
apartments from 13.3 percent to five percent starting from this
April.
</P>
<P>
The measure enables residents exempting from paying land use
right fees for five years when they buy the resident apartments,
and a 8.3 percent cut in taxes when the residents resell the
apartments. This measure has proved effective, and helps
accelerate the pace for housing reform, said local official.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Vows to Bring Inflation Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
vowed to further reduce the inflation rate from 15 to 7.5 percent
in the next fiscal year beginning from July.
</P>
<P>
Dar es Salaam newspapers Friday quoted a senior treasury
official as saying that the measures to control inflation
include, avoiding bank borrowing, making repayments to the
banking system, and continuation of cash budgeting which involves
spending the actual revenue received.
</P>
<P>
"These measures are expected to reduce the money supply and
make more credit available to the private sector," Raphael
Mollel, the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, said
while opening a two-day seminar on monetary policy stance in
Tanzania in the northern region of Arusha Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the measures taken by the government during the
fiscal reforms in 1991, inflation dropped drastically from 38
percent in the early 1990s to 15 percent last July.
</P>
<P>
To enhance efficiency of financial institutions, Mollel noted
that the government, through the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), will
carry out divestiture of the financial institutions and encourage
the entry of new private banks and other financial agencies.
</P>
<P>
On credit problems in rural areas, Mollel said people will be
mobilized to form their own community banks and credit and
service schemes.
</P>
<P>
He also said the liberalization of the insurance sector is
progressing well as two private insurance firms have been
licensed in addition to the state-owned National Insurance
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, attended by 60 senior bankers, has been

CHANGCHUN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin Province
has succeeded in bringing 95 percent of the drinking water in
urban areas up to national standards after five years of battling
severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
The province has built 66 facilities in different cities for
more efficient central heating and environmental protection and
has provided natural gas for 300,000 families in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Government departments got rid of 120 sources of industrial
pollution and, by the end of 1997, had treated 74 percent of the
polluted water, according to a senior Environmental Protection
Bureau official.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring has shown that the average amount of suspended
particles in each cubic meter of air is 356 micrograms, 70
micrograms less than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has many large state-owned industries and has suffered
from heavy pollution for several decades, but the government
decided in 1990 to try to stop the environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
Jilin also has 35 different nature reserves, which cover ten
percent of the province's land mass, and some cities and counties
are trying out more ecologically-sound agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Abducted Girls Should Be Freed by Force: Museveni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that the 20 school girls abducted by Kony rebels should
only be freed by force since the rebels refused to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the statement at a press conference jointly held
with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the failure by the rebels to release the girls on May
14 confirmed he is right to see the use of force as the only way
to rescue them.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan President said he was bluffed into releasing the
42 Sudanese prisoners of war on condition that the Sudanese
government would reciprocate Uganda's goodwill gesture and
release the girls being held by Joseph Kony's rebels since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Lord Resistance Army (LRA), spearheaded by Joseph Kony, is
a rebel group in northern Uganda and it usually retreats into
southern Sudan when faced with mounting pressure from the Ugandan
army. The rebels killed and abducted in the northern districts
like Kitgum and Gula, posing a potential threat to the security
of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The girls were abducted by the LRA from St. Mary's school, at
Aboke on October 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rebels initially abducted 130 girls, but the school's
deputy headmistress, an Italian Roman Catholic nun, Rachele
Fassera, followed them into the bush and persuaded the rebel
commander to free all but 30, who were retained allegedly for
their beauty.
</P>
<P>
Nine of the girls have since escaped, while one was killed by
the rebels last year when she tried to get out of rebels' hands.

</P>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Everything is ready for Sunday's
election of the first Legislative Council of Hong Kong after it
became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China last July.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.8 million registered voters are expected to cast
their votes to choose from 166 candidates the 60 members of the
Legislative Council from 7:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Legislative Council Ordinance, of the 60
Legislative Council members, 20 are to be returned from the
geographical constituencies, 30 from the functional constituencies
and 10 from the Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 polling stations are set up across Hong Kong
following the month-long publicity activities ranging from roving
exhibitions, advertisements, parades and carnivals to a string of
forums for the candidates to explain their views.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has attached great importance to the
legislature election as an important step in fully implementing
the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a
high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the HKSAR was founded last July, the Provisional
Legislative Council adopted the Legislative Council Ordinance in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, drawing
up specific methods for the election of the first HKSAR
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa appointed a 3-member Electoral
Affairs Commission with Justice Woo Kwok-hing as its chairman, to
supervise the entire election process.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the election to be conducted in an open,
fair and honest manner, the government formulated the guidelines
on election-related activities in respect of the election after
soliciting opinions from people in all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts made the related activities for the
legislature election orderly and smooth.
</P>
<P>
They included voter registration, the nomination of candidates
for the Election Committee subsector election and the subsector
election of the 800-strong Election Committee as well as the
nomination of candidates for the legislature election.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has urged the local media to supervise
the election and set up hotlines to receive complaints from local
residents.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Affairs Commission opened two polling stations
Friday, two days ahead of the election, offering local residents
chances to visit them in a bid to increase transparency.
</P>
<P>
On the polling day Sunday, 15,000 civil servants will be
mobilized to assist the election at the polling stations and the
central counting station. Visitors and journalists are allowed to
view the entire process of vote counting.

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sector Booming in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The non-public sector in east
China's Fujian Province has experienced fast expansion in recent
years to become an important part of the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
Fujian had 88,000 non-public economic entities by the end of
last year, with their industrial output value and retail sales
standing at 40 and 55.9 percent of the provincial totals,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's non-public sector, which includes private firms,
shareholding entities supported mainly by private funds and
partnership entities, is among the most developed in China. It has
become an important driving force behind Fujian's economic growth
since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the industrial output value of
Fujian's non-public sector grew an average 49.4 percent between
1991 and 1997. The rate is 17.9 percentage points higher than the
growth rate for the entire industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the non-public sector turned in 2.35
billion yuan in industrial and commercial taxes last year. The
figure is up 23.6 percent from 1996 and 12.3 percent of the
province's total tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Fujian's non-public sector, which covers electronics,
machinery, chemicals, computer, agriculture, fishery, building

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong, a small region of less
than 1,100 square kilometers inhabited by six million people, has
developed into an economic powerhouse despite its lack of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong economy has nearly quadrupled over the past two
decades, with its GDP growing at an average annual rate of about
seven percent in real terms. The World Bank has ranked Hong Kong's
per capita GDP, in terms of purchasing power parity, the sixth
highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong holds the world's third largest foreign exchange
reserves, after Japan and China's mainland. Its foreign currency
assets totaled 92.8 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a small and open economy, Hong Kong's economic success owes
a great deal to the remarkable performance of its external trade
sector.
</P>
<P>
It is the world's seventh largest trading economy, and the U.S.
Heritage Foundation has named Hong Kong the freest economy in the
globe four years in a row.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has established itself as a major international
financial center. It is the world's fifth largest banking center
in terms of the volume of external banking transactions, and the
fifth largest foreign exchange market in terms of turnover. Its
stock market is Asia's second largest in terms of market
capitalization and ranks the seventh in the world. Hong Kong is
also the world's fourth largest gold bullion market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has emerged as Asia's services hub, with exports of
services ranging from accounting and legal services, to insurance
and fund-raising, and telecommunications and media.
</P>
<P>
Low tax rates, a level-playing field, rule of law, clean
government, free flow of information, free market competition, and
 efficient infrastructure have all contributed to the success of
Hong Kong economy.

international financial center, thanks to its favorable
geographical position, bridging the time gap between North America

important factor for the growth of the Hong Kong financial
industry.

of the volume of external banking transactions. It has a very
strong presence of international institutions. Some 500 banks and

Hong Kong has a mature and active foreign exchange market,
which ranks the fifth in the world and forms an integral part of
the global market.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the world's fourth largest gold bullion market.

capitalization and ranks the seventh in the world. The stock
market acts as an important funding source for companies in Asia,
particularly for those Chinese enterprises seeking overseas
investment.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Province Regulates Property Rights Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 22 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei province
recently worked out a set of rules on the transfer of state-owned
property rights to regulate the nascent market.
</P>
<P>
The rules have detailed stipulations on property rights
transfer authorization, qualifications for intermediary agencies
involved in property rights transfer, the property rights transfer
procedure, the use of proceeds from property rights transfer,
property rights transfer supervisions, and punishment for rule
violators.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hebei has issued certificates to qualified property
rights transfer agencies and launched qualification tests among
property rights transfer professionals.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics show that Hebei's property rights
turnover exceeded 1.7 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
As China moves from a planned to a market economy, property
rights transfers have become increasingly frequent. Besides Hebei,
many other provinces and municipalities have also set up property
rights transfer centers and formulated rules to regulate the
rapidly-expanding market.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 800,000 laid-off workers in
Beijing have been hired in private businesses, which observers
here attribute to booming private sector and the people's changing
concepts on employment.
</P>
<P>
Information supplied by the municipal labor market shows that
during the first season of the year, applicants for posts in
private sector account for 15 percent of the total, for the first
time surpassing the demand percentage, which stood at 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
A latest policy issued by the municipal bureau of labor shows
that the municipal government continues to encourage private
enterprises absorbing job-hunters.
</P>
<P>
Local regulations show that private enterprises which enroll a
certain percentage of laid-off workers are entitled to enjoy such
preferential policies as tax reduction and favorable loans.
</P>
<P>
Any private enterprise which employs a male laid-off worker
above 40 or a female laid-off above 35 and fulfil a two-year
contract with the worker is endowed to receive 4,000 to 6,000 yuan
as re-settlement fees.
</P>
<P>
You Lantian, director of the municipal bureau of labor, said
that private enterprises have been playing a major role in
absorbing laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, sources from the Beijing Municipal Association of the
Self-employed show that the city's private businesses absorbed a
total of 11,000 laid-off workers last year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Calls for Diversified Use of Jute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina on Thursday stressed the importance of diversified and
increased commercial use of jute for the country's economic
development, the independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The commercial use of jute should be increased and markets
expanded," she said this while meeting with members of the
Parliamentary Standing Committee on the Jute Ministry here.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of environment concern, the use of jute should be
increased in the world market and Bangladesh could capture the
market by innovating diversified use of jute, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is the biggest jute-exporting country in the world
and occupies 58 percent of the global jute market.
</P>
<P>
Of the country's annual production of over 5 million bales
(about 0.9 million tons), 90 percent is exported to some 20
countries.
</P>
<P>
The jute industry is the country's second major foreign
exchange earner after the ready-made garment industry. It earned
about 139 million U.S. dollars from exporting jute goods in the
July 1996-June 1997 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Multinational Corporations Invest More in Fujian Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Multinational corporations
significantly increased their investment in east China's Fujian
Province in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Investment by companies from developed European countries, the
United States and Japan surged more than 30 percent in the first
three months, official statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six of the world's largest multinational corporations
have invested in 58 projects in Fujian, with investment totaling
more than five billion US dollars. Of the projects, 26 are in
Xiamen, a special economic zone on the eastern coast.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has been one of the most successful in using overseas
investment since China launched its market economic reform in the
late 1970s. It had approved 23,300 overseas-funded enterprises by
the end of March this year, with contracted overseas investment
reaching 50.64 billion US dollars. The amount of paid-in
investment in Fujian, at 22.89 billion US dollars, is 10 percent
of the national figure.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Hong Kong, Taiwan and southeast Asian countries put
in nearly 80 percent of the overseas investment in
Fujian. However, companies from these places have invested mainly
in small and labor-intensive projects.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Fujian has stepped up its efforts to attract
funds from multinational corporations in developed countries such
as the United States and Japan, according to Vice Governor Cao
Degai.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Fujian has invested more than 30 billion yuan to
improve its infrastructures and train local workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
As the investment environment improves, more multinational
corporations have come to explore investment opportunities in
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Multinational corporations showing up in Fujian include
Boeing, General Electric, Shell and Matsushita Electric.

<P>
Xi'an has spent 4.7 billion yuan (about 566 million
U.S. dollars) on environmental protection facilities like a
natural gas pipe project and a large sewage treatment plant.
</P>

and nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an is the largest city in this part of China and, under the
name Chang'an, was the capital of eleven dynasties from the
Western Zhou (1100-771 B.C.) to the Tang (618-907 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
Local officials ordered the use unleaded gasoline, and the
natural gas system will be available for another 320,000 urban
families this year.

Xi'an has also gotten people to plant shelter belts to help
deal with the dust from the loess plateau to try to get the the

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Malaysia's Bid to Make NPLs Perform Aims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government's
move to set up an asset management company (AMC) to buy out and
manage bank's non-performing loans (NPLs) to make NPLs perform is
a measure that could restore confidence in the banking sector and
expedite the economic recovery process, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced
Wednesday the setting up of the (AMC) to take over the NPLs and
troubled assets of the nation's banks to clean up their balance
sheets.
</P>
<P>
Under the mechanism, the nation's banks would be able to write
down the NPLs and sell them to the AMC at depreciated values,
which would manage and try to maximize the recovery of the assets
and thereafter sell them off at market prices.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, who is also Finance Minister, promised the AMC, which is
expected to operate within two weeks, would be managed by the
local private sector and international companies and would operate
within the market mechanism without intervention from the
government.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector in Malaysia has been made vulnerable by an
increase in NPLs since the financial crisis hit the region
including Malaysia last July.
</P>
<P>
The NPLs of the banking system in the country increased from
24.04 billion ringgit (about 6.41 billion U.S. dollars) or 5.7
percent of the total loans as at the end of 1997 to about 37.2
billion ringgit (about 9.92 billion U.S. dollars) or 9.3 percent
of the total loans given out as at the end of March this year,
according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
It was unofficially predicted that the NPLs of Malaysia's
banking system, which once reached a high of 30.1 percent of the
total loans at the end of 1988, might increase to 72-80 billion
ringgit (about 19.2- 21.33 billion U.S. dollars) or 18 to 20
percent of the total loans by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rising NPLs, most banks saddled with NPLs
and troubled assets have had to make huge provisions, which in
the process curbs their lending capacities.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the NPLs problem has been seen by analysts and
economists as critical in efforts to restore confidence in the
banking system and in the economy in general.
</P>
<P>
With the AMC target clearly stated, the banks in the country
could be relieved from the burden of managing the NPLs and
troubled assets by converting the idle assets into cash to start
off with a clean balance sheet, therefore allowing them to
concentrate on their daily operations.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said an effect of this is that the banks will have
more confidence in giving out badly-needed loans to productive
sectors of the economy and increased lending will help spur the
economy.
</P>
<P>
However, Anwar said that although banks would now be able to
focus on loan disbursements after the setting up of the AMC, the
credit growth target of 15 percent this year would not be reviewed
upwards.
</P>
<P>
And as the move is timely in strengthening the foundation of
banks, the analysts said investors would then look at the banking
sector favorably with more foreign direct investment expected to
flow back to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the AMC is not a measure taken in isolation
but is part of a series of measures Malaysia has taken since last
October to revive its economy and restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
The various measures and policies taken by the Malaysian
government in view of the tough economic environment included the
austerity measures announced in the 1998 Budget last October, the
cutback in the expenditure in December and the stabilization
measures to consolidate the financial sector taken in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
Optimistic of the latest measure to help generate business
activities and speed up economic recovery and restore confidence,
the analysts did not forget to caution the market against putting
too high expectation for the move to immediately help banks get
rid of their NPLs. They said the AMC alone could not be expected
to make everything all right.

<HEADLINE> hke052229 - Indian Home Minister Accused of Creating War Hysteria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- India's opposition parties and
noted figures have accused Home Minister L. K. Advani of creating
war hysteria against Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Advani in his recent strong worded statements linked India's
nuclear capability with the Kashmir issue and threatened to go
pro-active against Pakistan "misadventures."
</P>
<P>
"They are trying for an escalation of tension with the
neighbors," The Hindustan Times quoted Congress leader Ms. Ambica
Soni as saying here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The BJP-led government was trying to whip up a war hysteria to
cover up its internal problems and lack of governance, she said.
</P>
<P>
"No sane person would say that we've got a bomb, we can settle
the Kashmir issue," said H. Singh Surjeet, general secretary of
the Communist Party of India (Marxism) (CPI-M).
</P>
<P>
The provocative statements would only serve to isolate India
diplomatically, he said adding that Advani was definitely trying
to whip up a war hysteria.
</P>
<P>
"This will only lead to a nuclear arms race in the region, or
make the sub-continent more susceptible to a nuclear umbrella from
outside. Either way, it is harmful, said A. B. Bardhan, general
secretary of the Communist Party of India (CPI).
</P>
<P>
Shock, disgust and anger marked the range of reactions of a
cross-section of eminent personalities in the Capital to the
statement of Home Minister Advani that India had decided on a
pro-active response to the Pakistani "misadventures" on its
territory, The Hindustan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Former President of the People's Union for Civil Liberties
Rajindar Sachar said that the saber-rattling by Advani was most
deplorable. "Pokhran 11 (nuclear tests) should have brought
humility and serious introspection. Instead, the BJP shows
arrogance and adventurism," he said.
</P>
<P>
Social activist Prakash Panigrahi said that by behaving like a
regional bully, a wrong message was being given to the
international community. The display of voyeuristic nationalism
soon after conducting the nuclear tests was a diplomatic setback
for India.
</P>
<P>
Peace activist Shabnam Hashmi said that the government was
trying to raise issues which were not real. "For the last 40 years
we have been trying for better relations with our neighbors and
this statement is detrimental to it," she said.

<HEADLINE> Information Technology Workers in U.S. Highly Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Information technology
professionals are in big demand in the United States and their
salaries are soaring to record levels, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
About 11,000 respondents to an online survey conducted by
InformationWeek Research said that over the past 12 months, they
have seen their salaries climb by an average of 11 percent, a rate
well above the average of other professions.
</P>
<P>
This is amazing, said InformationWeek, considering that
inflation is low and typical workers in other fields have seen
their paychecks increase by a paltry 3 percent to 4 percent this
past year -- a quarter of what information technology
professionals receive.
</P>
<P>
"Until there is a greater supply of information technology
people, the demand will continue to drive up competition for
talent, compensation and other perks," said Harrs Miller,
president of the Information Technology Association of America, an
industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
Programmers claim the biggest annual percentage gain in base
annual salary, 14.3 percent, while the smallest increase, 7.6
percent, is going to operations managers.
</P>
<P>
Job titles figure greatly in the salaries paid. On average,
directors of information service and information technology earn
79,000 dollars a year, while a chief information officer (CIO)
earns 40,000 dollars more. It's not uncommon for some CIOs,
especially in some large companies, to command salaries of 400,000
to 500,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Demand for people to fix the year 2000 problem as well as to
develop client-server applications such as enterprise resource
planning have made the past year a lucrative one for
programmers. They experienced the biggest pay gains among
information technology professionals. The average annual salary of
a programmer now approaches 58,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Information technology professionals also get an additional 18
percent of compensation from nonsalary perks, including
bonuses. Top executives may get as high as 26 percent of their
compensation from other benefits, such as stock.
</P>
<P>
Some of the more unusual perks to keep information technology
happy include long weekends, extra vacation time and free trips.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Immigration Commissioner Defends Its Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Commissioner of the
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Doris Meissner
Thursday defended the troubled agency against critics in Congress
who want it dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Taking the agency apart "will only divide the problems, not
solve them," Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
"Improving accountability is the key. And we simply cannot
improve accountability by dispersing important functions into
different agencies with different priorities, procedures and
leadership," she told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
immigration and claims.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to stop efforts to split the INS apart, the
Clinton administration has proposed a plan to separate its
operations while keeping the 29,000-person agency intact.
</P>
<P>
Separate staffs with distinct chains of command would be in
charge of the enforcement and service operations, although both
would remain under the control of INS headquarters. They would
have separate offices, but would share access to INS databases and
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a special immigration commission recommended
abolishing the agency and distributing its functions among the
departments of State, Justice and Labor.
</P>
<P>
Representative Harold Rogers, a Republican and chairman of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the INS, is
sponsoring legislation to enact the bipartisan commission's
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Rogers' bill would create an agency to police the borders and
find and deport illegal immigrants, put the State Department in
charge of processing immigrant benefits, require the Department of
Labor to find illegal aliens in the workplace, and consolidate
review procedures into an independent agency.
</P>
<P>
Meissner criticized the multiple-agency approach, saying the
INS' functions are too interconnected to be spread across
government.
</P>
<P>
Representative Silvestre Reyes, a Democrat, also criticized the
INS, saying that more than five million illegal immigrants live in
the country while more than two million legal immigrants await
citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"For far too long the U.S. border has been neglected and we are
now paying the price for that neglect," said Reyes, who has
sponsored a separate INS reorganization bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A passenger airplane of Bosnian
airlines Thursday landed on the Belgrade airport, marking the
resumption of air services between Sarajevo and Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
This was the first airliner to have arrived in Belgrade from
Sarajevo since the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1992
which was followed by the Bosnia-Herzegovina civil war. The war
ended at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A Bosnia-Herzegovina government economic delegation, headed by
Transport Minister Kemal Bubalo, was welcomed by his Yugoslav
counterpart Dejan Drobnjakovic at the airport, according to
Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers expressed their belief that the air services
would push forward cooperation between the two countries in
economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral agreement, Yugoslav airliners will land in
Sarajevo and Banjaluka, while Bosnian flights will serve the
routes to Belgrade and Podgorica.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Irish to Endorse Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Thursday urged voters in Ireland and Northern Ireland to vote
"yes" on an historic peace deal and "embrace a common future in
peace."
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the call in a White House ceremony to sign the
U.S. ratification of the NATO expansion to include Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to put in one last plug for the vote in Ireland and
Northern Ireland tomorrow," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"And I hope that those fine people will lift the burden of the
last 30 years from their shoulders and embrace a common future in
peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a statement recorded at the White House for
broadcast abroad, Clinton said Friday's referendum in Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic is a chance to "join hope to
history" by ending three decades of violence and building a
peaceful future.
</P>
<P>
"You can turn the common tragedy of Northern Ireland's past
into a shared triumph for the future," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The voters "can do nothing to erase the past, but you can do
everything to build the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton repeated his warning to those who might revert to
violence: "You must know that you will find no friends in
America."
</P>
<P>
The peace accord was signed by all the parties concerned in
Belfast on April 10.

</P>
<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told newspaper editors from
across the country Thursday that Pakistan's decision on nuclear
test will be determined solely by its national interests.
</P>
<P>
The Nation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Ehtesab (accountability) Bench of Sindh High Court
withdrew on Thursday the non-bailable warrant of the Opposition
Leader, Benazir Bhutto, and ordered her to furnish enhanced surety
of 10 million rupees (about 230,000 U.S. dollars) within a week,

<HEADLINE> Poll Shows Most Americans Support Nuclear Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A new poll, taken after India
detonated five underground nuclear explosions last week, shows
that most Americans support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT).
</P>
<P>
The poll, carried out by the Mellman Group for the private
Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, showed 73 percent of 1,000
respondents thought the treaty should be ratified by the
U.S. Senate while 16 percent opposed and 11 percent had no view.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was submitted to the Senate last year after
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed it in 1996. But the Senate has
taken no action so far.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Republican Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he would block a
Senate vote on the treaty, arguing that the Indian tests showed
the accord was "scarcely more than a sham."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration strongly supports the ratification
even though India and its rival Pakistan have not signed the
treaty.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Bank Okays Stake-Holding in Thai Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The management of the
Netherlands-based Abn Amro Bank has approved plans to take a 75
percent stake in Thailand's Bank of Asia, the Bangkok Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March, Abn Amro agreed to pay 7.5 billion baht
(192.3 million U.S. dollars) for 1.423 billion new shares in Bank
of Asia, or 75 percent of the bank's total stake. The money are
expected to be paid in July.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the Dutch Bank will purchase a second lot of
10,000 shares in 2000, with prices based on Bank of Asia's asset
value and price-to-book values for the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
After the approval from the Abn Amro's managing board, the deal
now awaits the completion of legal documentation and approval by
regulators and Bank of Asia shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Asia Chairman Chavalit Thanachanan said the success of
the deal reflected foreign investor confidence in the government's
economic policies and the nation's future prospects.
</P>
<P>
He said Bank of Asia would focus on expanding its mid-level
retail base, aiming for a 5 percent market share within 3-5 years,
from the present share of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ton de Boer, Abn Amro's Asia Pacific chief executive officer,
said the transaction had so far moved very smoothly.
</P>
<P>
He said the Dutch Bank is now concentrating on how to develop
Bank of Asia's business in Thailand over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Asia is Thailand's 11th largest bank, with 2,300 staff
and 110 branches nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Washington Launches Space Day 1998 Celebrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Amid crowds of eager children,
Senator John Glenn, the first U.S. astronaut to orbit the Earth,
launched Space Day 1998 celebrations here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Venturing into space has not only served to expand our
knowledge. It has also helped to promote peace and foster
international cooperation," said Glenn.
</P>
<P>
"Young students represent our future space pioneers -- the men
and women of the next generation who will one day help to expand
our frontiers and realize possibilities that my colleagues and I
can only imagine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Through "space age" technology, millions of children around the
globe participated in Space Day celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece of this year's celebrations is an eight-hour
Cyber Webcast, broadcast live from the lawn outside the
Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
A special program during the Webcast was the voice of astronaut
Andy Thomas from the Russian Space Station, Mir, encouraging
students to embrace space and fulfill the visions of space
pioneers.
</P>
<P>
Many visiting children also got the chance to experience the
thrill of a shuttle blast-off during simulated missions aboard
Project Dream Mission, a 63-foot long interactive replica of the
space shuttle which made its debut here today.
</P>
<P>
More than 500,000 students in schools across the United States
and 21 other countries took part in a unique program named
"Students' Signatures in Space." These signatures will be flown
with John Glenn as he is aboard the Shuttle Discovery on the STS95
mission scheduled in October.
</P>
<P>
Space Day is a day dedicated to the extraordinary achievements,
benefits and opportunities in the exploration and use of space.

<HEADLINE> New Technology Does Away with Cables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Personal computers must be
connected to a printer via cable, but a new technology is planning
to change that.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson, IBM, Intel and other companies have unveiled their
vision to revolutionize wireless connectivity for personal and
business mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
The companies will work together to create Bluetooth, the
codename for a short-range radio link to exchange information,
enabling effortless wireless connectivity between mobile phones,
mobile PCs, handheld computers and other peripheral items of
equipment. The radio will operate on the globally available
2.45-GHz "free-band," allowing international travelers to use
Bluetooth enabled equipment worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Bluetooth will eliminate the need for business travelers to
purchase or carry numerous, often proprietary cables, by allowing
multiple devices to communicate with each other through a single
port. Enabled devices will not need to remain within
line-of-sight, and can maintain an uninterrupted connection when
in motion, or even when placed in a pocket or briefcase.
</P>
<P>
The companies said that Bluetooth technology adoption is
expected to be widespread throughout the computer and
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
With the technology, they said, users will be alerted to, and
can respond to, incoming e-mail via their mobile phone, even while
their mobile PC remains in its carrying case. When the PC receives
an e-mail message, an alert will sound on the mobile phone. It is
then possible to browse incoming e-mails immediately, reading the
contents on the display of the mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
Users will also be able to access the Internet via a completely
wireless connection. They could send an "instant postcard" by
cordlessly connecting a camera to a mobile phone or any wire-bound
connection. They also could add comments to their snapshots using
a mobile phone or mobile PC, and send them instantly to recipients
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The first products using the wireless port are expected by the
second half of 1999.

<P>
DHAKA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A hot and humid weather has been
hitting Bangladesh these days, making many people here suffer
headstroke.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka, capital of this South Asian country, experienced the
hottest and most humid day Thursday with the temperature soaring
to 37.5 degree Celsius, the highest in May in 28 years, press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mercury on Thursday hit season's new high, 41.8 degree
Celsius, recorded at Rajshahi district, 204 km northwest of here,
and it might climb a bit further, according to experts here.
</P>
<P>
Two laborers died of sunstroke and 18 others fell sick in the
northwest district of Pabna in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
"The temperature could rise by 1-2 degrees until rain comes in
a few days," a senior meteorologist was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The hot weather was due to a "heat low" in Bangladesh and
adjoining West Bengal of India and "above normal" humidity, he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of the country was already having pre-monsoon
rain and the whole country was expected to have it within the next
three to four days, he added.

</P>
<P>
The two giants alliance could win the green light if the United

</P>
<P>
The final decision should be made by the Transportation
Department to decide whether to approve an arrangement allowing
American and British Airways to coordinate their passenger and
cargo activities between the United States and Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- World Health Organization Regional
Director for the Western Pacific S.T. Han on Friday called on
member governments to re-double their efforts in countering
growing tobacco consumption in the region.
</P>
<P>
Han's appeal was contained in a press release issued by the
Manila-based WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific nine days
before the World No-Tobacco day.
</P>
<P>
Han emphasized that "comprehensive national policies and
programs on tobacco control need to be further strengthened and
strictly implemented to counter the tobacco industry's current
forecast of a 33 percent growth in the cigarette market in Asia
between 1991 and 2000."
</P>
<P>
The Western Pacific Region, which is home to nearly one-third
of the world's population, now registers the highest tobacco sales
in the world.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ill-effects to health, smoking in the region
continues to rise, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Han warned that unless efforts against tobacco use are
re-doubled, the worldwide tobacco deaths estimated at 4 million in
1998 will increase to 10 million annually by 2030.
</P>
<P>
Han also called for regional solidarity in the campaign against
smoking through the development and implementation of
comprehensive policies to discourage tobacco use.

</P>
<P>
On the same day, a statement released by the Russian Defense
Ministry said Russian peacekeepers were stationed along the
borders to separate the sides. It called for political measures as
an acceptable way to prevent bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Vladimir Rakhmania said
Thursday that Russia would do its best to push for talks between
Shevardnadze and Abkhaz leader Vladislav Ardzinba. It hoped these
could help normalize the situation in the Gali region.
</P>
<P>
Abkhaz police and forces supporting Georgia have fired on each
other in the Gali region, which lies on the front line between
Abkhaz forces and the Georgian army, bringing about some deaths
and injuries.

MADRID, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
its relations with Spain and is ready to raise friendly ties to a
new level, Li Ruihuan, Chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Conference (CPPCC), said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Li

in the economic, trade, cultural, scientific and technological
fields since they forged diplomatic ties 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that China would uphold and enlarge
its policies of opening to the outside world and participate in
international cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He said China hoped that the developed countries and world
economic and trade organizations would open their door wider to
China, and give the fair treatment to China that it deserves.

<P>
Li said that the international community should quicken the
steps in building a new world economic order, which is fair,
reasonable, equal and mutually beneficial.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- After several hours of negotiations,
the authorities in the Russian Caucasus republic of Dagestan
Thursday reached a deal with gunmen loyal to a Moslem leader,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The authorities promised not to prosecute the gunmen, who
seized the main government building in the capital Makhachkala
early Thursday. One policeman died and several others were injured
in earlier clashes.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen had withdrawn from the government building and Lenin
Square was under police control.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen were supporters of Nadirshah Khachilayev, head of
the Russian Union of Moslems and a deputy in the Russian Duma
(lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin moved quickly to try to defuse the crisis.
President Boris Yeltsin set up an emergency headquarters and
recalled Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin from Strasbourg to
Moscow to take command.
</P>
<P>
Dagestan, a mainly Moslem republic, lies between Chechnya and
the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The republic of two million people is strategically important
for Russia. Makhachkala is Russia's only year-round, ice-free port
on the Caspian, and a vital transit point for road and rail
traffic and oil exports going north from Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Rebutts Accusation on Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior State Department
official rebutted here Thursday the accusation that the Clinton
Administration had allowed sensitive technology transfer to China,
defending the cooperation with China in satellite launch.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told a noon press briefing that the
charges were based on "incorrect information." He hoped the fact
would turn out as it is before the American people some time.
</P>
<P>
"The whole underlying suggestion that somehow we want to
transfer technology to the Chinese, as a result of I don't know
what, is simply fatuous, and the more rational analysis...would
certainly help bring to the American people an understanding that
this process does not transfer technology by design," he said.
</P>
<P>
Critics in Republican-dominant Congress put their fingers at
President Bill Clinton for allowing two American companies to
launch commercial satellites atop Chinese rockets. The House of
Representatives and Senate have both set up panels to look into
the allegations that missile guidance technology was leaked to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The companies, the Hughes Electronics Corporation and Loral,
have both denied any wrongdoing, while the Administration asserts
foolproof has been in place to protect American technology.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to communicate to all of you is that for
three administrations in a row, we have been weighing the costs
and benefits of those risks and pursuing the exact same policy for
three administrations," Rubin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The denial and assertion have so far failed to convince the
congressmen who obviously wanted to make it a big issue before
President Clinton goes to visit China in June. The House of
Representatives voted Wednesday to curb satellite and
high-technology exports to China. The Senate was also expected to
vote over the legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely disappointed by this vote in the House of
Representatives. If passed in the Senate, this legislation will
threaten American leadership in the commercial satellite business,
and therefore, threaten an area where America has a competitive
advantage," the spokesman warned.
</P>
<P>
According to The Wall Street Journal Thursday, the harsh
measures, if applied, will cost U.S. aerospace companies hundreds
of million dollars and open a window for foreign corporations to
jump ahead in the competition to provide global-communications
services.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the anxiety, Rubin said that the misfunctioning of a
communications satellite in the last two days have made the people
understand better why it is important for the Chinese to launch
American satellites.
</P>
<P>
"As everyone saw so graphically yesterday, the absence of
sufficient satellite capacity and the absence of backup satellites
and material effect on not only the lives of Americans but our
competitive advantage in this area," he said, with a reference to
the vast breakdown of communications since Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. government
projections are that satellite makers' demand will outstrip
commercial launches for the next 10 years. Last year, Chinese,
French, U.S. and Russian rockets sent 35 commercial satellites
aloft. But as many as 350 satellites could be vying for space on
launch vehicles in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"If they (American satellites) can't get off into space, we are
worse off. There is a risk in not letting them do that," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied any linkage between the government's policy
and fund-raising drive in the 1996 presidential election
campaign. There was allegations that the Loral chief executive
officer donated a lot of money to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"Well, you're inventing a linkage that is simply no evidence
for it," Rubin replied to a question asked at the press briefing.

KIEV, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A pan-European security system should
be established on the basis of the existing security organizations
in the region, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma told the

military reforms, and the training of military officers.
</P>
<P>
He believed Ukraine was also strengthening its security
and making significant contributions to the consolidation of
regional stability while cooperating with NATO.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation, he stressed, was not aimed against other
countries and Russia's geo-political interests were also taken
into account.
</P>
<P>
The president emphasized that neither NATO nor Ukraine had ever
raised the issue of Ukraine joining the alliance.
</P>

Kuchma made the address before meeting Suleyman Dimirel,
president of Turkey, a NATO member, who arrived here Thursday on a

<HEADLINE> Italian Museums Call for Tighter Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Museums and galleries in Italy must
apply sophisticated security equipment to fend off thieves, a
museum director said Thursday after three famous paintings were
stolen and six 17th Century paintings were damaged.
</P>
<P>
"If art becomes a question of mass interest, then security
systems need to be adapted," said Renato Nicolini, a respected
architect and director of Rome's Palazzo delle Esposizioni
said. "We need to use technology, not just guards."
</P>
<P>
Italy's artistic heritage has suffered two major blows in the
last two days.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday night, two Van Goghs and a Cezanne were stolen by
armed thieves from the capital's National Modern Art Gallery.
</P>
<P>
The next day six minor 17 Century paintings on display at the
Palazzo Venezia gallery were found to have small holes in them,
ranging from the size of a pinprick to the diameter of a drinking
straw. It resembled an act of vandalism in January, when three
paintings by Matisse on display at the Capitoline Museums were
punctured by pencil tips.
</P>
<P>
"We need to abandon our old-fashioned concepts of
security. What we need are security cameras, sophisticated
electronic surveillance systems, alarms and closed-circuit
televisions," said Nicolini. "An advanced network which will leave
a thief feeling like he's in a complicated Chinese box game from
which there is no escape."
</P>
<P>
He also questioned the recent decision of Deputy Premier and
Minister of Culture Walter Veltroni, who ordered a large number of
Italian museums to extend opening hours until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, I support the initiative because it is great for
art, but it is a decision which carries risks. It's obvious that
closing at 4 p.m. isn't as dangerous as closing at 10 p.m.," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Grows in Hunan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Investment from overseas grew in
central-south China's Hunan Province during the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that Hunan, which is a major haven for
overseas funding in central and western China, has, during the
three-month period, approved 79 projects involving direct overseas
investment in the first quarter, a year-on-year rise of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contracts were signed on the use of over 200 million
US dollar of direct overseas investment, a jump of 46 percent over
the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Also in the first quarter, the exports by the Sino-overseas
joint ventures and solely-overseas-funded firms amounted to 82.51
million US dollars, an increase of 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the amount of previously pledged overseas investment
put into place in the first quarter dropped by 19 percent to stand
at 134 million US dollars. The decline was caused mainly by delays
from southeast Asian countries, Japan and the Republic of Korea
(ROK), provincial officials said.
</P>
<P>
Provincial experts called for enhanced efforts to guarantee the
inflow of overseas investment in the second quarter, which is
regarded as a peak season for the arrival of foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Auctions Popular At Shanghai Universities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai auctioneer sold a sheet
of souvenir "Hong Kong Returns to the Motherland" stamps for 100
yuan at a recent university auction held by Shanghai Finance and
Economics University, Fudan University, Tongji University, and
Shanghai Institute of Physical Culture.
</P>
<P>
Most of the auctioned items, like stamps, coins, toys, and
footballs with some local star's signature on them, came from
students who are close to graduation, the organizers say.
</P>
<P>
Half the proceeds of the auction will go to Project Hope,
China's largest program to aid poor pupils.
</P>
<P>
Many of Shanghai's university students are familiar with
auctions and some have invited well-known auctioneers to give
lectures. Shanghai's universities have organized other similar
activities like moot courts, and Shanghai University and Fudan
University have their own mini-stock exchange where students can
experiment with stock trading for as little as ten yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The auction has become a common thing in modern times, so it's
not unusual that university students know about it," says Lin
Yiping, the general manager of the Shanghai Auction House.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican FM Worried by FTAA Slowness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Roberto Rojas expressed his concern Thursday about the pace of
negotiations on the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA).
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four countries of the American continent took part in
negotiations for the creation of the biggest free trade area in
the world before the year 2005. The talks began at a regional
summit in Santiago, Chile, in April.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has tried to advance more rapidly in the reduction
of tariffs and in the signing of bilateral free trade agreements.
It has an agreement with Mexico, in force since 1994, and expects
to sign another with Chile, with whom it has already signed a
framework agreement, said Rojas.
</P>
<P>
"The FTAA process goes too slowly," said Rojas. "We see
resistance from the United States and Mercosur (the Southern
Common Market made up by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay)
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said some major U.S. sectors have criticized the results of
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) signed by the
United States, Canada and Mexico. This made it more difficult to
gain support from the United States for the negotiation of the
FTAA.
</P>
<P>
In the same way, Mercosur seems more interested in
consolidating its own integration and was not willing to sacrifice
it for the FTAA, Rojas added.
</P>
<P>
"Our perception is that the FTAA will advance very slowly, and
for this we want to advance by our own account as fast as we can,"
said the Costa Rican foreign minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Shopping marts in Beijing are
carrying out safety checks on their escalators, following a
series of accidents in which two boys died and a girl was
seriously injured, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Labor Bureau has asked enterprises and shops to follow
strictly the guidelines on self-checking for escalator safety
issued by the former Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
They cover the safety of the escalators themselves and safety
requirements at entrances and exits.
</P>
<P>
Escalators with severe safety problems must be shut down until
they are required, the labor bureau said.
</P>
<P>
District labor bureaux are urged to carry out random
inspections on the self-checks. They should hand in the results
before June 10.
</P>
<P>
There have been three accidents since January at Xinxing Xidan
Shopping Centre in Majiapu Residential Area in Fengtai
District. Two three-year-old boys died after falling from the
junction between two flights of escalators and one girl was
severely injured when she was crushed by an escalator.
</P>
<P>
At present, Beijing has more than 2,000 escalators.

<HEADLINE> A friend In Need Is A Friend Indeed By Dong Xueqing and Liu Guangjun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Xingdi Electronics Co. Ltd., a
Korean electronics company in the city of Weihai in China's
Shandong Province, has been through some hard times in recent
months, because of the Asian financial crisis that has not spared
the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Employees had asked that their salaries be cut, in order to
deal with the situation, and made other cost cutting
proposals. These measures proved successful and orders continued
to arrive, and, as a result, the company's output was up 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
But, Xingdi was just one of many ROK-backed companies in this
province that survived the financial turmoil because of the moral
and financial assistance of local Chinese governments and people.
</P>
<P>
After being told these stories, Yong Youn Seok, the head of the
Commercial Section of the ROK Embassy in Beijing, commented
simply, "A friend in need is a friend indeed," but went on to say,
"As early as the 7th century, Koreans began commercial adventures
in the Shandong Peninsula, beginning the now centuries-old trade
ties with China."
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, ROK investors have made the Shandong
Peninsula their first choice because of the geographical and
cultural proximity, and Shandong is now home to at least 2,500
ROK-funded firms, involving 3.78 billion US dollars worth of
ROK funds. ROK is the second largest investor in China, and a
third of that investment is in Shandong.
</P>
<P>
"China has benefited from ROK investors," says one Foreign
Economic and Trade Ministry official, "and ROK investment has
contributed remarkably to increased employment opportunities, the
GDP, taxes, and exports in the country."
</P>
<P>
Wu Guanzheng, secretary of the Shandong Provincial Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party, says that ROK-funded firms are
currently having great troubles, but also says that ROK
investors as "our friends", so the province needs to keep the
faith and help them keep profits up to get over the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the provincial government has had a campaign
to help ROK-funded firms with favorable tax, land-use, and
customs policies, and for water and power supplies. In Wendeng,
for example, government officials even donated money to save some
struggling Korean companies, and in other small cities,
ROK-funded companies have been advised by local governments to
use more local materials to keep costs down.
</P>
<P>
The province's Vice-Governor Du Shicheng, who is responsible
for foreign economic and trade affairs, urges local people to make
every effort to help ROK-funded companies get through these
troubled times and to consider the long-term interests of Sino-ROK
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We Koreans have always seen the Chinese as brothers, and vice
versa," says the Korean embassy's Yong, "and I greatly appreciate
what they have done to help the ROK-funded companies."

MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said on Thursday that NATO
should not take any military action unless it gets permission from
the United Nation's Security Council, or the Organization for

<P>
Vladimir Rakhmanin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign

Treaty Organization's military deployment in Albania appeared
possible.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's political crisis in Albania, NATO has sent a

Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
He said the border between Albania and Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province should be strictly closed to foil weapons smuggling and
the infiltration of militiamen.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, an economic
powerhouse in China, has changed the practice of building
artificial scenic spots, and has turned to developing unique local
tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Marine Museum and the Hongkong Wildlife World are
its latest brainchildren. The former is reportedly the world's
largest inland marine museum, while the latter is the largest
of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Business Tourist Walking Street is cited as
another example. It almost cost nothing to build, as it is in the
downtown area. However, the street is attracting an increasing number
of visitors, not only from abroad but also local urbanites.
</P>
<P>
Bicycle-based tourism, agricultural sightseeing along the Pearl
River Delta area, expedition tours, and expeditions specially
arranged for women are becoming increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
The province made a hit in the 1980s when a miniature park,
called the Window of the World, was completed in Shenzhen. Other
places followed suit. As a result, huge amounts of money were
spent on artificial scenic spots, but didn't yield expected
returns.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Water Consumption In Mid-21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 22 (Xinhua) -- China's annual water consumption
midway through the 21st century is expected to be 700 billion
cubic meters, compared with 500 billion cu.m. now.
</P>
<P>
Water consumption will continue to grow along with economic
development, according to Liu Changming, of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, who was recently here for an international symposium on
water resources and management.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that people's ideas about the sustained development of
water resources are changing and conservation technology is
improving so China can slow the increase in water consumption
without retarding economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States, and many European countries have
managed to get water consumption growth down to zero. The United
States consumes 500 billion cubic meters of water annually, but
its GDP is ten times that of China.
</P>
<P>
Many water conservancy projects like the Three Gorges on the
Yangtze River and the Xiaolangdi on the Yellow River are under
construction, while the Chinese government is tightening water
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
Liu says that water consumption is decreasing in some cities
and he believes that zero growth can be realized in China in 20 to
50 years. Water for agricultural use now accounts for 80 percent
of the country's total, and industrial and urban consumption, the
rest.
</P>
<P>
Liu adds that controlling pollution, recycling waste water,
saving water resources, and setting a reasonable price for water
are the keys to decreasing water consumption.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Rebels Cancel Peace Talks With Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) has canceled peace talks with the Philippine
government scheduled for this weekend, the local television
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The MILF rebels said they prefer to negotiate with the incoming
administration which will assume office on June 30 this year,
Southern Command chief Maj. Gen. Joselin Nazareno was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the MILF and the government have reached an
agreement to shelve the scheduled talks to be held in Marawi City,
capital of Lanao del Sur in the southern Philippines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to resume contacts only after June 30
when President Fidel Ramos steps down and transfers power to his
successor elected in the May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
The MILF leadership has expressed concern over the apparent
winning presidential candidate Vice President Joseph Estrada, whom
they said could renegade on any accord signed before his
assumption of power, according to Nazareno.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF, which has fought for a separate Islamic
state for more than two decades, is currently the largest
anti-government force in the country.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF) which had already signed a peace treaty
with the government in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began low-level exploratory peace
talks in January 1997, but have so far failed to agree on the
agenda and the timetable for formal peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Daba Mountains of
southwest China's Chongqing Municipality have considerably
improved their life by moving elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
In Chengkou County, for example, some 700 households of more
than 3,000 people, who used to live in mountain areas with an
elevation of over 1,500 meters, have come down and resettled along
roadsides and river valley areas.
</P>
<P>
Newly-erected buildings and cement highways are posing a
striking contrast with thatched sheds and rugged roads in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
The county government started the resettlement project in 1996,
ruling that resettled farmers can do breeding and other business,
and at the same time manage their farmland and forests in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Yuan Shenglin in Beiping Township has repaid the loans
for his new house by opening a barber's shop and farming on
contracted land.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that almost every resettled family now earns
more than 5,000 yuan on average. And mom and pop shops, catering
and entertainment services in newly emerging small towns are
contributing increasingly to the local economy.

<P>
BEIJING, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has launched all-round
preparations against this year's floods to protect the safety of
the Chinese capital, according to a deputy mayor of the city.
</P>
<P>
Yue Fuhong said that flood-control headquarters at the
municipal and county levels have been established, and the work in
this regard has been set as a criterion for judging the
performance of government officials.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is located in the northern part of the North China
Plain, a place vulnerable to natural disasters such as floods and
drought.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the city was hit by natural
disasters 794 times during the 580 years before 1949, 387 times by
floods.
</P>
<P>
The 680-km Yongding River is the major source of floods which
threaten Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Water Resources warned that
Beijing should make better preparations against serious floods
this year, due to reports of unusual meteorological conditions
recently.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has learned that since this spring, Beijing's investment
in water conservation has increased by 26 percent, with over 20
projects including dredging of rivers, improving the safety of

<HEADLINE> Philippines Posts Current Account Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a current
account surplus of 68 million U.S. dollars for the first two
months of the year, a big improvement from the 45-million dollar
deficit during the same period last year, the Philippine newspaper
Malaya reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying
Thursday the surplus was due to the narrowing trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the current account surplus resulted in a
higher balance of payments surplus of 482 million dollars in the
first two months of this year from the year-ago level of 370
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Singson also expected the country to end the year with a
current account surplus after suffering over a decade of yearly
deficits.
</P>
<P>
Current account is made up of visible trade such as merchandise
exports and imports, and invisible trade referring to the income
and expenditure for banking, insurance, tourism and shipping
services together with profits earned overseas and interest
payments.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the current account surplus would further
boost investors' confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign fund managers always look at you CA (current
account) position rather than the balance of payments since it
(CA) is not dependent on capital inflows," he said.

BRUSSELS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Olympic gold medalists and hosts
the Netherlands opened its bid to add the world trophy to its
credit as well on Thursday at the 1998 World Cup Field Hockey
Tournament, beating Canada 3-1 in Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch side, runners-up at the last cup outing in Sydney
four years ago, did not hesitate in demonstrating its ambition in
the game that it dominated with deft dribbling and passing.
</P>
<P>
Only scoring needed polish to secure a better placing of the
round-robin group tourney that already avoided the hosts early
clashes with either World Cup holders Pakistan or Olympic silver
medalists Spain and bronze medalists Australia.
</P>
<P>
Germany and India, fourth and fifth at the Sydney World Cup,
were pooled with the Netherlands in group A.
</P>
<P>
In the other men's group, both Australia and Pakistan won
handsomely, trouncing Poland 8-0 and routing Malaysia 7-2
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Like its opener a day earlier, the Dutch women had to come from
behind to win its Thursday's game against England.
</P>
<P>
The English women, who beat India in the previous rounder,
first led 1-0. But the host team would not let go the home
advantage and plowed ferotiously back by scoring two of their
three goals deep into the second half of the 70-minute game.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch women now lead group B on more goals scored, followed
by Argentina. The clash between the two teams slated for next
Wednesday is likely to turn out the decider for the top place of
the six-team group preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
Group winner takes up the second-place finisher of the other
group in the sudden-death semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Olympic runners-up South Korea pulled back one game by
squeezing past New Zealand five goals to four in women's action.
The South Koreans went 2-1 down to Argentina on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> US Government Rebutts Accusation on Technology Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. State Department
official rebutted here Thursday the accusation that the Clinton
Administration had allowed sensitive technology transfer to China,
defending the cooperation with that Asian country in satellite
launch.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin told a noon press briefing that the
charges were based on "incorrect information." He hoped the fact
would turn out as it is before the American people some time.
</P>
<P>
"The whole underlying suggestion that somehow we want to
transfer technology to the Chinese, as a result of I don't know
what, is simply fatuous, and the more rational analysis...would
certainly help bring to the American people an understanding that
this process does not transfer technology by design," he said.
</P>
<P>
Critics in Republican-dominant Congress put their fingers at
President Bill Clinton for allowing two American companies to
launch commercial satellites atop Chinese rockets. The House of
Representative and Senate have both set up panels to look into the
allegations that missile guidance technology was leaked to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The companies, the Hughes Electronics Corporation and Loral,
have both denied any wrongdoing, while the Administration asserts
foolproof has been in place to protect American technology.
</P>
<P>
"What we are trying to communicate to all of you is that for
three administrations in a row, we have been weighing the costs
and benefits of those risks and pursuing the exact same policy for
three administrations," Rubin stressed.
</P>
<P>
The denial and assertion have so far failed to convince the
congressmen who obviously wanted to make it a big issue before
President Clinton goes to visit China in June. The House of
Representatives voted Wednesday to curb satellite and
high-technology exports to China. The Senate was also expected to
vote over the legislation next month.
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely disappointed by this vote in the House of
representatives. If passed in the Senate, this legislation will
threaten American leadership in the commercial satellite business,
and therefore, threaten an area where America has a competitive
advantage," the spokesman warned.
</P>
<P>
According to The Wall Street Journal Thursday, the harsh
measures, if applied, will cost U.S. aerospace companies hundreds
of million dollars and open a window for foreign corporations to
jump ahead in the competition to provide global-communications
services.
</P>
<P>
Sharing the anxiety, Rubin said that the misfunctioning of a
communications satellite in the last two days have made the people
understand better why it is important for the Chinese to launch
American satellites.
</P>
<P>
"As everyone saw so graphically yesterday, the absence of
sufficient satellite capacity and the absence of backup satellites
and material effect on not only the lives of Americans but our
competitive advantage in this area," he said, with a reference to
the vast breakdown of communications since Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. government
projections are that satellite makers' demand will outstrip
commercial launches for the next 10 years. Last year, Chinese,
France, U.S. and Russian rockets sent 35 commercial satellites
aloft. But as many as 350 satellites could be vying for space on
launch vehicles in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
"If they (American satellites) can't get off into space, we are
worse off. There is a risk in not letting them do that," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, he denied any linkage between the government's policy
and fund-raising drive in the 1996 presidential election campaign.
There were allegations that the Loral chief executive officer
donated a lot of money to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
"Well, you're inventing a linkage that is simply no evidence
for it," Rubin replied to a question asked at the press briefing.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Failure Affects Life of Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of pagers
carried by Americans have been silent since Tuesday evening as a
major U.S. owned satellite suffered a computer failure and moved
out of position.
</P>
<P>
At least eight of the nation's 10 biggest paging companies
depend on the PanAmSat's Galaxy IV satellite were unable to supply
service to millions of hospitals, police departments and other
business and individual customers.
</P>
<P>
National Public Radio broadcasts and some small TV operations
were disrupted. Drivers at Chevron gas stations could not use
pumps at thousands of service stations.
</P>
<P>
Wireless telecommunications services of some major chain stores
were also down for hours.
</P>
<P>
PanAmSat, which is mainly owned by the Hughes Electronics Corp.
subsidiary of General Motors Corp., was trying hard to fix the
problem. But it was reported that it may take several days before
the nation's paging network is fully restored, and as long as a
week for a backup for broadcasting to be put in place.

<HEADLINE> Moldova's New Cabinet Validated by Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The parliament of Moldova
validated on Thursday the new cabinet led by Ion Ciubuc and it's
work program, reported the Messenger, the Moldovan National TV
Station.
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the deadline, according to the constitution, when
the premier designated had to ask a confidence vote to his team.
</P>
<P>
A compromise was reached regarding the cabinet formation,
between Ion Ciubuc and the "Alliance for democracy and reforms",
the governing coalition just a few hours before the voting.
Earlier, the Democratic Convention of Moldova threatened to vote
against any cabinet whose head ignores its proposals.
</P>
<P>
The principal problem on the constitution of the new cabinet
was the Ciubuc's insistence to maintain Nicolae Cernomaz as
minister of state and Mihai Plamadeala as minister of interior. At
last, Nicolae Cernomaz remained in the cabinet, while Mihai
Plamadeala had to leave.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet pledged that the stability of the national
currency (lei) exchange rate in relation to the U.S. dollar will
be maintained and that the inflation by 2001 will not exceed 8
percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell broadly here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.78 yen,
down from 135.98 late Wednesday. The dollar also was changing
hands at 1.7558 German marks, down from 1.7698.
</P>
<P>
The dollar had benefited from a flow of funds into the United
States as economic and political unrest in Indonesia spelled more
international investors to change their money into the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Japan's currency suffered because of
its economic ties to Indonesia. On Tuesday, the dollar rose to
136.44 yen, its highest level against the Japanese currency since
August 1991.
</P>
<P>
The resignation Thursday of President Suharto of Indonesia
prompted investors to buy yen, and raise cash for doing so by
selling dollars,
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4618 Swiss francs, down from 1.4758; 5.8860 French
francs, down from 5.9340; 1,732.05 Italian lire, down from

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM Urges Public to Follow Govt's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi urged Thursday the Ethiopian people to adhere to and
implement the decisions of the government on the sovereignty of
the country.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference to Ethiopian journalists in connection
with Ethio-Eritrean border disputes, Meles said peace is "our
priority" to which end the government is striving but it will be
obliged to defend the nation's sovereignty if peace efforts are
in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Meles as saying that the
government is doing everything in its capacity to integrate and
uphold these two principles to resolve the disputes with Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ethiopia is ready to go to any length in defusing
disputes in peace but will never bow to impositions by the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
Meles said that Ethiopia is committed to the promotion of
peace because its priority is development, alleviation of poverty
and backwardness and he stressed the determination of the
government to fully exploit the valueless peaceful times to this
end.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean government has committed a grave historical
blunder in resorting to the use of force to resolve the dispute,
Meles said, adding that unless the use of force as a means to
resolve territorial claims is totally abandoned, it will gravely
endanger the peace in the sub-region.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Conditions for Resuming IMF Aid to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States will see
whether proper conditions are created in Indonesia for Washington
to support a resumption of disbursements to Indonesia under a 43
billion U.S. dollars International Monetary Fund rescue package,
The State Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, told reporters
that the United States wants to see a series of principles to be
followed by Indonesia's new leader Jusuf Habibie before it could
consider the possibility of resumption of IMF aid to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Habibie sworn in as Indonesia's president on Thursday after
Suharto announced his decision to resign on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said three principles -- inclusiveness, dialogue and
democracy -- should be followed in the post-Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the United
States would consult with other countries about whether the
International Monetary Fund should renew the rescue package to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A senior IMF official said on Wednesday before Suharto
decided to resign that it was suspending disbursements to
Indonesia and may have to drastically overhaul the program.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, first deputy IMF managing director,
confirmed that civil unrest will delay the previously planned
disbursement of 1 billion U.S. dollars on June 4.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed that given the steep decline in the value of
the rupiah, Indonesia's currency, and its impact on economic
assumptions and targets in the IMF program, it is very likely
the terms will have to be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Thursday a
resumption of IMF ties with Indonesia depended on Indonesia's
willingness to pursue economic and political reforms.

<HEADLINE> Two Bodies Found at Student Shooter's Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two people were found dead in
the home of the student who opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle
in an Oregon high school that killed at least one person and
wounded 24 others on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two bodies of a man and a women were found by police an
hour and a half after the shooting by a boy who was expelled a day
earlier for trying to bring a gun to school. But the relationship
of the victims were unknown.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old student, dressed in a cream-colored trench
coat, started the shooting just before 8:00 a.m. in a cafeteria at
Thurston High School in Springfield, Oregon. He run through the
cafeteria, where up to 400 people were gathered, firing his rifle
from the hip. Among the wounded, seven were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
A wrestling student, despite being shot himself, tackled the
shooter, got the gun away from him and held him down. The suspect
was arrested about 20 minutes after the shooting broke out.
</P>
<P>
Students in the school said that the shooter had always said
that it would be fun to kill someone. One day before the shooting,
he told a couple of people that he was probably going to do
something stupid Thursday and get back at the people who had
expelled him.
</P>
<P>
The school of 1,350 students was shut down immediately after
the shooting and parents, many of them weeping and screaming,
waited outside. A school official read the names of students who
were injured.
</P>
<P>
Learning the event, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed the
nation's sympathy to the victims and their families.
</P>
<P>
"I know that all Americans are heartbroken," Clinton said
during a Rose Garden ceremony on NATO expansion. "Our thoughts and
prayers are with the families of the people who were killed and
wounded, and with that entire fine community."
</P>
<P>
The president also called the school's principal to express
personal condolences, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
It was the latest in a series of school shootings across the
country. On the same day, a 15-year-old boy carrying a gun got on
his school bus in Onalaska, Washington, took his girl friend off
and then went to his home and shot himself in the head as her
father tried to break down the door.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a high school student shot and killed a student in
a school parking lot in Fayetteville Tennessee, three days before
they were to graduate, apparently because they had argued about a
girl.
</P>
<P>
On April 24, a 14-year-old boy opened fire at an eighth-grade
graduation dance in Edinboro, Pennsylvania, killing a teacher and
wounding two students and another teacher.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, an 11-year-old boy and his 13-year-old friend
opened fire on classmates in Jonesboro, Arkansas, killing four
pupils and a teacher and wounded 10 others.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, a 16-year-old student in Pearl, Mississippi,
killed his mother, then went to school and shot nine students. Two
of them died.
