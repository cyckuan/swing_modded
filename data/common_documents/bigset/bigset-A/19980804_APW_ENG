Roman Catholic priest killed by Haiti gunmen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Gunmen shot and killed a Roman
Catholic priest active in organizing Haiti's peasants, state TV
said.
	   The Rev. Jean Pierre-Louis was accosted by two gunmen as he got
out of his car in his office courtyard around late Monday morning,
a street vendor who said he witnessed the slaying told the station.
	   Haitian Human Rights Platform director Chenet Jean-Baptiste said
he believed it was a political killing, and noted Pierre-Louis was
not robbed. The identity of the gunmen was not known.
	   Once a follower of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
Pierre-Louis distanced himself from Aristide heirs who have
governed Haiti since 1996.
	   Persecuted by anti-democratic soldiers and thugs during past
dictatorships, Pierre-Louis had often been forced to go into
hiding. He was recently active in organizing peasant associations,
among other causes.

 &UR; Eds: ADDS details on kidnapped senator to Colombia item. &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Leftist rebels have suspended peace
talks with civic leaders and confirmed that they abducted a ruling
party senator.
	   Jailed representatives of the 5,000-member National Liberation
Army, or ELN, had planned to meet Monday with business and civic
leaders in a prison near Medellin, the country's second largest
city.
	   The contacts were supposed to help pave the way for direct
negotiations with President-elect Andres Pastrana, who takes office
August 7.
	   The decision to suspend the talks follows a weekend of rebel
attacks_ including the abduction Saturday of Sen. Carlos Espinoza _
that left eight dead and raised doubts about the guerrillas' desire
for peace.
	   The ELN pledged last month to scale back kidnappings and attacks
on civilian installations as a gesture to improve the climate for
peace.
	   Violence between rebels, the army and rightist paramilitary
groups has forced hundreds of thousands of Colombians to flee their
homes.
	   In the latest such incident, several thousand peasants have fled
to the oil-refining city of Barrancabermeja, some 165 miles (265
kilometers) northeast of Bogota.
	   In a statement broadcast by radio Monday, an ELN spokesman said
the group would free Espinoza providing the Senate appoints a
commission to meet with the refugees in Barrancabermeja and that an
international committee is created to verify that any promises to
the refugees are kept.
	   In a separate statement Monday the rebels said they would not
resume talks with a civilian peace commission until the civic
leaders explain a July 26 agreement with paramilitary groups.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A local police association has called for the
resignation of the city's top cop, arguing he is incapable of
curbing crime or police corruption, newspapers reported Monday.
	   The National Coordinator of Security Workers also urged
lawmakers to revise labor laws to allow creation of a formal police
union that could help win pensions and other benefits, steps it
said would fight the ranks' reputation for corruption.
	   The association, representing 150,000 police and security
guards, called on city police Capt. Rodolfo Debernardi to step down
over a recent scandal in which police officers allegedly kidnapped
three teen-age girls and raped two of them.
	   Association leaders said Sunday the case shows that Debernardi
has no control over his officers.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Roman Catholic archbishop of Oaxaca state
says he spoke with leftist rebels on two occasions but stressed the
church has no intention of acting as a mediator between the group
and the government, newspapers reported Monday.
	   Archbishop Hector Gonzalez Martinez said Sunday he met members
of the Popular Revolutionary Army during religious services _ the
first time a Catholic church official has acknowledged doing so,
the daily Reforma said.
	   He did not specify when the meetings took place.
	   The rebels, known by their Spanish initials EPR, rose up in
neighboring Guerrero state in 1996 on the anniversary of a massacre
of 17 peasants by state police. The group has demanded sweeping
political reforms.
	   Gonzalez, who said neither he nor the church is looking to
mediate in the conflict, said he urged the rebels to revise their
political tactics and objectives and adopt a ``more civil''
approach to their goals.
	   ___
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ A farm laborer has been found shot to
death in a region of Guerrero state where political tensions have
been high.
	   Relatives of the slain man, Juan Mejia Hernandez, 44, said they
could not explain his death since he was not involved with any
political party.
	   A family member found Mejia's body Sunday in a corn field in
Aguas Blancas, a community 16 miles (25 kilometers) northwest of
Acapulco where state police massacred 17 men in 1995. The next
year, a rebel group surfaced in the area demanding political
reform.
	   Since then there have been periodic clashes between troops and
suspected rebels or rebel supporters.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A passenger bus flipped on a mountain road in
the southern state of Oaxaca, killing four passengers and injuring
nine, local authorities reported Monday.
	   The four died at the scene of the wreck, which occurred late
Sunday in the township of Juquila Mixe, Oaxaca, about 60 miles (100
kilometers) east of Oaxaca City, the state government said in a
press statement.
	   The state government did not provide information on the
condition of the injured.
	   The bus driver, who was among the injured, was blamed for poor
driving in the accident, the government news agency Notimex
reported.

Critics drive Costa Rican homosexual festival into secrecy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Organizers of a homosexual festival
have taken the once-overt event into secrecy after criticism by
President Miguel Angel Rodriguez and a Roman Catholic archbishop.
	   Organizers of the Costa Rican Lesbi-Gay Festival 98 announced
Monday they would change the site of the Aug. 26-31 event and halt
publicity.
	   ``We don't want the country to be known for activities of this
sort, but for peace, protection of nature and respect for human
rights,'' Rodriguez had told reporters.
	   The archbishop of San Jose, Roman Arrieta, said he was in
``total disagreement'' with the festival, which he said was
``contrary to the healthy customs of the Costa Rican people.''
	   The festival had been planned for the beach of Quepos, 35 miles
(56 kilometers) south of the capital.

France's Testud takes first day of competition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late match in new 5th graf; edits throughout. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ Amateur Alexandra Stevenson was on
the brink of her biggest victory yet, only to lose concentration
and with it a potential upset Monday in the Toshiba Tennis Classic.
	   France's Sandrine Testud, ranked 13th in the world, was down a
set and trailed 2-1 in the second set before winning the final 11
games for a 4-6, 6-2, 6-0 victory on the opening day of the dlrs
450,000 event at the La Costa Resort and Spa.
	   Testud's comeback highlighted play on the first day of action in
the tournament featuring seven of the top 10 players on the WTA
tour.
	   None of the seeded players, including No. 1 seed Martina Hingis,
played on Monday.
	   In other matches Monday, Mary Pierce of France, ranked No. 16 on
the WTA tour, beat Barbara Paulus of Austria 6-3, 7-5; Iva Majoli
of Croatia, ranked 20th, was extended in a 7-6, (7-1), 6-3 victory
over Alexandra Fusai of France; and former teen sensation Jennifer
Capriati won her third qualifying match _ a 7-6, (7-5), 2-6, 6-1
victory against France's Nathalie Dechy _ to move into the main
draw.
	   Stevenson, who will be a high school senior in the fall, was
playing in only her eighth WTA event. But the 17-year-old had never
had the type of success she enjoyed Monday in taking a lead into
the second set against Testud.
	   Stevenson envisioned an upset that would improve her current
world ranking of No. 151.
	   ``I kept telling myself to stay focused,'' said Stevenson, who
has a 1-9 record on the WTA tour. ``I didn't think I played badly
but I got unfocused and made some errors.''
	   For Capriati, 22, the victory was another in her attempted
comeback from problems encountered as a teen tennis phenom.
	   Capriati has been an infrequent player since taking two years
off from the tour in 1994.
	   ``It's a humbling experience,'' Capriati said about having to
qualify for a tournament that she won in 1991 and 1992. ``But it
makes me more determined also.''

French technology chosen for Australian link
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A consortium using the
French-designed TGV high-speed train technology has been chosen to
link Sydney and the national capital Canberra, Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday.
	   The Speedrail consortium, a 50-50 venture between GEC Alsthom of
France and Leighton Contractors of Australia, was chosen over a
German rival using magnetic levitation technology.
	   Howard said the train, which would travel at speeds up to 320
kilometers an hour (198 mph), would make the 285-kilometer
(180-mile) journey in 81 minutes.
	   ``Based on current information, fast trains will operate between
Sydney and Canberra by the end of 2003, with billions of dollars
injected into the regional economy in the interim,'' Howard said.
	   The project is expected to cost U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion (3.5
billion Australian dollars).
	   Speedrail will build, run and operate the link for 30 years. It
will then be transferred to public ownership.
	   The consortium was asked to supply technology that could later
extend links to Australia's second-biggest city, Melbourne and the
Queensland capital, Brisbane.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with late games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Danny Darwin won for the first time in nine
starts since June 8 and Barry Bonds drove in two runs as the San
Francisco Giants beat the Philadelphia Phillies 6-1 Monday to
complete a four-game sweep.
	   Darwin (7-9), who had lost six consecutive decisions, allowed
four hits in five shutout innings, striking out three and walking
three.
	   Carlton Loewer (5-4) allowed three runs and seven hits in six
innings, struck out seven and walked one.
 &UR; Expos 6, Padres 1
	   In Montreal, Dustin Hermanson took a shutout into the ninth and
Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run, first-inning homer.
	   Hermanson (9-9) matched his season high with eight strikeouts
and walked four, allowing four hits in 8 2-3 innings. With two outs
in the ninth, Greg Myers hit an RBI single, and Steve Kline came in
for the final out.
	   Brian Boehringer (5-2), making his first start of the season,
allowed five runs _ four earned _ and six hits in four innings. He
was starting because Joey Hamilton was in San Diego with his wife
Angie, due to deliver their first child.
 &UR; Marlins 11, Astros 3 &QC; 
	   In Miami, struggling rookie Andy Larkin pitched 6 2-3 strong
innings and Gregg Zaun matched a career high with four RBIs to help
the Florida Marlins beat the Houston Astros 11-3 Monday night.
	   Florida's Craig Counsell was hit in the jaw by a pitch from C.J.
Nitkowski in the eighth inning. Counsell remained on his feet but
immediately left the game for treatment.
	   Nitkowski, who had hit the two previous batters to load the
bases, was taken out of the game after he hit Counsell. It was the
third time in the major leagues since 1900 that a pitcher had hit
three consecutive batters _ Dock Ellis of Pittsburgh did it in 1974
and Wilbur Wood of the Chicago White Sox did it in 1977.
	   Larkin (3-6) allowed five hits and three runs, lowering his ERA
from 7.97 to 7.58. He raised his batting average from .083 to .160
with singles in his first two at-bats.
 &UR; Rockies 7, Pirates 2 &QC; 
	   In Pittsburgh, Bobby Jones pitched eight strong innings and hit
a pair of RBI singles as the Colorado Rockies beat the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
	   Jeff Reed went 4-for-4 and drove in two runs and newly acquired
Darryl Hamilton also had two RBIs. The Rockies won for just the
third time in their last 14 road games.
	   Jones (5-4), making his first start in 11 days, gave up five
hits, walked two and struck out six.
	   The Rockies beat Jon Lieber (8-12) for the second time in six
days. The Pirates lost for the seventh time in eight games to fall
a season-low 12 games under .500.
 &UR; Dodgers 8, Mets 5 &QC; 
	   In New York, Hideo Nomo and Mike Piazza came up big against
their former team, leaving the Mets in position for an emotional
win. Raul Mondesi and Eric Karros changed that real fast.
	   Mondesi's second homer of the game tied the score in the
seventh, and Karros hit a tiebreaking two-run shot later in the
inning to lift the Los Angeles Dodgers over the New York Mets.
	   Nomo, 3-1 for the Mets following a 2-7 start for Los Angeles,
left with a 5-2 lead in the seventh but was undone when shortstop
Rey Ordonez threw Eric Young's easy one-out, double-play grounder
into right field for an error.
	   Mark Grudzielanek followed with a sacrifice fly, and Mondesi
then connected off Greg McMichael (2-4). Gary Sheffield singled,
and Karros also homered off McMichael, who faced eight batters and
allowed five hits.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Cardinals 5
	   In Milwaukee, Steve Woodard won his career-high sixth straight
decision and the Milwaukee Brewers kept Mark McGwire in the
ballpark.
	   Since hitting his 45th home run against Milwaukee at Busch
Stadium last Tuesday, McGwire has gone 22 at-bats without homering.
He went 1-for-4 with a double, a line drive off the left-field wall
that fell about a foot short of the yellow home run rail.
	   Gary Gaetti's two-run homer with one out in the ninth off Bob
Wickman cut the Brewers' lead to 6-5. Wickman retired the next two
batters for his 18th save in 21 chances.
	   Woodard (9-5), who gave up three runs on five hits in six-plus
innings, gave up a two-run homer to Ron Gant in the second and a
solo shot to Ray Lankford _ who was later ejected _ in the fourth.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 6, Cubs 5 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Tony Batista, batting for injured Matt Williams,
connected for the first pinch-hit home run in team history as the
Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Chicago Cubs.
	   The Diamondbacks won for the fourth time in five games. Chicago,
leading the NL wild-card race, has lost three of five.
	   Williams was activated from the 15-day disabled list before the
game after being sidelined by a micro-stress fracture in his left
foot. But the third baseman was hit in the right hand by a pitch in
the third inning, and was replaced by Batista in the fifth.
	   Batista's two-run homer made it 5-0. It was the 161st pinch-hit
at-bat for the Diamondbacks. Williams was listed as day-to-day with
a bruised hand.

Family of murdered Taiwan politician agrees to autopsy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Relatives of a Taiwan politician killed by
kidnappers in China have agreed to an autopsy to help clarify the
circumstances of her death, the state-run Xinhua News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   Lin Ti-chuan's July 29 death in northeast Liaoning province,
apparently due to an overdose of drugs forced on her by the
kidnappers, has become the latest point of contention between the
rival governments in Taiwan and China.
	   The decision to conduct an autopsy was part of an agreement
reached Monday with Chinese authorities that will allow Lin's
family to take her body back to Taiwan, Xinhua reported.
	   Initially, Lin's political allies in Taiwan and her family
resisted having an autopsy performed, in keeping with the
traditional Chinese custom of keeping a body intact after death. It
was unclear why the family reportedly agreed to the autopsy.
	   Lin, a city councillor in the southern Taiwan city of Kaohsiung,
was kidnapped on July 27 together with her Taiwanese boyfriend,
allegedly because of a business dispute. Lin's boyfriend escaped
and reported the abduction to police, who launched a massive
manhunt that ended with the discovery of Lin's body at a hospital
in the Liaoning city of Haicheng last Thursday.
	   Taiwan officials have warned that mishandling of the case could
hinder efforts to improve ties with China, and that the killing is
likely to discourage Taiwan investment in the Chinese mainland.
	   Taiwan and China have been political rivals since the communist
takeover of the mainland in 1949. They are moving slowly to resume
a dialogue which was suspended in 1995. While China is pushing for
political talks on reunification, Taiwan wants negotiations on
practical matters, such as the safety of Taiwanese in China.
	   Taiwan officials have reported an alarming rise in crimes
against Taiwanese businessmen in China.
	   As of mid-April, the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation
had recorded 19 cases of violence against Taiwanese investors in
China this year, compared with 27 cases for all of 1997.
	   Those 19 cases included five murders, six disappearances, and
eight kidnappings. Most occurred in southern Guangdong province and
in coastal Fujian, where large numbers of migrants desperate for
work have resorted to crime, officials of the foundation said.

Traditional Maori tribes owners of fish assets, judge rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The High Court has ruled that
traditional Maori tribes, or ``iwi,'' are the owners of more than
U.S. dlrs 250 million of fisheries assets, snubbing claims by urban
Maori for a share in tribal fishing wealth.
	   The decision means that urban Maori groups, which claim to
represent one-third of the country's 520,000 Maori, have no claim
on the fishing assets granted to tribes as part of a settlement of
historic sea fisheries ownership.
	   The urban groups went to the High Court seeking control over
some of the fisheries assets, with Maori deeply divided over the
right of non-tribal Maori to claim ownership of part of the fishing
wealth.
	   But Justice Barry Paterson said Tuesday the right to determine
the distribution of the fisheries assets rested with ``iwi,'' which
he took to mean traditional tribes in the context of a 1992
settlement.
	   The meaning of the word ``iwi,'' or tribe, was central to the
case.
	   The judge said the tribes had a duty to ensure that any scheme
to allocate the assets included urban Maori who could claim iwi
links.
	   ``A fair settlement should benefit all Maori,'' he said in his
landmark ruling.
	   He added that the intent of the government in the fisheries
settlement was ultimately to benefit all Maori and there were
strong arguments why this should be so.
	   Paterson said urban Maori authorities were legal bodies which
stood in similar relationship to the people they served as did iwi
authorities to members of the iwi.
	   However, urban authorities did not have a tribal basis in the
sense that they did not have a genealogical, blood or kinship link.
	   The case is one of a number on how assets or funding should be
distributed among Maori.
	   Maori Affairs Minister Tau Henare said at least U.S. dlrs 10
million (dlrs NZ 20 million) should be set aside as a special fund
for the use of urban Maori groups.
	   Census figures show more than 112,000 Maori people either do not
know their iwi, or tribe, or for some reason choose not to
affiliate with it.
	   Manukau Urban Maori Authority spokesman Willie Jackson said he
was shocked by the ruling.
	   ``It's like the judge has ignored the modern-day reality,'' he
said. ``Urban Maori people have found their identity with groups
like us.''
	   Jackson said the authority would discuss the prospects of an
appeal with its lawyers, but it was not their first option.
	   `The best thing for us is to get together with the Waitangi
(Maori) Fisheries Commission and maybe negotiate something for all
Maori,'' he said.

Unemployed turn out in droves for chance at Bangkok market stalls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 8,000 poor and unemployed
Thais turned up at Bangkok's city hall to apply for about 600
stalls available at two city-run markets, local papers reported
Tuesday.
	   An advisor to the Bangkok governor said the demand was
overwhelming and that the city would try and open more markets to
accommodate people who wanted stalls, The Nation newspaper said.
	   Thailand's economy is in deep recession and more than two
million people have been left unemployed by the country's economic
crisis, which began in July 1997.

Knoblauch keys Yankees' 14-1 win over Athletics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   OAKLAND, California (AP) _ Mike Oquist became the first pitcher
to give up 14 earned runs in 22 years, and Chuck Knoblauch homered
twice and drove in a career-high five runs as the New York Yankees
overwhelmed Oakland 14-1 Monday night.
	   Oquist (6-9) set a franchise record for runs allowed and gave up
16 hits in five innings. With the Yankees and Athletics scheduled
to play a doubleheader Tuesday, Oakland saved its bullpen by
sacrificing Oquist, who lost his fourth straight decision.
	   Bill Travers was the last major leaguer to allow 14 earned runs,
according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He did it on Aug. 14, 1977,
in 7 2-3 innings of Milwaukee's loss to Cleveland.
	   Darryl Strawberry and Paul O'Neill also homered as the Yankees
tied their season high by connecting four times. Matt Stairs tied
an Athletics franchise record by homering in his fifth straight
game.
	   Orlando Hernandez (6-3) pitched a three-hitter and struck out
eight in his second complete game. New York won for the 10th time
in 13 games.
 &UR; Mariners 3, Red Sox 1
	   IN Seattle, rookie Shane Monahan's first major league homer, a
two-run shot in the seventh inning, gave Ken Cloude and the Seattle
Mariners a victory over the Boston Red Sox.
	   Monahan, playing in his 20th game with the Mariners, hit a line
drive over the right-field fence off John Wasdin (5-4) to break a
1-1 tie. Wasdin hit Jay Buhner with a pitch to open the inning.
	   Cloude (6-7) won his third straight decision. He gave up five
hits in eight innings. Mike Timlin pitched the ninth for his
seventh save.
 &UR; White Sox 6, Devil Rays 1
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, James Baldwin continued his
dominance over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, becoming the first
three-time winner over the expansion team in the Chicago White
Sox's victory.
	   Baldwin (7-4) outdueled rookie Rolando Arrojo (11-8) for the
second time in a week. The Chicago starter had a shutout until Fred
McGriff homered with one out in the ninth.
	   Baldwin allowed eight hits, struck out seven and walked one in 8
2-3 innings. In Baldwin's three victories over Tampa Bay, the Devil
Rays have scored only three runs in 21 1-3 innings and struck out
18 times.
 &UR; Angels 11, Indians 4
	   In Anaheim, California, Tim Salmon capped a five-run second
inning with a three-run homer and Randy Velarde went 3-for-5 and
scored twice as Anaheim beat Cleveland to snap a four-game losing
streak.
	   Velarde was recalled earlier in the day from the minors, where
he was on a rehabilitation assignment after straining his right
forearm. Velarde, who played in only one game last year because of
elbow problems, singled in the first inning for his first hit in
Anaheim since Sept. 25, 1996.
	   Steve Sparks (5-2) gave up three runs and seven hits in 5 1-3
innings. Jaret Wright (9-7) gave up seven runs and five hits in two
innings, the shortest outing of his two-year career.

<SLUG> Computer problem shuts down Japanese bank's ATM network </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese bank's nationwide automatic teller
machine network has been crippled by a computer system malfunction,
an Asahi Bank Ltd. spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The computer error, the cause of which remains unknown,
paralyzed Asahi Bank's ATM network shortly after 10:00 a.m. local
time (0100 GMT), said bank spokesman Masahiro Minami.
	   The spokesman said the bank sped efforts to fix the problem, but
he was unable to say when its hundreds of ATMs would be back in
service.
	   One of Japan's 10 largest commercial banks, Asahi Bank was
formed through the merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank in 1991.

	   The computer error, the cause of which remains unknown,
paralyzed Asahi Bank's ATM network shortly after 10:00 a.m. local
time (0100 GMT), said bank spokesman Masahiro Minami.
	   The spokesman said the bank sped efforts to fix the problem, but
he was unable to say when its hundreds of ATMs would be back in
service.
	   One of Japan's 10 largest commercial banks, Asahi Bank was
formed through the merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank in 1991.

Former Philippine President Corazon Aquino wins Magsaysay award

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, who helped topple strongman Ferdinand Marcos in 1986 and
inspired struggles against dictatorships worldwide, was named
winner Tuesday of the 1998 Ramon Magsaysay Award for International
Understanding.
	   The awards board cited Aquino for ``giving radiant moral force
to the nonviolent movement for democracy in the Philippines and in
the world.''
	   The award, named for the late Philippine President Ramon
Magsaysay, is considered the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize.
	   Aquino is the widow of Marcos' fiercest political rival, Sen.
Benigno Aquino, whose assassination on Aug. 21, 1983, as he
returned from U.S. exile triggered massive street protests that
culminated in a 1986 ``people power'' revolt that ended Marcos' two
decades of strongman rule.
	   The awards board said Aquino then emerged from the shadow of her
late husband to galvanize the fragmented opposition to Marcos.
	   She agreed to run against Marcos in a snap presidential election
in February 1986 but lost in the official count, which was widely
believed to be rigged.
	   Aquino called for civil disobedience to protest the election
outcome. Meanwhile, a group of military officers broke off from
Marcos in a series of events that led to his overthrow.
	   Aquino was swept to the presidency, inheriting an economy in
shambles and a country battered by years of dictatorship.
	   ``Step by step, she dismantled the machinery of dictatorship and
constructed the machinery of democracy: a free press and a new
constitution, then elections,'' the awards board said.
	   Noting that Aquino survived seven coup attempts, the board said
she could not satisfy all expectations of her government, but it
said she accomplished much in restoring the country's democratic
institutions.
	   When her term ended in 1992, Aquino traveled widely to share the
Philippines' non-violent struggle against authoritarianism.
	   Aquino's Magsaysay award is the fifth and last to be announced
this year. The awards board earlier named Phaly Nuon of Cambodia
the winner for community leadership, Thai banker Sophon Suphapong
for public service, Pakistani doctor Adibul Hasan Rizvk for
government service and Chinese Ying Ruocheng for journalism,
literature and creative communication arts.
	   The winners will be honored at the 40th presentation ceremonies
for the awards in Manila on Aug. 31, Magsaysay's birthday. The
popular Philippine president died in a plane crash in 1957.
	   The winners of the awards each receive a certificate, medallion
and dlrs 50,000.

Royals gather for Queen Mother's 98th birthday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the royal family were expected Tuesday
to gather around the Queen Mother Elizabeth, the nation's oldest
royal in history, to celebrate her 98th birthday.
	   Two world wars, the death of her husband, the disappointment of
failed marriages among younger royals, two hip replacements and a
cataract operation _ the mother of Queen Elizabeth II has endured
them all.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
and unsought sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They
ruled until George VI died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.
	   As the royal family accelerates its program of modernization in
the wake of the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash Aug.
31, the Queen Mother is actively engaged in the life of the nation
and remains for some Britons the favorite royal.
	   The queen, 72, was expected to lead tributes to her mother
Tuesday at a family lunch party at Clarence House, the Queen
Mother's London residence close to Buckingham Palace.
	   The celebrations were scheduled to include a band of the Welsh
Guards marching past her home playing ``Happy Birthday,'' a 41-gun
salute in Hyde Park and a 62-gun birthday salute at the Tower of
London. It was hoped the hugely popular Queen Mother would make an
appearance for well-wishers outside her home.
	   The tabloid Daily Mail marked the birthday of the woman they
called ``Britain's best loved grandmother'' with a double-page
spread of 98 photographs chronicling her life.
	   In wishing her a happy birthday, the tabloid Mirror newspaper
dubbed her the ``pearl in the crown.''
	   Great-grandchildren Prince William, 16, and 13-year-old Prince
Harry were expected to be with her, along with their father, Prince
Charles. The queen, her husband, Prince Philip and her sister,
Princess Margaret were also expected to be with her.
	   After the birthday celebrations, the Queen Mother was expected
to travel to the royal family's Balmoral estate in Scotland for the
family's traditional summer holiday.

Death toll in building collapse climbs to 14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS to UPDATE with higher death toll. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAMOLA TALWAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Firemen and volunteers scrabbled with their
bare hands Tuesday to search for survivors in the debris of a
collapsed building, discovering more bodies that boosted the death
toll to 14, police said.
	   Rescuers working though the night found 21 people alive in the
rubble of the building, which had been declared structurally
unsound earlier this year. Police feared as many as 15 people were
still trapped inside.
	   Cranes worked under floodlights to remove large chunks of
concrete to clear the way for rescuers to pull out victims. Workers
heard moans and cries for help from under the rubble.
	   The injured were taken to nearby hospitals.
	   The 20-year-old building crumpled with a loud thud Monday night.
Three of its seven stories had been added as a guest house without
authorization from city authorities.
	   Municipal officials said they had ordered residents to vacate
the building several months ago, reportedly after it was seen to be
leaning to one side. The warning was ignored.
	   ``We feared yesterday the toll could have been much higher ....
because of the guest house,'' said Sridhar Joshi, a top civic
official. Many rooms were unoccupied at the time of the collapse.

Philippine stocks plunge to lowest level in five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Tuesday, with the main index closing at its lowest level in more
than five years as confidence continued to be pounded by domestic
and regional economic concerns, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 31.63 points,
or 2 percent, to 1,511.44 _ its lowest close since it hit 1,480.30
on April 2, 1993. This followed a drop of 64.54 points Monday.
	   On Jan. 9 this year, the index hit an intraday low of 1,450, but
closed that day at 1,518.
	   Tuesday's lowest point was 1,496, but late buying reversed some
of the losses.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 8.69 points to 485.36,
following Monday's 17-point decline.
	   Losers trounced gainers 80 to 13, with 34 issues unchanged.
	   Ramon Lucas, a trader for Kim Eng Securities, said that while
there are concerns about the slowdown of the Philippine economy,
``the biggest concern remains the regional overhang.''
	   Market participants are anxiously watching to see how effective
the new government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi will be in
implementing pledges to rev up the Japanese economy.
	   A further slowdown in Japan's economy could trigger another
round of regional currency devaluations.
	   Compounding the regional concerns was the overnight decline of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which fell 96.55 points to
8,786.74, following a 143.66-point decline Friday.
	   ``Nothing new is happening; it's the same concern about regional
economies,'' said Helen Alvarez, research director for All Asia
Securities Corp.
	   In currency trading, the peso was slightly lower against the
U.S. dollar in heavy morning trading, weighed down by banks
maintaining their U.S. currency positions, traders said.
	   At late morning the dollar averaged 42.112 pesos, up marginally
from Monday's average of 42.082 pesos.
	   Unlike other Southeast Asian currencies, positive sentiment
resulting from the Japanese yen's rally against the dollar in
morning trading didn't buoy the peso.
	   Banks that were previously short on dollars were maintaining
their dollar positions to prevent being under their required
reserves of the currency, traders said.

Recount begins for some disputed areas in Cambodia election

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia moved a step closer Tuesday
to issuing complete results from last week's parliamentary
election, but a limited recount of some votes seemed unlikely to
satisfy opposition complaints of electoral fraud.
	   The official National Election Committee announced preliminary
final results for four more provinces Tuesday, leaving totals
pending for just three of the country's 23 electoral districts.
	   Co-Premier Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party has garnered the
highest vote tallies in 17 provinces, the opposition party
FUNCINPEC in two and its ally, the Sam Rainsy Party, in one.
	   A projection by the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, an independent election monitoring group, gives the
Cambodian People's Party 64 seats, FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy
Party 15 in the 122-seat National Assembly.
	   The opposition parties have alleged widespread irregularities in
voting and ballot-counting for the July 26 poll.
	   In response, the official National Election Committee on Tuesday
began a recount of the votes from three communes in the southern
province of Takeo.
	   The recount was supposed to begin Monday, but election workers
could not find in time the right ballots in the piles of hundreds
of blue official sacks containing votes sent in from all around the
country.
	   Opposition party observers and independent poll watchers were
present for Tuesday's recount. It is not clear whether the election
committee plans any more recounts, or how they might decide which
areas should have them.
	   Sam Rainsy, the most outspoken opposition leader, showed up at
Tuesday's recount and told reporters his party had filed 250
complaints with the committee so far and expected to protest
irregularities in as many as 700 communes, or roughly half the
total nationwide.
	   ``We have very serious reasons to ask for recounts,'' he told
reporters, adding that recounting was neither particularly
difficult nor costly.
	   Sam Rainsy met briefly Tuesday morning with his opposition ally,
FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He said they agreed to
stand firm in refusing to consider joining Hun Sen in a coalition
government until all their election complaints are addressed.
	   ``No coalition will be discussed before the recount is
completed,'' he said. ``If they do not agree to recounting we will
not agree to discuss anything else. There will be a deadlock.''
	   The opposition parties last week asked that new votes be taken
in disputed precincts if their charges of wrongdoing were found to
be valid, and threatened to boycott the National Assembly if their
complaints were not heeded.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.
	   Hun Sen responded by inviting them to join a coalition
government, but warning that if they carried out their threat not
to attend the assembly, he could confirm a government by lowering
the constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet from two-thirds
to 50 percent plus one. He also said his current government could
simply remain in power.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup d'etat, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.

Yangtze River embankments collapse, causing heavy loss of life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Waterlogged levees along China's flood-swollen
Yangtze River have started to collapse, wreaking death and
destruction on a massive scale, state media said Tuesday without
providing any casualty figures.
	   With a tropical storm and another flood tide expected, the
threat mounted of further breaches along the already weakened
levees that protect millions of people and rich farmland from the
world's third-longest river.
	   Main Yangtze dikes remain intact but secondary levees were
breached in at least two counties and a city in central China's
Hubei province, ``causing huge loss of life and property,'' the
official China Youth Daily reported.
	   The newspaper gave no casualty figures. But a human rights group
said 150 soldiers and hundreds of villagers were swept away when a
levee suddenly collapsed Saturday in Hubei's Jiayu county, about 70
kilometers (43 miles) upriver from the industrial center of Wuhan.
	   As of Monday, the bodies of nine soldiers had been recovered,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Local officials have barred foreign journalists from visiting
the worst affected flood areas, and state-controlled media tend to
provide delayed or conflicting accounts and downplay casualties.
	   The official newspaper Yangcheng Evening News said some 400
soldiers were swept away when the levee that had been protecting
some 56,000 people in two towns collapsed. Soldiers and police
pulled nearly 20,000 people from the water, the newspaper said.
	   More than 100,000 people lost their homes when a levee burst in
Anxiang, in neighboring Hunan province, on July 24, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said. Victims were living in tents, ``without
adequate food and drinking water,'' Xinhua said.
	   There were 3,200 places on levees along the Yangtze that were
prone to burst, Xinhua said.
	   ``The flood control situation along the Yangtze remains
extremely serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future,''
it reported.
	   Millions of soldiers and civilians have been manning the dikes,
watching for signs of collapse and plugging leaks, as waters on the
Yangtze reached levels unseen since floods in 1954 killed more than
30,000 people.
	   So far, at least 1,268 people have been reported killed in this
year's floods caused by summer rains that fell earlier and heavier
than usual. The death toll is likely to rise as reports of further
flooding reach Beijing.
	   A flood peak, the fourth this year, was forming on the upper
reaches of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long Yangtze, the
China Youth Daily said.
	   A tropical storm also was expected to hit land in southeast
China in the next two days, bringing strong winds and heavy rains
that could complicate flood control efforts.

Disarmament talks with Iraq collapse, Butler to return

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector cut short
his trip to Baghdad on Tuesday after talks with Iraq on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, checked out
of Baghdad's Al-Rashid Hotel early in the morning and went to the
U.N. headquarters in the capital in advance of leaving the country.
	   He declined to say what had caused the impasse in talks a day
earlier with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   ``My duty is to report what has happened to the Security Council
and the United Nations,'' Butler said. ``I'm going to New York to
do that.''
	   His deputy, Charles Duelfer, told The Associated Press that Iraq
had insisted on a clean bill of health from Butler. He quoted the
Iraqis as saying ``There is no point in continuing the talks until
you report (this) to the council.''
	   Duelfer said Butler told the Iraqis he could not certify their
compliance with U.N. resolutions calling for the destruction of
their nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   ``So there is no point in conducting further talks,'' Duelfer
said, adding that ``we are leaving pretty soon.''
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being a pawn of the Americans
in trying to prolong the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban air
travel and limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily of
Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the peoples strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year -- the
first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   The breakdown of the talks was confirmed late Monday by Danilo
Turk, president of the U.N. Security Council in New York.
	   Danilo said Butler would be in New York by Wednesday at the
latest to brief the council.
	   ``This is a difficult moment,'' said Turk, who is the Slovenian
ambassador to the council. ``It is not easy to have the discussions
cut short, it is disturbing. We will have to see what Mr. Butler
brings.''
	   A U.S. State Department official said the decision to pull out
was Iraq's.
	   ``Iraq's action to break off talks is disturbing. We, of course,
want to wait for Chairman Butler's report to the council, probably
on Thursday, before assessing what cancellation of the talks
means,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear if the latest impasse would trigger another
military crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain
sent warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential
sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused by an agreement brokered in February by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Baghdad has long accused the United States of working to prolong
the sanctions despite Iraq's contention that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Aziz on Monday accused Butler of working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions. He said Butler's team was ignoring
the country's progress in eliminating its weaponry and, instead,
focusing on ``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of
disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   In June, when Butler gave Iraq a ``blueprint'' of what it must
do to comply with U.N. resolutions so the sanctions could be
lifted.
	   But Monday, he said Iraq turned down his plan of action.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A computer malfunction forced major Japanese lender
Asahi Bank Ltd. to suspend account transactions nationwide Tuesday
at its 353 branches and automatic teller machines, the bank said.
	   But the bank was expected to resume ATM service at 3:00 p.m.
local time (0600 GMT), said spokesman Sagaki Takagi.
	   The computer electronics-related problem, the exact cause of
which remained unknown, paralyzed Asahi Bank's computer system
shortly after 10:00 a.m. local time (0100 GMT), the bank said.
	   While the bank plans to close its walk-in teller windows as
usual at mid-afternoon Tuesday, bank employees will be posted
outside to aid customers with ATM transactions, the spokesman said.
	   The bank will resume normal operations Wednesday morning, he
said.
	   One of Japan's 10 largest commercial banks, Asahi Bank was
formed through the merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank in 1991.

Shoplifting of yo-yos contributes to higher crime rates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A recent yo-yo craze is contributing to
juvenile delinquency in Singapore.
	   Yo-yo theft accounted for almost half of all juvenile
shoplifting cases in May, an increase from just over a third of all
cases in April, The New Paper reported Monday.
	   Quoting fresh police statistics, the report said the boom
yo-yo-stealing could be due to the rising popularity of the toys,
which sell for about 12 Singapore dollars (dlrs 7) apiece.
	   Singaporean families are tightening their budgets and cutting
back on frills as the Asian economic crisis hits this affluent
island state. Parents who may once have indulged their children's
craving for the latest yo-yo are now more likely to decline the
request.
	   Yo-yos have taken Singapore by storm this year, in part because
of American yo-yo enthusiast Hans Van Dan Elzen who has put on live
demonstrations in stores and shown off amazing tricks in television
ads.
	   All types of shoplifting accounted for 60 percent of juvenile
crimes through May this year, the report said, and were part of a
general 4.7 percent increase in the crime rate over the same period
last year.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX CODING

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the royal family were expected Tuesday
to gather around the Queen Mother Elizabeth, the nation's oldest
royal in history, to celebrate her 98th birthday.
	   Two world wars, the death of her husband, the disappointment of
failed marriages among younger royals, two hip replacements and a
cataract operation _ the mother of Queen Elizabeth II has endured
them all.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
and unsought sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They
ruled until George VI died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.

	   Great-grandchildren Prince William, 16, and 13-year-old Prince

	   After the birthday celebrations, the Queen Mother was expected
to travel to the royal family's Balmoral estate in Scotland for the
family's traditional summer holiday.

Royals gather for Queen Mother's 98th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with well-wishers staking out her home

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Members of the royal family were expected Tuesday
to gather around the Queen Mother Elizabeth, the nation's oldest
royal in history, to celebrate her 98th birthday.
	   Two world wars, the death of her husband, the disappointment of
failed marriages among younger royals, two hip replacements and a
cataract operation _ the mother of Queen Elizabeth II has endured
them all.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
and unsought sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They saw
Britain through the dark days of World War II and ruled until
George VI died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.
	   As the royal family accelerates its program of modernization in
the wake of the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash Aug.
31, the Queen Mother is actively engaged in the life of the nation
and remains for some Britons the favorite royal.
	   Throngs of well-wishers stood in line outside the gates of her
home early Tuesday _ some of them had camped there overnight and
some have come year after year _ to pay tribute to her. It was
hoped the hugely popular Queen Mother would make an appearance.
	   The queen, 72, was expected to lead tributes to her mother
Tuesday at a family lunch party at Clarence House, the Queen
Mother's London residence close to Buckingham Palace.
	   The celebrations were scheduled to include a band of the Welsh
Guards marching past her home playing ``Happy Birthday,'' a 41-gun
salute in Hyde Park and a 62-gun birthday salute at the Tower of
London.

South Korean foreign minister fired for mishandling dispute with
</HEADLINE>
Russia

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung fired his
foreign minister Tuesday, holding him responsible for what critics
say was a humiliating deal with Russia to end a diplomatic row.
	   The president named Hong Soon-young, 61, a former ambassador to
Germany and Russia, to replace Park Chung-soo as minister of
foreign affairs and trade.
	   At a meeting of foreign ministers in Manila last week, Russia
and South Korea said they had settled a diplomatic row that began
when each expelled spies posing as diplomats.
	   The two foreign ministers, however, differed widely on terms of
the settlement.
	   Russia's Yevgeny Primakov said South Korea agreed to allow the
return of a Russian diplomat expelled from Seoul in retaliation for
Russia's deportation of a South Korean on espionage charges.
	   But Primakov said the South Korean diplomat would not be allowed
to return to Moscow ``because he was caught red-handed'' taking
classified material from a Russian contact.
	   Park at first denied that the Russian would be allowed to return
to Seoul. But two days later, his deputy, Sun June-young,
acknowledged Seoul agreed to ``discuss'' the Russian diplomat's
return so that he could pack his belongings.
	   South Korean news media and other critics called the alleged
deal humiliating. They accused Park and other South Korean
officials of trying to hide a secret deal to avoid embarrassment.
	   The row started July 4, when Russia ordered the expulsion of a
South Korean diplomat in Moscow after he reportedly was caught
accepting classified documents from a Russian contact.
	   The Russian was arrested on treason charges.
	   South Korea retaliated four days later by expelling a Russian
diplomat in Seoul, saying he had engaged in ``activities that go
against his status as a diplomat.''
	   Then, on July 20, South Korea withdrew five more officials from
Russia under an agreement to limit the number of intelligence
agents each country assigns to its diplomatic missions. No
withdrawal was reported from the Russian embassy in Seoul.
	   South Korean officials had hoped that would end the dispute.
	   But when Park and Primakov met on the sidelines of a Southeast
Asia security conference in Manila last week, Russia raised the
issue again and asked South Korea to retract its earlier decision
that expelled the Russian diplomat in Seoul.

calling for holy war to lift sanctions, CHANGES dateline and

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector cut short
his trip to Baghdad on Tuesday after talks with Iraq on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, checked out
of Baghdad's Al-Rashid Hotel early in the morning and went to the
U.N. headquarters in the capital in advance of leaving the country.
	   He declined to say what had caused the impasse in talks a day
earlier with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   ``My duty is to report what has happened to the Security Council
and the United Nations,'' Butler said. ``I'm going to New York to
do that.''
	   His deputy, Charles Duelfer, told The Associated Press that Iraq
had insisted on a clean bill of health from Butler. He quoted the
Iraqis as saying ``There is no point in continuing the talks until
you report (this) to the council.''
	   Duelfer said Butler told the Iraqis he could not certify their
compliance with U.N. resolutions calling for the destruction of
their nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as well as
long-range missiles.
	   ``So there is no point in conducting further talks,'' Duelfer
said, adding that ``we are leaving pretty soon.''
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being a pawn of the Americans
in trying to prolong the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban air
travel and limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily
newspaper of Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the people's strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the
first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   The breakdown of the talks was confirmed late Monday by Danilo
Turk, president of the U.N. Security Council in New York.
	   Danilo said Butler would be in New York by Wednesday at the
latest to brief the council.
	   ``This is a difficult moment,'' said Turk, who is the Slovenian
ambassador to the council. ``It is not easy to have the discussions
cut short, it is disturbing. We will have to see what Mr. Butler
brings.''
	   A U.S. State Department official said the decision to pull out
was Iraq's.
	   ``Iraq's action to break off talks is disturbing. We, of course,
want to wait for Chairman Butler's report to the council, probably
on Thursday, before assessing what cancellation of the talks
means,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear if the latest impasse would trigger another
military crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain
sent warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential
sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused by an agreement brokered in February by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Baghdad has long accused the United States of working to prolong
the sanctions despite Iraq's contention that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Aziz on Monday said Butler's team was ignoring the country's
progress in eliminating its weaponry and, instead, focusing on
``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''
	   In June, when Butler gave Iraq a ``blueprint'' of what it must
do to comply with U.N. resolutions so the sanctions could be
lifted.
	   But Monday, he said Iraq turned down his plan of action.
	   ``We did not make the progress I have hoped for,'' Butler told
reporters. ``I do not know whether we are going to meet tomorrow.''

Cargo handler says not given enough time for airport opening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ In a detailed report of its problems at Hong
Kong's new airport, the main cargo handler told a government
commission that it was not given enough time to ensure a smooth
opening, news reports said Tuesday.
	   Managing Director Anthony Charter told the commission on its
first visit to the airport Monday that Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals was ``under extreme time pressure'' to get its
computerized cargo system running at Chek Lap Kok airport, the Hong
Kong Standard said.
	   Charter told Chairman Woo Kwok-hing that the company's permit to
occupy the new terminal was given only three days before the
airport's opening on July 6, and that much sensitive computer
equipment was left exposed to dust, dirt, and water.
	   Both the government and the cargo handler have come in for
scathing criticism from legislators and businessmen who fear the
problems will further hurt Hong Kong's weakening economy. It is not
clear whether compensation will be offered for losses resulting
from the cargo problems, and if so, by whom.
	   The explanation offered by the cargo company on Monday was among
the most comprehensive given so far.
	   Charter's deputy, Yeung Kwok-keung, was quoted as saying that
the cargo company's computers failed to connect to the airport's
main flight-information system, and received its first message only
on the evening of the first day of operations.
	   By that time, about 600 error messages were logged in the
computer, Charter was quoted as saying.
	   Yeung was quoted as saying that cargo companies compounded the
problems by continuing to send shipments even after being told of
the cargo terminal's problems.
	   The latest government statistics show that gross domestic
product shrank 2.8 percent in this year's first quarter. Worse
figures are expected for the second quarter of the year. The
government has said that the economy is being slowed further by the
cargo problems.
	   Woo said during the visit to the airport that the commission has
received ``several responses'' from foreign experts who were asked
to help in the investigation, the South China Morning Post
reported.
	   The cargo handler has shifted some operations back to its
facilities at old Kai Tak airport, and said last week that it was
slightly ahead of a phased recovery plan.
	   It promised to be up to 100 percent cargo capacity at the new
airport by the end of August.

Thai government cracking down on hilltribe Buddhist temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Alleged drug dealing and an
unauthorized statue of Thailand's king had government officials
promising a crackdown Tuesday on a Buddhist temple which shelters
members of the Hmong hilltribe from Laos.
	   Some Hmong have allegedly become deeply involved in amphetamine
trafficking, with reports that gang members have put out murder
contracts on anti-narcotics policemen.
	   Many Hmong worship at Tham Krabok temple in Saraburi, 90
kilometers (56 miles) north of Bangkok. The temple is known for
running a drug treatment program in which herbal remedies are used.
	   Some police and government officials, however, have accused the
temple of sheltering drug dealers.
	   On Tuesday, Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart said police
will set up a special drug task force on Aug. 15 to deal with the
problems of the Hmong and the temple.
	   Education Minister Chumpol Silpa-archa cautioned, however, that
the police must take care and treat the temple's clergy with
respect because they have done much good for the community.
	   The Education Ministry oversees the Department of Religious
Affairs. It also oversees the Fine Arts Department, which on
Tuesday ordered the temple to destroy a recently-completed statue
of Thailand's constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
	   ``Building His Majesty the King's statue requires official
permission and supervision by the Fine Arts Department. Otherwise,
it is lese majeste,'' said an official of the Fine Arts Department,
who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   He added that the 16-meter (53-foot) statue violated the
municipality's rule that says statues should not be more than
15-meters (49.5 feet) high.
	   Ordering a statue of Thailand's king, who is revered as
semi-divine by his subjects, to be destroyed, is an unusual
occurrence in Thailand.

Arson possible in Singapore fire at center of Malaysia row

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Authorities said they could not rule out arson
Tuesday as the cause of a fire that erupted inside a train station
at the center of a row with neighboring Malaysia.
	   The small fire in the Tanjong Pagar station bordering the
city-state's financial district was put out by the Civil Defense
Force about 15 minutes after it was reported Tuesday morning, said
government television.
	   The fire broke out about 50 yards (45 meters) from where
Malaysian officers were conducting their country's immigration
formalities against the wishes of the Singapore government.
	   The station was operating normally, with passengers waiting for
the next train as the fire was extinguished.
	   Government television quoted the Civil Defense Force as saying
foul play could not be ruled out. The blaze erupted among wooden
partitions in an unused lounge, burning parts of the room and
bursting windows.
	   The station has been at the center of a simmering dispute
between Singapore and Malaysia over the location of their customs
and immigration checkpoints along the railway line that connects
the two countries.
	   Singapore moved its border post to a checkpoint in the north of
the island on Saturday, despite objections from Malaysia, which
said it preferred to remain at Tanjong Pagar.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stocks finish lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Nikkei closing, mid-afternoon dollar and bond
price &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen Tuesday
following warnings by Japanese finance officials that they may
intervene to halt the yen's slide. Tokyo stock prices closed lower.
	   The dollar bought 144.98 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.66
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate
of 145.60 yen overnight.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told a regular news conference
that intervention in the foreign exchange markets is necessary if
currency moves are disruptive. Miyazawa added that similar comments
he made last week weren't meant to imply that intervention to
support the yen was unnecessary.
	   Separately, Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the international bureau of
the Finance Ministry, warned that Japan was prepared to take action
against what he called the ``excessively weak'' yen.
	   The comments combined to push the dollar down from its morning
high of 146.05 yen, traders said.
	   It was Miyazawa's assertion last week that intervention should
occur only when currency moves are disruptive that prompted dollar
buying.
	   But the different emphasis this time, and Miyazawa's suggestion
that he had been misinterpreted previously, helped boost the yen,
traders said.
	   On Monday, the dollar climbed to a seven-week high against the
yen amid a perception that a turnaround in Japan's economy could
take time.
	   Meanwhile, stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to
fall as a drop in bank issues was weighing on overall market
sentiment, dealers said.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 141.50 points,
or 0.88 percent, closing at 16,023.58 points. On Monday, the index
shed 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   Traders remained unsettled because of the volatile exchange
market and an overnight fall of 96.55 points in the Down Jones
industrial average on Wall Street.
	   Domestic institutional investors were among sellers of bank
shares on worries that restructuring of the nation's banking
industry will take a toll on the sector.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,234.61. The
TOPIX closed down 16.80 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.210 percent from Monday's finish of 1.225 percent,
driving its price up to 111.73 yen from 111.62 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Overcoming public opposition and safety fears,
Japan for the first time in 10 years will build a commercial
nuclear power plant for generating electricity, officials said
Tuesday.
	   After months of discussion, the government's five-member Nuclear
Safety Commission concluded Monday there would be no problem with
the construction and operation of a new nuclear reactor.
	   That move paves the way for Kaoru Yosano, Minister of
International Trade and Industry, to soon give the go-ahead for the
construction of a nuclear power plant in Higashidori, a village in
Aomori Prefecture, or state, in northern Japan, ministry officials
said.
	   Resource-poor Japan last approved the construction of a nuclear
power plant in 1988 in the town of Shika in Ishikawa prefecture,
located 295 kilometers (183 miles), northwest of Tokyo.
	   Under the plans, construction of a boiling light-water type
reactor with an electricity generation capacity of 1.10 million
kilowatts will begin in December, said the officials, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The new plant, located 631 kilometers (391 miles) northeast of
Tokyo and operated by Tohoku Electric Power Co., is slated to start
operations in July of 2005, the officials said.
	   The local assembly in Higashidori adopted a resolution to accept
the nuclear power plant in 1965, but local residents' opposition
delayed it, the Asahi newspaper said.
	   But such opposition has died down considerably in recent years,
the Asahi said.
	   The commission also judged safety will be maintained, even if a
magnitude 6.5 earthquake strikes below the site of a nuclear power
facility, the ministry officials said.
	   A temporary nuclear waste storage facility is currently under
construction at Rokkasho, another town in Aomori Prefecture.
Anti-nuclear activists say that Rokkasho is a dangerous place for
storage because it sits on at least two active earthquake faults.
	   Despite the government's efforts to reduce dependence on
imported oil, safety concerns among local residents regarding
reactors has hampered or delayed plans elsewhere as well.
	   Public concerns increased after the 1986 nuclear accident at
Chernobyl in then-Soviet Ukraine and Japan's first-ever local
referendum, held in the town of Maki, 250 kilometers (160 miles),
northwest of Tokyo. In a first for Japan, citizens in that
referendum decisively rejected a proposal to build a nuclear plant.
	   Also, trust in Japan's nuclear industry has fallen in recent
years following a series of accidents and cover-ups by plant
operators. A fire in March 1997 exposed 37 workers to low-level
radiation in a fuel processing facility.
	   Japan now has 51 commercial nuclear power plants, supplying
about one-third of the nation's electricity, according to
government figures.

Thai foreign minister says Cambodia must be unified to get aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Foreign Minister said
Tuesday that Cambodia must show it is peaceful and unified before
the international community and Asian countries will resume
development aid.
	   Most countries cut off aid to Cambodia, one of the world's
poorest nations, last July when Hun Sen ousted Prince Norodom
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup d'etat.
	   Cambodia is still tallying up the votes from last Sunday's
national election, only its second in nearly 30 years. The
opposition, led by Ranariddh, has charged Hun Sen, whose party is
leading in the polls, with cheating.
	   The opposition has threatened to boycott a new Parliament unless
an honest recount is conducted.
	   Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said that Cambodia's neighbors were confident that the
country's king, Norodom Sihanouk, will play a main role in helping
a government form quickly and peacefully.
	   Sihanouk is Ranariddh's father.
	   ``We want to see unity in the country and see it soon so that
the international community and Asians will be ready to help with
development,'' Surin said.

<TEXT>
	   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) _ Strong winds and poor visibility
hampered rescue helicopters Tuesday from reaching a French woman
injured when she fell off a ravine while climbing a volcano,
officials said.
	   Two air force helicopters with paramedics were sent to the
eastern side of the Mayon volcano which Olivia Murell and two
companions had climbed early Monday.
	   Murell, 27, from Paris, suffered cuts in the head and arms and
could not move her left leg when volunteer rescuers and local
residents pulled her out of the ravine early Tuesday, said Rowena
Ondiz, operations chief of the Albay Provincial Disaster Management
Organization.
	   There was no report on whether the two other French tourists _
Bruno Locatilli, 24, and Cristel Ghergovalch, 25, both of
Montpellier, France _ were also injured.
	   The three French tourists had hired a local resident to guide
them up the 2,462-meter (8,125-foot) volcano.
	   Murell slid off a ravine during a flash flood following a heavy
downpour after they became separated from their guide. The guide
later found them about halfway up the slope of the mountain Monday
afternoon and reported the accident to local authorities.
	   Rescue helicopter pilot Lt. Gerald Naldosa said he could not
land at a camp normally used by climbers where the victim was taken
by the rescuers because of dangerous winds and poor visibility and
had to land about two kilometers (one mile) away. Paramedics plan
to carry the woman to the helicopter on a stretcher, he said.
	   Governor Al Francis Bichara said the guide had not been
certified by the local tourism office and the tourists did not
inform local authorities they had planned to climb the volcano,
about 320 kilometers (200 miles) southeast of Manila.
	   Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, last
erupted in February 1994, killing at least 70 people.
	   After the 1994 eruption, the government declared an area six
kilometers (3.75 miles) around the summit as a permanent danger
zone off limits to tourists and local residents.

Mexico's governing party wins two state in more competitive

<TEXT>
	   AGUASCALIENTES, Mexico (AP) _ Despite winning two of three state
elections over the weekend, Mexico's governing party saw its
victory margins shrivel in a display of the country's much more
competitive political scene.
	   Nearly complete preliminary results Monday showed that the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, lost to the
conservative National Action party in the small north-central state
of Aguascalientes, even though polls showed that most voters liked
the outgoing PRI governor.
	   The three elections are among 10 gubernatorial races this year
that help set the course for the presidential elections in the year
2000.
	   Politicians in the three major parties already are jockeying
publicly for the presidential nomination _ unusual in a country
where party chieftains have traditionally chosen candidates and
frowned on expressions of ambition.
	   ``The PRI was reaffirmed yesterday as the first political force
of the country,'' the party announced in a press release. ``these
are times of high electoral competition in which victories and
defeats should be judged in their fair dimension,'' it added.
	   The PRI's historical dominance of Mexico was underscored by its
winning despite a sharp reduction in the votes it received in
contests against two major rivals.
	   In Veracruz, the party's share of votes slid almost 20
percentage points from the 1992 gubernatorial election, but
businessman Miguel Aleman _ son of a former president _ easily
outdistanced his opponents to win with 49 percent of the vote.
	   Aleman, who united a divided party in Veracruz, has been touted
by supporters as a possible presidential candidate.
	   In Oaxaca, the PRI's share fell almost 30 percentage points. But
Jose Murat won with 48 percent, despite a determined effort by the
leftist Democratic Revolution Party, which wound up with 36 percent
_ 25 points above its 1992 showing.
	   In Aguascalientes, the PRI had won with 74 percent of the vote
in 1992. This year Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of National Action
bested the PRI candidate 53 to 36 percent.
	   Gonzalez obviously was not thinking of a national campaign.
``There are three countries,'' he said Monday. ``The center thinks,
the north works and the south rests.''
	   President Ernesto Zedillo said Monday the elections showed the
effectiveness of voting reforms he sponsored soon after taking
office in 1994.
	   ``In a short time we have assisted in a deep and irreversible
transition which has opened a new epoch of transparency, equity and
justice in electoral processes,'' the president told a meeting of
public administrators.
	   The Aguascalientes win helped National Action bounce back from a
damaging loss last month in Chihuahua _ the first state to turn
back to the PRI after having an opposition party governor.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector cut short
his trip to Baghdad on Tuesday after talks with Iraq on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, checked out
of Baghdad's Al-Rashid Hotel early in the morning and later left to

for a flight to Bahrain.
	   Reporters are not allowed at the military base.
	   He declined to say what had caused the impasse in talks a day
earlier with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
	   ``My duty is to report what has happened to the Security Council
and the United Nations,'' Butler said at the Al-Rashid. ``I'm going
to New York to do that.''

Report: Deadly virus could reach Hong Kong in one year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A microbiology expert says a virus that has
killed more than 50 people in Taiwan may take its time reaching
Hong Kong, and warned against complacency, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong health authorities have been watching closely for an
outbreak of the enterovirus 71.
	   So far, none of the 38 confirmed cases of a strain similar to
the virus found in Taiwan has resulted in death.
	   Paul Chan Kay-sheung, a microbiology professor at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, was on a team of experts from Hong Kong
that traveled to Taiwan last week to study the virus.
	   Chan said Hong Kong could not afford to relax just because it so
far had managed to escape the level of infection found in Taiwan.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted him as saying that the virus
``will take a year to arrive'' in Hong Kong.
	   The virus, which strikes infants and small children especially
hard, is the latest in a string of worries about health risks in
Hong Kong.
	   Last December, the government halted all live imports of poultry
and ordered all 1.4 million local chickens killed to stamp out the
so-called ``bird flu.'' Then, more than 100 people were admitted to
hospitals after eating deep-sea coral fish contaminated with heavy
metals.
	   Most recently fish and shellfish were declared unsafe when red
tides _ fast-breeding, oxygen-depleting algae _ hit Hong Kong
waters.

Report: Indonesian president makes new plea for Chinese to return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie has made a new
plea to frightened ethnic Chinese to return to Indonesia after
fleeing racially charged riots in May, a news report said Tuesday.
	   However, Habibie, who replaced autocratic former President
Suharto after the riots, said he can do no more to get them to
return.
	   ``I have full sympathy for them ... not only full sympathy, I'm
on their side, pro-active. They should trust me,'' Habibie was
quoted as saying by The Asian Wall Street Journal.
	   ``I have condemned that (the riots) already, officially as
president, and I will not let it happen again.''
	   ``I am looking forward for them to come home,'' he said.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up only about 4 percent of Indonesia's 202
million population. However, they dominate commerce and industry
and were targeted by indigenous Indonesian mobs during the riots as
scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Thousands of Chinese fled the violence in which about 1,200
people were killed. Hundreds of Chinese-owned stores and homes were
robbed and burned. Dozens of Chinese women and girls were
reportedly raped by gangs.
	   Habibie has set up inquiries into the causes of the riots and
the rapes and has repeatedly said that it is now safe for Chinese
people to return.
	   ``I have done the utmost I can do (to get them to return). I
cannot go and take my airplane and beg them and kiss them at the
feet. I don't know how to do (that), I cannot,'' the newspaper
quoted him as saying.
	   Analysts say Chinese capital and business expertise are
desperately needed by Indonesia as it grapples with soaring
inflation and mass unemployment.
	   Last month, Habibie raised eyebrows when he was quoted by The
Washington Post as saying the economy will survive even if ethnic
Chinese entrepreneurs don't return because their place will be
taken by other Indonesians.

Canucks face prospect of having to trade Bure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) _ If Pavel Bure won't play for
the Vancouver Canucks, he might not play at all.
	   The Vancouver star is demanding a trade, but Canucks general
manager Brian Burke said Monday that Bure will have to wait for the
right deal to come along.
	   ``I do not answer to Pavel Bure,'' Burke said. ``My boss' name
is not Bure, it's (owner John) McCaw.''
	   Burke said that Bure has already informed him that he won't be
at camp.
	   ``He's an employee of the Vancouver Canucks and therefore to me
at this point he is no more than an asset. And I today will not
promise to move him,'' Burke said from Nashville, where NHL general
managers are meeting.
	   ``In fact, I'm going to make the opposite promise, that I will
not move him unless I'm offered a deal which makes sense to our
hockey club and improves our hockey club.''
	   Burke's comments came a day after a Vancouver newspaper quoted
Bure's agent Mike Gillis as saying, ``Pavel has told Brian Burke he
will never play for the team again.''
	   So Burke, who as a Vancouver assistant general manager in 1991
drove Bure to the rink for his first practice, has the task of
trying to trade him just over a month after assuming his current
post.
	   ``I spoke with (Bure) last weekend. I had offered to try to help
cure a couple of the problems he cited, and he reiterated that he'd
like to be traded,'' Burke said. ``I said, `Is there anything,
anything at all that I could do or say to make you want to stay in
Vancouver?' And he said, `No.'''
	   Bure, 27, didn't specify his reasons for wanting a trade. But he
reportedly is unhappy with the lack of privacy in Vancouver and the
Canucks' plans to enter a rebuilding stage after the team missed
the playoffs for the second consecutive season.
	   Bure has also been frustrated by numerous contract squabbles
he's had since signing his five-year deal in 1994. Despite
guarantees in his contract, Bure was forced to battle the Canucks
for money they failed to pay him during the NHL lockout that wiped
out half of the 1994-95 season.
	   Bure, the 1991-92 NHL rookie of the year, is a two-time 60-goal
scorer who scored 51 last season. The Russian right winger has one
year left on his contract, which will reportedly pay him over dlrs
8 million.
	   ``The reasons are my own and everyone has personal reasons for
doing things, and I don't really want to discuss them,'' Bure said
of his trade demand. ``I love the fans here and I love the city.
But I really feel it's time to move.''
	   Burke said Bure will face fines and a suspension without pay if
he refuses to play for the team or fails to show up for training
camp.
	   ``If we start the regular season and we haven't made a deal,
then a suspension is not an option, it's going to happen,'' Burke
said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Determined to reduce the nuisance
caused by crows, city officials in a Kuala Lumpur suburb are
offering prizes to those who shoot the birds down.
	   A crow shooting contest set for Aug. 16 in Klang is offering one
ringgit (dlrs 0.25) for every crow shot, the Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
	   Rosli Udin, Klang Municipal Council spokesman, said the crows
were a nuisance to the public and their population had to be
reduced.
	   Rosli said the event, organized by the town's health department,
was open to both professional and amateur shooters.
	   In the past, the council set traps in public parks to capture
crows. Last year, 35,620 crows were killed by the traps, a
municipal official said.

Tajikistan's president brings more opposition figures into govt.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajikistan's president has brought four more
opposition figures into the government, part of an ongoing
reconciliation effort following the country's civil war, a news
report said Tuesday.
	   President Emomali Rakhmonov signed a decree Monday installing
leaders from the United Tajik Opposition as the chiefs of various
committees, including precious metals, oil and gas, and emergencies
and civil defense, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   He also appointed an opposition leader to head the Agriculture
Ministry. Rakhmonov plans to fill the posts of vice prime minister
and defense minister with opposition members as well.
	   Under an agreement between the two sides, 30 percent of
government posts to be filled by opposition figures.
	   The secular government and the opposition, which includes
Islamic fundamentalists, signed a peace agreement last year ending
a 5-year civil war. However, there are still tensions between the
two sides.
	   In addition, some warlords have refused to recognize the peace
deal, and have clashed periodically with government forces.

Presumed gas explosion destroys apartment house in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A suspected natural gas explosion destroyed an
apartment house in Berlin early Tuesday and rescue workers searched
by hand and with dogs through the rubble for survivors.
	   Firefighters said at least nine of the 19 people registered as
living in the five-story building survived; at least two of them
were injured.
	   Some 200 rescue workers and five dogs were searching for trapped
residents. Heavy equipment could not be used for fear the 5-meter
(16-foot) high pile of rubble would collapse further.
	   Police believe the explosion, which sent a huge cloud of dust
over the Steglitz neighborhood, was caused by natural gas.
Residents of six surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution.

Aid agencies struggle to reach Kosovo refugees

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in the
woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to flee
their villages.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was planning an aid
convoy Tuesday for ethnic Albanians near Malisevo, a former
stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, where
thousands of refugees had sought shelter.
	   Serb forces toppled three additional KLA strongholds Monday,
Serb sources said. These included the villages of Lausa, Smonica
and Jablanica. The attacks come days after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic promised to stop his attack on the KLA.
	   Milosevic also pledged last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province, part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership said that moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who
met with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill Monday, blamed the Serbs for
exacerbating the problem in Kosovo.
	   ``Serb forces kill civilians, burn and destroy settlements and
entire villages and carry out ethnic cleansing,'' Rugova said. He
also demanded ``energetic intervention by the United States and its
allies.''
	   In Washington Monday, the administration of U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced that NATO had approved a plan to use firepower
against Serb forces in Kosovo, warning that another offensive could
trigger a ``humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium said that a
number of options had been underway for some time, but there was no
military action planned at this stage.
	   There was no immediate word on what would trigger an attack by
NATO. Nor was it clear whether the administration was trying mostly
to unnerve Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
an ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995.

Suu Kyi vows to keep struggling; regime threatens annihilation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is
recovering from her roadside standoff with the military regime in
Myanmar and vows to keep pushing for dialogue, but official
newspapers Tuesday threatened any dangers to the state with
annihilation.
	   U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weideman, the top U.S. envoy in
Myanmar, said in a memo circulated to diplomats in the capital that
he visited Suu Kyi on Sunday and was allowed entry to her home
after only ``minimal delays'' from security forces.
	   The memo said Suu Kyi, 53, was ``recuperating well from her
encounter and indicated that she intends to continue to assert her
rights in order to achieve her objective of dialogue with the
government.''
	   Weideman said he visited without prior warning to establish the
right of diplomats to see her when they want.
	   Suu Kyi ``indicated to me that she would welcome the visit of
other diplomatic missions to firmly establish the right of
diplomats to meet with her,'' the memo said.
	   The Associated Press was shown a copy of the memo by a diplomat
who received it. The U.S. Embassy could not immediately confirm its
authenticity, though Weideman is known to have visited Suu Kyi for
two hours Sunday.
	   State-controlled newspapers ran an opinion piece Tuesday saying
that Suu Kyi was conspiring with Western media and unspecified
countries _ though U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
statement last week that Myanmar was headed for civil unrest was
noted.
	   ``It is obvious that she is trying to instigate unrest and cause
internal instability to create the recurrence of an anarchistic
uprising for the second time,'' said the article, believed to
reflect the views of at least part of the government.
	   ``Any external and internal danger threatening the establishment
of a peaceful and prosperous state will be annihilated,'' it said.
	   The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, was intensely
criticized by the United States, the European Union and many other
countries for last week's standoff with Suu Kyi on a road outside
Yangon, the capital.
	   The government, which seldom allows her to leave her home and
never lets her outside the capital, stopped her car and refused to
allow her to travel to another city, Bassein, to meet party
supporters. She spurned orders to go back home.
	   After six days, with neither side budging and Suu Kyi running
low on food and water, authorities ejected her driver and two
fellow passengers, held her down and drove her back to Yangon, her
National League for Democracy party has said.
	   The military, which has ruled the country since 1962, said Suu
Kyi's action was intended to embarrass Myanmar during a foreign
ministers conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The standoff comes amid a period of anniversaries marking 10
years since the army killed thousands of people to quell
anti-government protests. Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero
Aung San, rose to the vanguard of the pro-democracy movement during
the unrest.
	   Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her non-violent
promotion of democracy.
	   She has spent most of the past decade under house arrest or
close confinement to her home. In 1990, the National League for
Democracy overwhelmingly won elections, but the military never
allowed the new parliament to convene.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD have set a deadline of Aug. 21 for the
ruling State Peace and Development Council to finally convene the
legislature. They have no means to enforce the demand, though
Yangon is edgy with anticipation of unrest.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, a dozen Myanmar students began a sit-in
Monday outside the Myanmar Embassy scheduled to last until Aug. 21
to press the NLD demand.

Yangtze River embankments collapse, causing heavy loss of life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 20 dead, 370 injured in Sichuan province in grafs
2 and 13, edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Waterlogged levees along China's flood-swollen
Yangtze River have started to collapse, wreaking death and
destruction on a massive scale, state media said Tuesday.
	   Torrential rains in southwest Sichuan province also have
triggered flooding that killed at least 20 people, pushing the
known death toll from floods caused by unusually heavy and early
summer rains this year to 1,288.
	   With a tropical storm and another flood tide expected, the
threat mounted of further breaches along the already weakened
levees that protect millions of people and rich farmland from the
Yangtze, the world's third-longest river.
	   Main Yangtze dikes remain intact but secondary levees were
breached in at least two counties and a city in central China's
Hubei province, ``causing huge loss of life and property,'' the
official China Youth Daily reported.
	   The newspaper gave no casualty figures. But a human rights group
said 150 soldiers and hundreds of villagers were swept away when a
levee suddenly collapsed Saturday in Hubei's Jiayu County, about 70
kilometers (43 miles) upriver from the industrial center of Wuhan.
	   As of Monday, the bodies of nine soldiers had been recovered,
the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Local officials have barred foreign journalists from visiting
the worst flood areas, and state-controlled media tend to provide
delayed or conflicting accounts and downplay casualties.
	   The official newspaper Yangcheng Evening News said some 400
soldiers were swept away when the levee that had been protecting
some 56,000 people in two towns collapsed. Soldiers and police
pulled nearly 20,000 people from the water, the newspaper said.
	   More than 100,000 people lost their homes when a levee burst in
Anxiang, in neighboring Hunan province, on July 24, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said. Victims were living in tents, ``without
adequate food and drinking water,'' Xinhua said.
	   There were 3,200 places on levees along the Yangtze that were
prone to burst, Xinhua said.
	   ``The flood control situation along the Yangtze remains
extremely serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future,''
it reported.
	   Millions of soldiers and civilians have been manning the dikes,
watching for signs of collapse and plugging leaks, as waters on the
Yangtze reached levels unseen since floods in 1954 killed more than
30,000 people.
	   Aside from killing 20 people, the floods in Sichuan province in
recent days also injured 370 people and left two others missing,
Xinhua said. Torrential rains triggered landslides and caused
waters on the Yangtze's upper reaches and its main tributaries to
reach danger levels, it said.
	   A flood peak, the fourth this year, was forming on the upper
reaches of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river, the China
Youth Daily said.
	   A tropical storm also was expected to hit land in southeast
China in the next two days, bringing strong winds and heavy rains
that could complicate flood control efforts.

Newspaper director found guilty of insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The managing director of a weekly newspaper
has been found guilty of insulting the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini by publishing a letter critical of his
rule, Iranian newspapers said Tuesday
	   A Tehran court on Monday found Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, managing
director of the weekly Khaneh, guilty of ``insulting the Imam and
Islamic sanctities,'' the papers said.
	   The court did not immediately announce a sentence, they said.
Za'eri was freed on bail of 20 million rials (dlrs 6,600) pending
sentencing.
	   Meanwhile, the Tous daily, a pro-democracy paper, was evacuated
late Monday after receiving a bomb threat from an anonymous caller.
	   No bomb was found, and journalists at Tous later resumed work,
editor Mahmoud Shams said Tuesday.
	   Za'eri was arrested last week after the paper published a letter
in which an anonymous young woman criticized Khomeini, the leader
of the 1979 revolution who is called ``the Imam.''
	   Criticism of Khomeini, who led Iran in the 1980-88 war with
Iraq, has been taboo.
	   But the young woman wrote to the paper: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   On July 27, militants threw a small petrol bomb at the offices
of Khaneh and then called editors to threaten further action if the
paper didn't change its policies. No one was injured in the
incident.
	   Tous, which was evacuated because of the bomb scare, has been at
the center of a power struggle between hard-liners and reformists
inside Iran's Islamic government.
	   Shams, who was beaten by Muslim militants allied with the
hard-liners earlier this week, said Tuesday that the paper had
received a call Monday evening from a man who said ``there was a
bomb on the second floor of our building which would explode in a
half hour.''
	   Shams said he ordered the paper's 80 odd employees to evacuate
and then called police. He said police and a bomb disposal squad
arrived about an hour later, but found no explosive device.
	   Tous began as the daily Jameah but was closed down last month by
hard-liners opposed to the reforms of Iran's moderate president,
Mohammad Khatami. The paper then changed its name to Tous and
continued publishing.
	   The authorities then ordered Tous to close, but later rescinded
the directive.
	   Shortly before the ban on Tous was served Saturday, militants
believed allied to the hard-liners assaulted Shams. They also beat
two reporters for The Associated Press who arrived on the scene.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in the

	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was planning an aid

Legislators say Hong Kong should consider deficit spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With no relief in sight for Hong Kong's
economy, the territory's largest political party is urging
officials not to dismiss deficit spending to ease the pain of its
struggling citizens.
	   On top of announcements Monday on its gross domestic product,
corporate earnings, layoffs and stock prices, the territory is
bracing for more bad news.
	   The stock market, after plunging 4.8 percent Monday, dropped
another 1.5 percent in early trading Tuesday.
	   Monday's string of bad news also included a poor earnings report
by giant HSBC Holdings for this year's first six months, retail
layoffs and new government figures indicating that the economy
contracted more than originally thought in the first quarter of the
year.
	   More poor earnings reports are expected later in the week.
Cathay Pacific, the struggling airline, announces results on
Wednesday. Swire Pacific, which owns 44 percent of the airline and
also is heavily invested in the battered property market, announces
its first-half results on Thursday.
	   Hong Kong has become used to continuous growth in the past
decade. Instead, the economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first
quarter, and officials said Monday that results for the April-June
quarter are likely to be worse. Even in the second half of the
year, there will be no miracle turnaround, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Monday.
	   As a way of maintaining financial discipline, the territory
customarily ties any spending increases to the economic growth
rate.
	   Measures that the government already has taken may lead to a
small deficit this year. Yeung Sum, a senior leader of Hong Kong's
Democratic Party, said the current economic troubles mean there is
likely to be very little growth next year, and little room for
increased spending to help struggling residents.
	   In comments to the South China Morning Post published Tuesday,
he urged the government not to ``blindly follow the rules.''
	   Yeung was quoted as saying the government should be flexible
enough to allow a deficit ``for an exceptional year in order to
meet the rising expectations of the community for livelihood
improvement.''
	   He said the government should reconsider the party's proposal to
return some of the salary and profit tax payments for the 1996-1997
tax year to struggling residents, whose income and investments both
have been hit hard.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.5 percent, and much
higher in some sectors. A union survey released over the weekend
indicated it had reached 17 percent in the retail and department
store sector. Other workers who kept their jobs were facing wage
cuts or freezes.
	   The stock and property markets have fallen dramatically in the
past year, and some analysts estimated the losses have cut assets
of Hong Kong residents by 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 516
billion).

Russian miners ease blockade of power plant in Far East
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With coal supplies dwindling, striking miners
eased their blockade Tuesday of the main power plant on the eastern
island of Sakhalin, agreeing to allow enough coal through to keep
the plant operational.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of overdue
wages, have been blocking railroad approaches to the plant for
nearly two weeks. They agreed that 25 cars carrying about 1,500
tons of coal could go to the plant daily, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   But authorities will continue rationing electricity on the Far
Eastern island, the reports said. Homes and factories on Sakhalin
have been getting only between five and six hours of electricity a
day, it added.
	   Sakhalin Deputy Gov. Ivan Malakhov called the protest a
``terrorist'' act, ITAR-Tass said. But his boss, Gov. Igor
Farkhutdinov, disputed the accusation and revoked an earlier threat
to use force to remove the miners.
	   ``No one is going to use force,'' Farkhutdinov was quoted as
saying. ``It is not terrorism; it is an act of despair.''
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant for electricity. About
650,000 people live on the island.
	   The strike is one of many miners' protests over unpaid wages in
recent months. But the protests have been largely uncoordinated and
in most instances have inflicted only limited damage on the
economy.
	   Many of Russia's coal mines have been losing money for years,
and the government has been trying to shut them down. Many coal
companies are nominally privatized, but still depend on significant
government subsidies to pay their workers.
	   In a related protest, ambulance workers in the eastern port city
of Vladivostok went on strike Tuesday to demand four months of back
wages.
	   There are usually 30 ambulances on duty, but only four ambulance
teams will stay on the job, and will respond only to calls
involving children or accident victims, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Also in the Far East, more than 100 miners from the town of
Partizansk blocked a local section of the Trans-Siberian railroad
for three hours Tuesday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In the Ural Mountains, coal miners from the Chelyabinsk region
were blocking the Argayashskaya power plant, which supplies energy
to nuclear-waste processing enterprise Mayak, the business daily
Kommersant said.
	   Authorities have cut all power to the town of Ozersk, where the
Mayak plant is located, Kommersant said. Civil defense workers have
been sent to the region to ensure the safety of nuclear storage
sites, ITAR-Tass reported.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A computer malfunction forced major Japanese lender
Asahi Bank Ltd. to suspend account transactions nationwide Tuesday
at its 353 branches and automatic teller machines, the bank said.
	   But the bank was expected to resume ATM service at 3 p.m. (0600
GMT), said spokesman Sagaki Takagi.
	   The computer electronics-related problem, the exact cause of
which remained unknown, paralyzed Asahi Bank's computer system
shortly after 10 a.m. (0100 GMT), the bank said.
	   While the bank plans to close its walk-in teller windows as
usual at midafternoon Tuesday, bank employees will be posted
outside to aid customers with ATM transactions, the spokesman said.
	   The bank will resume normal operations Wednesday morning, he
said.
	   One of Japan's 10 largest commercial banks, Asahi Bank was
formed through the merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank in 1991.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin resumed his summer
vacation Tuesday, arriving at the Valdai lake resort in
northwestern Russia, presidential press service announced.
	   Last week, Yeltsin interrupted his stay in the Russian republic
of Karelia, near the Finnish border, citing urgent business in
Moscow.
	   He spent the past few days in his country residence near the
Russian capital, conferring with Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
and other top officials and signing several economic bills into
law.
	   Yeltsin is expected to spend about 10 days in the Uzhin resort
near lake Valdai, about 400 kilometers (230 miles) north of Moscow,
Interfax news agency reported, citing Yeltsin's press service.

Kuwait intercepts ships allegedly violating Iraq embargo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) - The Kuwaiti coast guard has intercepted two wooden
boats that apparently were violating the U.N. trade embargo against
Iraq, Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The boats were seized in Kuwait's territorial waters on Sunday,
the ministry's spokesman, Col. Bader Saleh, told The Associated
Press.
	   He said the boats, registered in the United Arab Emirates and
manned by 13 Asian sailors, were carrying dates and fertilizer from
Iraq. Saleh gave no other details.
	   Scores of ships have been intercepted in the Gulf since the
United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions ban air travel to and from the country and
international trade of all commodities, including oil.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has complied with
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed its weaponry and has demanded that
the sanctions be lifted. Baghdad has called on Arab countries to
ignore the trade ban and has actively sought to circumvent it with
shipments of goods overland to neighboring countries and via the
Gulf.

Farmers begin nationwide protest against grain imports

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Protesting farmers blockaded the city hall
in a northwestern Polish town Tuesday, beginning a planned
nationwide demonstration against grain imports and low prices.
	   Four tractors and a trailer filled with grain jammed the access
road to the building in Goleniow, 520 kilometers (320 miles)
northwest of Warsaw, city employee Mariusz Tarnozek said by
telephone Tuesday morning.
	   According to Tarnozek, a banner on the trailer said: ``We have
grain, who will buy it?''
	   The protesters also blocked the main entrance to city hall,
forcing employees and visitors to use the back door, he said,
adding that business proceeded as usual.
	   Four farmers' unions that represent well over half of the
nation's 4 million farmers threatened Monday to block 250 roads,
several government offices and eight border crossings on Tuesday to
protest grain imports and demand government purchases of their
grain.
	   Agriculture Minister Jacek Janiszewski scheduled a news
conference later Tuesday on grain purchases.
	   The government has promised to triple state purchases of Polish
grain and increase custom fees on grain imports beginning Thursday,
and Janiszewski's news conference was expected to announce those
measures to try to prevent the protest.
	   Polish agriculture remains hobbled by small, poorly equipped
farms unable to compete with larger, more modern farms in Western
Europe. Calls for reforms to consolidate farms and make them more
efficient in preparation for Poland's bid to join the European
Union have been resisted by farmers, who fear losing control of
their land and having to work for others.
	   Farmers have staged a series of protests this year demanding
more government protection. In the latest protest, a few dozen
farmers from the Solidarity union on Monday spilled 1,200 tons of
grain brought by train from Slovakia and Hungary across the rails
at a border crossing.

Rich and poor alike affected by Malaysian water shortage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY107 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PUCHONG, Malaysia (AP) _ For nearly 2,000 people in this
low-income housing project, going eight days without water simply
confirmed their belief that Malaysian officials had forgotten them.
	   ``The government gives priority to the rich, and we're neglected
because we're poor,'' said Bak Itam, standing outside her wooden
lean-to where she sells durian fruit and Flying Horse bleach.
	   Authorities finally showed up in this town outside the capital,
Kuala Lumpur, to fix a pump in the communal water tank. Until then,
children stayed home from school, and fathers skipped work to help
the elderly and women carry buckets of water from a nearby fire
station.
	   As nearly 2 million people in the capital and its suburbs head
into their sixth month of strict water rationing, few residents _
rich or poor _ go untouched.
	   Legends to explain the water shortage abound, such as one about
hazardous ammonium in a city reservoir that forced authorities to
turn off the taps. Or the one in which the government is hoarding
water in advance of the prestigious Commonwealth Games next month.
	   Authorities have blamed a drought for depleting rain-fed
reservoirs. But many residents and independent experts, noting that
Malaysia contains many rivers, blame poor planning and
mismanagement.
	   ``You build the biggest airport, the tallest buildings, but they
forgot about the water,'' said Joe Yusof, a retired army general in
Ampang Jaya, a fashionable neighborhood whose residents go for days
without water because their grand homes on hills overlooking the
capital are fed by old pipes and weak pumps.
	   Some people say that Ampang Jaya is serviced by a
disproportionate number of water trucks, with drivers more apt to
stop in front of every home because they receive fatter tips.
Still, the affluent neighborhood, with its retired military
officers, expatriates, diplomats and wealthy Malays, offers proof
that none are immune to rationing.
	   The water shortage finally wore down Canadians Shelly and John
Smith, who live in Ampang Jaya, several doors down from Yusof. They
teach at the international school here, where students share one
bathroom and flush the toilets with bucket water.
	   ``Anywhere else in the world, health officials would have shut
it down,'' said Smith about the school.
	   The Smiths, who have two boys, moved last week to a house with
better water pressure a few miles (kilometers) away.
	   ``How much water is in this sucker? How many flushes?'' Ms.
Smith said she asked her new landlord when eyeing a newly installed
water tank beside the house.
	   Despite hardships created by the shortage, the Smiths said
they'll miss Ampang Jaya. The one virtue of rationing is that many
neighbors here have grown closer, sharing hoses to tap the water
trucks or holding one another's babies while they fill their
buckets.
	   Things aren't always so friendly elsewhere in town, where the
houses are closer together and the lines are longer.
	   Two people were recently injured in the suburb of Petaling Jaya
after people objected to three men cutting into line at the water
truck. The three offenders pulled out knives and machetes to
confront the angry crowd.
	   But such a confrontation is rare among a typically placid people
who are learning not to take water for granted.
	   In the muggy Southeast Asian country where the temperature
averages 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 Celsius), Malaysians
traditionally have bathed twice a day.
	   ``A lot of people are saying we had it so good for so long, so
this is God's way of saying, `Hey, slow down, take care of your
natural resources,''' said Yusof's wife, Nursia.

Sri Lankan government declares emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The Sri Lankan government imposed
emergency rule across the country Tuesday, a move that would allow
President Chandrika Kumaratunga to postpone provincial elections
scheduled for later this month.
	   Military leaders have expressed concern that troops needed to
fight a major campaign against Tamil rebels in the north would have
to be redeployed to secure polling booths.
	   Elections have been scheduled for August 28 in five of the
country's eight provinces.
	   In an executive order, Mrs. Kumaratunga said the emergency was
imposed ``in the interest of public security, the protection of
public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential
to the life of the community.''
	   Government forces have fought for 15 years against Tamil
guerrillas, who want an independent homeland in northeastern Sri
Lanka for the island nation's Tamil minority. The rebels accuse the
majority Sinhalese of discriminating against the Tamils, whom the
colonial British introduced from the Indian mainland as a source of
labor for tea plantations and other projects.
	   The army and rebels are now locked in a stalemate along a vital
north-south highway.
	   A national emergency had been in effect since the war broke out
in 1983. When Mrs. Kumaratunga took office in 1994, she lifted the
regulations except in the embattled north and east, and in the
capital, Colombo.
	   The new regulations give security forces wide powers to search,
detain and investigate.

Tokyo stocks prices decline for second day, dollar falls

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices declined Tuesday for the second
consecutive day, with major banking issues leading the slide. The
U.S. dollar fell against the yen after three sessions of gains.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 141.50 points,
or 0.88 percent, closing at 16,023.58. On Monday, the index had
shed 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   Traders remained unsettled because of the volatile dollar-yen
exchange market and an overnight fall of 96.55 points in the Dow
Jones industrial average on Wall Street.
	   The Nikkei index's decline was restrained by buying by public
pension funds in the afternoon, traders said.
	   They said investors sold banking issues on worries that
restructuring of the nation's banking industry will take a toll on
the sector.
	   Losers also included brokerage and real estate stocks and
non-life insurance issues.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, to 1,234.61. It
had fallen 16.80 points, or 1.33 percent, the previous day.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 668 to 403, with 193 issues
unchanged. An estimated 356 million shares changed hands on the
first section, up from Monday's 299 million.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 144.62 yen, down 1.02 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of
145.60 yen overnight. It ranged between 144.20 yen and 146.05 yen
in Tuesday's trading.
	   In the previous three trading days, the U.S. currency had gained
a total of 4.55 yen to a seven-week high against the yen.
	   Traders said the dollar weakened from its day's high after
Japanese finance officials warned that they would intervene on
currency markets to support the yen if necessary.
	   Haruhiko Kuroda, head of the Finance Ministry's international
bureau, told a regular news conference that Japan was prepared to
take action on what he called the ``excessively weak'' yen.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa also said separately that
intervention in foreign exchange markets is necessary if currency
moves are disruptive. Miyazawa said similar comments he made last
week weren't meant to imply that intervention to support the yen
was unnecessary.
	   But many traders suggested the effect of the latest comments
would be only temporary, and the dollar would climb again soon
because of Japan's gloomy economic outlook.
	   Miyazawa's assertion last week that intervention should occur
only when currency moves are disruptive had prompted dollar buying.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.220 percent from Monday's finish of 1.225 percent,
driving its price up to 111.66 yen from 111.62 yen.

Palestinians reject Israeli `nature reserve' idea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian officials have rejected an Israeli
proposal to make part of a West Bank withdrawal a restricted
``nature reserve,'' negotiator Hassan Asfour said Tuesday, leaving
it unclear whether the sputtering peace talks would go on.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli envoy
Yitzhak Molcho met for several hours Monday night in Jerusalem, but
did not speak to reporters afterward. Erekat briefed Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat on the talks late Monday night.
	   Israeli news reports said Israel was waiting for a Palestinian
response to proposals made at the meeting.
	   After months of stalemate during which the United States failed
to win Israeli backing for a proposal to turn over an additional 13
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control, Israel and the
Palestinians returned to the negotiating table two weeks ago.
	   Asfour told The Associated Press that Israel had proposed that 3
percent of the withdrawal be land in the Judean Desert classified
as a ``nature reserve,'' over which Israel would retain overall
security control.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   Asfour said such Israeli proposals would ``lead to the end of
talks ... If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there
is no need for further meetings.''
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Israelis had offered to give the Palestinians civil authorities
in the 3 percent _ which he said was meaningless because no one
lived in the desert areas.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.
	   ``We think they should deal with each other with respect and
confidentiality and a greater sense of urgency, and meet
intensively, so that they can make sure they've done everything
they can to try to reach an agreement. And they also, as we've said
before, need to make tough decisions. But we want specific
proposals on the table that can be dealt with,'' Rubin said.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A suspected natural gas explosion destroyed an
apartment house in Berlin early Tuesday, trapping at least two
people in a huge pile of rubble.
	   Firefighters had made contact with two trapped survivors and
were working to extricate them, but the fate of eight other people
registered as living in the four-story building was unknown.
	   One couple that managed to get out told rescuers their
13-year-old son was still trapped inside.
	   There was no immediate word on injuries.
	   Some 200 rescue workers searched by hand and with dogs through
the rubble. Heavy equipment could not be used for fear the 5-meter
(16-foot) high pile of rubble would collapse further.
	   Police believe the explosion, which sent a huge cloud of dust
over the Steglitz neighborhood, was caused by natural gas.
Residents of six surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution.

Philippine export growth slows to 12.2 percent in June
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine export growth slowed to
12.2 percent in June despite stronger-than-expected sales of
electronics, the government said Tuesday.
	   The National Statistics Office said exports for the month
totaled dlrs 2.3 billion. For the first six months of the year,
exports rose 18.8 percent to dlrs 13.9 billion, it added.
	   Exports of electronics and components, which accounted for 52
percent of total shipments in June, rose 46 percent from a year
earlier to dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   Garment exports rose 7.4 percent to dlrs 232.3, while exports of
computer inputs and peripheral units rose 9.1 percent to dlrs 148.9
million.
	   While economists had expected a slowdown in overall export
growth, which until a few months ago had been running at more than
20 percent, the robust growth in exports of electronics and
components was a welcome surprise.
	   ``The growth in electronics exports was beyond our expectation.
We were expecting a slowdown because global demand is going down,''
said Joey Cuyegkeng, economist for ING Barings Securities
Philippines Inc.
	   He said the sector appears to be benefiting from the relocation
of foreign electronics manufacturers to the Philippines due to
incentives offered by the country's special economic zones.
	   Despite the slowdown in export growth, Cuyegkeng said the
Philippines is expected to end with a narrower trade deficit by the
end of 1998 due to declining imports.
	   ``Of course this is all due to the slowdown in the economy,''
Cuyegkeng said.
	   The year-old regional financial crisis has taken its toll on
economic activity, resulting in a relatively sharp reduction in
imports. And, while exports have undoubtedly benefited from the
weaker peso, this windfall is expected to taper off over the second
half of 1998 as exporters feel the pressure from a weakening
economy.
	   The government announces imports separately each month.
	   The country's trade deficit shrank 66.1 percent to dlrs 1.60
billion in the first five months of 1998.

Aid agencies struggle to reach Kosovo refugees

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in the
woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to flee
their villages.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was planning an aid
convoy Tuesday for ethnic Albanians near Malisevo, a former
stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, where
thousands of refugees had sought shelter.
	   Serb forces toppled three additional KLA strongholds Monday,
Serb sources said. These included the villages of Lausa, Smonica
and Jablanica. The attacks come days after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic promised to stop his attack on the KLA.
	   Milosevic also pledged last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyber
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province, part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian
leadership said that moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who
met with U.S. envoy Christopher Hill Monday, blamed the Serbs for
exacerbating the problem in Kosovo.
	   ``Serb forces kill civilians, burn and destroy settlements and
entire villages and carry out ethnic cleansing,'' Rugova said. He
also demanded ``energetic intervention by the United States and its
allies.''
	   In Washington Monday, the administration of U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced that NATO had approved a plan to use firepower
against Serb forces in Kosovo, warning that another offensive could
trigger a ``humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium said that a
number of options had been underway for some time, but there was no
military action planned at this stage.
	   There was no immediate word on what would trigger an attack by
NATO. Nor was it clear whether the administration was trying mostly
to unnerve Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
an ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995.

Royals gather for Queen Mother's 98th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment from well-wishers; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Devoted admirers of Queen Mother Elizabeth camped
out overnight to wish a happy 98th birthday Tuesday to Britain's
longest-lived royal.
	   ``I've been looking forward to it more and more each year. It
has become an obsession,'' said Jennifer Hawkins, a 49-year-old
nurse from suburban London who was first in line outside Clarence
House, the Queen Mother's residence.
	   ``I feel she is the nation's favorite grandmother and an
inspiration to us all,'' said Mrs. Hawkins, who staked out her
place Sunday morning.
	   Alan Rudd, a Londoner who was second in line, said he had been
coming to the birthday celebration for 17 years. ``She is so
special. She is very genuine when she talks to you. She is just a
sweet, dear lady,'' he said.
	   Two world wars, the death of her husband, the disappointment of
failed marriages among younger royals, two hip replacements and a
cataract operation _ the mother of Queen Elizabeth II has endured
them all.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
and unsought sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They saw
Britain through the dark days of World War II and reigned until
George VI died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.
	   As the royal family accelerates its program of modernization in
the wake of the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash Aug.
31, the Queen Mother is actively engaged in the life of the nation
and remains for some Britons the favorite royal.
	   ``I think it's important for us all to be here so she can see
how she is loved by the public. This is a special day and we want
to show her how much she is loved,'' said Alan Morton, 53, who
traveled from Edinburgh and got in line Monday morning.
	   ``I met her in person when I was four years old during the
Blitz. She came round to reassure people that they did not have to
leave the country. I have been following her ever since,'' said
Terry Hutt, 63, who wore a Union Jack hat.
	   ``I think she is a nice and gentle lady, she always says thank
you and I think that is worth coming for,'' Hutt said.
	   ``This is the highlight of the year for us royalists. It is a
big reunion,'' said Colin Edwards, 57, from Macclesfield, Cheshire.
	   Gill Corbett, 57, from Hucclecote in western England was in line
with her daughter Helen Edwards, 35, and her 5-year-old
granddaughter, Amy.
	   ``I wanted to wish her a happy birthday. I hope she gets some
jelly and ice cream for her birthday tea. I've brought her a
birthday card and some pink flowers as a birthday present,'' said
Amy, who wore a new pink dress for the occasion.
	   Monday's party plans included the band of the Welsh Guards
playing ``Happy Birthday,'' a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park and a
62-gun salute at the Tower of London, and lunch with Queen
Elizabeth II and other family members at Clarence House.
	   The tabloid Daily Mail marked the birthday of the woman they
called ``Britain's best loved grandmother'' with a double-page
spread of 98 photographs chronicling her life.

5 million methamphetamine tablets seized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Narcotics police have seized 5 million
methamphetamine tablets in a truck coming from the Golden Triangle
region, the largest shipment of the drug ever seized in Myanmar,
official newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Two men, apparently Myanmar citizens, were arrested July 22
after a search at a checkpoint turned up the drugs, broken down
into 25,000 packets, in a secret panel in their vehicle, the
newspapers said.
	   The suspects reportedly confessed that a Thai citizen they had
met near Myanmar's border with China had paid them 2.5 million
kyats (about dlrs 10,000 at unofficial rates) to drive the shipment
to Mandalay, Myanmar's second-largest city.
	   The final destination of the shipment _ five times larger than
the previous record haul seized in June _ was unknown. The drug has
become a scourge in neighboring countries in recent years and,
increasingly, in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Narcotics rings in the Golden Triangle _ where the borders of
Myanmar, Laos and Thailand converge _ traditionally have made and
smuggled heroin, but have been turning to easier-to-make
amphetamines and methamphetamines as a side business.

	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder is a man at ease. The
front-runner all year in the race to govern Germany, he strides
confidently into a room packed with foreign journalists, smoking
his trademark cigar.
	   Seven weeks before voters decide whether he will end Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's 16 years in office, Schroeder is ahead in the polls
and _ by his account _ calling the political shots in a heated
campaign.
	   ``This is of course a comfortable position,'' Schroeder said
during an interview Monday at Lower Saxony's administration
offices, from which he has governed the state since 1990.
	   Confident that he leads the battle at home, Schroeder headed to
Washington on Tuesday to take on Kohl in the one area where the
chancellor holds the advantage: experience on the world stage.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A computer malfunction forced major Japanese lender
Asahi Bank Ltd. to suspend transactions nationwide Tuesday at its
3,499 automatic teller machines and cash dispensers, the bank said.
	   After a five-hour outage, ATM service resumed at 3:37 p.m. (0637

many people were affected by the shutdown.
	   During the outage, he said, the bank accepted withdrawals of up

	   Overseas transactions, handled by another on-line system, were
not affected by the trouble, he added.
	   Sano said the bank is investigating the cause of the trouble.
	   One of Japan's 10 largest commercial banks, Asahi Bank was
formed through the merger of Kyowa Bank and Saitama Bank in 1991.

Newspaper director found guilty of insulting Khomeini
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The managing director of a weekly newspaper
has been found guilty of insulting the late Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini by publishing a letter critical of his
rule, Iranian newspapers said Tuesday
	   A Tehran court on Monday found Mohammad-Reza Za'eri, of the
weekly Khaneh, guilty of ``insulting the Imam and Islamic
sanctities,'' the papers said.
	   The court did not immediately announce a sentence, they said.
Za'eri was freed on bail of 20 million rials (dlrs 6,600) pending
sentencing.
	   Meanwhile, the Tous daily, a pro-democracy paper, was evacuated
late Monday after receiving a bomb threat from an anonymous caller.
	   No bomb was found, and journalists at Tous later resumed work,
editor Mahmoud Shams said Tuesday.
	   Za'eri was arrested last week after the paper published a letter
in which an anonymous young woman criticized Khomeini, the leader
of the 1979 revolution who is called ``the Imam.''
	   Criticism of Khomeini, who led Iran in the 1980-88 war with
Iraq, has been taboo.
	   But the young woman wrote to the paper: ``When I think of
Khomeini, all that comes to mind are the horrifying sounds of the
midnight bombs that used to fall on Tehran, and the blood of
thousands of innocent young Iranians who died in that war.''
	   She added: ``Do you call me to follow someone who has
transformed Iran into an international terrorist state with his
order to murder Salman Rushdie?''
	   Khomeini ordered Muslims to kill Rushdie for insulting Islam in
his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
	   On July 27, militants threw a small petrol bomb at the offices
of Khaneh and then called editors to threaten further action if the
paper didn't change its policies. No one was injured in the
incident.
	   Tous, which was evacuated because of the bomb scare, has been at
the center of a power struggle between hard-liners and reformists
inside Iran's Islamic government.
	   Shams, who was assaulted by Muslim militants allied with the
hard-liners earlier this week, said Tuesday that the paper had
received a call Monday evening from a man who said ``there was a
bomb on the second floor of our building which would explode in a
half hour.''
	   Shams said he ordered the paper's 80-odd employees to evacuate
and then called police. Police and a bomb disposal squad arrived
about an hour later but found no explosive device, he said.
	   Tous began as the daily Jameah but was closed down last month by
hard-liners opposed to the reforms of Iran's moderate president,
Mohammad Khatami. The paper then changed its name to Tous and
continued publishing.
	   The authorities then ordered Tous to close but later rescinded
the directive.

Russian protesters' jeer arrival of U.S. naval ship

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ About 50 Russian protesters jeered as
the American naval ship USS Germantown docked Tuesday in this
Pacific port in preparation for two days of military exercises with
Russian sailors.
	   While Russian and American sailors hailed the cooperation
between the formal rivals, the demonstrators from communist and
nationalist groups waved Soviet-era flags and sang patriotic songs
on a pier in protest of the ship's arrival.
	   The maneuvers are part of the Cooperation at Sea exercises, and
more than 1,200 participants will take part in the exercises, which
will simulate a response to a natural disaster. It's the third time
since 1994 that the U.S. 7th Fleet and Russia's Pacific Fleet have
held joint exercises.
	   U.S. naval officers said they were unfazed by the small group of
protesters.
	   ``We as Americans are used to these sort of events,'' said Vice
Admiral Harry Highfill. ``These people have this right and this is
the voice of freedom speaking. It doesn't bother us.''
	   The demonstrators have held several protests and local political
leaders have also condemned the exercises. This led Russian navy
commanders to move the actual maneuvers to small islands 100
kilometers (62 miles) south of Vladivostok, instead of staging them
on the city's outskirts as originally planned.
	   Some opponents of the exercises have threatened to block the
maneuvers with small fishing vessels.
	   ``These (protesters) just want political dividends out of
this,'' said Russian Pacific Fleet spokesman Alexander Kosolapov.
``I have no idea who these people even are. Everything we tell them
just goes in one ear and out the other.''

Russian miners ease blockade of power plant in Far East

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With coal supplies dwindling, striking miners
eased their blockade Tuesday of the main power plant on the eastern
island of Sakhalin, agreeing to allow enough coal through to keep
the plant operational.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of overdue
wages, have been blocking railroad approaches to the plant for
nearly two weeks. They agreed that 25 cars carrying about 1,500
tons of coal could go to the plant daily, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   But authorities will continue rationing electricity on the Far
Eastern island, the reports said. Homes and factories on Sakhalin
have been getting only between five and six hours of electricity a
day, it added.
	   Sakhalin Deputy Gov. Ivan Malakhov called the protest a
``terrorist'' act, ITAR-Tass said. But his boss, Gov. Igor
Farkhutdinov, disputed the accusation and revoked an earlier threat
to use force to remove the miners.
	   ``No one is going to use force,'' Farkhutdinov was quoted as
saying. ``It is not terrorism; it is an act of despair.''
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant for electricity. About
650,000 people live on the island.
	   The strike is one of many miners' protests over unpaid wages in
recent months. But the protests have been largely uncoordinated and
in most instances have inflicted only limited damage on the
economy.
	   In a related protest, ambulance workers in the eastern port city
of Vladivostok went on strike Tuesday to demand four months of back
wages.
	   There are usually 30 ambulances on duty, but only four ambulance
teams will stay on the job, and will respond only to calls
involving children or accident victims, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In the Ural Mountains, coal miners from the Chelyabinsk region
were blocking the Argayashskaya power plant, which supplies energy
to nuclear-waste processing enterprise Mayak, the business daily
Kommersant said.
	   Authorities have cut all power to the town of Ozersk, where the
Mayak plant is located, Kommersant said. Civil defense workers have
been sent to the region to ensure the safety of nuclear storage
sites, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Meanwhile, miners in the Siberian coal center of Kemerovo lifted
all railroad blockades Tuesday, allowing the traffic to pass
unimpeded for the first time in at least a month, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A governmental commission had spent two weeks negotiating with
miners in Kemerovo, and the region's coal companies have begun
paying back wages, the report said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's average household spent 307,853 yen (dlrs
2,130) in June, down 1.0 percent from the year-earlier month in
real terms, a government report said Tuesday.
	   The Statistics Bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency
said June marked the eighth consecutive month of declines from
year-earlier levels.
	   The propensity for wage earners to consume, a ratio that
measures the amount of disposable income that went to household
spending, rose to 77.0 percent from 69.7 percent in May on a
seasonally adjusted nominal basis, the agency said. The ratio hit a
record low 68.4 percent in February.
	   The data confirmed that the weakening of the labor market has
continued to discourage consumers from spending. Sluggish household
spending in turn is weighing on output and further depressing labor
demand, creating a vicious cycle. Japan's unemployment rate rose to
a record 4.3 percent in June from 4.1 percent in May.
	   For the first six months of 1998, household spending averaged
321,638 yen (dlrs 2,224) per month, down 3.1 percent from average
monthly outlays in the January-June period last year in real terms,
the agency said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's army, short of cash because
of the country's economic crisis, is encouraging its troops to take
a month's unpaid leave, the Bangkok Post reported Tuesday.
	   The army's budget for troop daily allowances is only sufficient
for 11 months of the year, and some army units are short of fuel
for their vehicles, the paper said.
	   Training budgets have also been cut by 60 percent, and Army
Commander in Chief Gen. Chetta Thanajaro has ordered commanders to
suspend construction and procurement projects and divert the money
to training programs.
	   The army has also launched projects where soldiers grow their
own food on bases to cut costs.
	   Thailand is battling its worst economic crisis in modern times,
and the military, once immune to budget cuts because of its history
of launching coups, has also had to reduce its expenses.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A consortium using the
French-designed TGV high-speed train technology has been chosen to
link Sydney and the national capital, Canberra, Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday.
	   The Speedrail consortium, a 50-50 venture between GEC Alsthom of
France and Leighton Contractors of Australia, was chosen over a
German rival using magnetic levitation technology.
	   Howard said the train, which would travel at speeds up to 320
kilometers an hour (198 mph), would make the 285-kilometer
(180-mile) journey in 81 minutes.
	   The train will operate between Sydney and Canberra by the end of
2003, Howard said.
	   The project is expected to cost U.S. dlrs 2.1 billion (3.5
billion Australian dollars).
	   Speedrail will build, run and operate the link for 30 years. It
will then be transferred to public ownership.
	   The consortium was asked to supply technology that could later
extend links to Australia's second-biggest city, Melbourne, and the
Queensland capital, Brisbane.
	   ___
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine food and beverage
conglomerate San Miguel Corp. said Tuesday its packaging unit,
Rightpak International Corp., is in talks with a foreign entity to
explore the possibility of an alliance.
	   No definite agreement has been reached. San Miguel declined to
identify the foreign entity.
	   The entry of a foreign partner in Rightpak is seen as a means to
further improve the company's performance. Rightpak is one of the
country's leading packaging concerns, producing bottles, cartons
and other types of packaging products. It serves the needs of San
Miguel and other clients.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Unemployment in Singapore could rise as high as
7 percent next year, with 126,000 people out of work, if the
economy slides into a recession, a labor union leader was quoted as
saying Tuesday in a local newspaper.
	   Singapore needs economic growth of 3-4 percent to absorb new
entrants into the work force each year, said Lim Swee Say, deputy
secretary-general of the National Trades Union Congress, according
to the Business Times.
	   A 7 percent unemployment rate would be the highest in many
decades, and higher than the 5-6 percent rate in the mid-1980s
recession, the daily said.
	   ___
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China Motor Corp., Taiwan's largest
commercial vehicle maker and sole producer of Japan's
Mitsubishi-brand vehicles in Taiwan, on Tuesday reported 6.62
billion Taiwan dollars (dlrs 192.4 million) in July sales, a 59
percent jump from a year earlier.
	   Sales for the first seven months of 1998 also grew to 35.16
billion Taiwan dollars (dlrs 1.02 billion) from 27 billion Taiwan
dollars (dlrs 784.7 million) in the corresponding period last year,
the company said in a statement.
	   The company credited the good performance to good auto sales.
	   In July, the company's auto sales rose 36 percent from a year
earlier to 13,008. In the first seven months of the year, China
Motor sold 75,184 cars, up 18 percent from a year earlier, the
company said.

All Sydney water now safe, health official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with water upgrade announced, consumer spokeswoman
comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Sydney's water was declared safe for
drinking Tuesday, clearing the way for the city's 3 million-plus
residents to begin drinking straight from the tap.
	   ``We are absolutely clear that the water is safe to drink,'' New
South Wales chief health officer Andrew Wilson said Tuesday after
the entire city was given the all-clear after more than a week of
having to boil water.
	   The culprit was an outbreak of the potentially deadly
microscopic parasites giardia and cryptosporidium. It was a severe
embarrassment for the city that will play host to the 2000 Summer
Olympics.
	   Wilson said the health department would continue to monitor the
number of people reported to be suffering from illnesses related to
water contamination for the next two weeks to ensure the water
scare had not had an impact on people's health.
	   Fear and anger among city residents has continued since the
dangerous parasites were found.
	   ``Opening the tap and drinking water is something we take for
granted, and what has happened with the water makes me understand
what people in Third World countries go through,'' said Sydney
resident Rick Turansky.
	   The health department said there had been no reported cases of
illness from water contamination, but the parasites have an
incubation period of a week or more.
	   The water treatment plant that had spread the parasites has been
cleaned up and the city's water system was flushed with clean
water.
	   By Monday night, 104 suburbs in the west and south of the city,
housing more than 600,000 of the city's 3.7 million people, had
been given the go-ahead to resume drinking tap water.
	   On Tuesday, the all-clear was given for the entire city.
	   Sydney Water board chairman David Hill later announced a U.S.
dlrs 21 million upgrade of the city's water supply.
	   Hill said the board endorsed a series of improvements including
improved water storage controls and daily monitoring of water
filtration outlets.
	   ``They are extensive measures,'' said Hill. ``It is as much as
we possibly could do to ensure that we don't see cryptosporidium
and giardia in drinking water in the future.''
	   A consumer group spokeswoman said public confidence in the water
system had been shattered by the contamination crisis, and that it
would take considerable time for trust to be restored.
	   ``The case of rebuilding will be very high,'' Australian
Consumers Association spokeswoman Mara Bun said.
	   ``Consumers will have to buy unnecessary water filters and
bottled water and the regulators (Sydney Water) will have to
demonstrate that they have regained our trust,'' she said.
	   Bun said she would not be surprised if consumers did not
immediately return to drinking or using tap water.
	   ``It's absolutely understandable; those who have been
comfortable will follow public advice but those who feel cautious
will go out and buy filters and keep taking precautions, and as
time goes by, the public's trust will have to be regained.''
	   Giardia and cryptosporidium are most dangerous to people who
already have weakened immune systems, including those suffering
from AIDS.
	   Cryptosporidium got into the water supply of Milwaukee in 1993,
contributing to the deaths of about 100 people. More than 400,000
others became ill.

Rejuvenated Castro emerges as a champion of Caribbean rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Casting himself as a champion of
Caribbean economic rights, Cuban President Fidel Castro wrapped up
a three-island tour that showed his communist island to be a
powerful _ and popular _ influence in the region.
	   Castro received warm welcomes in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada,
even from past foes, and won strong support for his demand that the
United States drop its 38-year economic boycott against Cuba.
	   He reciprocated by attacking Washington's challenge to the
European Union's preferential trade terms for Caribbean bananas _ a
benefit seen as a lifeline for many of the vulnerable island
economies.
	   Coming from Castro, the denunciation exemplified a seductive
anti-capitalist ideology: Powerful nations owe smaller ones a slice
of the world market, whatever the free markets might dictate.
	   ``Countries with different degrees of development cannot be
treated equally,'' Castro told thousands of cheering Jamaicans at
Kingston's Nelson Mandela Park. ``It would not be fair, it would
not be humane.''
	   Castro also criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement,
which links the United States, Canada and Mexico, for allegedly
robbing the Caribbean of more than 100,000 jobs.
	   That message is perfectly tailored to the concerns of tiny
nations dangerously dependent on limited sources of income _
tourism, textiles, bananas, sugar _ and jittery about the emergence
of a single global economy in which they cannot compete.
	   It also comes at a time when Caribbean nations are frustrated
with Washington for failing to develop a hemispheric vision that
includes the Caribbean. Instead, the United States has reduced aid
to the eastern Caribbean from dlrs 225 million in 1985 to dlrs 26
million in 1996 and closed the regional U.S. aid mission in
Barbados.
	   By contrast, Cuba increased donations in the region from an
estimated dlrs 5 million in 1995 to as much as dlrs 20 million.
More than 200 Cuban engineers, technicians, doctors, health workers
and sports trainers work throughout the Caribbean; more than 240
Caribbean students study for free at Cuban universities.
	   Castro's tour included powerful symbols of rapprochement, too.
	   In Barbados, Castro dedicated a memorial bearing the names of 73
people killed when a Cuban airliner was bombed out of the sky off
the island 22 years ago _ an attack blamed on Cuban exiles.
	   In Grenada, Castro unveiled a plaque commemorating Cuba's help
in building the island's international airport _ the work of armed
Cuban construction workers whom U.S. troops fought and expelled in
a 1983 invasion. The airport was completed by Americans.
	   In both Jamaica and Barbados, Castro participated in ceremonies
marking the emancipation of slaves in the 1830s _ with only a few
people noting the irony of honoring a communist dictator at a
celebration of freedom.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said the
United States hoped the Caribbean leaders ``will discuss (with
Castro) how Cuba needs to move towards democracy.''
	   Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell told a news conference
before Castro departed that Caribbean leaders have ``consistently''
raised the issue of democracy but that it was better discussed in
private.
	   Still, if anything, the leaders' public comments were directed
at the United States.
	   Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur, for example, said
misgivings about Castro's government should be addressed by the
United States through ``constructive engagement,'' as Washington
does with its qualms about China.
	   ``The alternative to constructive engagement is to go back to
the old process of sanctions,'' which haven't worked, Arthur said.
	   And Jamaican Premier P.J. Patterson declared unapologetically
that ``Jamaica will continue to give the fullest support in
ensuring Cuba's reintegration within the hemispheric system.''
	   Even Edward Seaga, the former conservative Jamaican leader who
once severed his country's ties with Havana, admitted ``we have
come to the end'' of the conflict with Castro's Cuba.

Hong Kong share prices close generally higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
generally higher on bargain-hunting Tuesday, a day after the key
index tumbled 4.8 percent.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 28.03 points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 7,580.80. On Monday,
the index had slumped 383.43 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 5.14 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
658 million), up from Monday's 4.74 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 607 million).
	   Brokers said share prices fell for most of the session following
Monday's government announcement that the territory's economy
shrank by 2.8 percent in the first quarter instead of the 2.0
percent estimated earlier.
	   But a late bout of bargain-hunting pushed the key index into
positive territory.
	   Among gainers, Hang Seng Bank rose 2.60 Hong Kong dollars to
39.30, Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 60 cents to 25.00, Hutchison
Whampoa rose 30 cents to 36.00, and Hong Kong Telecom rose 10 cents
to 14.00.
	   Going against the trend was HSBC Holdings, which fell 1 dollar
to 178.00. HSBC Holdings announced Monday that its net profit fell
16 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.40 billion in the first half of this
year.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Authorities said they could not rule out arson
as the cause of a fire Tuesday inside a train station at the center
of a row with neighboring Malaysia.
	   The small fire in the Tanjong Pagar station bordering the
city-state's financial district was put out by the Civil Defense
Force about 15 minutes after it was reported Tuesday morning, the
force said in a statement.
	   ``We are still investigating and therefore not ruling out any
possibilities,'' spokesman Capt. Koh Chin Yee told The Associated
Press.
	   The fire broke out about 50 yards (45 meters) from where
Malaysian officers were conducting their country's immigration
formalities against the wishes of the Singapore government.
	   The station was operating normally, with passengers waiting for
the next train as the fire was extinguished. No one was evacuated
during the fire, the statement added.
	   Government television quoted the Civil Defense Force as saying
foul play could not be ruled out. The blaze erupted among wooden
partitions in an unused lounge, burning parts of the room and
bursting windows.
	   The station has been at the center of a simmering dispute
between Singapore and Malaysia over the location of their customs
and immigration checkpoints along the railway line that connects
the two countries.
	   Singapore moved its border post to a checkpoint in the north of
the island Saturday, despite objections from Malaysia, which said
it preferred to remain at Tanjong Pagar.

State of emergency declared in forest fire area near Athens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities declared a state of emergency
in areas near Athens on Tuesday as 300 firefighters and 200
soldiers battled a huge forest fire raging for a second day.
	   Evidence suggested the blazes could be the work of arsonists,
officials said.
	   Seven firefighting planes and two Chinook helicopters assisted
efforts to battle the wind-whipped blaze, which was rekindled
during the night after being brought under control.
	   The blaze reportedly damaged several houses and a German World
War II cemetery and led to the evacuation of a convent, a military
hospital and a home for disabled children.
	   The fire began late Sunday at the foot of Mount Pendeli about
four kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern
suburbs.
	   Local officials have said anonymous telephone callers on Sunday
threatened to burn local forests. Fire brigade and police radio
frequencies were jammed Monday by callers shouting obscenities and
reporting fires far from the actual blazes.
	   ``There was an attempt to terrorize firefighting forces and
cause anxiety,'' said Public Order Minister Giorgos Romeos.
	   No injuries due to the fires were reported. Blazes in the
Pendeli area in past years have left much of the mountainside a
landscape of charred stumps.
	   In another brush fire, flames threatened some ancient sites
including the small amphitheater at Epidavros, about 60 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Athens, media reports said.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

Fugitives proving hard to catch in Russia's remote northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Despite police assurances that three fugitives
would soon be caught, the men remained at-large Tuesday, four days
after escaping from a remote prison in Russia's far northeast, a
news report said.
	   Police originally said the escapees would be easily caught
because there is nowhere to hide in the Arctic tundra on the
Chukotka peninsula, which extends into the Bering Sea.
	   But snow, rain, and fog have helped the fugitives elude capture
and police say one of the escapees, a local resident, has extensive
knowledge of the region, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The three men were part of a group of 11 convicts who killed a
police officer and stole a large number of weapons while escaping
from prison Friday and fleeing in two stolen trucks and an armored
vehicle into the tundra near the Leningradsky settlement.
	   Two convicts and two police were killed in a shootout that
followed. One escapee committed suicide and five more were
captured.
	   Law enforcement officials, who have permission to shoot on
sight, said the fugitives would be caught soon because of cold
weather and lack of food, according to ITAR-Tass.

Defector accuses North Korea of kidnappings, forgery, drug

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A North Korean defector said Tuesday he saw two
kidnapped Japanese working at a spy-training center in the
reclusive country, bolstering allegations that the communist
government has abducted several foreigners since the 1970s.
	   The ex-spy, An Myung-jin, identified the two Japanese as Megumi
Yokota, who vanished from northwest Japan in 1977 at age 13, and
Shuichi Ichikawa, who was 23 when he disappeared in 1978.
	   Tokyo has accused Pyongyang of kidnapping 10 Japanese and taking
them to North Korea, presumably to work as language instructors,
though some groups say the number could be as high as 50. The
allegations, which North Korea denies, are a major sticking point
between the two governments.
	   An said he saw a total of four Japanese, as well as Chinese and
Westerners of unknown nationality. He had no other details on their
identities.
	   He said he vividly recalled seeing Yokota held against her will
at a special spy-training school in North Korea. She had
disappeared while on her way home from school badminton practice.
	   ``Frankly speaking, she was young and pretty. That's why I
remember her,'' the former North Korean agent said at a news
conference in Tokyo.
	   An, who defected in 1993, said abductions were not the only
``crimes'' committed by the North.
	   He said he had seen forged dlrs 100 bills so finely crafted that
they could pass unnoticed through U.S. counterfeit detection
machines, and had seen opium-based drugs that were secretly being
produced for sale in the West.
	   Despite recent efforts to improve relations with the rest of the
world since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, North Korea hasn't
stopped these operations, he said.
	   ``I think such crimes will continue unless the world keeps an
eye on North Korea and blames it,'' said An, who now lives in South
Korea, where he said the government protects him from the North,
which ``dreams about killing me.''
	   North Korea has been regularly sending agents into Japan
disguised as Japanese fishermen to spy on U.S. military bases
there, he said. Some of the Japanese, including Yokota, were seized
after they accidentally stumbled across these agents.
	   Once in North Korea, the foreigners were used at spy schools to
teach agents the languages and customs of their home countries, An
said.
	   The North also stole the abductees' identities, he said. Two
North Korean agents using forged Japanese passports were arrested
for planting a bomb on a Korean airliner that killed all 120 on
board in 1987.
	   An said Japanese have been a favorite target for abduction
because of resentment over their country's colonial rule of the
Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945 and Japan's backing of
capitalist South Korea after World War II.

Russian government seeks to abolish death penalty by next April
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian government is committed to abolishing
the death penalty by April 1999, the justice minister said Tuesday.
	   However, it's still not clear if the opposition-led parliament
will go along with the government's wishes.
	   The Justice Ministry has been working on amendments to the
nation's criminal code that would eliminate capital punishment,
Justice Minister Pavel Krasheninnikov said Tuesday.
	   ``We shall meet our international obligations,'' Krasheninnikov
was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency.
	   Russia promised to halt the death penalty when it joined the
Council of Europe in January 1996. Nonetheless, 92 people were
executed that year before President Boris Yeltsin imposed a
moratorium.
	   While Yeltsin is able to introduce many new policies by decree,
the amendments to the criminal code would almost certainly need to
be approved by parliament _ and many members oppose a ban on the
death penalty.
	   With no ban in place, Russian courts have continued handing down
death sentences and about 1,000 people are now on death row,
according to Amnesty International, the human rights group.
	   However, no one has been executed for about two years.

Floods in eastern Russia leave 6,000 homeless
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two swollen rivers in the southeastern region of
Chita have flooded 32 settlements and left more than 6,000 people
homeless, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Emergency workers, including police and army troops, were
evacuating residents from settlements along the Shilka and Nercha
rivers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Local officials declared a state of emergency in the region. No
deaths have been linked to the flooding.
	   Weather forecasters said high water levels may persist until the
weekend, when a hurricane that swept in from Mongolia was likely to
dissipate, according to ITAR-Tass.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ As officials recounted some ballots
from last week's elections, opposition leaders insisted anew
Tuesday that their complaints about electoral fraud be resolved
before they consider joining Cambodian leader Hun Sen in a
coalition government.
	   ``No coalition will be discussed before the recounting is
complete,'' Sam Rainsy said after meeting opposition ally Prince
Norodom Ranariddh early Tuesday. ``We insist on the recount of
ballots to be completed properly.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is the top vote-getter in 17
of the 20 electoral districts whose results have been announced so
far. Complete preliminary election results should become known
Wednesday, when the last three districts are expected to be
announced.
	   A projection by the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, an independent election monitoring group, gives Hun Sen's
CPP 64 seats, Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy Party 15
in the 122-seat parliament.
	   A recount of ballots from three communes in the southern
province of Takeo began at a snail's pace Tuesday, scrutinized by
party observers and independent poll watchers who immediately cried
foul when one of the ballot bags appeared to be missing a report
listing the total number of voters.
	   Sam Rainsy said his party suspects irregularities in as many as
700 _ or close to half _ of the country's communes. He urged
elections officials to speed up their work if they want the new
government to be formed on time. He said he has already filed
complaints about irregularities in about 250 communes.
	   It was not clear whether the election committee planned any more
recounts after the Takeo communes were completed, or how it might
decide which areas require new tallies.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Hun
Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.
	   But the opposition has listed a string of complaints about fraud
and irregularities and has threatened to boycott the National
Assembly when the next session opens Sept. 24 if its concerns are
not met.
	   ``If they do not agree to recounting, we will not agree to
discuss anything else. There will be a deadlock,'' Sam Rainsy told
reporters, adding that recounting was neither particularly
difficult nor costly.
	   Hun Sen said he wants a new government to be formed quickly so
that Cambodia can win back its seat at the United Nations, which
has been left vacant since last year's coup.
	   He also wants Cambodia to be admitted as a full member in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where it now enjoys
observer status.
	   A National Election Committee spokesman apologized Tuesday for
delays in the recounts, saying they resulted from inexperience.
	   Samraing Kamsan denied accusations that the NEC was stalling to
give advantage to Hun Sen's CPP, as has been alleged by members of
the opposition.
	   Hun Sen has warned that if the opposition carried out its threat
not to attend the National Assembly, he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one.
	   He also said his current government could simply remain in
power.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.

Philippine police chief accused of killing prisoner in target
</HEADLINE>
practice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The National Police Commission said
Tuesday it is investigating a police chief accused of fatally
shooting a prisoner while trying to hit a plastic bottle placed on
the inmate's shoulder.
	   Prisoner San-ur Sibay was killed July 22 in Kabugao in northern
Kalinga Apayao province, said police commission Vice Chairman Leo
Magahum.
	   Magahum said police chief Marner Dasayon reported that he shot
Sibay after the prisoner grabbed a gun from a police escort in an
escape attempt.
	   But witnesses said Dasayon forced Sibay to stand still and
placed a plastic bottle on his shoulder for target practice.
Dasayon's shot missed the bottle and hit Sibay in the neck, killing
him, they said.
	   Ambaro Sagle, Sibay's uncle, said Dasayon was drunk at the time
of the shooting.
	   ``He was bragging about how good a gun expert he was,'' Sagle
said. ``He made my nephew into a toy for target practice.''
	   Sibay reportedly was to have been released in a few days after
charges of causing serious injuries in a fight were dropped.
	   Congressman Elias Bulut filed a case against Dasayon with the
police commission, which investigates police wrongdoing, after no
report of the incident was filed in Kabugao.
	   ``I wish to state that we are still government by the rule of
law and not of man,'' Bulut said. ``The act of summarily executing
a mere suspect of a crime in public view is the highest degree of
barbarism.''
	   No formal charges have been filed against Dasayon, and he has
not been relieved of his duty.

Policeman awakes from coma after World Cup attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French policeman has awoken from a coma,
six weeks after being clubbed over the head by German thugs during
the World Cup, hospital officials said Tuesday.
	   Daniel Nivel, 44, regained consciousness on Monday, and was
taken off a respirator. He was expected to begin rehabilitation in
the next few weeks, Lille hospital said in a statement.
	   ``Daniel Nivel spends several hours per day in an armchair,''
the statement said. ``He suffers serious problems concerning
understanding and speech and will need extensive rehabilitation.''
	   The hospital added that Nivel also was suffering from muscular
problems on his right side.
	   Nivel was attacked by a group of German fans shortly after a
June 21 World Cup match between Germany and Yugoslavia in this
northern French town.
	   At the time of the attack, Nivel was guarding a police vehicle
near the stadium. He was hit on the back of the head with an iron
bar.
	   Four suspects are in custody in Germany, facing charges of joint
attempted murder and causing serious bodily harm as well as
disturbing the peace. Another suspect is being held in France.
	   German prosecutors say they believe they have most of the
suspects, but added that their investigation remained open.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities have detained more
than 400 suspected counterfeiters and uncovered more than 2,300
cases of fake currency notes being distributed in the first half of
this year, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Police also found 16 workshops producing counterfeit Ukrainian
hryvna, U.S. dollars, Russian rubles and Italian lira, Kievskiye
Vedomosti said, citing the Interior Ministry.
	   A total of 440 people involved in producing and distributing
counterfeit money were facing charges, the report added.
	   Most of the fake money was produced with the help of computers
and color printers or photo copiers, it said. Counterfeiters favor
10- and 20-hryvna notes, worth dlrs 5 to 10 at the current exchange
rate, which they then try to dispose of in outlying villages,
according to the report.

area, CLARIFY that area is 3 percent of West Bank &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators rejected an Israeli
proposal to make part of a West Bank withdrawal a restricted
``nature reserve'' where they would have no security authority,
leaving it unclear Tuesday whether the sputtering peace talks would
go on.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli envoy
Yitzhak Molcho met for several hours Monday night in Jerusalem, but
did not speak to reporters afterward. Erekat briefed Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat on the talks late Monday night.
	   Israeli news reports said Israel was waiting for a Palestinian
response to proposals made at the meeting.
	   After months of stalemate during which the United States failed
to win Israeli backing for a proposal to turn over an additional 13
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control, Israel and the
Palestinians returned to the negotiating table two weeks ago.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told The Associated Press
on Tuesday that Israel had proposed that 3 of the 13 percent be
land in the Judean Desert classified as a ``nature reserve,'' over
which Israel would retain overall security control.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   Asfour said such Israeli proposals would ``lead to the end of
talks ... If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there
is no need for further meetings.''
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Israelis had offered to give the Palestinians civil authorities
in the nature reserve areas _ which he said was meaningless because
no one lived in the desert areas.
	   The Palestinians would not, however, be allowed to have either a
security presence or to build in the area, another official said,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.
	   ``We think they should deal with each other with respect and
confidentiality and a greater sense of urgency, and meet
intensively, so that they can make sure they've done everything
they can to try to reach an agreement. And they also, as we've said
before, need to make tough decisions. But we want specific
proposals on the table that can be dealt with,'' Rubin said.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel suffered
from an irregular heartbeat on Tuesday and has developed pneumonia,
doctors said.
	   A statement from the presidential spokesman did not classify
Havel's immediate condition but said the situation ``is being
worked on intensively.''
	   ``The course of the president's treatment was complicated by
arrhythmia this morning,'' spokesman Martin Krafl said.
	   According to the statement, the beginning of pneumonia was
confirmed by computer tomography.
	   Havel remains in intensive care after undergoing surgery on July
26 to close a colostomy.

Kosovo boy killed by robbers in Albania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ An 8-year-old boy from Kosovo was killed
and four other refugees from the embattled Serbian province were
wounded when robbers attacked them in Albania, newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   The attack reportedly occurred early Monday near Lezha, 55
kilometers (35 miles) north of the capital Tirana. The assailants,
wearing masks, shot at the minibus carrying nine refugees when the
driver refused their demands to stop, the independent papers Gazeta
Shqiptare and Koha Jone said.
	   Six people were arrested in the attack, according to the
newspapers. Police did not immediately confirm the report.
	   More than 12,000 refugees from Kosovo have fled their homes into
Albania in the past several months to escape violent clashes that
began following a crackdown by Serb-led security forces on Kosovo
Albanian separatists. Hundreds of others have died.

One drowns, one hurt as torrential rain hits Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One man drowned, another was hurt in a landslide
and 10,000 residents evacuated their homes Tuesday as the heaviest
rain in more than 80 years deluged north central Japan, officials
said.
	   Rains as heavy as 97 millimeters (3.8 inches) an hour hit
Niigata prefecture (state) early Tuesday, the hardest downpour
since the Central Meteorological Agency began compiling statistics
in 1914, the agency said.
	   Kiri Kobayashi, 77, drowned after he fell into a ditch and was
washed away on Sado Island, 325 kilometers (201 miles) north of
Tokyo, the Niigata Prefectural Police reported.
	   In Tochio City, just south of the prefectural capital of
Niigata, Ryokitsu Sano, 69, suffered a knee injury when hit by a
landslide.
	   In Sasakami, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of Tokyo, an
entire village of 9,700 residents was evacuated when a river
overflowed and broke a dike, a prefectural government spokesman
said. Some 900 others in other villages in Niigata were also
evacuated.
	   Niigata police said two houses were destroyed in landslides, and
12,903 had been flooded by midafternoon Tuesday. Police also
reported landslides at 45 places, 37 cases of road damage, three
bridges washed away and dikes broken in three places.
	   Electricity to 29,000 households in the city of Niigata was cut
off after two transformer substations were flooded, Kyodo News
service quoted local utility officials as saying. Some 12,800
households were still without electricity at midday, it said.
	   Most trains to Niigata city have been suspended.
	   Although rain weakened later Tuesday, the weather agency issued
new warnings of torrential rains and possible floods.

Legislators say Hong Kong should consider deficit spending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES graf 3 with Hang Seng index closing slightly higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With no relief in sight for Hong Kong's
economy, the territory's largest political party is urging
officials not to dismiss deficit spending to ease the pain of its
struggling citizens.
	   On top of announcements Monday on its gross domestic product,
corporate earnings, layoffs and stock prices, the territory is
bracing for more bad news.
	   The stock market, after plunging 4.8 percent Monday, dropped
another 1.5 percent in early trading Tuesday. It rebounded later,
closing with a slight gain.
	   Monday's string of bad news also included a poor earnings report
by giant HSBC Holdings for this year's first six months, retail
layoffs and new government figures indicating that the economy
contracted more than originally thought in the first quarter of the
year.
	   More poor earnings reports are expected later in the week.
Cathay Pacific, the struggling airline, announces results on
Wednesday. Swire Pacific, which owns 44 percent of the airline and
also is heavily invested in the battered property market, announces
its first-half results on Thursday.
	   Hong Kong has become used to continuous growth in the past
decade. Instead, the economy shrank 2.8 percent in the first
quarter, and officials said Monday that results for the April-June
quarter are likely to be worse. Even in the second half of the
year, there will be no miracle turnaround, Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang said Monday.
	   As a way of maintaining financial discipline, the territory
customarily ties any spending increases to the economic growth
rate.
	   Measures that the government already has taken may lead to a
small deficit this year. Yeung Sum, a senior leader of Hong Kong's
Democratic Party, said the current economic troubles mean there is
likely to be very little growth next year, and little room for
increased spending to help struggling residents.
	   In comments to the South China Morning Post published Tuesday,
he urged the government not to ``blindly follow the rules.''
	   Yeung was quoted as saying the government should be flexible
enough to allow a deficit ``for an exceptional year in order to
meet the rising expectations of the community for livelihood
improvement.''
	   He said the government should reconsider the party's proposal to
return some of the salary and profit tax payments for the 1996-1997
tax year to struggling residents, whose income and investments both
have been hit hard.
	   Unemployment is at a 15-year high of 4.5 percent, and much
higher in some sectors. A union survey released over the weekend
indicated it had reached 17 percent in the retail and department
store sector. Other workers who kept their jobs were facing wage
cuts or freezes.
	   The stock and property markets have fallen dramatically in the
past year, and some analysts estimated the losses have cut assets
of Hong Kong residents by 4 trillion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 516
billion).

Trans-Siberian, Chinese railroads to be linked
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A link between the Trans-Siberian and Chinese
railroads will be completed later this month in the Russian Far
East, a news report said Tuesday.
	   The section between Russia's Makhalino and China's Hunchun
stations will handle 500,00 tons of cargo in each of the next two
years, and will reach the capacity of 3 million tons by 2002, said
Alexander Lashin, deputy transportation chief in Russia's Primorye
region, in the Far East.
	   The railroad will also handle passenger runs, Lashing was quoted
as saying by Interfax news agency.
	   Trade between Russia and China has been increasing following the
Soviet breakup and the opening of long-sealed borders.

Former East German prosecutor gets 1 1/2 years for perversion of
</HEADLINE>
justice &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ A former East German prosecutor was
convicted Tuesday of perversion of justice and wrongful deprivation
of liberty in three cases and given a suspended sentence of 18
months.
	   The state court in Leipzig also ordered Heinz Kurzke, 68, to pay
2,400 marks (dlrs 1,355) to the Buchenwald Foundation for support
of a memorial at the former Nazi concentration near Weimar.
	   Chief Judge Erich Drath said that Kurzke was clearly motivated
by politics when he prosecuted and obtained prison terms for three
East Germans who broke no laws, but only wanted to resettle in the
West between 1985 and 1987.
	   Kurzke said he accepted the verdict and would not appeal, even
though his defense lawyer had asked for a ruling of innocent during
the short two-session trial that opened last Thursday.
	   Since unification in 1990, numerous former East German justice
officials have been convicted of perversion of justice for
heavy-handed decisions against those seeking to flee repression
under East Germany's communists from 1949-1989. Most have received
similar light sentences.

Suu Kyi vows to keep struggling; regime threatens annihilation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with embassy confirms letter, 6th graf; charge
communicated through intermediary, 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is
recovering from her roadside standoff with the military regime in
Myanmar and vows to keep pushing for dialogue, but official
newspapers Tuesday threatened any dangers to the state with
annihilation.
	   U.S. Charge d'Affaires Kent Weideman, the top U.S. envoy in
Myanmar, said in a memo circulated to diplomats in the capital that
he visited Suu Kyi on Sunday and was allowed entry to her home
after only ``minimal delays'' from security forces.
	   The memo said Suu Kyi, 53, was ``recuperating well from her
encounter and indicated that she intends to continue to assert her
rights in order to achieve her objective of dialogue with the
government.''
	   Weideman said he visited without prior warning to establish the
right of diplomats to see her when they want. He communicated with
Suu Kyi, who remained in the private quarters of her home, through
an intermediary while he stayed in a reception area.
	   Suu Kyi ``indicated to me that she would welcome the visit of
other diplomatic missions to firmly establish the right of
diplomats to meet with her,'' the memo said.
	   The Associated Press was shown a copy of the memo by a diplomat.
The U.S. Embassy confirmed its authenticity.
	   State-controlled newspapers ran an opinion piece Tuesday saying
that Suu Kyi was conspiring with Western media and unspecified
countries _ though U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
statement last week that Myanmar was headed for civil unrest was
noted.
	   ``It is obvious that she is trying to instigate unrest and cause
internal instability to create the recurrence of an anarchistic
uprising for the second time,'' said the article, believed to
reflect the views of at least part of the government.
	   ``Any external and internal danger threatening the establishment
of a peaceful and prosperous state will be annihilated,'' it said.
	   The government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, was intensely
criticized by the United States, the European Union and many other
countries for last week's standoff with Suu Kyi on a road outside
Yangon, the capital.
	   The government, which seldom allows her to leave her home and
never lets her outside the capital, stopped her car and refused to
allow her to travel to another city, Bassein, to meet party
supporters. She spurned orders to go back home.
	   After six days, with neither side budging and Suu Kyi running
low on food and water, authorities ejected her driver and two
fellow passengers, held her down and drove her back to Yangon, her
National League for Democracy party has said.
	   The military, which has ruled the country since 1962, said Suu
Kyi's action was intended to embarrass Myanmar during a foreign
ministers conference of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The standoff comes amid a period of anniversaries marking 10
years since the army killed thousands of people to quell
anti-government protests. Suu Kyi, daughter of independence hero
Aung San, rose to the vanguard of the pro-democracy movement during
the unrest.
	   Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her non-violent
promotion of democracy.
	   She has spent most of the past decade under house arrest or
close confinement to her home. In 1990, the National League for
Democracy overwhelmingly won elections, but the military never
allowed the new parliament to convene.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD have set a deadline of Aug. 21 for the
ruling State Peace and Development Council to finally convene the
legislature. They have no means to enforce the demand, though
Yangon is edgy with anticipation of unrest.
	   In Bangkok, Thailand, a dozen Myanmar students began a sit-in
Monday outside the Myanmar Embassy scheduled to last until Aug. 21
to press the NLD demand.

S.Africa aims to legitimize traditional healers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Seeking to break a stereotyped
image of witchdocters chanting mumbo-jumbo, lawmakers on Tuesday
said they want to legitimize traditional African healers.
	   A report drawn up by parliamentary committees on social services
and health has recommended setting up a special council to regulate
the thousands of men and women who practice traditional medicine in
South Africa.
	   Aside from giving them medical certificates, proposals include
allowing healers to claim costs from their patients' medical
insurance, developing a code of conduct and establishing a register
of all traditional docters.
	   The planned council would also standardize treatments and prices
and promote training, research and the creation of a medicine data
base.
	   Using traditional medicine is still widespread among South
Africa's black population, especially in rural areas. Government
figures estimate up to 80 percent of South Africans will at
sometime use one of the country's 350,000 healers.
	   Under apartheid traditional medicine was banned, but the
practice did not disappear. Though the laws have not been changed
since 1994's all-race elections ended white rule, traditional
healers are now accepted again by government.
	   ``The report attempts to redress the inappropriate government
policies of the past, which were repressive and dehumanizing,'' the
document said ``Traditional healers were not only dehumanized but
branded as witches.''
	   The report recommends classifying traditional healers into four
types; herbalists, diviners, birth attendents and surgeons _ who
primarily perform in circumcision rituals.
	   Meetings between doctors and government will now take place
later this year and early in 1999, to discuss ways of implementing
the report and drafting legislation.
	   Elsewhere in the world, several other countries have already put
traditional medicine on the same level as Western medical science.
	   In China traditional doctors can go to special universities for
training and hospitals are divided into those who mainly use
traditional methods and those with Western-style doctors.

Palestinians reject Israeli `nature reserve' idea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian negotiators rejected an Israeli
pullout plan that would make part of the West Bank a restricted
``nature reserve,'' leaving it unclear Tuesday whether the
sputtering peace talks would go on.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli envoy
Yitzhak Molcho met for several hours Monday night in Jerusalem but
did not speak to reporters afterward. Erekat briefed Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat on the talks late Monday night.
	   Israeli news reports said Israel was waiting for a Palestinian
response to proposals made at the meeting.
	   Israel and the Palestinians returned to the negotiating table
two weeks ago, after months of stalemate during which the United
States failed to win Israeli backing for a proposal to turn over an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told The Associated Press
on Tuesday that Israel had proposed that 3 of the 13 percent be
land in the Judean Desert classified as a ``nature reserve,'' over
which Israel would retain overall security control.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   Asfour said such Israeli proposals would ``lead to the end of
talks ... If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there
is no need for further meetings.''
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Israelis had offered to give the Palestinians civil authority
in the nature reserve areas _ which he said was meaningless because
no one lived in the desert areas.
	   The Palestinians would not, however, be allowed to have either a
security presence or to build in the area, another official said,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.

Report: Deadly virus could reach Hong Kong in one year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 3 with 39th case confirmed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A microbiology expert says a virus that has
killed more than 50 people in Taiwan may take its time reaching
Hong Kong, and warned against complacency, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   Hong Kong health authorities have been watching closely for an
outbreak of the enterovirus 71.
	   Hong Kong authorities announced Tuesday that they had confirmed
a 39th case of a strain similar to the virus found in Taiwan. So
far, none of them has proved fatal here.
	   Paul Chan Kay-sheung, a microbiology professor at the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, was on a team of experts from Hong Kong
that traveled to Taiwan last week to study the virus.
	   Chan said Hong Kong could not afford to relax just because it so
far had managed to escape the level of infection found in Taiwan.
	   The South China Morning Post quoted him as saying that the virus
``will take a year to arrive'' in Hong Kong.
	   The virus, which strikes infants and small children especially
hard, is the latest in a string of worries about health risks in
Hong Kong.
	   Last December, the government halted all live imports of poultry
and ordered all 1.4 million local chickens killed to stamp out the
so-called ``bird flu.'' Then, more than 100 people were admitted to
hospitals after eating deep-sea coral fish contaminated with heavy
metals.
	   Most recently fish and shellfish were declared unsafe when red
tides _ fast-breeding, oxygen-depleting algae _ hit Hong Kong
waters.

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarians are sweltering in a heat
wave that has buckled streetcar tracks and sent temperatures
soaring to record highs this week.
	   Public pools have standing room only, residents are plunging
into city fountains to seek relief and doctors are warning the
elderly in this city of nearly 2 million people to stay home.
	   A 77-year-old heat record for Aug. 3 was broken Monday when the
official temperature reached 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 Fahrenheit).
It was even hotter downtown _ 40 (104 F) or higher.
	   The heat wave is in its third week.
	   ``We just can't work _ we have three fans going and it is still
35 (95 F) degrees in the office,'' sairtain stretches where
there's danger of the track getting overheated,'' said State
Railways official Gyoergy Foeldhazi.
	   No deaths have been reported directly due to heat, but the
municipal ambulance service said its workload is up by 20 percent.
	   A break in the weather is coming _ but not for long. Attila
Nadrai, head of the National Meteorological Service, said a cool
front is expected by Wednesday but the forecast for next week is
more heat.

Havel develops pneumonia, irregular heartbeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel suffered
from an irregular heartbeat on Tuesday and has developed pneumonia,
doctors said.
	   A statement from the presidential spokesman did not classify
Havel's immediate condition but said the situation ``is being
worked on intensively.''
	   ``The course of the president's treatment was complicated by
arrhythmia this morning,'' spokesman Martin Krafl said.
	   According to the statement, the beginning of pneumonia was
confirmed by computer tomography.
	   Havel remains in intensive care after undergoing surgery on July
26 to close a colostomy.
	   He ruptured his colon in April while vacationing in the Austrian
Alps. He underwent emergency surgery at the Innsbruck University
Clinic and colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, a combined Austrian-Czech team of doctors closed the
colostomy in Prague at the president's request. Shortly afterward,
Havel's lungs collapsed briefly, forcing the use of a respirator.
	   Breathing problems and impaired immunity leading to infections
have hindered Havel's recovery.
	   Late Sunday, Havel's temperature shot up to 39 degrees Celsius
(102 degrees Fahrenheit), his heartbeat went up and laboratory
findings indicated a lung inflammation.
	   On Monday, doctors suspected pneumonia developing in the
president's right lung.
	   The 61-year-old president, formerly a chain smoker, has been
hospitalized five times since December 1996, when he had a third of
his lung and a tumor removed.

Italy to extradite official in corruption case, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Italy has approved the extradition of
a local government official at the heart of Switzerland's biggest
corruption scandal, the Zurich district attorney's office said
Tuesday.
	   In November, Raphael Huber, sentenced by Zurich district court
in 1995 to five years in prison, was arrested on his estate in
Italy.
	   Huber, who was in charge of restaurant permits in the canton
(state) of Zurich, was found guilty of accepting 1.38 million Swiss
francs (then dlrs 1.2 million) in bribes.
	   The court, which tried him in his absence, also ordered him to
repay the money within three months, plus a fine of 200,000 francs
(dlrs 174,000). Huber has been living in Italy since the scandal
came to light in 1991.
	   The court also handed down suspended prison sentences to four
prominent local businessmen.
	   Swiss authorities had issued an arrest warrant only for
Switzerland, giving Huber the opportunity to return on his own.
	   But when Huber failed to appear before an appeals court in
November, the prosecutor announced he had issued an international
warrant. Italian authorities then took him into custody at his
estate near Gaiole.
	   The corruption scandal shocked Switzerland's normally staid
business community. Although Swiss banks are often accused of
accepting dirty money, cases of domestic corruption are rare.
	   Huber was accused of accepting and in some cases demanding money
for restaurant licenses and allegedly used the money for the estate
in northern Italy.
	   The attorney's office said he will be handed over to Swiss
authorities in the border town of Chiasso later Tuesday.

Kuwait intercepts ships allegedly violating Iraq embargo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) - The Kuwaiti coast guard has intercepted two wooden
boats that apparently were violating the U.N. trade embargo against
Iraq, Kuwait's Interior Ministry said Tuesday.
	   The boats were seized in Kuwait's territorial waters on Sunday,
the ministry's spokesman, Col. Bader Saleh, told The Associated
Press.
	   He said the boats, registered in the United Arab Emirates and
manned by 13 Asian sailors, were carrying dates and fertilizer from
Iraq. Saleh gave no other details.
	   Scores of ships have been intercepted in the Gulf since the
United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions ban air travel to and from the country and
international trade of all commodities, including oil.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has complied with
resolutions calling for the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq says it has destroyed its weaponry and has demanded that
the sanctions be lifted. Baghdad has called on Arab countries to
ignore the trade ban and has actively sought to circumvent it.

Yangtze River embankments collapse, causing heavy loss of life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with estimate of 1,000 people missing in graf 6, dikes
abandoned in graf 9 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Waterlogged levees along China's flood-swollen
Yangtze River have started to collapse, wreaking death and
destruction on a massive scale, state media said Tuesday.
	   Torrential rains in southwest Sichuan province also have
triggered flooding that killed at least 20 people, pushing the
known death toll from floods caused by unusually heavy and early
summer rains this year to 1,288.
	   With a tropical storm and another flood tide expected, the
threat mounted of further breaches along the already weakened
levees that protect millions of people and rich farmland from the
Yangtze, the world's third-longest river.
	   Main Yangtze dikes remain intact but secondary levees were
breached in at least two counties and a city in central China's
Hubei province, ``causing huge loss of life and property,'' the
official China Youth Daily reported.
	   The newspaper gave no casualty figures. But a human rights group
said 150 soldiers and hundreds of villagers were swept away when a
levee suddenly collapsed Saturday in Hubei's Jiayu County, about 70
kilometers (43 miles) upriver from the industrial center of Wuhan.
	   As of Monday, the bodies of nine soldiers had been recovered,
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China said. The Hong Kong-based group said more than 1,000 people
were believed missing.
	   Local officials have barred foreign journalists from visiting
the worst flood areas, and state-controlled media tend to provide
delayed or conflicting accounts and downplay casualties.
	   The official newspaper Yangcheng Evening News said some 400
soldiers were swept away when the levee that had been protecting
some 56,000 people in two towns collapsed. Soldiers and police
pulled nearly 20,000 people from the water, the newspaper said.
	   In a bid to lower the Yangtze's waters, Hubei authorities
abandoned 11 small dikes to divert floodwaters, Xinhua said. The
strategy caused 400 million yuan (dlrs 48 million) in flood damage,
but helped protect Wuhan city, it said.
	   More than 100,000 people lost their homes when a levee burst in
Anxiang, in neighboring Hunan province, on July 24, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said. Victims were living in tents, ``without
adequate food and drinking water,'' Xinhua said.
	   In all, the Yangtze was threatening to burst its embankments in
3,200 places, and 1,800 of these possible breaches were ``major,''
Xinhua said.
	   ``The flood control situation along the Yangtze remains
extremely serious and will remain so for the foreseeable future,''
it reported.
	   Millions of soldiers and civilians have been manning the dikes,
watching for signs of collapse and plugging leaks, as waters on the
Yangtze reached levels unseen since floods in 1954 killed more than
30,000 people.
	   Aside from killing 20 people, the floods in Sichuan province in
recent days also injured 370 people and left two others missing,
Xinhua said. Torrential rains triggered landslides and caused
waters on the Yangtze's upper reaches and its main tributaries to
reach danger levels, it said.
	   A flood peak, the fourth this year, was forming on the upper
reaches of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river, the China
Youth Daily said.
	   A tropical storm also was expected to hit land in southeast
China in the next two days, bringing strong winds and heavy rains
that could complicate flood control efforts.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The Rwandan army has killed a senior Hutu
rebel in northern Rwanda and has put his body on public display,
officials said Tuesday.
	   The man was killed Monday night when the army stopped rebels
from burning down administrative offices in Nyarutovu commune in
the troubled northwestern Ruhengeri region, officials said.
	   Nyarutovu, where the body the man identified as Maj. Mugemana
was put on display, is 50 kilometers (32 miles) northwest of
Kigali.
	   The army described Maj. Mugemana as a ``close bodyguard'' of
former Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death in a plane
crash in April 1994 set off the Hutu government-sponsored genocide
in which more than half a million Tutsis and politically moderate
Hutus were killed.
	   The 90-day slaughter ended when Tutsi rebels overthrew the
government. Former members of the Hutu government and military,
many of whom were involved in the genocide, have since been
carrying out attacks inside Rwanda.
	   Hutu rebels have attacked Nyarutovu several times. They are
believed to have a base nearby.
	   The army has claimed a series of victories in the area in recent
weeks, saying it dealt the rebels a serious blow last week by
killing several of its leaders.
	   The Tutsi-dominated army also claims to have made headway on its
battle to win popular support in the predominantly Hutu northwest
and wean residents away from backing the rebels.
	   On Monday, the army said residents of the Rushashi commune in
Rural Kigali prefecture north of Kigali helped capture six rebels
who were believed to have participated in an attack on Sunday that
had left more than 100 dead.
	   The six will be tried, officials said.

Zimbabwe dollar falls 20 percent as economic fears deepen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Zimbabwe Reserve Bank intervened at
the close of business Monday to freeze the exchange rate for the
local currency at 23 to the U.S. dollar.
	   The move came after a day of volatile trading that saw the
Zimbabwe dollar depreciate about 20 percent.
	   ``Speculation against the Zimbabwe dollar had been reflected in
unseasonably high and non-essential volumes of imports,'' the
reserve bank said Tuesday.
	   An International Monetary Fund delegation was due here Tuesday
to review payments of 176 million U.S. dollars in budget support
following President Robert Mugabe's backtracking on economic
liberalization pledges made since 1991.
	   Banks reported importers taking advantage of what they regarded
a temporarily unrealistic rate for the pressured South African Rand
against the Zim dollar.
	   ``This triggered a run on hard currency, particularly U.S.,''
said an executive of a major bank who asked not to be identified.
	   The reserve bank said the pressures led to a further
depreciation of the zim dollar to levels beyond those ``compatible
with economic fundamentals and developments in international
currency markets.''
	   Last mont the bank said the currency had reached a realistic
level of about 18 to the U.S. dollar.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Protesting farmers blockaded roads and
government offices in several Polish towns Tuesday in a nationwide
demonstration against grain imports and low prices.
	   The protests were peaceful, with one including music from a folk
group, but they showed the increasing desire by farmers to display
their political muscle as Poland considers widespread reforms
needed to join the European Union.
	   In Goleniow, a town 520 kilometers (320 miles) northwest of
Warsaw, four tractors and a trailer filled with grain jammed the
access road to the city hall, an office worker in the building said
by telephone.
	   According to Mariusz Tarnozek, the worker, a banner on the
trailer said: ``We have grain, who will buy it?''
	   On the main road south from Warsaw, farmers tossed boxes of
potatoes and sacks of grain to halt vehicles and even stood in the
street themselves. No violence was reported, and a folk band played
music at one protest in Biala Podlaska, 120 kilometers (75 miles)
east of Warsaw.

Asian stock markets close generally lower

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, with the key index in Manila slumping 2 percent to a
five-year low.
	   Traders said the Philippine market continued to be battered by
domestic and regional economic concerns. Shares were also pushed
down by the overnight decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
which fell 96.55 points to 8,786.74.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 31.63 points
to 1,511.44 _ its lowest close since 1,480.30 on April 2, 1993.
This followed a drop of 64.54 points, or 4 percent, on Monday.
	   Asia's economic crisis has hit Philippine stocks hard, with the
PSE index losing nearly 20 percent since the start of the year.
	   Indonesian shares also tumbled on fears that the Indonesian
government will delay its plan to sell its stake in some
state-owned companies.
	   Dealers also blamed the uncertain political situation in
Indonesia after the government announced plans to investigate some
senior military officers for involvement in the kidnapping of
political activists.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 2.9 percent,
or 13.91 points, to 461.350.
	   Share prices in Tokyo closed lower for a second consecutive
session.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 141.50 points,
or 0.88 percent, closing at 16,023.58. On Monday, the index had
shed 213.89 points, or 1.31 percent.
	   Traders said investors sold banking issues on worries that
restructuring of the nation's banking industry will take a toll on
the sector.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen after three
sessions of gains.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 144.62 yen, down
1.02 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 145.60 yen overnight.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally higher, a day after the
key index tumbled 4.8 percent. The Hang Seng Index rose 28.03
points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 7,580.80.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower in the wake of overnight
losses on U.S. stock markets. The market's key Weighted Stock Price
Index fell 5.90 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,593.14.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers
saying the local market suffered from falls on the U.S stock
market. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 23.03 points, or 1.0
percent, to 2,081.02.
	   SYDNEY: The Australian share market closed moderately higher.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 8.5 points, or 0.3 percent, to
2,682.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed higher in reaction to a strong
Japanese currency Tuesday and recent cuts in local interest rates.
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 3.73 points, or 1.1
percent, to 333.20.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices close generally lower, but
the Composite Index, which tracks share prices of 100 key stocks,
edged up 0.17 point to 386.44.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly lower as last-minute
selling in index-linked stocks drove the benchmark index down. The
Straits Times Industrial Index fell 9.77 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,064.99.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed lower on continued concern
over the ailing bank sector. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index
fell 2.85 points, or 1.1 percent, to 258.04.

Lawyers test the legal waters in mock trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE ASSEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Imagine the lawsuits if the Titanic sank today _
the claims of faulty construction and unsafe speed would pile up.
And sex discrimination: ``women and children first'' might no
longer cut it in court.
	   ``If you design or build a boat, it must be able to stay
afloat,'' Johnnie Cochran, formerly O.J. Simpson's criminal defense
lawyer, argued Monday as members of the American Bar Association
held a fictional trial over the massive ship's 1912 sinking.
	   Cochran represented a woman portraying a fictional survivor of
the tragedy, who was suing shipbuilder Harland and Wolff.
	   But Stephen G. Morrison of Columbia, South Carolina,
representing the shipbuilder, insisted the vessel was
state-of-the-art at a time when the Ford Model T was only four
years old.
	   He said the real fault lay with the ship's owner and operator,
White Star Line, which he accused of taking the Titanic too fast
through an iceberg field out of ``ego and arrogance and
carelessness.''
	   The fictional character, named Rhoda Abbott, claimed the ship
was unsafely built and operated _ brittle rivets, not easily
maneuverable, not enough lifeboats and a lookout crew without even
a pair of binoculars.
	   And then there was the women-and-children-first policy. The
woman and her teen-age sons survived but her husband didn't, and
thus she said she planned to file a whole new lawsuit against the
White Star Line based on sex discrimination.
	   The ABA event was conducted as if modern product-liability laws,
legal skills and courtroom technology had been transported back to
the time of the Titanic.
	   Photos of the ship and blowups of White Star Line documents were
projected onto large screens to help the audience, acting as the
jury, understand the lawyers' arguments and questioning of
witnesses.
	   Even some of the lawyers themselves _ women and blacks _ likely
would not have been seen in those courtroom roles back then.
	   ``It's an opportunity to see how the best lawyers present the
most complicated cases,'' said Robert H. Alexander of Oklahoma
City, the lawyer who chaired the program. ``It gives a framework
for appreciating how much the law has changed in the years since
Titanic.''
	   The true-life lawsuits over the Titanic's sinking were settled
without coming to trial. The largest American settlement was dlrs
5,000 to a well-to-do family, while the largest British settlement
was dlrs 50,000 to a large company, Alexander said.
	   On Monday, Cochran asked the audience to award the woman
anywhere from dlrs 120 million to dlrs 225 million in damages.
	   The ship should have had fully watertight compartments to keep
water from spreading inside and bolted-down binoculars in the
lookout nest so they couldn't be lost, Cochran said. And the
builder shouldn't have let people think the Titanic was unsinkable,
he added.
	   ``You would not want a ship ... to wait until it was literally
on top of an iceberg to take evasive action, would you?'' asked
lawyer Emmanuel E. Edem of Oklahoma City, who also represented the
woman.
	   But attorney Chilton Davis Varner of Atlanta, representing the
ship's manufacturer, asked a series of questions designed to show
the real problem was White Star Line's operation of the ship and
actions after it struck the iceberg.
	   The ship's owners overruled the manufacturer's recommendation to
install enough lifeboats for the 2,000-plus passengers, she said,
displaying documents to back her statements up.
	   And the ship did take almost three hours to sink, Varner said.
	   ``Harland and Wolff provided almost three hours of time during
which, had there been sufficient lifeboats and sufficient training,
you and your family might have escaped,'' she said.
	   The verdict? The shipbuilder was liable and must pay dlrs 1.5
million.

Taliban even closer to Mazar-e-Sharif
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Red Cross evacuated the last
foreign aid workers from the northern Afghanistan city of
Mazar-e-Sharif Tuesday, fearing a repeat of the street fighting and
looting that erupted when the Taliban religious militia briefly
held the city last year.
	   Taliban fighters advanced to just 20 kilometers (12 miles) west
of Mazar-e-Sharif, one of their opposition's few remaining
strongholds. Hundreds of residents were reportedly fleeing the
city.
	   The Taliban already controls most of Afghanistan. Bolstered by
recent victories, the extremist Islamic army appears poised to
capture the rest of the country.
	   Taliban troops engaged in minor skirmishes as they advanced
Tuesday, according to Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn. He said
the religious militia was now pausing to build bunkers and take
other measures to shore up defenses. It was unclear when the
religious militia would attempt to capture Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   An opposition source in Mazar-e-Sharif who refused to be named
confirmed that Taliban fighters were 20 kilometers (12 miles) to
the west. The source, speaking by satellite phone, said residents
in the region were revolting against warlord Rashid Dostum, a
leader in the fractious anti-Taliban coalition, allowing the
Taliban to advance.
	   Dostum's whereabouts were unclear Tuesday, two days after the
Taliban pushed him out of his stronghold of Shebergan, 100
kilometers (60 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif. Taliban spokesman
Muttayn said Dostum's fighters were gathering south of Shebergan in
preparation for a counter-attack, but opposition sources had said a
day before that Dostum had retreated to Hayratan, about 60
kilometers (40 miles) east of Mazar-e-Sharif on Afghanistan's
border with Uzbekistan.
	   Taliban radio reported late Monday that Taliban fighters were
also east of Mazar-e-Sharif, within rocket range of the airport.
	   Red Cross spokesman Michel Schaffner said Mazar-e-Sharif was
calm Tuesday and the airport, which was closed the day before, was
open, allowing a Red Cross plane to land and pick up 11 aid
workers. A Pharmacists Without Borders spokesman said the 11
included three Afghans.
	   The workers were brought to the Pakistani border town of
Peshawar, where Schaffner spoke by telephone.
	   Taliban fighters briefly held Mazar-e-Sharif last May,
retreating after street battles in which hundreds of Taliban
soldiers died. As many as 2,000 Taliban prisoners of war reportedly
were later massacred.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing the Afghan capital, Kabul,
in 1996, they have barred girls from school and confined most women
to their homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities.

China bars Japan-based dissident from entering: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Japan-based Chinese democracy campaigner has
been barred from returning to China, the latest victim of a policy
of exiling those considered politically undesirable, a rights group
said Tuesday.
	   Wang Tingfang was turned away by Chinese customs agents when he
attempted to cross into China from Hong Kong on Saturday, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China
said in a news release.
	   Chinese police had briefly detained Wang and then forced him to
leave the country when he visited his wife and child in Shanghai
July 21, the Hong Kong-based center reported.
	   Wang was attempting to visit his sick father-in-law on both
occasions, it said.
	   The fact customs agents were able to pick out Wang for refusal
proves his name has been included on a ``not permitted entry-black
list,'' the center said.
	   Wang, chairman of the Japan branches of two U.S.-based dissident
groups, is the sixth overseas democracy activist barred entry to
China since April, the center said.
	   China routinely refuses entry to Chinese affiliated with
pro-democracy organizations abroad, though some have successfully
sneaked into the country.
	   Other activists, such as former student leader Wang Dan, have
been released from prison in China on condition they go into exile
abroad, and threatened with further imprisonment if they return.
	   Pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong, which reverted from
British to Chinese sovereignty last year, have also been denied
entry to China.

Havel develops pneumonia, irregular heartbeat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ President Vaclav Havel suffered
from an irregular heartbeat on Tuesday and has developed pneumonia,
doctors said.
	   A statement from the presidential spokesman did not classify
Havel's immediate condition but said the situation ``is being
worked on intensively.''
	   ``The course of the president's treatment was complicated by
arrhythmia this morning,'' spokesman Martin Krafl said.
	   According to the statement, the beginning of pneumonia was
confirmed by computer tomography.
	   Havel remains in intensive care after undergoing surgery on July
26 to close a colostomy.
	   He ruptured his colon in April while vacationing in the Austrian
Alps. He underwent emergency surgery at the Innsbruck University
Clinic, and a colostomy was performed.
	   On July 26, doctors closed the colostomy in Prague at the
president's request. Shortly afterward, Havel's lungs collapsed
briefly, forcing the use of a respirator.
	   Breathing problems and impaired immunity leading to infections
have hindered Havel's recovery.
	   Late Sunday, Havel's temperature shot up to 39 degrees Celsius
(102 degrees Fahrenheit), his heartbeat quickened and laboratory
findings indicated a lung inflammation.
	   On Monday, doctors suspected pneumonia developing in the
president's right lung.
	   The 61-year-old president, formerly a chain smoker, has been
hospitalized five times since December 1996, when he had a third of
his lung and a tumor removed.

Royals gather for Queen Mother's 98th birthday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Queen Mother's appearance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Mother Elizabeth, wearing a yellow dress to
match the sunshine of a rare summery day, celebrated her 98th
birthday Tuesday by greeting well-wishers who had camped out to
join the party.
	   As the Band of Welsh Guards marched past, playing a specially
composed Royal Birthday March and then ``Happy Birthday'', the
Queen Mother smiled, waved and acknowledged the 45 bandsmen as she
stood at the gateway of Clarence House, her residence.
	   Children lined up to present bouquets to Britain's longest-lived
royal, who leaned on a cane as she walked to the gate. The sunshine
broke a long spell of clouds and rain in England, which has had wet
and dreary summer.
	   ``I've been looking forward to it more and more each year. It
has become an obsession,'' said Jennifer Hawkins, a 49-year-old
nurse from suburban London who was first in line outside Clarence
House.
	   ``I feel she is the nation's favorite grandmother and an
inspiration to us all,'' said Mrs. Hawkins, who staked out her
place Sunday morning.
	   Alan Rudd, a Londoner who was second in line, said he had been
coming to the birthday celebration for 17 years. ``She is so
special. She is very genuine when she talks to you. She is just a
sweet, dear lady,'' he said.
	   Two world wars, the death of her husband, the disappointment of
failed marriages among younger royals, two hip replacements and a
cataract operation _ the mother of Queen Elizabeth II has endured
them all.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
and unsought sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They saw
Britain through the dark days of World War II and reigned until
George VI died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.
	   As the royal family accelerates its program of modernization in
the wake of the death of Princess Diana in a Paris car crash Aug.
31, the Queen Mother is actively engaged in the life of the nation
and remains for some Britons the favorite royal.
	   ``I think it's important for us all to be here so she can see
how she is loved by the public. This is a special day and we want
to show her how much she is loved,'' said Alan Morton, 53, who
traveled from Edinburgh and got in line Monday morning.
	   ``I met her in person when I was four years old during the
Blitz. She came round to reassure people that they did not have to
leave the country. I have been following her ever since,'' said
Terry Hutt, 63, who wore a Union Jack hat.
	   ``I think she is a nice and gentle lady, she always says thank
you and I think that is worth coming for,'' Hutt said.
	   ``This is the highlight of the year for us royalists. It is a
big reunion,'' said Colin Edwards, 57, from Macclesfield.
	   Gill Corbett, 57, from Hucclecote in western England was in line
with her daughter Helen Edwards, 35, and her 5-year-old
granddaughter, Amy.
	   ``I wanted to wish her a happy birthday. I hope she gets some
jelly and ice cream for her birthday tea. I've brought her a
birthday card and some pink flowers as a birthday present,'' said
Amy, who wore a new pink dress for the occasion.
	   Tuesday's party plans included the band of the Welsh Guards
playing ``Happy Birthday,'' a 41-gun salute in Hyde Park and a
62-gun salute at the Tower of London, and lunch with Queen
Elizabeth II and other family members at Clarence House.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ One woman drowned, one man was hurt in a landslide
and 10,000 residents evacuated their homes Tuesday as the heaviest
rain in more than 80 years deluged north central Japan, officials
said.
	   Rains as heavy as 97 millimeters (3.8 inches) an hour hit
Niigata prefecture (state) early Tuesday, the hardest downpour
since the Central Meteorological Agency began compiling statistics
in 1914, the agency said.
	   Kiri Kobayashi, 77, drowned after he fell into a ditch and was
washed away on Sado Island, 325 kilometers (201 miles) north of
Tokyo, the Niigata Prefectural Police reported.
	   In Tochio City, just south of the prefectural capital of
Niigata, Ryokitsu Sano, 69, suffered a knee injury when hit by a
landslide.
	   In Sasakami, about 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of Tokyo, an
entire village of 9,700 residents was evacuated when a river
overflowed and broke a dike, a prefectural government spokesman
said. Some 900 others in other villages in Niigata were also
evacuated.
	   Niigata police said two houses were destroyed in landslides, and
12,903 had been flooded by midafternoon Tuesday. Police also
reported landslides at 45 places, 37 cases of road damage, three
bridges washed away and dikes broken in three places.
	   Electricity to 29,000 households in the city of Niigata was cut
off after two transformer substations were flooded, Kyodo News
service quoted local utility officials as saying. Some 12,800
households were still without electricity at midday, it said.
	   Most trains to Niigata city have been suspended.
	   Although rain weakened later Tuesday, the weather agency issued
new warnings of torrential rains and possible floods.

Cleric says Islam does not bar women from becoming judges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Amid growing public debate, a leading
Egyptian cleric has ruled that there is nothing in Islam's holy
book, the Koran, that bans women from becoming judges.
	   However, Sheik Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi also cautioned women
against rushing to join the ranks of the judiciary.
	   ``The nature of the job does not suit that of a woman,'' said
Tantawi. ``There are certain jobs that make it necessary for men to
carry them out.''
	   Tantawi is head of Al-Azhar, the leading Sunni Muslim center of
religious thought.
	   His comments were published in all of Tuesday's Egyptian
newspapers.
	   Tantawi's rulings carry substantial weight in the Muslim world,
and his statement could lend legitimacy to campaigns by feminist
activists to get women on the bench.
	   The newspaper quoted Tantawi as saying there was no profession
forbidden to women by Islam and that there was no precise text in
the Koran or in the teachings of Prophet Mohammed that banned women
from becoming judges.
	   His statements follows months of debate in Egypt over one
woman's 10-year battle to be accepted as a candidate for a
judgeship.
	   Fatima Lashin, a 34-year-old lawyer who was turned down solely
on grounds she is a woman, has taken her case to a succession of
courts. This year the case was accepted by Egypt's highest court,
but no date has been set for a decision.
	   The question of whether women should serve as judges has sparked
a vociferous debate in newspapers, television and legal circles in
recent months, with many scholars claiming that Islam bars women
from the bench.
	   Many base their arguments on a Koranic tenet that holds that two
women are equal to one man if they are called as witnesses in a
court. They argue, therefore, that a woman cannot be a judge if she
cannot be a solo witness.

Kabila moving against rebellious troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments from state radio, justice
minister; officials warn of armed response to rebellion. Edits
throughout to conform. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's government
issued an appeal Tuesday for public support against an open revolt
in eastern Congo and a brief armed challenge in the capital.
	   Accusing Rwandan soldiers and armed mercenaries of staging a
rebellion against the government, state-controlled radio quoted
Kabila as vowing to crush the uprising.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gun battles in two military barracks in the capital.
	   ``The government asks Congo's neighbors not to make the wrong
decisions to fight,'' Minister of State for the Presidency Pierre
Victor Mpoyo said in a radio broadcast following the meeting.
	   The comment was aimed directly at neighboring Rwanda, which
Kabila believes is behind the movement against his leadership.
Rwandan mercenaries and Tutsis from the Banyamulenge ethnic group
in eastern Congo played a key role in helping Kabila march to
victory last year over longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Those same fighters today, however, appear to be moving to get
rid of Kabila.
	   A delicate ethnic and military alliance that helped thrust
Kabila _ a one-time obscure Marxist rebel _ into power 14 months
ago is now unraveling.
	   Rwandan officials on Monday said unrest in Congo's capital and
in the eastern province of North Kivu was an internal matter and
denied any involvement.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo told The Associated
Press that the government was preparing an armed response to the
rebellion in the eastern province of North Kivu.
	   On Monday, military officers said they had seized control of the
province and were vowing to oust Kabila, news reports in
neighboring Rwandan said.
	   The majority ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close
links with Rwanda and Kabila's support and control of the region
has faltered for months.
	   ``They are bandits organized to loot the country,'' Kongolo
said, describing the breakaway leaders in North Kivu.
	   He said Rwandan soldiers had been seen in the towns of Goma and
Bukavu along the border with Rwanda.
	   ``We're telling them to lay down their arms and end this
adventure before we immediately bring in the army,'' Kongolo said.
	   In the capital one day after shots rang out at two military
bases on Kinshasa's west end, loyal troops continued to patrol city
streets and man roadblocks as heightened security left the city
tense. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was still in effect, but life in the
city began to return to normal as abandoned streets began to fill
again with shoppers and merchants.
	   Offices and shops reopened after being ordered closed on Monday.
	   Pre-dawn clashes Monday at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last week ordered all
Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.

Italy extradites official in corruption case, Swiss say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES lead, 2nd graf with extradition confirmed. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Italy has extradited a local
government official at the heart of Switzerland's biggest
corruption scandal, Swiss authorities said Tuesday.
	   Raphael Huber was handed over to Swiss authorities in the border
town of Chiasso, the Zurich district attorney's office and the
Federal Office of Police Affairs said.
	   In November, Raphael Huber, sentenced by Zurich district court
in 1995 to five years in prison, was arrested on his estate in
Italy.
	   Huber, who was in charge of restaurant permits in the canton
(state) of Zurich, was found guilty of accepting 1.38 million Swiss
francs (then dlrs 1.2 million) in bribes.
	   The court, which tried him in his absence, also ordered him to
repay the money within three months, plus a fine of 200,000 francs
(dlrs 174,000). Huber had been living in Italy since the scandal
came to light in 1991.
	   The court also handed down suspended prison sentences to four
prominent local businessmen.
	   Swiss authorities had issued an arrest warrant only for
Switzerland, giving Huber the opportunity to return on his own.
	   But when Huber failed to appear before an appeals court in
November, the prosecutor announced he had issued an international
warrant. Italian authorities then took him into custody at his
estate near Gaiole.
	   The corruption scandal shocked Switzerland's normally staid
business community. Although Swiss banks are often accused of
accepting dirty money, cases of domestic corruption are rare.
	   Huber was accused of accepting and in some cases demanding money
for restaurant licenses and allegedly used the money for the estate
in northern Italy.

Malaysia asks Singapore to be considerate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHOR BARU, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid a worsening row with
neighboring Singapore, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
asked the tiny city-state Tuesday to be more considerate toward its
larger northern neighbor.
	   ``We feel saddened when there is tension between Singapore and
Malaysia,'' Mahathir said in a speech in Johor Baru, which is
separated from Singapore by a thin strip of water.
	   ``We try our best to be cordial. We have no ill will against
it,'' he said to thunderous cheers from nearly 10,000 people who
had packed an indoor stadium to hear him.
	   Many in his party, meanwhile, have been urging strong action
against Singapore, including suspending new bilateral deals.
	   The dispute is over the location of the immigration and customs
facility for passengers crossing the Malaysia-Singapore border.
	   Despite Malaysia's opposition, Singapore relocated its railroad
immigration facility Saturday, causing hardships for several
thousand commuters who now have to disembark twice for immigration
checks. Malaysia says it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty.
	   In 1989, Singapore decided to abandon the joint checkpoint in
Tanjong Pagar and move it closer to the actual border, saying this
would facilitate checks on drug traffickers, smugglers and illegal
immigrants.
	   ``Singapore owns land in Malaysia, but we don't harass them,''
Mahathir said.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he warned
Singapore, which depends on Malaysia for more than half the water
its citizens use. Some politicians have urged that Malaysia use
water as a bargaining tool with Singapore.
	   ``They asked us to get out even though we supply them with
water. Please be considerate. We are considerate,'' Mahathir said.
	   Singapore has said the dispute over the railroad immigration
point should not be related to the water issue.
	   ``If they don't sell it to us, they don't have anybody to sell
it to,'' Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan
said Monday.
	   In Singapore, an angry citizen wrote a letter offering his
services in case of war.
	   ``As a sovereign nation, we are not to be taken for granted. As
an operationally ready NSman (national serviceman), I am prepared
to defend and die for Singapore,'' said the letter from Chang Chern
Yuen, a reservist, published in Tuesday's Straits Times.
	   Relations have been rocky in the past, but there is little
danger of an armed conflict between the two nations, which were
united briefly in 1963.
	   The experiment failed two years later but Singapore still
remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner and an important
gateway into Malaysia. More than 200,000 Malaysians cross over to
Singapore each day to work and 27 trains run daily between the two
countries.
	   Meanwhile, a small fire broke out Tuesday morning at the Tanjong
Pagar station still used by Malaysian customs officials.
Authorities said they could not rule out arson as the cause.

Indonesian Cabinet minister sues media over report on 1996 raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A Cabinet minister has sued a number
of Indonesian media organizations for reporting his alleged
involvement in a raid on the headquarters of an opposition leader
in 1996, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid, who is an army lieutenant
general, filed the case Monday at police headquarters in Jakarta,
the daily Suara Pembaruan said.
	   It quoted a police spokesman, Maj. Gen. Da'i Bachtiar, as saying
his office is studying the report.
	   Bachtiar refused to specify the number as well as the names of
the media organizations.
	   Newspaper, magazines and television stations have been stepping
up reports on those allegedly behind the raid following
commemorations marking the second anniversary of the incident last
month.
	   On July 27, 1996, a government-backed faction staged a predawn
raid on the headquarters of the minority Indonesian Democratic
Party, which was being occupied by supporters of pro-democracy
leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   Megawati, the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno, was ousted from the party in June the same year by a rival
group supported by the government.
	   Her ouster prompted the occupation of the headquarters.
	   Riots broke out after the raid, and at least five people were
killed and more than a dozen reported missing.
	   At the time, Syarwan was the military's chief of staff for
social and political affairs. He has denied involvement in the
raid.

category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector cut short
his trip to Baghdad when talks with Iraq on dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction collapsed Tuesday. Richard Butler, head
of the U.N. Special Commission, checked out of Baghdad's Al-Rashid
Hotel in the morning and headed to an air base for a flight to
Bahrain. He declined to say what had caused the impasse in Monday's
talks with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. On Monday,
Aziz accused Butler of being an American pawn in trying to prolong
the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban air travel and limit the sale
of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay. (IRAQ)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Congo's capital remained under a curfew
Tuesday and troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila manned
roadblocks throughout the city searching for renegade Rwandan
mercenaries. In eastern Congo, military officers declared a revolt
Monday against Kabila and urged the population to oust the
president. About 14 months after charging victoriously into
Kinshasa, the rebel alliance that carried Kabila to power appears
to be unraveling. Defense officials ordered troops to kill any
Rwandan soldiers found hiding in and around the deserted city.
Pre-dawn clashes Monday at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last
week ordered all Rwandan soldiers to leave the country. (CONGO)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling Tuesday to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in
the woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to
flee their villages. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was
planning an aid convoy for ethnic Albanians near Malisevo, a former
stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army, where
thousands of refugees had sought shelter. Serb forces reportedly
toppled three additional KLA strongholds Monday, just days after
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised to stop his attack
on the rebels. Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo
province, part of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia. In
Washington Monday, the U.S. government announced that NATO had
approved a plan to use firepower against Serb forces in Kosovo, but
officials at NATO headquarters said that no military action was
being planned at this stage. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Waterlogged levees along China's flood-swollen
Yangtze River have started to collapse, wreaking death and
destruction on a massive scale, state media said Tuesday.
Torrential rains in southwest Sichuan province also have triggered
flooding that killed at least 20 people, pushing the known death
toll from floods caused by unusually heavy and early summer rains
this year to 1,288. With a tropical storm and another flood tide
expected, the threat mounted of further breaches along the already
weakened levees that protect millions of people and rich farmland
from the Yangtze, the world's third-longest river. A Hong
Kong-based human rights group said 150 soldiers and hundreds of
villagers were swept away when a levee suddenly collapsed Saturday
in the central province of Hubei, and that more than 1,000 people
were believed missing. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   ADDIS ABABA (AP) _ With a war-induced famine killing hundreds of
people a day, representatives of the Sudanese government and rebels
fighting in southern Sudan have again agreed to put down their
weapons and look for a solution to their 15-year-old civil war. The
government in Khartoum announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout
southern Sudan Monday to let humanitarian relief reach an estimated
1.5 million people threatened by famine. Talks to end the fighting
were set to begin Tuesday. The latest cease-fire expands the scope
of a three-month truce agreed to last month between the government
and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in the hardest-hit
southwestern region of Bahr al-Ghazal. The mainly African,
Christian and animist southerners have been fighting the Islamic,
Arabized north since 1983 for greater autonomy. (SUDAN-PEACE TALKS)

19 killed by rival group in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BINOO JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Unidentified assailants entered a remote
village in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir and killed 19
people, in what police described Tuesday as a feud between two
groups of separatist fighters.
	   Kashmir police chief Gurbachan Jagat said the victims were all
relatives of a militant known as Imtiaz, who is wanted by police
for alleged acts of terrorism. Details of Monday's killings in the
village of Siala were not immediately clear.
	   Meanwhile, shelling across the India-Pakistan border, which
killed 88 people over the last several days, tapered off Tuesday.
Cross-border gunfire intensified last week when Indian and
Pakistani leaders held inconclusive talks over the disputed
territory of Kashmir.
	   The killings came less than a day after suspected Kashmiri
militants shot dead 34 laborers, most or all of them Hindus, in the
adjoining state of Himachal Pradesh.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is
divided between them. Militants in the Indian-controlled part of
Kashmir want to secede or unite with Muslim Pakistan. The Indian
part of Kashmir is the country's only state with an Islamic
majority.
	   Jagat said the suspected militant, Imtiaz, belonged to
Tehrik-e-Jihad, one of several groups fighting for Kashmir's
separation from India. That group is feuding with another group
called Hizbul Mujahideen.
	   In New Delhi Tuesday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told
Parliament the government was taking ``firm steps'' to deal with

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally lower
Tuesday, with the key index in Manila slumping 2 percent to a
five-year low. Traders said the Philippine market continued to be
battered by domestic and regional economic concerns. Shares were
also pushed down by the overnight decline of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, which fell 96.55 points to 8,786.74. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 31.63 points to
1,511.44 _ its lowest close since April 1993. Indonesian shares
also tumbled on fears that the Indonesian government will delay its
plan to sell its stake in some state-owned companies. In Tokyo, the
benchmark Nikkei Stock Average lost 141.50 points, or 0.88 percent,
closing at 16,023.58. Traders said investors sold banking issues on
worries that restructuring of the nation's banking industry will
take a toll on the sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar fell against
the yen, trading by late afternoon at 144.62 yen, down 1.02 yen
from late Monday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) _ Casting himself as a champion of
Caribbean economic rights, Cuban President Fidel Castro wrapped up
a three-island tour that showed his communist island to be a
powerful _ and popular _ influence in the region. Castro received
warm welcomes in Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada, even from past
foes, and won strong support for his demand that the United States
drop its 38-year economic boycott against Cuba. He reciprocated by
attacking Washington's challenge to the European Union's
preferential trade terms for Caribbean bananas _ a benefit seen as
a lifeline for many of the vulnerable island economies. Castro also
blamed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which links the
United States, Canada and Mexico, for allegedly robbing the
Caribbean of more than 100,000 jobs. He pitched his message to the
concerns of tiny nations dangerously dependent on limited sources
of income _ tourism, textiles, bananas, sugar _ and jittery about
the emergence of a single global economy in which they cannot
compete. (CARIBBEAN-CASTRO)
	   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. could face another ugly
confrontation with the United Auto Workers, this time over its plan
to discard its big Delphi parts business by the end of next year.
The move will further reduce the size of the No. 1 automaker and
mark a drastic shift away from GM's history as a vertically
integrated automaker that made most of its parts and assembled them
into finished cars and trucks. Early next year, the automaker will
offer up to 20 percent of Delphi in a public stock offering, then
turn over the remaining part of the company to GM shareholders. The
announcement was met with a terse UAW statement that implied more
labor problems for the automaker, which settled two crippling
strikes last week. (GM-REORGANIZATION)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Overcoming public opposition and safety fears,
Japan for the first time in 10 years will build a commercial
nuclear power plant for generating electricity, officials said
Tuesday. After months of discussion, the government's five-member
Nuclear Safety Commission concluded Monday there would be no
problem with the construction and operation of a new nuclear
reactor. That move paves the way for Kaoru Yosano, Minister of
International Trade and Industry, to soon give the go-ahead for the
construction of a nuclear power plant in Higashidori, a village in
Aomori Prefecture, or state, in northern Japan, ministry officials
said. The commission also judged safety will be maintained, even if
a magnitude 6.5 earthquake strikes below the site of a nuclear
power facility, the ministry officials said. (JAPAN-NUCLEAR)
	   CHICAGO _ His attorney has long said that Michael Andreas,
executive vice president of the Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
``doesn't make deals.'' But a retired Japanese executive claimed
otherwise during testimony in the ADM federal price-fixing trial.
Hirokazu Ikeda, formerly of the Tokyo-based Ajinomoto Co. Inc.,
testified that Andreas agreed to put a cap on the amount of the
feed additive lysine that ADM would sell in 1994 during a meeting
in Irvine, California, in October 1993. Andreas, who is on leave
from ADM, is also the son of chairman Dwayne Andreas. He is the
highest-ranking of three current and former ADM executives accused
in the price-fixing trial. Andreas' attorney, John Bray, has said
his client's comments were simply the talk of a cagey competitor
who was trying to figure out how big the worldwide lysine market
was. (US-ADM TRIAL)

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Firemen and volunteers scrabbled with their
bare hands Tuesday to search for survivors in the debris of a
collapsed building, discovering more bodies that boosted the death
toll to 16, police said.
	   Rescuers working though the night found 22 people alive in the
rubble of the building, which authorities had declared structurally
unsound earlier this year. Police feared as many as 15 people were
still trapped inside.
	   Cranes worked under floodlights to remove large chunks of
concrete to clear the way for rescuers to pull out victims. Workers
heard moans and cries for help from under the rubble.
	   Sobbing relatives searched for missing family members among the
injured being taken to hospitals.
	   ``I was buying medicines when I saw part of the building
crumble, and I ran for my life. By the time I turned around the
whole structure had toppled. It took less than 10 seconds,'' said
Manesh Rai, who was among the first to be discharged after
treatment for minor injuries.
	   Bina Shah spoke of the nightmare of being buried alive for more
than 10 hours.
	   ``I must have blacked out for the most part,'' Shah said. ``I
don't remember much but loud voices and rumbling sounds, I just
remember feeling very scared.''
	   The 20-year-old building crumpled with a loud thud Monday night.
Three of its seven stories had been added as a guest house without
authorization from city authorities.
	   Municipal officials said they had ordered residents to vacate
the building several months ago, reportedly after it was seen to be
leaning to one side. The warning was ignored.
	   ``We feared yesterday the toll could have been much higher ....
because of the guest house,'' said Sridhar Joshi, a top civic
official. Many rooms were unoccupied at the time of the collapse.

Aid agencies struggle to reach Kosovo refugees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. official saying convoy plans on hold due to
fighting, quotes, Serb report echoes claim that three KLA
strongholds overrun Monday, U.S. envoy comments &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling Tuesday to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in
the woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to
flee their villages.
	   Fighting stymied plans by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to send an aid convoy Tuesday for ethnic Albanians near
Malisevo, a former stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army, where thousands of refugees had sought shelter.
	   ``We cannot go into a battlefield,'' UNHCR spokesman Kris
Janowski said in Geneva.
	   He compared the situation in Kosovo to what happened in 1992 in
Bosnia, when Serb forces embarked on a policy of trying to empty
villages of their non-Serb populations.
	   ``If this is an attempt to drive Kosovo Albanians out of Kosovo
... that would be total lunacy,'' Janowski said.
	   There were no immediate details on the latest fighting.
	   The Serb Media Center on Tuesday echoed earlier reports that
Serb forces toppled three additional KLA strongholds Monday. These
included the villages of Lausa, Smonica and Jablanica. The attacks
come days after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised to
stop his attack on the KLA.
	   Milosevic also pledged last week to ``personally guarantee''
access for refugee agencies trying to bring aid to displaced ethnic
Albanian civilians. Nevertheless, U.N. refugee official Mons Nyberg
said Monday that access had been ``on and off.''
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was headed to the Serb-overrun towns
of Orahovac and Malisevo on Tuesday to assess the conditions for a
possible return of refugees.
	   ``If we don't start getting people back to their homes in the
next week or two, we will really have a humanitarian nightmare on
our hands,'' he told reporters.
	   ``I want to see what's out there and in fact I'm not really sure
what I'm going to see.''
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province, part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who met with Hill on
Monday, blamed the Serbs for exacerbating the problem in Kosovo.
	   ``Serb forces kill civilians, burn and destroy settlements and
entire villages and carry out ethnic cleansing,'' Rugova said,
according to the Kosovo Information Center. He also demanded
``energetic intervention by the United States and its allies.''
	   In Washington Monday, the administration of U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced that NATO had approved a plan to use firepower
against Serb forces in Kosovo, warning that another offensive could
trigger a ``humanitarian catastrophe.''
	   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium said that a
number of options had been underway for some time, but there was no
military action planned at this stage.
	   It has never been clear what would trigger a NATO attack. Nor
was it clear whether the administration was trying mostly to
unnerve Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
an ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995.

Cambodian officials vow to speed trial of alleged Khmer Rouge

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian justice officials said
Tuesday they are working to speed up the trial of a former Khmer
Rouge guerrilla accused of ordering the killing of three Western
tourists in 1994.
	   Nuon Paet was arrested Saturday in the murders of David Wilson,
29, of Australia, Mark Slater, 28, of Britain and Jean-Michel
Braquet, 27, of France, who were killed after being held hostage by
the guerrillas for about two months.
	   The young Westerners were abducted from a train that had been
stopped by Nuon Paet's guerrillas in the southern province of
Kampot.
	   Justice Minister Chem Snguon said Tuesday he has asked the
provincial court in Kampot, where the three were slain, to transfer
the case to Phnom Penh within the next few days.
	   Nop Sophon, deputy chief of the Phnom Penh court, said that once
he receives the go-ahead, ``we will start handling the case
immediately.''
	   Nuon Paet was arrested in Phnom Penh after the government lured
him to the capital from the former guerrilla stronghold of Pailin
with a bogus offer of a business deal.
	   He is being detained at the capital's dilapidated T-3 prison,
which houses political detainees and other important criminals and
suspects.
	   Although the warrant for Nuon Paet's arrest was originally
issued in Kampot, Cambodian leader Hun Sen said over the weekend
that he wanted the trial held in Phnom Penh ``for security
reasons.''
	   Prominent opposition politician Sam Rainsy, meanwhile,
questioned the timing of Nuon Paet's arrest, just one week after
parliamentary elections.
	   ``Nobody is fooled. Even two of the victims' fathers say they
are not satisfied with the timing or motivation of the arrest,''
Sam Rainsy said.
	   Critics say Hun Sen knew of Nuon Paet's whereabouts for nearly
two years, but only had him arrested Saturday to express thanks to
foreign governments that helped fund and give a stamp of approval
to Cambodia's electoral process.
	   Hun Sen, whose party leads in returns so far, hopes that the
elections will restore legitimacy and aid lost after he ousted
Prince Norodom Ranariddh in a violent coup last July.
	   Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy's partner in opposition, on Monday
described Nuon Paet's arrest as a ``tragic comedy.''
	   ``Why? Because Hun Sen has known for a long time where Nuon Paet
is, but he didn't do anything,'' Ranariddh told reporters.
	   He acted now, Ranariddh said, because he wanted ``to please
Australia, Britain and France'' after the elections.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Sunday that
the arrest would play no part in his country's evaluation of the
election process.

German prince fined for umbrella attack on reporter

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Prince Ernst August of Hanover has been
fined 90,000 marks (dlrs 50,800) for beating a photographer trying
to snap pictures of him with Princess Caroline of Monaco,
prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   Charges of assault will be dropped if the prince agrees to pay
the fine, to be divided evenly between two charity organizations
and the state of Lower Saxony, a statement from state prosecutors
said.
	   Prosecutors charged the prince beat photographer Karsten
Thuernau repeatedly for seven minutes with an umbrella at his
Pattensen estate, near Hanover, on the night of Jan. 11.
	   Thuernau, who had been waiting outside the estate to take a
picture of the royal couple, was not seriously injured. The prince
had claimed he was not trying to hit Thuernau, but only his camera.

EU approves dlrs 49.5 million in aid to Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 45 million
European currency units (dlrs 49.5 million) in aid Tuesday for
southern Sudan, where war has threatened hundreds of thousands of
people with starvation.
	   The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said the money
will help fund the activities of the U.N. World Food Program and
other organizations working to feed people in southern Sudan.
	   ``A combination of drought and escalating conflict has
aggravated the crisis in the region,'' the Commission said in a
statement. ``People are dying in increasingly alarming numbers, and
malnutrition is rampant.''
	   The Commission, citing World Food Program estimates, said
700,000 people need emergency food aid in rebel-controlled areas in
the province of Bahr El Ghazal, compared to 250,000 at the start of
1998.
	   The WFP is ``currently aiming to move a total of 15,000 metric
tons of food a month to aid a target population of 2.4 million in
Sudan,'' the Commission said.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has fought since 1983 for
autonomy for the south's Christian and animist peoples. An
estimated 1.5 million have died in the fighting and consequent
famines.
	   Under pressure from aid organizations, the United Nations and
donor countries, the government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Army rebels agreed in July to a three-month cease-fire to permit
distribution of food.
	   The Commission said the latest aid package brings to 66 million
ecu (dlrs 73 million) the total amount it has spent in humanitarian
aid for Sudan.

Singapore Jehovah's Witness told to violate belief or lose job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A Jehovah's Witness, whose beliefs prohibit him
from singing the national anthem or reciting the national pledge,
testified in court Tuesday how superiors ordered him to participate
in those rituals and dissociate himself from fellow believers or
lose his job.
	   ``I was appalled,'' Peter Nappalli, 37, testified as he closed
his case seeking reinstatement to his teaching job at a vocational
institute. ``It was really against every constitutional right that
I have.'' He said the letter essentially was ordering him to
abandon his family, who are also Jehovah's Witnesses.
	   The defendants' case was to open Wednesday and closing arguments
were expected Friday.
	   The first two days were taken up mostly in cross-examination
that seldom focused on constitutional rights, but instead on
whether Nappalli had warned his employers when he was hired that he
would not recite the national pledge or sing the anthem.
	   Defense attorney Tang Khin Wei repeatedly accused Nappalli of
lying about his intentions during his initial job interviews.
	   Nappalli, who supports his family as a tutor, repeatedly
affirmed that he had made his position clear, and that his
employers would have known anyway because he spent his military
service in prison camp for refusing to participate in army
activities.
	   Nappalli, who was fired from his tenured post teaching English
and mathematics in 1994, is suing to get back his job, lost pay, a
clear conduct record and compensation for infringement of his
constitutional rights.
	   Although there is no national law requiring citizens to recite
the national pledge or sing the anthem, the vocational institute
where Nappalli worked for 10 years, and other government-linked
institutions such as schools, have established such internal
requirements.
	   Singapore's constitution guarantees individuals the right to
practice, profess and propagate religious beliefs, but laws
restrict those freedoms.
	   For instance, the Jehovah's Witness denomination is banned from
meeting in groups of more than three people, possessing its own
version of the Bible and other literature, owning land, buying or
selling. It is illegal for adherents of the faith to go door to
door proselytizing.
	   Each year up to 40 young male Jehovah's Witnesses are sentenced
to prison labor camps for refusing to serve in the military,
although they are willing to perform other forms of national
service. Jehovah's Witness elders say there are about 1,400
adherents in Singapore, while some government estimates range up to
2,000.
	   Although it remains legal for Singaporeans to be Jehovah's
Witnesses and profess their faith, Nappalli testified that in
January 1994, he received a letter from the vocational school
saying it ``cannot allow its employees to be associated with any
banned or illegal organization or to participate in their
activities.''
	   ``I should not be forced to give up my religious faith by
threats of dismissal,'' Nappalli said in a sworn affidavit that
constituted part of his testimony. ``My decision to maintain my
faith and job was met with further reprisals designed to force me
to abandon my faith.''

Wild bear injures woman, appears in village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A wild bear attacked and injured a woman in
the forest in western Ukraine and then appeared in a nearby
village, frightening its residents, a newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The male bear attack occurred when the woman was picking
raspberries in a forest in the Ivano-Frankivsk region, the daily
Segodnya said. The animal later turned up in the village of Spas.
	   Local hunters chased the male bear out of their settlement and
later found the dead body of a female bear in the forest. The
female bear had apparently been killed by poachers, the report
said.

Collectors of Rembrandt's time bought art _ and nutmeg graters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Collectors with spare cash can pick up tips
from a popular exhibit at the National Gallery of Art that shows
how the newly rich of Rembrandt's time indulged a taste for curios
as well as paintings.
	   Prosperity, scientific discovery and a slew of new artists gave
Dutch collecting a special push in the 1600s. Wealthy burghers
bought and admired almost anything from insect specimens to nutmeg
graters to the world's greatest masterpieces. Some of the same
factors are still at work.
	   Collectors were ``armed with the belief that God had placed man
in the center of the world and had provided him with the means to
achieve unlimited knowledge,'' says the gallery's director, Earl A.
Powell III.
	   Among the items: a collection of paintings of golfers, playing
on ice. Over 300 years ago an unknown connoisseur snagged one in
Holland by Hendrick Avercamp. In the picture, the golfer wears a
big starched and pleated ruff around his neck _ the fashion of the
day _ that appears to be preventing him from keeping his head down.
	   He also appears to be having trouble keeping his tall hat from
falling off as he tries to keep his footing on the ice.
	   ``I'd have told him to relax _ bend the elbows and knees a
little,'' said Matt Kayson, the pro at the East Potomac Golf
Course, which is near the gallery.
	   At least five other painters of the period did golf scenes,
including Rembrandt.
	   The exhibit, called ``A Collector's Cabinet,'' also includes two
paintings that illustrate the helter-skelter look of Dutch
collections of the time.
	   One picture, done partly by Jan Breughel the Elder about 1620,
shows important guests looking over a collection in Antwerp. Nine
elaborately dressed men and women are examining large paintings,
small sculptures, jewelry, atlases, musical and scientific
instruments. There are also five dogs and two monkeys in the
picture, looking a little bored.
	   The other painting is by Jan Breughel the Younger. It has a nude
Venus in it, apparently live, as well as art and curios.
	   Curator Arthur K. Wheelock Jr. said the owners of these
collections are unknown. By the end of the 1600s, the fad of
accumulating almost anything had faded, and collections became more
specialized.
	   _____
	   The exhibit, which was to have closed Aug. 9, has been so
popular that it was extended to Nov. 1. Admission is free.

Journalists handed one-year jail sentences for alleged libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Two journalists have been sentenced to
one year in prison, deprived of civil rights for one year and
ordered to pay damages equal to dlrs 170,000 after a judge sued
them for allegedly libeling her husband, their editor said Tuesday.
	   The journalists, Ovidiu Scultelnicu, 31, and Dragos Stangu, 30
are free pending an appeal, said Toni Hritac, editor-in-chief of
the Monitorul newspaper in Iasi, northeast Romania.
	   On May 27, the two published an article disclosing details of a
meeting of police chiefs in which a police colonel was accused of
ignoring complaints filed by local residents and of amassing wealth
of uncertain origin.
	   Col. Petru Susanu was dismissed after the article appeared and
his wife, a judge, sued for libel. Their daughter is also a judge
and their son-in-law is a prosecutor in Iasi, some 325 kilometers
(203 miles) northeast of Bucharest.
	   In post-Communist Romania, officials are unaccustomed to
criticism in the free-wheeling press. Justice officials are often
suspected to be corrupt. They are accused of delaying some cases
for years while rushing through others in which they have a vested
interest.
	   The journalists said the court in Iasi was biased and asked the
Supreme Court to relocate the trial elsewhere, but the request was
refused, Hritac said.
	   Hritac, speaking by telephone, said the sentence was based on
``vengeance and shows that the justice system is corrupt.''
	   The sentence was passed on July 23, but due to bureaucracy,
Monitorul learned of it only late last week.
	   The journalists were fined 1.5 billion lei (dlrs 170,000), a
fortune in Romania where the average salary is about dlrs 110.

Singapore Airlines and Taiwan's China Airlines form strategic
</HEADLINE>
alliance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's flagship air carrier cemented a
strategic alliance with its Taiwanese counterpart Tuesday,
including the purchase of a substantial stake in Taiwan's China
Airlines.
	   A memorandum of understanding between Singapore Airlines and
China Airlines called for the purchase of between 5 and 10 percent
of China Airlines shares within the next six months, a statement
from the city-state's carrier said.
	   Singapore Airlines deputy chairman and chief executive officer
Cheong Choong Kong said the stake may be increased in the future.
	   ``We see China Airlines as a good investment,'' he said. ``It
demonstrates our faith in the long-term future of the aviation
industry in this region, notwithstanding the present economic
difficulties.''
	   He added that Singapore Airlines will explore joint ventures
with China Airlines in airline-related businesses.
	   Flight schedules will be coordinated for faster and more
convenient connections between the carriers, which will also share
flights on certain routes, the statement said.
	   Singapore Airlines operates 87 aircraft to 76 destinations in 41
countries, while China Airlines operates 52 jetliners serving 46
destinations in 20 countries.
	   The Singapore carrier's group total revenue for fiscal 1997 was
about 7.7 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 4.5 billion), while China
Airline's operating revenue last year totaled about 55.9 billion
Taiwan dollars (dlrs 1.63 billion).

Japan's foreign minister to visit Moscow in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japan's new foreign minister plans to visit Moscow
in September, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Masahiko Kamura said he planned to make the trip during a phone
conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kamura reiterated that Tokyo's policy towards Russia would not
change despite a recent Japanese government shakeup.
	   He said Japan and Russia would work together in line with two
summits held in the last year between President Boris Yeltsin and
former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Despite disagreement over the Kuril Islands, which Russia has
controlled since the end of World War II, relations between the two
countries have improved in recent years.

First repatriation of Cambodian refugees since election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of 755 Cambodian refugees left
Thailand's eastern province of Trat to go home Tuesday in the first
voluntary repatriation since Cambodia's election July 26.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees announced that the
repatriations bring the total of Cambodians who have returned home
overland from Thailand since Oct. 10, 1997, to 7,147.
	   Police escorted the convoy of buses and trucks to the crossing
point of Aranyaprathet and on into Poipet, Cambodia. They will go
home to 11 Cambodian provinces.
	   Some 55,000 Cambodians fled their country after strongman Hun
Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a
coup last year that triggered a new round of warfare.
	   The fighting abated several months ago in preparation for new
parliamentary elections intended to restore stability, prompting
many to return home. Hun Sen's party has apparently won the vote.
	   Many of the refugees who remain in Thailand are family members
of hard-line Khmer Rouge guerrillas who have not made peace with
the government.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector left
Baghdad on Tuesday after talks with Iraqi officials on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, told
reporters after flying to nearby Bahrain that the impasse stemmed
from a demand by Iraq's chief negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, that Iraq be given a clean bill of health on its
weaponry.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded that I tell the Security Council that Iraq
is clean now,'' Butler told The Associated Press. ``I told him that
I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't have the evidence.''
	   Butler continued: ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied,
`Then we can't talk any further.'''
	   They were Butler's first comments on why the talks failed.

Abacha's security adviser arrested in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The top national security adviser to the
late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha has been arrested and charged with
widescale fraud and corruption, a Lagos newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Ismaila Gwarzo, the man who ran Abacha's feared and often
loathed internal security apparatus, was arrested in connection
with a investigation into bank fraud and corruption, Thisday
newspaper reported.
	   His arrest comes about one month after he was fired by Nigeria's
new military leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. Abacha died of an
apparent heart attack in early June.
	   Gwarzo was arrested on Saturday at his Kano home in northern
Nigeria near the border with Niger, Thisday reported.
	   In one instance, Gwarzo is accused of illegally channeling
millions of dollars and British pounds sterling into slush funds
earmarked for pro-Abacha promotion campaigns.
	   Millions more were reportedly set aside to try to finance
Nigeria's way into a permanent seat on the United Nations Security
Council, Thisday reported.
	   Just days before his arrest, Gwarzo's passport was seized.
	   Shortly after Abacha's death he had returned about dlrs 250
million to government coffers, but that failed to halt an
investigation into his alleged corrupt practices.

	   Butler said he would report Thursday to the Security Council.
	   A similar account of the talks' collapse was given by Gustavo
Zlauvinen, Butler's legal adviser, after his arrival in Bahrain.
	   Zlauvinen said Butler had offered Aziz a new work schedule for
inspections of suspected biological, chemical and missile sites but
that Aziz ``refused to accept any schedule of any kind.''
	   He quoted Aziz as saying: ``If the chairman (Butler) will not
produce a clean bill of health for us, we will not work with you.''
	   Western reporters were barred from covering Butler's departure
from the Habbaniya air base outside Baghdad. But the official Iraqi
News Agency quoted him as saying that the Security Council would
have to decide how to deal with the situation.
	   ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the situation,'' INA
quoted Butler as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word
crisis.''
	   He added: ``I am sure the (Security) Council will strive to find
a solution and determine what the next step should be.''

Thai auto exports up 84.7 percent in first half of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's vehicle exports in this
year's first half rose 84.7 percent from January-June last year to
18.29 billion baht (dlrs 446 million), the Federation of Thai
Industries' auto club said Tuesday.
	   The club gave no explanation for the increase. Its data show
that car exports recorded the highest growth rate, jumping 144
percent from 1997's first half to 11.35 billion baht (dlrs 276
million).
	   Exports of automobile components ranked second in terms of
growth, soaring 74.3 percent to 1.88 billion baht (dlrs 45
million).
	   With domestic sales slumping because of Thailand's economic
crisis, Thai automakers are focusing their sales strategies toward
exports.
	   Most Thai automakers are joint ventures with the top Japanese
car companies, which dominate the local market.

Croatian farmers block roads to protest increased costs

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Facing losses in the sale of wheat crops
to the state, farmers in eastern Croatia blocked a local main road
Tuesday, demanding higher prices for their yield.
	   Meanwhile, in Poland protesting farmers also blockaded roads as
well as government offices in a nationwide demonstration against
grain imports and low prices.
	   As early as 7 a.m., hundreds of angry Croatian farmers, perched
atop tractors or on foot held up traffic, chanting slogans on a
main road in Djakovo, a rich, fertile strip of land some 300
kilometers (188 miles) east of the capital Zagreb.
	   ``After paying value-added tax, the farmer is left with no
profit at all,'' said Antun Laslo, leader of the region's farmers
union at the rally.
	   The government signed a deal with the farmers' union to buy up
wheat crops at 1.10 kuna (17 cents) per kilo last year. But the
agreement did not envision a 22 percent sales tax which was
introduced earlier this year on all goods and services.
	   The farmers are demanding that the government renegotiate the
going price to take into consideration the new tax.
	   They threatened to expand the protest to major highways if a new
accord is not reached. The government has shown no signs of
submitting to the demands.
	   ``At this rate, fields across the region will be bare next
season, as sowing for wholesale can only be carried out at an
absolute loss,'' Laso said.
	   Agriculture is the main income source for the majority of people
in eastern Croatia. The region's grain supply caters largely for
the entire country.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A man who had climbed a tree to
pluck some fruit was killed by hunters who mistook him for a
squirrel, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Harun Mamat, 47, was shot in the chest Monday while perched in a
mangosteen tree in a village near Kota Bharu, in the northern
Malaysian state of Kelantan. Mangosteen is a tropical fruit.
	   Police spokesman Muhammad Muda said two men from a neighborhood
watch group were hunting for squirrels and accidentally shot Harun,
the Bernama news agency reported.
	   Police detained one of the men for questioning and confiscated
his shotgun.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.N. official saying convoy plans on hold due to
fighting, quotes, Serb report echoes claim that three KLA
strongholds overrun Monday, U.S. envoy comments &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ International aid agencies were
struggling Tuesday to reach tens of thousands of refugees camped in
the woods of Kosovo province, after Serb attacks forced them to
flee their villages.
	   Fighting stymied plans by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees to send an aid convoy Tuesday for ethnic Albanians near
Malisevo, a former stronghold of the secessionist Kosovo Liberation
Army, where thousands of refugees had sought shelter.
	   ``We cannot go into a battlefield,'' UNHCR spokesman Kris
Janowski said in Geneva.
	   There were no immediate details on the latest fighting.
	   The Serb Media Center on Tuesday echoed earlier reports that
Serb forces toppled three additional KLA strongholds in the
villages of Lausa, Smonica and Jablanica on Monday. The attacks
come days after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised to
stop his attack on the KLA.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in Kosovo province, part
of the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia.
	   Janowski compared the situation in Kosovo to what happened in
1992 in Bosnia, when Serb forces embarked on a policy of trying to
empty villages of their non-Serb populations.
	   ``If this is an attempt to drive Kosovo Albanians out of Kosovo
... that would be total lunacy,'' Janowski said.
	   U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was headed Tuesday to the
Serb-overrun towns of Orahovac and Malisevo to assess the
conditions for a possible return of refugees.
	   ``If we don't start getting people back to their homes in the
next week or two, we will really have a humanitarian nightmare on
our hands,'' he told reporters.
	   ``I want to see what's out there and in fact I'm not really sure
what I'm going to see.''
	   Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who met with Hill on
Monday, blamed the Serbs for exacerbating the problem in Kosovo.
	   ``Serb forces kill civilians, burn and destroy settlements and
entire villages and carry out ethnic cleansing,'' Rugova said,
according to the Kosovo Information Center. He also demanded
``energetic intervention by the United States and its allies.''
	   In Washington, the U.S. government announced Monday that NATO
had approved a plan to use firepower against Serb forces in Kosovo,
warning that another offensive could trigger a ``humanitarian
catastrophe.''
	   Officials at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, said that a
number of options had been underway for some time, but there was no
military action planned at this stage.
	   It has never been clear what would trigger a NATO attack. Nor
was it clear whether the administration was trying mostly to
unnerve Milosevic by raising the threat again publicly.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
an ethnic war in Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1995.

Spain withdraws from women's Tour de France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spanish riders have pulled out of the
women's Tour de France in protest at the doping investigations
which tarnished the men's race.
	   ``We take this measure because of the poor treatment received by
Spanish cyclists and teams in the Tour de France,'' the Spanish
Cycling Federation said in a statement. ``It's a test of solidarity
for fear that the same incidents will occur in other races and that
will only contribute to damage the image of cycling.''
	   All four Spanish teams _ Banesto, Once, Kelme and Vitali Cio _
dropped out of the men's Tour de France to protest alleged
harassment by French police investigating the use of banned drugs.
	   The women's race starts Aug. 11 and lasts for 10 days.

	   Butler said he would report Thursday to the Security Council.
	   A similar account of the talks' collapse was given by Gustavo
Zlauvinen, Butler's legal adviser, after his arrival in Bahrain.
	   Zlauvinen said Butler had offered Aziz a new work schedule for
inspections of suspected biological, chemical and missile sites but
that Aziz ``refused to accept any schedule of any kind.''
	   He quoted Aziz as saying: ``If the chairman (Butler) will not

have to decide how to deal with the situation.

quoted Butler as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word

	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being a pawn of the Americans
in trying to prolong the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban air
travel and limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily of
Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the peoples strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year -- the
first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   Within hours of Butler's departure, representatives of Iraqi
trade unions demonstrated outside the U.N. offices in Baghdad.
	   A petition addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
accused the U.N. inspectors of ``aggression and domination'' and
pledged ``the protection of people's interests ... by all means in
the face of the illegal American-British plots.''

Palestinians reject Israeli withdrawal proposal; talks uncertain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 6 grafs to UPDATE with Arafat, Netanyahu quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal
to make part of a West Bank withdrawal a restricted ``nature
reserve'' with no Palestinian police presence, leaving it unclear
Tuesday whether the sputtering peace talks would go on.
	   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat said Israeli
negotiators brought nothing new to a Monday night meeting, and that
the Palestinians were ``studying'' whether to continue the talks.
	   Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Arafat
said the Israeli proposal was ``very far'' from the existing
Israel-Palestinian agreements or from an American initiative for an
Israeli withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called Monday's meeting
``a waste of time.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, told reporters in
Jerusalem that the Israelis had presented ``substantive'' proposals
to the Palestinians that he believed could bring the talks to a
conclusion. ``But they have different calculations on their side,''
he said.
	   Netanyahu and other Israeli officials did not elaborate on the
proposals.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli envoy
Yitzhak Molcho met for several hours Monday night in Jerusalem, but
did not speak to reporters afterward. Erekat briefed Arafat on the
talks late Monday night.
	   After months of stalemate during which the United States failed
to win Israeli backing for a 13 percent withdrawal, Israel and the
Palestinians returned to the negotiating table two weeks ago.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour told The Associated Press
that Israel had proposed that 3 of the 13 percent be land in the
Judean Desert classified as a ``nature reserve,'' over which Israel
would retain overall security control.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   Asfour said such Israeli proposals would ``lead to the end of
talks ... If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there
is no need for further meetings.''
	   A Palestinian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the Israelis had offered to give the Palestinians civil authorities
in the nature reserve areas _ which he said was meaningless because
no one lived in the desert areas.
	   The Palestinians would not, however, be allowed to have either a
security presence or to build in the area, another official said,
also speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.
	   ``We think they should deal with each other with respect and
confidentiality and a greater sense of urgency, and meet
intensively, so that they can make sure they've done everything
they can to try to reach an agreement. And they also, as we've said
before, need to make tough decisions. But we want specific
proposals on the table that can be dealt with,'' Rubin said.

Tennis federation rips Nebiolo over doping allegations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In the latest doping dispute between world sports
administrators, the International Tennis Federation has attacked
track and field boss Primo Nebiolo for making ``uninformed'' and
``groundless'' accusations about drug-testing in tennis.
	   International Tennis Federation president Brian Tobin sent a
bluntly worded letter to Nebiolo, president of the International
Amateur Athletic Federation, rejecting the Italian's criticism of
tennis' doping control programs.
	   ``I must ask you to desist from making these uninformed and
groundless ad-hoc statements about the federation's activities and
the game of tennis generally and I require the courtesy of an
acknowledgment of this request,'' Tobin said in his letter, which
was published in the ITF's weekly bulletin Tuesday.
	   In a statement released last week in the wake of the doping
scandals which tarnished the Tour de France, Nebiolo singled out
tennis, volleyball and cycling as sports which had refused to sign
an Olympic accord for harmonizing anti-drug programs.
	   Tobin said he had previously written to Nebiolo in December 1997
explaining the ITF's anti-doping program and never received a
reply.
	   ``I am still available at any time to discuss these matters in
detail,'' Tobin said.
	   Tobin said the ITF carries out more than 1,000 tests a year in
an anti-drug program approved by the International Olympic
Committee and in cooperation with the ATP and WTA tours.
	   ``We are proud of the fact that our testing program, although
comprehensive, has revealed only isolated positive results,'' Tobin
said. ``I might add that we have never suffered a positive test at
an Olympic Games _ a record, I am sure, that some other Olympic
sports would envy.''
	   Last week, international volleyball federation president Ruben
Acosta accused Nebiolo of making ``totally false'' allegations
about drug-testing in volleyball and said Nebiolo should
concentrate on fighting ``systematic doping'' in track and field.
	   Nebiolo responded by accusing Acosta of making ``useless,
personal polemics.''

Amphetamine use rising among Thai teens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Arrests for illegal drug use in
Thailand have been rising steadily over the past five years, and
law enforcement officials say teen-agers becoming addicted to
amphetamines account for the growing numbers.
	   Drug arrests in Thailand in 1997 totaled 157,400, compared with
113,500 in 1993, according to statistics released Tuesday by the
Office of the Narcotics Control Board, a government agency.
	   Of the 1997 arrests, nearly half were for amphetamines. Although
the statistics did not break down the arrests by age groups, ONCB
officials said amphetamine abuse had spread beyond truckers and
laborers to teen-agers.
	   ``Laborers use it for endurance, while teens take it for a
kick,'' said an ONCB official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The most scary thing is that most of these teens have become
part of drug rings and they will drug their school peers and
convince them to join,'' the officer said.
	   A recent study by the Ministry of Education concluded there are
about 50,000 high school students addicted to amphetamines.
	   Amphetamines, called ``ya ba'' or ``madness medicine,'' are the
most popular drug in Thailand. The Thai government has made the
penalties for dealing in amphetamines almost as severe as those for
dealing in heroin.
	   Increasingly, the drug is being manufactured in neighboring
Myanmar, also known as Burma, and smuggled into Thailand.
	   The ONCB official urged schools to try counseling students
discovered to be using amphetamines. Usually, students are
suspended or expelled.
	   The Education Ministry has ordered schools to ask parents to
send their drug-addicted children for treatment. The ministry is
setting up a special committee to deal with drug problems in the
schools.
	   The ONCB's National Narcotics Control Plan for 1997-2000 calls
for more treatment and prevention programs at the community level
to go along with stronger law enforcement.
	   Some educators have suggested random urine tests in schools, but
some civil rights activists oppose them on the grounds that they
would violate students' constitutional rights.

EU approves dlrs 39 million to support French defense conversion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union approved 35.5
million European currency units Tuesday (dlrs 39 million) to
support French regions facing severe job losses due to reconversion
of the defense industry.
	   The EU Commission said the funds will be used in 22 areas in
France where employment is particularly threatened by restructuring
of the defense sector.
	   The defense sector in France accounts for 670,000 jobs. The
restructuring of defence activities decided in 1997 is likely to
result in the loss of about 35,000 jobs over the next few years,
the Commission said.
	   It said the French government is also financing 19 regional
programs linked to industrial conversion and 17 others specifically
tied to conversion of areas affected by the decline in
defense-related activities.
	   Altogether, EU and French funds included, ``the total cost of
the multiregional program is estimated at 136.3 million ecu (dlrs
150 million),'' the EU statement said.
	   Of that sum, ``62.5 million ecu (dlrs 69 million) comes from the
private sector, 35.4 million ecu (dlrs 39 million) from the French
authorities and 38.4 million ecu (dlrs 42 million) from'' the EU,
the statement said.
	   France, along with other European countries with declining
defense budgets in the post-Cold War era, has accelerated its push
to consolidate its defense and aerospace industries.

Malaysia warns Singapore not to take it for granted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to highlight Malaysia's warning &QL; 
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHOR BARU, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid a worsening row with
neighboring Singapore, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
cautioned the tiny city-state Tuesday not to take peace-loving
Malaysia for granted.
	   ``We feel saddened when there is tension between Singapore and
Malaysia,'' Mahathir said in a speech in Johor Baru, which is
separated from Singapore by a thin strip of water.
	   ``We try our best to be cordial. We have no ill will against
it,'' he said to thunderous cheers from nearly 10,000 people who
had packed an indoor stadium to hear him.
	   Many in his party have been urging strong action against
Singapore, including suspending new bilateral deals.
	   The dispute is over the location of the immigration and customs
facility for passengers crossing the Malaysia-Singapore border.
	   Despite Malaysia's opposition, Singapore relocated its railroad
immigration facility Saturday, causing hardships for several
thousand commuters who now have to disembark twice for immigration
checks. Malaysia says it should be allowed to keep its immigration
control at the original site because it owns the land under an old
treaty.
	   In 1989, Singapore decided to abandon the joint checkpoint in
Tanjong Pagar and move it closer to the actual border, saying this
would facilitate checks on drug traffickers, smugglers and illegal
immigrants.
	   ``Singapore owns land in Malaysia, but we don't harass them,''
Mahathir said.
	   ``We are peace-loving but don't take us for granted,'' he warned
Singapore, which depends on Malaysia for more than half the water
its citizens use. Some politicians have urged that Malaysia use
water as a bargaining tool with Singapore.
	   ``They asked us to get out even though we supply them with
water. Please be considerate. We are considerate,'' Mahathir said.
	   Singapore has said the dispute over the railroad immigration
point should not be related to the water issue.
	   ``If they don't sell it to us, they don't have anybody to sell
it to,'' Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan
said Monday.
	   In Singapore, an angry citizen wrote a letter offering his
services in case of war.
	   ``As a sovereign nation, we are not to be taken for granted. As
an operationally ready NSman (national serviceman), I am prepared
to defend and die for Singapore,'' said the letter from Chang Chern
Yuen, a reservist, published in Tuesday's Straits Times.
	   Relations have been rocky in the past, but there is little
danger of an armed conflict between the two nations, which were
united briefly in 1963.
	   The experiment failed two years later but Singapore still
remains Malaysia's third-largest trade partner and an important
gateway into Malaysia. More than 200,000 Malaysians cross over to
Singapore each day to work and 27 trains run daily between the two
countries.
	   Meanwhile, a small fire broke out Tuesday morning at the Tanjong
Pagar station still used by Malaysian customs officials.
Authorities said they could not rule out arson as the cause.

Ben Johnson: I'm not the only bad guy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter who was
stripped of his Olympic gold medal in 1988 after testing positive
for drugs, says the recent doping scandals in the Tour de France
and other sports prove he was never ``the only bad guy.''
	   Johnson, who was banned for life after a second positive test in
1993, says athletes in all sports use performance-enhancing drugs
and that there has never been a level playing field.
	   Johnson said the widespread use of drugs in cycling, which was
exposed during the Tour de France, and the recent positive tests of
American sprinter Dennis Mitchell and Olympic shot-put champion
Randy Barnes support his claim.
	   ``The whole world was pointing at me saying I was the big, bad
guy _ the only guy taking substances,'' Johnson was quoted as
saying in an interview in Tuesday's Daily Mail. ``Now they can't
hide from the truth.
	   ``Now the world has seen that no sport is fair, that there is no
level playing field _ that cyclists are at it, Dennis Mitchell and
Randy Barnes, the East Germans, the Chinese, everybody is at it.
	   ``So Ben Johnson is not the only one who was doing it. And I was
never alone. In 1988 I was never alone. The majority at Seoul were
on some substance.''
	   Johnson, 36, claims he was a scapegoat.
	   The times he clocked _ 9.79 seconds for the 100 meters at the
Seoul Olympics and the 9.83 seconds at the 1987 world championships
_ were annulled. The current world record of 9.84 was set by
Canada's Donovan Bailey in 1996.
	   Johnson said he didn't think he could run under 10 seconds
without drugs.
	   ``I would say 10 seconds flat,'' he said, referring to his
fastest possible time without the aid of drugs. ``If you've never
used anything, just come to it natural, that's about my limit.''
	   At the inquiry into Johnson's disqualification from the Seoul
Olympics, Johnson's coach Charlie Francis estimated drugs gave the
sprinter a two-meter boost in the Olympic final.
	   ``I won by that much. So I would have won anyway,'' Johnson
said.
	   Johnson admitted taking drugs after the 1988 scandal but claims
he did so at the instigation of his coach and doctor.
	   He is still appealing his life ban and will appear in a Canadian
court just days before the 10th anniversary of his Olympic
disqualification on Sept. 25.
	   Johnson said he was the victim of a conspiracy to show the sport
was serious about cleaning itself up.
	   ``Somebody was out to get Ben Johnson and succeeded. But the
truth will be revealed very soon,'' he said. ``They had to get rid
of somebody, show they were doing something so they picked me. Then
they say the rest were clean. You saw how true that was last week.
Ben Johnson wasn't the only bad guy. Never was.''
	   Johnson told the Daily Mail he reserved his greatest contempt
for the Americans who were quicker to condemn him than they were to
compete against him.
	   ``So do I think Mitchell and Barnes are the only ones? What do
you think? ''
	   Mitchell was four places behind Johnson in the final at Seoul
but was upgraded to fourth when Johnson was disqualified and his
record thrown out.
	   Mitchell, who won the bronze medal in the 100 at the 1996
Atlanta Games, tested positive for high levels of testosterone
earlier this year and has been suspended by the International
Amateur Atletic Federation pending a hearing.
	   Barnes, the world record-holder in the shot, tested positive for
a testerone-related substance and faces the prospect of a life ban
because it was his second offense.

Kabila moving against rebellious troops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bukavu controlled by rebels; ADDS quotes from
Mayor. SUBS 11th graf pvs, `The majority ...' to delete erroneous
reference that Tutsis are in the majority in North Kivu. Edits

 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's government
issued an appeal Tuesday for public support against an open revolt
in eastern Congo and a brief armed challenge in the capital.
	   Accusing Rwandan soldiers of staging a rebellion against the
government, state-controlled radio quoted Kabila as vowing to crush
the uprising.
	   ``Be assured we will take weapons to swiftly end this
rebellion,'' State Minister for the Presidency Pierre Victor Mpoyo
said on the radio, quoting Kabila.
	   In the eastern town of Bukavu, rebellious forces had taken full
control of the town and airport, although sporadic gunfire could be
heard Tuesday, said Bukavu Mayor Khaddee Mutware.
	   ``All the city has been liberated,'' Mutware said during an
interview by telephone. ``The majority of the people are in
accordance with this.''
	   Mutware said fighting for Bukavu on Monday had been brief
because most of the people, including the soldiers, had joined
``the forces of change.'' He said most of those loyal to Kabila had
fled.
	   The town of Uvira, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) further
south, had also been captured, Mutware said.
	   ``The forces of change have taken the town and for the moment
its calm,'' he said. However, an aid worker reached by telephone in
Uvira said gunfire was still being exchanged.
	   Across the border in Burundi, gunfire and mortar fire could be
heard, apparently coming from the town of Mboko, about 30
kilometers south of Uvira.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gun battles in two military barracks in the capital.
	   ``The government asks Congo's neighbors not to make the wrong
decisions to fight,'' Mpoyo said in a radio broadcast following the
meeting.
	   The comment was aimed directly at neighboring Rwanda, which
Kabila believes is behind the movement against his leadership.
Rwandan fighters and Tutsis from the Banyamulenge ethnic group in
eastern Congo played a key role in helping Kabila march to victory
last year over longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Those same fighters today, however, appear to be moving to get
rid of Kabila.
	   A delicate ethnic and military alliance that helped thrust
Kabila _ a one-time obscure Marxist rebel _ into power 14 months
ago is now unraveling.
	   Rwandan officials on Monday said unrest in Congo's capital and
in the eastern province of North Kivu was an internal matter and
denied any involvement.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo told The Associated
Press that the government was preparing an armed response to the
rebellion in the eastern province of North Kivu.
	   On Monday, military officers said they had seized control of the
province and were vowing to oust Kabila, news reports in
neighboring Rwandan said.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda and Kabila's support and control of the region has faltered
for months.
	   ``They are bandits organized to loot the country,'' Kongolo
said, describing the breakaway leaders in North Kivu.
	   He said Rwandan soldiers had been seen in the towns of Goma and
Bukavu along the border with Rwanda.
	   ``We're telling them to lay down their arms and end this
adventure before we immediately bring in the army,'' Kongolo said.
	   In the capital one day after shots rang out at two military
bases on Kinshasa's west end, loyal troops continued to patrol city
streets and man roadblocks as heightened security left the city
tense. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was still in effect, but life in the
city began to return to normal as abandoned streets began to fill
again with shoppers and merchants.
	   Offices and shops reopened after being ordered closed on Monday.
	   Pre-dawn clashes Monday at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last week ordered all
Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.

Heat wave hits Ukraine

 &UR; AP Photo Planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A heat wave has swept over parts of
Ukraine, sending temperatures in southern regions to record highs
of 40 Centigrade (104 Fahrenheit, a meteorological official said
Tuesday.
	   The weather service attributed the heat wave to hot air coming
from southwestern Europe.
	   ``Such hot periods are rare,'' said Mycola Kulbida, head of the
Ukraine's Meteorological Center. ``They occur once in 20 years.''
	   Ukraine usually has mild summer weather, but the temperature hit
record highs of 40 Centigrade (104 Fahrenheit) in the southern
cities of Mykolayiv and Kherson.
	   In the capital Kiev, the temperature was about 35 Centigrade (95
Fahrenheit).
	   Ukraine suffered storms and floods in the western part of the
country earlier this summer, and Kulbida said there was ``an
extreme danger of fire'' in southern Ukraine because of the high
temperatures.
	   No major change in the weather was forecast until the end of the
week, he said.

Thai coffee production expected to drop by 50 percent this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The drought induced by the El Nino
weather phenomenon is likely to halve Thailand's coffee crop for
the 1998-99 season and sharply reduce coffee exports this year,
local newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Coffee production for the coming crop year is expected to drop
by 40-50 percent from last year's 80,000 tons to 40,000-50,000
tons, the newspaper Krungthep Turakij (Bangkok Business) quoted
Deputy Commerce Minister Paitoon Kaewthong as saying.
	   Exports are expected to total about 10,000 metric tons, compared
to 50,000 tons last year, according to an official at the
Department of Internal Trade under the Commerce Ministry.
	   The official, who asked not to be named, added that local
consumption is around 30,000 tons a year.

BAGHDAD: should be.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being an American pawn for
trying to prolong the punishing U.N. trade sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions ban air
travel and limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily of
Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the peoples strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the
first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   Within hours of Butler's departure, representatives of Iraqi
trade unions demonstrated outside the U.N. offices in Baghdad.
	   A petition addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
accused the U.N. inspectors of ``aggression and domination'' and
pledged ``the protection of people's interests ... by all means in
the face of the illegal American-British plots.''
	   Danilo Turk, president of the U.N. Security Council in New York,
said Butler would be in New York by Wednesday to brief the council.
	   ``This is a difficult moment,'' said Turk, the Slovenian
ambassador to the council. ``It is not easy to have the discussions
cut short, it is disturbing. We will have to see what Mr. Butler
brings.''
	   A U.S. State Department official said the decision to pull out
was Iraq's.
	   ``Iraq's action to break off talks is disturbing. We, of course,
want to wait for Chairman Butler's report to the council, probably
on Thursday, before assessing what cancellation of the talks
means,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   It was unclear if the latest impasse would trigger another
military crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain
sent warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential
sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   Baghdad has long accused the United States of working to prolong
the sanctions despite Iraq's contention that it has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Aziz on Monday said Butler's team was ignoring the country's
progress in eliminating its weaponry and, instead, focusing on
``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   Aziz repeated Iraq's earlier contention that Iraq ``does not
have any weapons of mass destruction.''

British Petroleum profits hit by low oil prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum PLC said Tuesday its quarterly
profits fell 20 percent to 695 million pounds (dlrs 1.16 billion)
as it suffered the effects of a severely depressed oil market.
	   BP said its pre-tax profits for the three months ending June 30
compared with earnings of 874 million pounds in the same period a
year earlier.
	   Revenues plunged 30 percent to 6.24 billion pounds (dlrs 10.42
billion), from 8.96 billion pounds, BP said.
	   BP's chief executive, John Browne, called the results
``satisfactory,'' under the circumstances. Oil prices had fallen at
one point to their lowest level in more than a decade as OPEC
produced too much while demand in Asia was weakened by its serious
economic crisis.
	   BP said it made an average of dlrs 12.60 per barrel for its
crude oil in the quarter just ended, down sharply from dlrs 18.30
in the same quarter of 1997.
	   BP warned that the global market may stay glutted with oil for
some time, although it predicted that if OPEC sticks with recent
pledges to slash output, prices could recover modestly later in the
year.
	   While BP mentioned OPEC production as a critical factor that has
weakened the market, BP, too, is pumping more oil.
	   The company said its production was up by 8 percent from last
year, with the higher volume helping to shield it against the lower
prices.
	   BP said that for the first six months of the year, its pre-tax
profits came to 1.17 billion pounds (dlrs 1.96 billion), down from
1.83 billion pounds a year earlier.
	   Half-year revenues came to 13.03 billion pounds (dlrs 21.77
billion), compared with 19.24 billion pounds a year earlier.

Dutch carrier posts 12 percent profit jump for first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday its net profit for the first quarter of 1998 rose 12
percent to 212 million guilders (dlrs 106 million) but was dented
by Asia's economic crisis.
	   The results for the three months ended June 30 were supported by
a one-off gain, lower costs and improved yields but hurt by
``trading conditions in the Asia-Pacific region,'' the airline
said. It didn't elaborate.
	   KLM said the net profit figure didn't include subsidiary
Martinair, and that operating profit would have risen 15 percent to
285 million guilders (dlrs 142.5 million) if it had.
	   Overall operating income rose 5.2 percent to 262 million
guilders (dlrs 131 million), at the low end of analysts'
expectations.
	   The net profit includes a gain of 47 million guilders (dlrs 23.5
million) from KLM's sale of its 26 percent stake in Dutch
transportation company Frans Maas NV.
	   That gain was largely offset by the loss of earnings from U.S.
partner Northwest Airlines, in which KLM has sold its financial
stake. In the first quarter of 1997, Northwest had boosted KLM's
net profit by 56 million guilders (dlrs 28 million).
	   Looking ahead, KLM said it expects an improvement in operating
income in the fiscal year ending March 1999.
	   The Amsterdam-based airline said its forecast assumes stable
global economics and that the labor situation doesn't deteriorate
at Northwest, which remains a KLM partner. Northwest pilots are
threatening to strike at the end of the month in a contract
dispute.
	   KLM on Tuesday didn't reiterate a recent forecast by Chairman
Leo van Wijk that net earnings are expected to get a double-digit
boost this year.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ As officials recounted some ballots
from last week's elections, opposition leaders insisted anew
Tuesday that their complaints about electoral fraud be resolved
before they consider joining Cambodian leader Hun Sen in a
coalition government.
	   ``No coalition will be discussed before the recounting is
complete,'' Sam Rainsy said after meeting opposition ally Prince
Norodom Ranariddh early Tuesday. ``We insist on the recount of
ballots to be completed properly.''
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party is the top vote-getter in 18
of the 21 electoral districts whose results have been announced so
far. Complete preliminary election results should become known
Wednesday, when the last two districts are expected to be
announced.
	   A projection by the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in
Cambodia, an independent election monitoring group, gives Hun Sen's
CPP 64 seats, Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC 43 and the Sam Rainsy Party 15
in the 122-seat parliament.
	   A recount of ballots from three communes in the southern
province of Takeo began at a snail's pace Tuesday, scrutinized by
party observers and independent poll watchers who immediately cried
foul when one of the ballot bags appeared to be missing a report
listing the total number of voters.
	   By early evening, it still had not been completed, but observers
from the Sam Rainsy Party were already complaining that they had
seen 50 or 60 ballots that should have been declared invalid.
	   Sam Rainsy said his party suspects irregularities in as many as
700 _ or close to half _ of the country's communes. He urged
elections officials to speed up their work if they want the new
government to be formed on time. He said he has already filed
complaints about irregularities in about 250 communes.
	   A spokesman for the National Election Committee said it was
considering recounts for disputed areas in two more provinces _
Kampot in the south and Kampong Speu just west of the capital _ but
that a special subcommittee had not yet worked out details.
	   The election was held one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual
premiership formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Hun
Sen hoped the polls would win back his legitimacy in the
international arena and aid lost after his power grab.
	   But the opposition has listed a string of complaints about fraud
and irregularities and has threatened to boycott the National
Assembly when the next session opens Sept. 24 if its concerns are
not met.
	   ``If they do not agree to recounting, we will not agree to
discuss anything else. There will be a deadlock,'' Sam Rainsy told
reporters, adding that recounting was neither particularly
difficult nor costly.
	   Hun Sen said he wants a new government to be formed quickly so
that Cambodia can win back its seat at the United Nations, which
has been left vacant since last year's coup.
	   He also wants Cambodia to be admitted as a full member in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, where it now enjoys
observer status.
	   Hun Sen has warned that if the opposition carried out its threat
not to attend the National Assembly, he could lower the
constitutional minimum for the assembly to meet and confirm a
government from two-thirds to 50 percent plus one.
	   He also said his current government could simply remain in
power.
	   Without the opposition's attendance, the assembly is unlikely to
have present the two-thirds of its 122 members needed to conduct
any major business.

Kabila moving against rebellious troops

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ President Laurent Kabila's government
appealed Tuesday for public support against an open revolt in
eastern Congo and a brief armed challenge in the capital.
	   Accusing Rwandan soldiers of staging a rebellion against the
government, state-controlled radio quoted Kabila as vowing to crush
the uprising.
	   ``Be assured we will take weapons to swiftly end this
rebellion,'' State Minister for the Presidency Pierre Victor Mpoyo
said on the radio, quoting Kabila.
	   In the eastern town of Bukavu, rebellious forces had taken full
control of the town and airport, although sporadic gunfire could be
heard Tuesday, said Bukavu Mayor Khaddee Mutware.
	   ``All the city has been liberated,'' Mutware said during an
interview by telephone. ``The majority of the people are in
accordance with this.''
	   Mutware said fighting Monday for Bukavu had been brief because
most of the people, including the soldiers, had joined ``the forces
of change.'' He said most of those loyal to Kabila had fled.
	   The town of Uvira, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) further
south, had also been captured, Mutware said.
	   ``The forces of change have taken the town and for the moment
its calm,'' he said. However, an aid worker reached by telephone in
Uvira said gunfire was still being exchanged.
	   Across the border in Burundi, gunfire and mortar fire could be
heard, apparently coming from the town of Mboko, about 30
kilometers (20 miles) south of Uvira.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gun battles in two military barracks in the capital.
	   ``The government asks Congo's neighbors not to make the wrong
decisions to fight,'' Mpoyo said in a radio broadcast following the
meeting.
	   The comment was aimed directly at neighboring Rwanda, which
Kabila believes is behind the movement against his leadership.
Rwandan fighters and Tutsis from the Banyamulenge ethnic group in
eastern Congo played a key role in helping Kabila march to victory
last year over longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Those same fighters, however, now appear to be moving to get rid
of Kabila.
	   A delicate ethnic and military alliance that helped thrust
Kabila _ a one-time obscure Marxist rebel _ into power 14 months
ago is now unraveling.
	   Rwandan officials on Monday said unrest in Congo's capital and
in the eastern province of North Kivu was an internal matter and
denied any involvement.
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo told The Associated
Press that the government was preparing an armed response to the
rebellion in the eastern province of North Kivu.
	   On Monday, military officers said they had seized control of the
province and were vowing to oust Kabila, news reports in
neighboring Rwandan said.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda and Kabila's support and control of the region has faltered
for months.
	   ``They are bandits organized to loot the country,'' Kongolo
said, describing the breakaway leaders in North Kivu.
	   He said Rwandan soldiers had been seen in the towns of Goma and
Bukavu along the border with Rwanda.
	   ``We're telling them to lay down their arms and end this
adventure before we immediately bring in the army,'' Kongolo said.
	   In the capital, one day after shots rang out at two military
bases on Kinshasa's west end, loyal troops continued to patrol city
streets and man roadblocks as heightened security left the city
tense. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was still in effect, but life in the
city began to return to normal as abandoned streets began to fill
again with shoppers and merchants.
	   Offices and shops reopened after being ordered closed on Monday.
	   Pre-dawn clashes Monday at two military bases apparently pitted
Kabila's troops against Rwandan mercenaries, who last year helped
the president oust Mobutu Sese Seko. Kabila last week ordered all
Rwandan soldiers to leave the country.
	   Earlier, Kabila sacked James Kabari, a Rwandan Tutsi who had
been the president's top military commander.

Tropical storm Otto batters Taiwan, kills one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Tropical storm Otto battered Taiwan
Tuesday, triggering landslides that killed one person.
	   Police said a man died in a landslide in southern Chiayi, where
the storm dumped 300 millimeters (12 inches) of rain in a 12-hour
period. Chiayi is 300 kilometers (180 miles) south of Taipei.
	   Weathermen warned of further floods and cave-ins in the area,
where five people were killed last month by a 6.2 magnitude
earthquake.
	   In nearby Nantou, the storm flooded rivers and landslides
blocked road traffic. Hundreds of tourists and villagers were
stranded in the mountainous area, police said.
	   At 6 p.m. (1000 GMT), Otto, packing winds of 90 kilometers per
hour (54 mph), was crossing the Taiwan Strait toward the Chinese
mainland, the Central Weather Bureau said.
	   The storm uprooted trees and destroyed fruit and other crops
islandwide, causing damage estimated at 13 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 370,000), the Agriculture Council said.
	   More than 20,000 households suffered a blackout on the offshore
Green and Orchid Islands. Domestic air flights and train services
were suspended, officials said.
	   The storm was expected to hit the southern Chinese coast early
Wednesday.

Government hopes import reforms will halt major farmers' protest

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Protesting farmers blockaded roads and
government offices in several Polish towns Tuesday in a nationwide
demonstration against grain imports and low prices.
	   The government called the protest, the largest this year by
farmers, a surprise and said it would proceed with previously
announced plans to purchase Polish grain and put a quota on
imports.
	   ``This is more a political activity than a defense of the
farmers,'' Deputy Prime Minister Janusz Tomaszewski told a news
conference.
	   The protests were mostly peaceful, with one including music from
a folk group, but they showed the increasing desire by farmers to
display their political muscle as Poland considers widespread
reforms needed to join the European Union.
	   Some 500 farmers with tractors and heavy farming equipment
blockaded 20 roads and also some town halls across the nation,
according to national police spokesman Pawel Biedziak.
	   In Goleniow, 520 kilometers (320 miles) northwest of Warsaw,
four tractors and a trailer filled with grain jammed the access
road to the city hall, an office worker in the building said by
telephone.
	   According to Mariusz Tarnozek, the worker, a banner on the
trailer said: ``We have grain, who will buy it?''
	   On the main road south from Warsaw, farmers tossed boxes of
potatoes and sacks of grain to halt vehicles and even stood in the
street themselves. Some minor pushing and punching between irate
drivers and protesters occurred.
	   Other places were peaceful, such as Biala Podlaska, 120
kilometers (75 miles) east of Warsaw, where a folk band played as
farmers blockaded the city hall.
	   Four farmers' unions that represent well over half of the
nation's 4 million farmers organized the demonstrations to protest
grain imports and demand government purchases of their grain.
	   Tomaszewski called the protests a ``great surprise to the
government,'' which he said would carry out previous decisions to
protect farmers. On Thursday, he said, the government would
introduce import quotas on grain and start purchasing Polish grain.
	   Agriculture Minister Jacek Janiszewski, sitting next to
Tomaszewski, said the government also would offer state subsidies
to companies buying Polish grain beginning Aug. 15.
	   He said the government planned to buy 1.5 million tons of grain
this year, with prices equal to dlrs 150 per ton of wheat and dlrs
105 per ton of rye. According to the Agriculture Ministry, farmers
currently get about dlrs 147 per ton for wheat and dlrs 88 per ton
for rye.
	   Janiszewski said he hoped the new prices and subsidies would
halt grain imports. If not, he said, the government might consider
increasing import taxes or banning imports, as demanded by farmers,
as a last resort.
	   Polish agriculture remains hobbled by small, poorly equipped
farms unable to compete with larger, more modern farms in Western
Europe. Calls for reforms to consolidate farms and make them more
efficient in preparation for Poland's bid to join the European
Union have been resisted by farmers, who fear losing control of
their land and having to work for others.
	   Tuesday's protest was the largest of a series held by farmers
this year, including one Monday in which 1,200 tons of grain
brought by train from Slovakia and Hungary was spilled across the
rails at a border crossing.

<TEXT>
	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Darren Clarke moved into No. 2
spot on the European Tour money list after finishing second in the
Scandinavian Masters at Stockholm on Sunday.
	   The Northern Ireland golfer finished three strokes behind Jesper
Parnevik to claim the dlrs 146,200 second prize at Stockholm and
jump Colin Montgomerie and Ernie Els to move from No. 4 spot to No.
2 on the European Tour.
	   The Scandinavian Masters was Clarke's second successive top ten
finish on the tour. His second place at the Dutch Open on July 26
had boosted him from No.6 place on the tour to No.4.
	   Lee Westwood still leads the tour with dlrs 970,593, ahead of
Clarke with dlrs 777,336, Montgomerie with dlrs 710,683 and South
Africa's Ernie Els dropping into No.4 spot with dlrs 635,832.
	   The remainder of the European Tour top ten remained unchanged.

Romance classes taught to cut divorce rate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Husbands will be encouraged to
``romance their wives'' as part of a Malaysian state's campaign to
curb divorce and cure wanderlust, a news report said Tuesday.
	   A string of talks and workshops on ``techniques to love and
romance'' wives will be the highlight of a program called ``Romance
Your Wife,'' which begins next month in the northwestern state of
Kedah, the Star newspaper reported.
	   Kedah Chief Minister Sansui Junid will give the keynote speech
for the program, which is ``intended to promote healthy
lifestyles'' and prevent husbands from straying, said the
minister's spokesman, Aziz Desa.
	   ``We also hope the rate of divorce cases in Kedah can be reduced
by introducing such a program,'' Aziz said, adding that 1,729
divorce cases were filed in the state last year.
	   Religious personalities, motivation specialists and couples
considered models of matrimony are to teach the course, which is
open to all married couples, Aziz said.
	   ``The participants will be exposed to different experiences from
the experts to help the married couples improve their
relationships,'' Aziz said.

EU clears dlrs 2.1 million in aid for Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union on Tuesday approved
1.95 million European currency units (dlrs 2.1 million) in
humanitarian aid for Peru.
	   The EU Commission said the funds will be used to help resettle
thousands of Peruvian refugees who fled civil conflict in the
country's rural areas in recent years.
	   ``Hundreds of thousands of people fled during the violence that
has affected Peru for over 12 years. Many are now returning, but
are having great difficulty resettling on land that was abandoned
for many years,'' the Commission said.
	   Funds are scarce in Peru, which is still recovering from
torrential rains and floods earlier this year attributed to the El
Nino phenomenon, the statement said.
	   The funds for returning refugees will be channeled through
humanitarian organizations for projects being carried out over the
next eight months.

Turkish cartoonist begins serving sentence for insulting republic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A cartoonist for a pro-Kurdish daily has
begun serving a sentence of three years and four months in prison
for insulting the Turkish republic, his paper reported Tuesday.
	   A warrant was issued for Dogan Guzel, of the daily Ozgur Gundem,
following his recent conviction for calling the state ``villain''
though his cartoon character, Kirik, in four separate strips. He
was picked up Friday night.
	   The Paris-based international journalists organization Reporters
Sans Frontieres called for Guzel's release, saying the cartoonist
was exercising his right to express his opinions.
	   Around 30 Turkish journalists are serving prison terms for their
writings, according to another press organization, the New
York-based Committee to Protect Journalists.

Butler blames Iraq for collapse of disarmament talks

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector left
Baghdad on Tuesday after talks with Iraqi officials on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, told
reporters on arrival in nearby Bahrain that the impasse stemmed
from a demand by Iraq's chief negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, that the country be given a clean bill of health on its
weaponry.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded that I tell the Security Council that Iraq
is clean now,'' Butler told The Associated Press. ``I told him that
I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't have the evidence.''
	   Butler continued: ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied,
`Then we can't talk any further.'''
	   They were Butler's first comments on why the talks, which lasted
six hours on Monday, had failed.
	   Western reporters were barred from covering Butler's departure
from the Habbaniya air base outside Baghdad. But the official Iraqi
News Agency quoted him as saying that the U.N. Security Council
would have to decide how to deal with the situation.
	   ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the situation,'' INA
quoted Butler as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word
crisis.''
	   He added: ``I am sure the council will strive to find a solution
and determine what the next step should be.''
	   Butler said in Bahrain that he would report to the Security
Council on Thursday.
	   It was unclear if the latest impasse would trigger another
military crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain
sent warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential
sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused by an agreement brokered in February by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   Since then, Iraq has stepped up the pressure on the United
Nations to life punishing trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. The U.N. sanctions ban travel to and from Iraq
and limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said in a nationally
televised speech that the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the
first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   Within hours of Butler's departure, representatives of Iraqi
trade unions demonstrated outside the U.N. offices in Baghdad. A
petition to Annan pledged ``the protection of people's interests
... by all means in the face of the illegal American-British
plots.''
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement that ``the Iraqi government's antics'' were thwarting the
U.N. inspectors' work.
	   ``We would like to see the sanctions lifted as soon as
possible,'' it added. ``But progress depends entirely on the
Iraqis.''
	   The Security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, but Butler has said he still has
reservations about Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs
and long-range missiles.
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being a pawn of the Americans
in trying to prolong the sanctions.
	   Aziz told reporters that Butler was ignoring the country's
progress in eliminating its weaponry and, instead, focusing on
``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily of
Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the peoples strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''
	   A U.S. State Department official said Monday that the decision
to pull out of the talks was Iraq's.
	   ``Iraq's action to break off talks is disturbing. We, of course,
want to wait for Chairman Butler's report to the council, probably
on Thursday, before assessing what cancellation of the talks
means,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Taliban head off counterattack, even closer to Mazar-e-Sharif

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Taliban claiming to have captured Saripul. Edits

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army launched a
preemptive strike Tuesday, saying they captured a town from
Afghanistan's opposition and headed off an attack that could have
slowed their advance on a key northern city.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said his fighters took the
town of Saripul, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of the
key city Mazar-e-Sharif, after a one-hour battle. Muttayn said his
opponents, who had retreated to Saripul after losing their
stronghold of Shebergan on Sunday, had been regrouping for a
counterattack.
	   Muttayn had no details on causalities or captives, and there was
no independent confirmation of his report.
	   If the claim were true, it would be one more in a series of
victories that has bolstered the Taliban, who already controls most
of Afghanistan. The extremist Islamic army appears poised to take
the rest of the country.
	   The Red Cross evacuated the last eight foreign aid workers
Tuesday from the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-e-Sharif,
fearing a repeat of the street fighting and looting that erupted
last year when the Taliban religious militia briefly held the city,
one of their opposition's few remaining strongholds.
	   Hundreds of residents were reportedly fleeing the city.
	   Taliban troops engaged in minor skirmishes Tuesday as they
advanced to 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif,
according to Taliban spokesman Muttayn. He said the religious
militia was now pausing to build bunkers and shore up defenses. It
was unclear when the religious militia would attempt to capture
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   An opposition source in Mazar-e-Sharif, who refused to be named,
confirmed Taliban fighters were 20 kilometers (12 miles) to the
west. The source, speaking by satellite phone, said residents in
the region were revolting against warlord Rashid Dostum, a leader
in the fractious opposition coalition, allowing the Taliban to
advance.
	   Dostum's whereabouts were unknown Tuesday.
	   Taliban radio reported late Monday that Taliban fighters were
also east of Mazar-e-Sharif _ just 40 kilometers (25 miles) away,
within rocket range of the airport.
	   Red Cross spokesman Michel Schaffner said Mazar-e-Sharif was
calm Tuesday and the airport, which was closed the day before, was
open, enabling a Red Cross plane to land and pick up 11 aid workers
from organizations including Doctors Without Borders, Pharmacists
Without Borders and Save the Children. A Pharmacists Without
Borders spokesman said the 11 included three Afghans.
	   The aid workers were brought to the Pakistani border town of
Peshawar, where Schaffner spoke by telephone.
	   Most international organizations pulled their workers out of
Mazar-e-Sharif after the chaos there last year.
	   Taliban leaders have imposed a strict version of Islamic law in
territory they control. Since capturing the Afghan capital, Kabul,
in 1996, Taliban officials have barred girls from school and
confined most women to their homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities. The factions occasionally turn on
each other, weakening their ability to fight the Taliban.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern Europe is sizzling from a
three-week-old heat wave that has reportedly claimed at least 20
lives in Romania, buckled streetcar tracks in Hungary and smashed
temperature records across the region.
	   Temperatures soared past the 40-degree Celsius mark (104
Fahrenheit) again Tuesday in the southern Balkans region, suffering
through its worst heat wave in half a century.
	   How hot is it?
	   So hot that journalists found Serb forces in Yugoslavia's
troubled Kosovo province heating their baked beans by setting the
cans on the fiery metal surface of armored personnel carriers.
	   In Bucharest, where the mercury has hit at least 36 degrees (97
F) every day since the first half of July, some 2,500 people have
called the capital's emergency services in the past four days and
15 ambulances are on heat patrol.
	   Hospitals in the city of 3 million said they are crowded with
people who suffered strokes, heart attacks, sunstroke or have
fainted in the scorching heat.
	   Residents are plunging into the city's fountains, the dirty
Dambovita River and lakes to keep cool.
	   Bucharest's mayor, Viorel Lis, is sending the city hall staff
home at lunch time every day to avoid any heat-related accidents,
and has urged other employers to do the same.
	   Wheat and corn and sunflowers around the capital have been burnt
by the heat.
	   In Sarajevo, one-time host of the Winter Olympics, the Bosnian
Federation health ministry was recommending people stay indoors
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. because of the high temperatures.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, several dozen people fainted on the hot
sidewalks Monday on the hottest Aug. 3 in 111 years _ 39 Celsius
(102 Fahrenheit) in the shade.
	   In poverty-stricken Albania, where it was 42 (108) in the
capital Tirana on Tuesday, anxious mothers were taking their babies
to hospitals in high numbers for fear of health problems.
	   Croatia's renowned beaches weren't offering much relief from the
record-breaking heat _ the Adriatic Sea was a warm 26 to 28 degrees
Celsius (79 to 82 Fahrenheit).
	   In the Hungarian capital Budapest, public pools have standing
room only and a streetcar line suspended operations Monday when the
tracks along one stretch buckled.
	   A 77-year-old heat record for Aug. 3 was broken Monday when the
official temperature reached 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 Fahrenheit).
It was even hotter in downtown Budapest _ 40 (104 F) or higher.
	   ``We just can't work _ we have three fans going and it is still
35 (95 F) degrees in the office,'' said Melinda Kis, a secretary at
a travel agency.
	   Ukraine, which usually has mild summer weather, also was
affected, with record highs of 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in the
southern cities of Mykolayiv and Kherson.
	   A break in the weather is coming _ but not for long. Attila
Nadrai, head of Hungary's National Meteorological Service, said a
cool front is expected by Wednesday, but the forecast for the
region next week calls for more heat.

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Jordanian government and banks are to
blame for the profound recession in the local construction
industry, the president of the Jordanian Engineers Association said
Tuesday.
	   Construction activity has declined for a third consecutive year
and the total area of sites around the country is 16 percent below
the figure in the first half of 1997, Hosni Abou Ghida told The
Associated Press.
	   ``The volume and size of construction projects have dropped
sharply, and the number of engineering offices has been negatively
affected, because the government and banks do not support Jordanian
construction companies,'' Abou Ghida said.
	   He revealed that 60 percent of the construction under way was
being carried out by non-Jordanian companies with the backing of
foreign banks and the government.
	   Abou Ghida declined to speak about why investors preferred
foreign construction companies. However, the government is
encouraging foreign investment and it is known that foreign
investors tend to engage construction companies with whom they are
already familiar.
	   Abou Ghida said that 32 new engineering firms had registered
their offices with the association this year, but 48 offices had
closed, resulting in a decline of 16 registered firms.
	   As for engineers, he said 1,233 were registered as out of work
while 933 had jobs.
	   He appealed to the government and banks to support local firms.
	   ____
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran and five Asian states plan to build a
multi-purpose satellite, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Tuesday.
	   China, Pakistan, Mongolia, Thailand and South Korea will
cooperate with Iran to manufacture the satellite, which will be
used for telecommunications and monitoring, the agency quoted an
Iranian Deputy Communications Minister as saying.
	   The satellite will cost dlrs 20 million, the deputy minister
said. Construction will begin soon and the satellite should be
launched by 2001.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) - Some 100 local and foreign companies have applied
to rent space in Kuwait's first free-trade zone, suggesting the
project will be successful, the Al-Qabas newspaper said Tuesday.
	   The zone's manager, Juhail al-Juhail, is very pleased with the
high demand for a project whose first phase will open in October,
the newspaper reported.
	   Al-Juhail said the zone at Shuwaik Port, just west of Kuwait
City, will offer facilities for storage, light industry and
offices.
	   The government has contracted a private firm, The National Real
Estate Co., to build and manage the zone for 20 years. It is hoping
the zone will attract foreign capital and boost the private sector.
	   Kuwait wants to develop the private sector of its economy, which
depends heavily on oil and government spending.
	   ____
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The total assets of Bahrain-based
offshore banking units fell 1 percent to dlrs 71.4 billion in the
first quarter of this year, the island's Central Bank reported
Tuesday.
	   However, total commercial bank assets increased 2.6 percent in
the first quarter to dlrs 11.29 billion, the Bahrain Monetary
Agency said.
	   BMA, as the central bank is known, did not explain the
movements.
	   Bahrain is the offshore banking center of the Middle East. There
are about 47 offshore banking units and 19 commercial banks
operating from the tiny Gulf state.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon might become the regional center
for growing the potatoes used by the McDonald's fast-food chain,
Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury said in remarks published
Tuesday.
	   The minister said such a role depends on a plan to start potato
plantations in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley with 300 kilograms of
seeds imported from the United States, The Daily Star quoted
Fakhoury as saying.
	   The sowing of the seeds will begin in October, coinciding with
the opening of McDonald's first Lebanese branch in Beirut, the
minister said.
	   To open the branch, the government has allowed McDonald's to
import some 400 tons of potatoes.
	   McDonald's is scheduled to open a second branch in Beirut by the
end of the year.
	   The minister did not say where Lebanon might sell its American
species of potatoes, but McDonald's has branches in Egypt and
Jordan.
	   McDonald's is the latest of several fast-food chains to open in
Lebanon since the end of the 1975-90 civil war.
	   ____
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Foreign workers in Lebanon have been
ordered to buy insurance policies before they apply for work
permits, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Labor Minister Assad Hardan said the insurance policies must
cover health care, accident compensation, deportation fees and
repatriation of the body in case of a worker's death, An-Nahar and
other newspapers reported.
	   The minister said workers would have to buy policies offering at
least dlrs 2,500 for a minor or permanent physical handicap caused
by an accident. For more serious accidents and illnesses, the cover
should offer the worker at least dlrs 2,500 per accident and up to
dlrs 5,000 per year.
	   There are more than one million foreign workers, mainly Syrians,
in Lebanon, which has an estimated population of 3.2 million.

<SLUG> Group warns of American culture of sex at rally in Tokyo </SLUG>

	   TOKYO (AP) _ With thumping rap, folk singalongs and multilingual
banners, the U.S.-based Pure Love Alliance brought its message to
Japan Tuesday in a rally urging sexual abstinence and warning
against America's culture of sex.
	   About 500 advocates of sexual purity from the United States,
Japan, South Korea and Europe gathered in pouring rain in a park
near the Tokyo's Harajuku district, a favorite of young people, to
promote chastity and fidelity within marriage.
	   ``American culture is infiltrating the world, promoting the
spread of things like prostitution and pornography,'' said
24-year-old Tricy Sincavage, who flew in from the United States to
join the tour. ``Our aim is to help clean things up.''
	   The alliance, made up of students celebrating their virginity
and members of church groups from around the world, plans to hold
four more rallies and marches around Japan, then move on to South
Korea to complete its 1998 tour.
	   The growing number of Japanese schoolgirls who are turning to
prostitution and the country's booming sex industry, which includes
telephone dating clubs that are often fronts for prostitution, were
part of the reason the group came to Japan, organizers say.
	   ``More and more families are breaking up and Japan needs to
return to purity,'' said 42-year-old Pure Love member Masakazu
Irie. ``Japan must realize the mistakes of the sexual revolution.''
	   The alliance gained attention last year when it led 500 people
claiming to be virgins on a 25-city tour in the United States,
saying it wanted to end what it calls the stigma of virginity.
	   Many of the group's members are followers of the Unification
Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
	   Not everyone was convinced that the throng of demonstrators
wearing pink visors and ``pure love'' T-shirts had a message Japan
wanted to hear.
	   ``I don't know what they're talking about,'' said 40-year-old
Eichi Sasaki, who sells fried noodles from a booth in the park.
``Japan said no to sex before marriage at the turn of the century,
but not any more.''

Southern Chinese boom town to ban tobacco ads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The capital of booming southern China's Guangdong
province will ban all cigarette ads and product promotions by Aug.
25, the official China Daily reported Tuesday.
	   Billboards, bar signs, umbrellas, balloons and other giveaways
bearing cigarette brand names will be banned in Guangzhou city,
complementing a nationwide ban on print and broadcast cigarette
advertising, the paper said.
	   ``The municipal government expects the city to become a modern
metropolis without cigarettes,'' the paper quoted an unidentified
city official as saying.
	   But the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce challenged the
ban and said ads and promotions remain legal for the time being,
the paper said.
	   China has some 320 million smokers, and its smoking rate of 60
percent for men is among the highest in the world.
	   The government relies on cigarette taxes and profits for about
10 percent of its revenues, but says smoking-related fires and
health care cost more than tobacco brings in. In recent years,
smoking has been prohibited in planes, trains, theaters,
restaurants and public buildings.

Powerful Yorubas vote to support Nigeria's democracy plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Delegates attending a conference of
leading ethnic Yorubas voted to support the ruling military's
proposed plan to hand power back to civilian leaders, a spokesman
said Tuesday.
	   The meeting, described as the largest gathering of Yoruba
officials in three decades, took place at the plush Premier hotel
in the southwestern city of Ibadan on Monday.
	   Hundreds of politicians, academics and traditional leaders
attended the conference which was convened to discuss whether
Yorubas would endorse the new military junta's transition process.
	   ``All Yorubas will participate fully in the ensuing political
process that will lead to the termination of military rule,'' said
Abraham Adesanya, the group's spokesman.
	   The question of whether the Yorubas would boycott the new
junta's transition process has been looming ever since the death in
detention of Nigeria's most famous political prisoner Moshood
Abiola.
	   Yorubas activists have led opposition to military rule in
Nigeria.
	   Abiola, a Yoruba, was jailed by Abubakar's predecessor Gen. Sani
Abacha after declaring himself president in 1994. Abiola was the
presumed winner of 1993 presidential elections that Abacha
annulled.
	   The group's decision is a considerable boost for Abubakar, who
has received cautious praise for his policies since taking control
of the country.
	   Abubakar has promised to release all political prisoners and to
usher in civilian rule next year after elections in which all
Nigerians would be free to participate.

Butler blames Iraq for collapse of disarmament talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, CHANGES overline, RAISES possible

TRIMS. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector left
Baghdad on Tuesday after the collapse of talks on dismantling
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction collapsed.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, told
reporters on arrival in nearby Bahrain that the impasse stemmed
from a demand by Iraq's chief negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz, that the country be given a clean bill of health on its
weaponry.
	   ``Tariq Aziz demanded that I tell the Security Council that Iraq
is clean now,'' Butler told The Associated Press. ``I told him that
I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't have the evidence.''
	   Butler continued: ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied,
`Then we can't talk any further.'''
	   They were Butler's first comments on why the talks, which lasted
six hours on Monday, had failed.
	   Iraq has stepped up the pressure on the United Nations to lift
trade sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
U.N. sanctions ban travel to and from Iraq and limit the sale of
oil, Iraq's economic mainstay.
	   But the security Council has said that the sanctions will not be
lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction.
	   Western reporters were barred from covering Butler's departure
from the Habbaniya air base outside Baghdad. But the official Iraqi
News Agency quoted him as saying that the U.N. Security Council
would have to decide how to deal with the situation.
	   ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the situation,'' INA
quoted Butler as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word
crisis.''
	   He added: ``I am sure the council will strive to find a solution
and determine what the next step should be.''
	   Butler said in Bahrain that he would report Thursday to the
Security Council.
	   It was unclear if the latest impasse would trigger another
military crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain
sent warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential
sites to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused by an agreement brokered in February by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   Last month, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein gave a nationally
televised speech saying that the sanctions must be lifted this year
_ the first time he had set a deadline.
	   Government officials said that Saddam was expected to convene
his Revolutionary Command Council later Tuesday to assess the
situation.
	   Within hours of Butler's departure, representatives of Iraqi
trade unions demonstrated outside the U.N. offices in Baghdad. A
petition to Annan pledged ``the protection of people's interests
... by all means in the face of the illegal American-British
plots.''
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a
statement that ``the Iraqi government's antics'' were thwarting the
U.N. inspectors' work.
	   ``We would like to see the sanctions lifted as soon as
possible,'' it added. ``But progress depends entirely on the
Iraqis.''
	   Iraq insists it has eliminated its proscribed weapons, but
Butler has said he still has reservations about Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons programs and long-range missiles.
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of being an American pawn for
trying to prolong the sanctions.
	   Aziz told reporters that Butler was ignoring the country's
progress in eliminating its weaponry and, instead, focusing on
``minor issues which make no sense from the angle of disarmament.''
	   ``Since this is the wish of the American administration to
perpetuate the situation, to prolong the current situation, to keep
the sanctions on the people of Iraq. ... as long as this is the
American wish, you (Butler) are serving the American policy,'' he
said.
	   This theme was echoed Tuesday by Al-Qaddisiya, the daily of
Iraq's armed forces.
	   ``Eight years of unfair sanctions are enough.'' the paper said.
``Butler and his men have to prove that they are U.N.
professionals, not obedient tools of America. ... Otherwise, Iraq's
patient people will continue a `jihad' (holy war) and will not
allow more years of sanctions. Enough is enough.''
	   The paper did not suggest what action the country planned,
saying only that ``the peoples strategy is jihad until the
sanctions are lifted.''

Malaysia announces fund to strengthen banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's central bank on Tuesday
announced mechanisms to strengthen the country's ailing banks in
hopes that increased lending would spur economic growth.
	   Bank Negara said a special agency with initial funds of 1.5
billion ringgit (dlrs 375 million) would act as a strategic
investor in selected banks and encourage them to merge.
	   Bank Negara stressed that the fund was created as a pre-emptive
measure ``to recapitalize the domestic banking institutions to
healthy levels to enable them to increase their resilience and
enhance their ability to generate new lending.''
	   The agency, known as The Special Purpose Vehicle, will be run by
the central bank's assistant governor, Mohamad Daud Haji Dol Moin.
	   Malaysia recently adopted a strategy of strengthening its
debt-ridden banks so they could begin to lend money again to
companies reeling from the effects of Asia's economic turmoil.
	   This is part of a larger plan introduced last month to shore up
the economy by promoting spending and reviving many of the
expensive projects that were shelved last year at the onset of the
Asian currency and stock market crisis.
	   Part of the new plan, to raise money by selling bonds overseas,
received a setback recently when Moody's and Standard and Poor's
downgraded Malaysia's ratings.
	   On Tuesday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad criticized the
downgrade as a scheme to ``scuttle our bonds.''
	   ``The moment they hear that we are trying to recapitalize our
banks, they drop our credit ratings,'' Mahathir said at a public
meeting in the southern city of Johor Baru.
	   ``They do this to prevent us from helping our banks to
recover,'' he said. ``They are trying to destroy our economy.''
	   Mahathir urged Malaysians to keep their money in banks and buy
local goods to boost the economy.
	   ``Put your money in banks and not under your mattresses,'' he
said.
	   He accused the International Monetary Fund of wanting to control
Malaysia's banks and reiterated that Malaysia does not need support
from the international lending agency.
	   ``We can still stand on our own feet. There is enough to eat,''
Mahathir said.
	   Bank Negara said the government would play a minimal role in
financing the banking agency, which would be funded primarily from
bond issues and foreign lenders.
	   Malaysia's once booming economy is slipping into recession, with
forecasts of contraction of up to 2 percent in 1998, a sharp plunge
from 7.8 percent economic growth in 1997. The currency, the
ringgit, has depreciated 40 percent against the U.S. dollar since
last July.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities declared a state of emergency
in areas near Athens on Tuesday as more than 1,000 firefighters and
soldiers battled a huge forest fire raging for a second day.
	   Evidence suggested the blazes could be the work of arsonists,
officials said.
	   Gale force winds reaching 74 kilometers an hour (46 mph)
grounded firefighting planes and Chinook helicopters dispatched to
help battle the blaze around the village of Anthousa, about three
kilometers (1.8 miles) east of Athens, authorities said.
	   Residents and volunteers assisted 650 firefighters and 500
soldiers with 30 fire trucks battling the fire, which was rekindled
during the night after being brought under control.
	   The blaze reportedly damaged several houses and a German World
War II cemetery and led to the evacuation of a convent, a military
hospital and a home for disabled children. A children's summer camp
also was severely damage.
	   The fire began late Sunday at the foot of Mount Pendeli about
four kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern
suburbs.
	   Local officials have said anonymous telephone callers on Sunday
threatened to burn local forests. Fire brigade and police radio
frequencies were jammed Monday by callers shouting obscenities and
reporting fires far from the actual blazes.
	   ``There was an attempt to terrorize firefighting forces and
cause anxiety,'' said Public Order Minister Giorgos Romeos.
	   No injuries due to the fires were reported. Blazes in the
Pendeli area in past years have left much of the mountainside a
landscape of charred stumps.
	   A separate large fire broke out near the southeastern seaside
resort suburb of Lagonisi. No houses or hotels were threatened,
authorities said.
	   In another brush fire, flames threatened some ancient sites
including the small amphitheater at Epidavros, about 60 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Athens, media reports said.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

Kurdish rebel group accuses rival of killing local leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ One of the main Kurdish groups in northern
Iraq on Tuesday accused a Turkish rebel faction of killing one of
its local leaders by booby-trapping his house.
	   Delshad Miran, a spokesman for the Kurdistan Democratic Party,
said KDP leader Khalid Tawfiq and his family were killed in the
explosion on Saturday.
	   He blamed fighters from the Kurdish Workers Party of Turkey.
	   The KDP, which shares control over the enclave with the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, has been fighting the PKK. PKK
fighters carry out attacks on Turkey from their bases in northern
Iraq.
	   Miran, reached in London by phone from Cairo, accused the PKK of
planting explosives in Tawfiq's house in Dohuk, some 60 kilometers
(40 miles) south of the Turkish border. Tawfiq headed the KDP
branch in Dohuk.
	   The blast killed Tawfiq, his wife and four children, Miran said.
	   ``This is a heinous and terrorist crime against our party and
our people,'' Miran said.
	   The KDP has been helping the Turkish army in its campaigns to
try to shut down PKK bases in Iraq.

Group warns of American culture of sex at rally in Tokyo

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With thumping rap, folk singalongs and multilingual
banners, the U.S.-based Pure Love Alliance brought its message to
Japan Tuesday in a rally urging sexual abstinence and warning
against America's culture of sex.
	   About 500 advocates of sexual purity from the United States,
Japan, South Korea and Europe gathered in pouring rain in a park
near the Tokyo's Harajuku district, a favorite of young people, to
promote chastity and fidelity within marriage.
	   ``American culture is infiltrating the world, promoting the
spread of things like prostitution and pornography,'' said
24-year-old Tricy Sincavage, who flew in from the United States to
join the tour. ``Our aim is to help clean things up.''
	   The alliance, made up of students celebrating their virginity
and members of church groups from around the world, plans to hold
four more rallies and marches around Japan, then move on to South
Korea to complete its 1998 tour.
	   The growing number of Japanese schoolgirls who are turning to
prostitution and the country's booming sex industry, which includes
telephone dating clubs that are often fronts for prostitution, were
part of the reason the group came to Japan, organizers say.
	   ``More and more families are breaking up and Japan needs to
return to purity,'' said 42-year-old Pure Love member Masakazu
Irie. ``Japan must realize the mistakes of the sexual revolution.''
	   The alliance gained attention last year when it led 500 people
claiming to be virgins on a 25-city tour in the United States,
saying it wanted to end what it calls the stigma of virginity.
	   Many of the group's members are followers of the Unification
Church of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.
	   Not everyone was convinced that the throng of demonstrators
wearing pink visors and ``pure love'' T-shirts had a message Japan
wanted to hear.
	   ``I don't know what they're talking about,'' said 40-year-old
Eichi Sasaki, who sells fried noodles from a booth in the park.
``Japan said no to sex before marriage at the turn of the century,
but not any more.''

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Firemen and volunteers scrabbled with their
bare hands Tuesday to clear debris from a collapsed building,
discovering more bodies that took the death toll to 21, police
said.
	   In an overnight rescue mission, 22 people were taken out alive
from the rubble of the building, which had been declared
structurally unsound earlier this year. All but one were
hospitalized, mostly with head injuries.
	   Police feared 10 others may still be trapped inside.
	   Cranes worked under floodlights to remove large chunks of
concrete to clear the way for rescuers pulling out victims. Workers
could hear moans and cries for help from under the rubble.
	   Sobbing relatives searched for missing family members among the
injured who were being rushed to nearby hospitals.
	   ``I was buying medicines when I saw part of the building crumble
and I ran for my life. By the time I turned around the whole
structure had toppled. It took less than 10 seconds,'' said Manesh
Rai, who was among the first to be discharged after treatment for
minor injuries.
	   Others like Bina Shah spoke of the nightmare of being buried
alive for more than 10 hours.
	   ``I must have blacked out for the most part. I don't remember
much but loud voices and rumbling sounds, I just remember feeling
very scared,'' Shah said.
	   Earlier, officials feared a higher number of casualties, as it
was unclear how many people were inside the building when it
crumpled with a loud thud Monday night.
	   Three floors of the 20-year-old building's seven stories were
unauthorized by the Bombay city authorities and had been added on
as a guest house.
	   Municipal officials said they ordered residents to vacate the
building several months ago, reportedly after it was noticed to be
leaning toward one side. The warning was ignored.
	   ``We feared yesterday the toll could have been much higher ...
because of the guest house,'' said Sridhar Joshi, a top civic
official. Many rooms were unoccupied at the time of the collapse.

Vatican calls for respect for law by occupiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican on Tuesday called on a group of
immigrants occupying its embassy in Paris for four days to end
their ``illegal action.''
	   In a note seeking to clarify its position, the Vatican stressed
the need to obey French laws by immigrants seeking residence
permits.
	   In its first official comment Monday, the Vatican put the number
of people occupying its embassy at 12. But its note Tuesday said
they were actually nine -- four foreigners and five French citizens
from various associations.
	   The Vatican initially said its diplomats had asked French
authorities to review the cases of the immigrants seeking residence
permits. Its latest note acknowledged the ``human drama'' of those
involved, but emphasized that the problems involved ``must be
solved in respect of the law.''

Portuguese man arrested on heroin trafficking charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALEXANDROUPOLIS, Greece (AP) _ Customs officials on the
Greek-Turkish border arrested a Portuguese man on drug trafficking
charges after he was found to be in possession of 3.3 kilograms
(7.2 pounds) of heroin, authorities said Tuesday.
	   Officials at the Kipos customs post on the Greek-Turkish border
arrested Fernando Costa dos Santos, 28, late on Monday after a
search of his luggage revealed the heroin hidden in the lining of a
leather shoulder bag and a large leather notebook.
	   Dos Santos, a resident of London, arrived at the border crossing
by bus from Istanbul. He told authorities he was to be paid dlrs
5,000 to transport the heroin from Istanbul to London.
	   The man is being held in custody and is due to appear before a
prosecutor.

Cricket authorities employ soccer hooligan control tactics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Cricket fans at the fifth test between
England and South Africa starting at Headingley Thursday will be
subjected to the same security tactics as those used to control
soccer hooligans.
	   The Western Terrace at Headingley, which accommodates 6,000
spectators, has been the scene of trouble in previous years and
West Yorkshire police have pinpointed the area for extra security.
	   Police will use plain-clothed ``spotters'' with knowledge of
known local hooligans and video surveillance equipment _ the first
time such tactics have been used at a test cricket match in
England.
	   Inspector David Boyle, who is supervising police security at the
five-day match, said he would use methods developed by the National
Football Intelligence Unit to combat unlawful behavior in the
crowd.
	   ``There is increasing evidence that people are attending in
order to extend their football xenophobia within cricket,'' Boyle
said Tuesday.
	   ``We have seen this in the wearing of football strips, the
football banners in the crowd and the organized chanting which has
been seen at cricket.
	   ``(there is) the possibility that people involved in football
violence are coming to cricket.''
	   Headingley was the scene of an attack on Australian player Tim
Zoehrer by a spectator after an Ashes match in 1993, while a pig's
head was paraded around the crowd during the Pakistan tour in 1992.
	   An alcohol ban will be placed on the Western Terrace, while
restrictions will be imposed in other areas of the ground.
	   A ban on outrageous costumes imposed during the third test
between England and South Africa at Old Trafford will be repeated
at Headingley.

Opposition activist's body found in western Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The body of an opposition activist has been
found in the western state of Guerrero two weeks after he was
kidnapped, newspapers reported Tuesday.
	   Leaders of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, known as the
PRD, blamed state police for the kidnapping and death of Pedro
Romero Macedo. Police had no public comment on the case.
	   Romero Macedo had been active in an anti-corruption group that
accused the mayor of Tlachapa, a member of the rival Institutional
Revolutionary Party, of diverting more than 2 million pesos, or
dlrs 224,700, from the local government.
	   Macedo disappeared on July 22. PRD members found his decomposing
body Monday in ditch near Cacamicua, a village within Tlachapa
municipality.
	   Martin Mora Aguirre, secretary-general of the PRD's state
committee, blamed state police, noting that the Tlachapa police
chief had told the party members days ago to stop looking for
Romero Macedo because surely ``he should already be dead in a
ditch,'' Mexico City papers reported.
	   PRD members have asserted they are the targets of a harassment
campaign by the ruling party, known as the PRI, in Guerrero state.
Several PRD members have been detained by police in Guerrero in
recent months.
	   The PRD also claims scores of its activists in Guerrero have
died in political violence over the past decade. Officials say the
incidents were common crimes, not political ones.
	   The PRD is one of Mexico's three major parties and is the PRI's
main rival in Guerrero.

Former Radio Free Europe workers fight for freedom, at least in

name &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Another freedom fight has erupted in
Poland, at least in name.
	   Former Polish employees of U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Europe are
battling their previous employer over the use of the network's
name, associated by Poles with freedom and democracy, a daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The U.S. corporation protested the use of its trademark by the
former employees of its Polish division, who wanted to name their
publishing company with the Polish translation of Radio Free
Europe, according to the Rzeczpospolita report.
	   When the state licensing agency agreed with the Americans,
saying the U.S. group invented and promoted the name, the Poles
decided to lodge an appeal.
	   They said the U.S. corporation registered the name only in its
English version, the newspaper reported. If the logic of the
licensing agency were followed, they argued, then the Polish
magazine ``Czas,'' which means ``Time,'' also would have to change
its name, according to the newspaper.
	   The licensing agency's appeal body decided Monday to expand its
panel to decide the matter on an unspecified date.

Searchers for Amber Room report curious find
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Searchers for the famed long-lost
Amber Room on Tuesday were building a cofferdam in shallow waters
off Lithuania's coast to help them investigate a cache of metal
buried in the seabed.
	   A crew of German treasure hunters has been combing a beach near
the town of Preila for months in hopes of discovering the czarist
Russia treasure, which disappeared during World War II.
	   The searchers this week detected a large amount of metal buried
about 20 meters (65 feet) offshore.
	   The ornate amber panels that made up the room were a gift to
Russia's Czar Peter the Great from Prussian Emperor Friedrich
Wilhelm I.
	   The Nazis took the panels from Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in
1941 and the German government claims they were destroyed during
the 1945 Soviet invasion of Konigsberg, now the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad. Moscow has long insisted that the Nazis hid the
treasure.
	   The treasure-hunters have been following leads provided by an
80-year-old former area resident who says he saw Nazi officers
carrying mysterious boxes off a warship in 1944 and then burying
them along the shore near his home.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Moroccan Hicham Arazi was thrown
out of the Grolsch Open tennis tourney Tuesday for unsportsmanlike
conduct at 7-6 (11-9), 1-5 against Swede Magnus Norman.
	   Arazi had already been warned by the umpire twice for throwing
his racket, as he grew increasingly angry with himself for making
errors in the second set of this first-round match.
	   When he several times deliberately hit the ball wildly out of
bounds in an apparent attempt to throw the second set, he was given
a third warning and an automatic disqualification.
	   Arazi, ranked 42 in the world, will forfeit his prize money and
may be fined by the ATP tour administration.
	   Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera met unexpected resistance from
75th-ranked Russian Marat Safin, but struggled through to the last
16 of this clay court tournament, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5).

It took three months, but summer comes _ finally _ to Britain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ When Fabrizio Pellizzetti moved here from his
native Italy four weeks ago, friends warned him he would miss the
sun and balmy skies. How right they were.
	   Even in a country known for its gray, overcast days, this summer
has tested Britons' resilience, as they awoke day after day to
clouds and the hint of rain.
	   But Tuesday, all that seemed to be changing _ or at least people
chose to believe it was _ as forecasts called for the sudden
appearance of sunny days and temperatures in the mid-80s through
the weekend in most of the country.
	   Office workers in London drank their midday pints outside at
sidewalk tables, and women strolling through an open-air market
marched straight past the heavier clothes, drawn optimistically to
the halter tops and summer dresses.
	   The sun worshippers weren't the only ones loosening their ties
and rolling up their sleeves. Gardeners, golfers and resort-goers
also were expected to take advantage of the break in the weather.
	   ``The sun comes out and people are here within minutes,'' said
Helen Derrin, assistant manager of Clifton Nurseries in London.
	   The phone started ringing nonstop at the Stockley Park Golf
Course in Middlesex, with golfers eager to reserve tee-off times
for the weekend, operations manager Neil Munro said.
	   And the resort towns of Blackpool and Brighton were gearing up
for the arrival of tourists eager to be near the water now that the
sun was shining.
	   Balmy Tuesday proved that there is nothing like a blue sky and
the prospect of a few unblemished summer days to raise British
spirits. It even makes the past few months forgivable.
	   ``I don't think this summer's been too bad,'' said Jake Sale,
32, of Bedford, putting a cheery spin on a gloomy summer that might
only be possible when the sun is shining.
	   Pity, however, the poor souls in the country's northern reaches
and in Scotland, who still face the threat of rain and clouds in
the days ahead.
	   Leave it to Nathan Powell of the Meteorological Office to break
the bad news.
	   ``Unfortunately,'' Powell said, as gently as possible, ``it is
not going to be lovely everywhere.''

Butler: Iraq refusing to hold further disarmament talks
</HEADLINE>

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq is refusing to hold further
disarmament talks with the United Nations, the chief weapons
inspector said Tuesday, leaving uncertain the future of the U.N.
program to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Richard Butler, head of the U.N. Special Commission, said he
will brief the U.N. Security Council on Thursday on Monday's failed
talks with Iraq's chief negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz.
	   Butler said the impasse resulted from Aziz's demand for a UNSCOM
certification that Iraq has dismantled all its illegal weapons,
including chemical and biological arms and long-range missiles.
	   ``I told him that `I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,''' Butler told The Associated Press in Bahrain,
where he arrived Tuesday from Baghdad en route to New York.
	   Butler continued: ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied,
`Then we can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a work schedule aimed at increasing the pace of
weapons inspection work.
	   The Iraqi position was the ``main reason why we had to cut short
our trip in Baghdad. The talks were getting nowhere,'' he told AP.
	   Zlauvinen said a lot more work needs to be done to get a clearer
picture of Iraq's weapons capability.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq is free of weapons of mass
destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraqi
troops were evicted by the United States and its allies in the 1991
Gulf War.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Saddam
Hussein should not hope for an end to the sanctions until Iraq
complies with its obligations.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the next
step will be determined by Butler's report to the Council.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt UNSCOM's
seven-year search for the illegal weapons, a mission often
disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   However, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted Butler as saying
earlier the problem has not become a crisis. ``It is imperative not
to overdramatize the situation,'' Butler was quoted as saying.
	   Still, experts think that the Iraq-U.N. relationship is in
trouble.
	   ``Confrontation is looming, definitely,'' Tim Trevan, who served
on the U.N. inspections team from 1992 to 1995, was quoted as
saying on BBC radio.
	   Earlier this year, the United States and Britain sent warships
to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential sites to U.N.
inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused by an agreement brokered in February by
Annan.
	   After that, U.N.-Iraq tensions appeared to be easing until a
U.S. military lab reported in June that it found traces of deadly
VX nerve gas on fragments of Iraqi missile warheads it tested.
	   Iraq had claimed that although it developed VX, it never put the
chemical on missiles.
	   Zlauvinen, Butler's adviser, said the discovery of VX showed
Iraq's biological weapons program continues to have ``many
loopholes.''
	   ``It's still a big mess,'' he said.
	   On Monday, Aziz accused Butler of deliberately prolonging the
sanctions at the behest of the United States.
	   He said Butler is focusing on ``minor issues which make no sense
from the angle of disarmament.''
	   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook rejected Aziz's
statement.
	   ``Iraqi claims that UNSCOM is haggling over minor details are
patently absurd,'' Cook said in a statement, adding that UNSCOM has
confirmed ``Iraqi weaponization'' of VX nerve gas.
	   But Iraq's frustrations with the sanctions are also evident.
	   Last month, Saddam said in a nationally televised speech that
the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set
a deadline.

Zimbabwe dollar falls 20 percent as economic fears deepen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with increased rediscount rate,
closing exchange rates, stock exchange index fall; ADDS quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe raised its
rediscount interest rate 3.5 percent, but the country's currency
continued to slide on foreign exchange markets.
	   Bank Governor Leonard Tsumba held an emergency meeting Tuesday
of heads of commercial and merchant banks, in which he blamed them
and speculators for the slide, according to a banker who was
present and who asked not to be named.
	   Monday's volatile trading saw the Zimbabwe dollar depreciate
about 20 percent.
	   Last week the Zimbabwe dollar was trading at 18.8 for one U.S.
dollar. It had slid on foreign exchange markets to 25 to 27
Zimbabwe dollars per U.S. dollar by close of trading Tuesday.
	   ``This unhappy state of affairs has been largely self-inflicted,
due to intemperate political rhetoric ... and the unrealistic
assumption by the Reserve Bank that Zimbabwe could substantially
overvalue its currency relative to its major trading partners,''
Nick Swanepoel told the annual congress of the Commercial Farmers'
Union. Swanepoel is retiring as president of the 4,500-member
group.
	   The industrial index on Zimbabwe's stock exchange fell 216.97
points on Tuesday.
	   The crisis was believed to have been triggered by a rush of
demand by importers, who feared shortage of funds for pre-Christmas
imports, coupled with a threatened five-day national strike by
trade unions, poor commodity prices and possible withdrawal of
International Monetary Fund budget support.
	   The Reserve Bank raised its rediscount interest rate Tuesday 3.5
percent to 35 percent.
	   John Makamure, economist for the Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce, predicted a wave of bankruptcies.
	   ``Many of our members are bleeding already,'' he said. ``They
will certainly not sustain any further increases in interest rates.
It will not resolve the problem in the long term.''
	   An IMF delegation was due to review payments of 176 million U.S.
dollars in budget support following President Robert Mugabe's
backtracking on economic liberalization pledges made since 1991.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   The upper atmosphere remained unstable across the local region
Tuesday due to a nearly stationary low-pressure system located
across the Atlantic east through northeast of the Bahamas.
	   A trough has developed extending from this circulation
southeastward across our local area, aiding in development of
thunderstorms Monday evening and overnight.
	   Similar results are also possible Tuesday afternoon and Tuesday
night across our region, with very heavy rainfall possible.
	   An upper-level disturbance in the easterly winds moved quickly
across the tropical Atlantic and into the Lesser Antilles Monday
night and Tuesday morning. It is expected to reach our southeast
coastal waters late Tuesday afternoon or this evening.
	   However, dry and stable low level air has begun to move ahead of
this disturbance into the Virgin Islands late Tuesday morning and
will arrive in Puerto Rico Tuesday afternoon.
	   The drier air is expected to limit the number of showers and
thunderstorms developing across the area through Tuesday evening
before an increase in low-level moisture and active weather occurs
Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   East-northeast winds around 15 knots were building into the
local coastal waters from the east late Tuesday morning and will
cause a mild increase in seas across the regional waters.
	   Mariners across the east and southeast waters are urged to keep
an alert eye to the sky Tuesday afternoon and evening as clusters
of thunderstorms move in from the east.

Spain, Russia win key games as second round comes to end

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Spain defeated Lithuania 86-80 in overtime
and Russia won over Canada 81-72 to pick up key victories Tuesday
in second-round games of the World Championship, moving their
records to 5-1 entering Friday's crucial quarterfinals.
	   Spain is the surprise team of the worlds and hasn't won a medal
in a major tournament in seven years and has hardly been heard from
since it took silver in the 1984 Olympics.
	   Forward Alberto Herreros, the leading scorer in the tournament,
had 27 and Alfonso Reyes added 19. Arturas Karnisovas, playing with
a bandaged head after a second-half collision with a Spanish
opponent, had 20 for Lithuania (4-2).
	   Spain, which was on top for most of the game, could have won in
regulation but Herreros missed an outside shot in the final seconds
and Carlos Jimenez missed a tip-in at the gun.
	   Russia _ billed as the favorite with Yugoslavia to win the title
Sunday _ was topped by Vassiliy Karassev with 21 points and Sergei
Babkov and Sergei Panov with 14. Canada (1-5) got 14 points and 11
rebounds from Greg Newton.
	   Spain and Russia were already guaranteed quarterfinal places.
Four other teams also have spots _ Greece, Yugoslavia, Lithuania
and the United States.
	   The two other places were to be decided later Tuesday with four
teams in the running _ Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico and Australia.
	   Italy faced Puerto late with the winner guaranteed a place in
the quarterinals. Australia would get the other place if it beats
the United States in Tuesday's late game and still might advance
even if it loses.
	   On Monday, Yugoslavia fell to Italy 61-60 _ probably the key
upset of the tournament _ as the Italians avenged a loss last year
in the final of the European championship to the Yugoslavs.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian-born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   The Americans improved to 4-1 with 17 from Jimmy Oliver and 12
from Brad Miller in a 75-73 win over Spain.
	   Russia demolished the host Greeks 60-48 as Sergei Babkov hit 18,
one of four in double figures. Greece was led by Fragiskos Albertis
with 12 points.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, beat
Argentina 84-75. Australia improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil.
	   Puerto Rico also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth with a
94-81 victory over Canada.

Kohl, Kinkel criticize Czechs on remarks about exiled Germans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS throughout that Zeman criticized nomination of
Sudeten Germans to German-Czech dialogue forum, sted to
compensation board. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl slammed Czech
Premier Milos Zeman on Tuesday for comparing Germans exiled from
his nation after World War II to radical rightists and communists.
	   ``It is totally unfathomable how a government chief can use such
an absurd and completely unacceptable formulation of words,'' Kohl
told RTL television from his vacation retreat in Austria. ``Either
the man doesn't know what he's talking about or he is using it for
domestic politics.''
	   The dispute arose last month when Zeman rejected including
Sudeten Germans as board members of a German-Czech dialogue forum.
	   The forum is aimed at reconciling the two neighbors following
decades of hard feelings caused by Nazi occupation during the World
War II and the subsequent expulsion of some 2.5 million Germans
from the Sudetenland region of then-Czechoslovakia.
	   ``When we finally meet, I will tell him that if that's the
policy of good neighbors, to criticize a group of people who bore
special suffering, like his people suffered under the Germans, you
can't expect that we'll be good neighbors,'' Kohl said.
	   In an interview with the Cologne-based Stadt-Anzeige, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel was a bit more diplomatic than the
chancellor.
	   ``The continuing criticism from certain Czech government
representatives is unnecessary, unfathomable and not helpful,'' the
newspaper quoted Kinkel as saying.
	   But he also said that ``certain shrill comments from Germany,''
also contributed to the dispute.

Havel reported stable after morning crisis

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Ailing Czech President Vaclav
Havel was reported in stable condition late Tuesday, after doctors
used electroshocks to restore his heart function.
	   During the two-hour long crisis early Tuesday, Havel's heart
rate soared to 200 beats per minute, due to blood poisoning caused
by pneumonia. Doctors had to apply electroshocks to stabilize it.
	   ``Now the president is stable, his fever is down,'' Ilja Kotik,
head of Havel's medical team, told a news conference later Tuesday.
	   Doctors described the president's condition early in the day as
``temporarily critical,'' but denied speculations that Havel's life
had been in danger at any time.
	   ``This was not a case of clinical death, because his blood
circulation did not stop,'' Kotik said, describing the event as
paroxysmal tachycardia and fibrilation.
	   On July 26, Havel underwent a long-planned abdominal surgery to
close a colostomy, an operation complicated by pneumonia he
developed Monday.
	   ``The cause of the crisis was a septic state he got into as we
tried to cure his lungs,'' said Miroslav Cerbak, coordinator of the
team.
	   The 61-year-old president, a former chain smoker and veteran of
Communist jails, has suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996, when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   ``You can never rule out a relapse (of irregular heartbeat)''
Kotik said, but added Havel's current condition gave enough ground
for an optimistic prognosis.
	   According to doctors Havel was awake late Tuesday, his heart
function was normal and the president was able to communicate
through written notes.
	   ``I feared for him all night, and this morning too, but now it
seems to me he's doing better,'' the hospitalized president's wife,
Dagmar, told reporters after leaving his bedside Tuesday afternoon
at Prague's military hospital.
	   Havel served as president of Czechoslovakia for three years
after the 1989 anti-Communist revolution. He has served another
five years as president of the Czech Republic, after the federation
broke up on Jan. 1, 1993.
	   This January, he was narrowly reelected as Czech president for
his second and final five-year.
	   Assuming no further complications, doctors estimated Havel will
need at least six to eight weeks before he is able to return to
office.

Report: More than 6,000 Russian deserters surrender to authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More than 6,000 Russian army deserters gave
themselves up to to military prosecutors during the first six
months of this year, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Many of the 6,187 deserters who surrendered to military
authorities did so under a ``Deserter Come Home'' program that was
launched in March and offered leniency to those who gave up.
	   Desertion has become an increasingly grave problem for Russia's
military. Morale is low in the armed forces, conditions are
frequently bleak and hazing has caused numerous deaths.
	   According to the ITAR-Tass news agency, 4,832 of the deserters
who surrendered were pardoned, including 3,300 who left their units
because of hazing.

Bradford calls off transfer after French forward falls ill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRADFORD, England (AP) _ Samassi Abou's transfer from West Ham
to Bradford was called off Tuesday when it was discovered the
French Under-21 international forward was suffering from malaria.
	   Abou was thought to have contracted the disease during an
off-season visit to the Ivory Coast. He delayed his visit to Valley
Parade because of flu-like symptoms.
	   After medical tests in London, malaria was diagnosed and the
player is having treatment in hospital.
	   ``Samassi had been running a temperature of over 100 degrees and
blood tests have shown he has contracted malaria,'' said Bradford
owner Geoffrey Richmond, who was about to pay West Ham 900,000
pounds (dlrs 1.48 million) for the forward.
	   ``The two clubs doctors have spoken and as a result of that
conversation we have decided to put the transfer on hold.''

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A Moldovan delegation headed by Prime
Min-sdFr Yon Chubuk met Tuesday with Ukrainian officials to discuss
border demarcation and economic issues.
	   Ukrainian premier Valery Pustovoitenko, who conferred with
Chubuk, called neighboring Moldova Ukraine's strategic partner but
said economic relations between the two former Soviet republics
should be intensified.
	   He noted that trade turnover between the two nations this year
has been decreasins, focused on the
demarcation of mutual borders, the future of resorts and
sanitariums built by then-Soviet Moldova in Ukraine, plans to build
an oil terminal on the joint border and Moldova's debt for
Ukrainian electricity, estimated at dlrs 11 million.
	   The sides agreed that Moldova would receive a small area of
Ukrainian territory to build an oil terminal in exchange for a
section of the road connecting the Ukrainian cities of Odessa and
Izmail and partly running through Moldova, Pustovoitenko said after
the talks.
	   Moldova and Ukraine also would work on preparing a 10-year
economic cooperation treaty, he said.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ To the strains of a special march composed by an
admirer on a set of saucepans, Britain's beloved Queen Mother
Elizabeth celebrated her 98th birthday Tuesday with the crowds
camped outside her Clarence House home.
	   Dressed in sunshine yellow and leaning slightly on a cane, the
country's longest-living royal ever beamed and waved as
well-wishers sang ``Happy Birthday, your majesty.''
	   Children stood in line to present balloons, bouquets and cards,
among them 2-year-old Nathaniel Hess of west London, who produced a
half-eaten cookie, which the Queen Mother laughingly pretended to
eat.
	   ``I hope she's having a very happy birthday. I like her a lot,
she's a very cool old lady,'' said Steve Marsh, 10, from Camberley,
south of London.
	   The Queen Mother, the mother of Queen Elizabeth II, has remained
one of the most popular royals, serenely enduring two world wars,
the death of her husband, two hip replacements and a cataract
operation.
	   When Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Simpson, the Queen Mother and her beloved husband Bertie _
then the Duke and Duchess of York _ were propelled into unwanted
sovereignty as George VI and Queen Elizabeth. They saw Britain
through the dark days of World War II and reigned until George VI
died in 1952, after 29 years of marriage.
	   Royals may wane and wax in popularity _ witness Prince Charles'
role as the villain in the Princess Diana story, or accusations
that the queen is a remote and out-of-touch monarch _ but the
``Queen Mum'' has never fallen out of favor.
	   She continued to shine despite the recent scandal that
surrounded the break-ups of three of her grandchildren's marriages,
and the 1976 divorce of her younger daughter Princess Margaret,
much of which was played out in lurid detail in Britain's salacious
tabloid newspapers.

	   LONDON (AP) _ When Fabrizio Pellizzetti moved here from his
native Italy four weeks ago, friends warned him he would miss the
sun and balmy skies. How right they were.
	   Even in a country known for its gray, overcast days, this summer
has tested Britons' resilience, as they awoke day after day to
clouds and the hint of rain.
	   But Tuesday, all that seemed to be changing _ or at least people
chose to believe it was _ as forecasts called for the sudden
appearance of sunny days and temperatures in the mid-80s Fahrenheit
(around 30 Celsius) through the weekend in most of the country.

Spain, Russia win key games as second round comes to end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Spanish coach &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Spain defeated Lithuania 86-80 in overtime
and Russia won over Canada 81-72 to pick up key victories Tuesday
in second-round games of the World Championship, moving their
records to 5-1 entering Friday's crucial quarterfinals.
	   Spain, the surprise team of the worlds, hasn't won a medal in a
major tournament in seven years _ bronze in the '91 Europeans _ and
has hardly been heard from since it shocked itself with silver in
the 1984 Olympics.
	   Forward Alberto Herreros, the leading scorer in the tournament,
had 27 and Alfonso Reyes added 19. Arturas Karnisovas, playing with
a bandaged head after a second-half collision with a Spanish
opponent, had 20 for Lithuania (4-2).
	   Spain, which was on top for most of the game, could have won in
regulation but Herreros missed an outside shot in the final seconds
and Carlos Jimenez missed a tip-in at the gun.
	   ``This has shown our basketball is decent and we're
competitive,'' said coach Lolo Sainz, who is in the first phase of
rebuilding and is expected in the next few years to dip heavily
into the a rich pool of young talent.
	   ``We're not afraid of anybody,'' he added.
	   Russia _ billed as the favorite with Yugoslavia to win the title
Sunday _ was topped by Vassiliy Karassev with 21 points and Sergei
Babkov and Sergei Panov with 14. Canada (1-5) got 14 points and 11
rebounds from Greg Newton.
	   Spain and Russia were already guaranteed quarterfinal places.
Four other teams also have spots _ Greece, Yugoslavia, Lithuania
and the United States.
	   The two other places were to be decided later Tuesday with four
teams in the running _ Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico and Australia.
	   Italy faced Puerto late with the winner guaranteed a place in
the quarterinals. Australia would get the other place if it beats
the United States in Tuesday's late game and still might advance
even if it loses.
	   On Monday, Yugoslavia fell to Italy 61-60 _ probably the key
upset of the tournament _ as the Italians avenged a loss last year
in the final of the European championship to the Yugoslavs.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian-born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   The Americans improved to 4-1 with 17 from Jimmy Oliver and 12
from Brad Miller in a 75-73 win over Spain.
	   Russia demolished the host Greeks 60-48 as Sergei Babkov hit 18,
one of four in double figures. Greece was led by Fragiskos Albertis
with 12 points.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, beat
Argentina 84-75. Australia improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil.
	   Puerto Rico also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth with a
94-81 victory over Canada.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Three Swiss cyclists in the Festina
team expelled last month from the Tour de France made a low-key
return to the road Tuesday in the Cross-Lausanne event.
	   Spectators sparsely lining the streets of this lakeside city
applauded Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, among 25
riders taking part in the evening race.
	   They cheered and clanged cowbells as the Festina riders set off
over the 6.85 kilometer (4.26 mile) course, some of it over the
cobblestones of Lausanne's old town.
	   Festina was thrown off the Tour because its riders were said to
have taken the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among
those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   Dufaux's name had been painted on the road at the arrival, and
banners along the route welcomed the rider.
	   Tour de France winner Marco Pantani of Italy, racing in a yellow
jersey, won the first of two time trials over the uphill course in
12 minutes 28 seconds, with a 45-second advantage over
Switzerland's Pascal Richard.
	   Also taking part was Colorado's Bobby Julich, third in the Tour.
Julich finished third in Tuesday's first round, 48 seconds behind
Pantani. Dufaux was fourth.

Israel points to brightening picture for Palestinian workers
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CROSSING POINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a major turnaround,
Israel has not closed its borders to Palestinian workers once this
year, Israel's liaison with the Palestinians said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli official, Maj. Gen. Yaacov Orr, said that and other
steps in recent months mark a fundamental shift in Israel's
dealings with Palestinian workers, whose earnings from jobs in the
Jewish state are crucial to the Palestinian economy.
	   ``It's a question of opening a window, and then a door,'' Orr
told reporters at the checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
``A stronger Palestinian economy is good for Israel.''
	   In the early 1990s, more than 100,000 Palestinians worked in
Israel. But that number has been sharply curtailed in recent years
in response to terror attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Palestinians with jobs in Israel make up only about 20 percent
of the territories' work force, but their wages represent up to 40
percent of total Palestinian earnings.
	   For the past several years, Israel's frequent sealing off of
Gaza and West Bank cost the Palestinian economy millions of dollars
in lost income and export revenues. The territories were closed for
93 days in 1996 and 62 days last year.
	   In 1998, however, the only closures have come on national
holidays when Palestinian workers would not have been on the job in
Israel anyway, Orr said.
	   The closures of previous years were generally in response to
suicide bombings or serious civil unrest in the Palestinian lands.
Orr said this year, Israel has deliberately refrained from closures
even when it was worried about potential security threats.
	   ``It's a calculated risk, but it builds the future life between
our societies,'' he said.
	   The last suicide bombing in Israel was 11 months ago, and the
last major closure was in response to it.
	   Depicting a brightening jobs picture, Orr cited measures
including the issuing of travel permits to 18,000 Palestinian
merchants and business people; permission for about 5,000 workers
to stay overnight in Israel; a small increase in truck traffic in
and out of the territories, and the building of a new Israeli
customs compound to expedite Palestinian exports from Gaza.
	   Palestinians, however, say any improvements must be seen in
light of the severity of restrictions. Fewer than 60,000 of the
nearly 3 million Palestinians in the territories have permission to
travel to Israel, and unemployment is rampant in the West Bank and
Gaza.
	   The Palestinians also say long-range improvement in their
economy hinges on getting peace negotiations back on track.
	   ``There are major investments in the works, but they will never
happen unless there is a breakthrough in the peace process,'' said
Mohammed Ishtaya, director of the Palestinian Economic Council for
Development and Reconstruction, an agency that funnels donor money
into projects.
	   ``So by maintaining a deadlock in the political process, Israel
destroys the Palestinian economy,'' he said.
	   Peace talks broke off 16 months ago. During the past two weeks
the two sides have held direct high-level talks to try to restart
them, but no agreement has been reached.
	   Orr said that the easing of restrictions on workers is based on
the notion that peace must be built from the ground up.
	   ``It's a step in that process, not the end,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila
battled with rebellious Tutsi fighters Tuesday at opposite ends of
the country in an uprising aimed at toppling the president's
14-month-old regime.
	   Gunfire was reported in the eastern town of Bukavu near the
border with Rwanda, said aid workers based there. A provincial
official told The Associated Press that the rebels were in control
of the town, although some reports indicated fighting there
continued.
	   Banyamulenge Tutsis and Rwandan soldiers led the uprising
against Kabila, accusing him of widespread corruption and
government mismanagement.
	   In the southwestern village of Kitona, where rebel gunmen forced
a hijacked private airplane to land, fighting was reported at the
town's main military base, a government spokesman said.
	   It was unclear who was in control of the base in Kitona, but
Kabila has vowed to crush the uprising and called on his supporters
for help.
	   ``Be assured we will take weapons to swiftly end this
rebellion,'' Cabinet minister Pierre Victor Mpoyo said on state
radio, quoting Kabila.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza said
the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   ``At the moment a large portion of the province is under the
control of the army which is hostile to Kabila's regime,'' Serukiza
said in a telephone interview.
	   Kivu region is divided into three provinces, including North
Kivu, South Kivu and Maniema.
	   In the city of Goma, gunmen hijacked a private airplane and
ordered the pilot to fly to the military base in Kitona near the
Atlantic coastline on the opposite side of the country, said
Kabila's spokesman Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi.
	   The hijacking was led by Banyamulenge ethnic fighters.
	   The Congolese airplane owned by the private airline CAL touched
down in Kitona about 225 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of
Kinshasa, said Ndombasi.
	   He gave no other details concerning the hijacking during a brief
announcement broadcast on state television.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gun battles in two military barracks in the capital.
	   ``The government asks Congo's neighbors not to make the wrong
decisions to fight,'' Mpoyo said in a radio broadcast following the
meeting.
	   The comment was aimed directly at neighboring Rwanda, which
Kabila believes is behind the movement against his leadership.
Rwandan fighters and Banyamulenge Tutsis played a key role in
helping Kabila march to victory last year over longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Those same fighters today, however, appear to be moving to get
rid of Kabila.
	   A delicate ethnic and military alliance that helped thrust
Kabila _ a one-time obscure Marxist rebel _ into power 14 months
ago is now unraveling.
	   ``Kabila has been very aggressive against his neighbors of
late,'' said Rwandan chief of staff Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa. ``So
today is Rwanda's turn.''
	   He denied Rwanda was involved in the mutiny, but warned that the
rebellion included some of the best soldiers in Kabila's army.
	   The rebel forces may ``push up to Kinshasa,'' he said, adding
``It depends on how effective they will be.''
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said the government was
preparing an armed response to the rebellion in Kivu region.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in the area has close links with
Rwanda, while Kabila's support and control of the region has
faltered for months.
	   ``We're telling them to lay down their arms and end this
adventure before we immediately bring in the army,'' Kongolo said.
	   In the capital one day after shots rang out at two military
bases on Kinshasa's west end, loyal troops continued to patrol city
streets and man roadblocks.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was still in effect, but life in the city
began to return to normal as abandoned streets began to fill again
with shoppers and merchants.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern Europe is sizzling from a
three-week heat wave that has reportedly claimed at least 20 lives
in Romania, buckled streetcar tracks in Hungary and smashed
temperature records across the region.
	   Temperatures soared past 40 C (104 F) again Tuesday in the
southern Balkans region, suffering through its worst heat wave in
half a century.
	   How hot is it?
	   So hot that Serb forces in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province
are heating their baked beans by setting the cans on the fiery
metal surface of armored personnel carriers.
	   So hot that prison convicts in the Romanian town of Braila
refused to work Tuesday, citing a 1986 order that gives them a
reprieve when temperatures top 35C (95 F).
	   And so hot that in Hungary, they're all screaming for
``fagylalt'' _ ice cream _ in record numbers. The country's largest
ice-cream producer, Schoeller Budatej, has boosted production to
three shifts to meet the demand, said the MTI news agency.
	   In Bucharest, Romania, where the mercury has hit at least 36 C
(97 F) every day since the first half of July, some 2,500 people
have called the capital's emergency services in the past four days
and 15 ambulances are on heat patrol.
	   Hospitals in the city of 3 million said they are crowded with
people who suffered strokes, heart attacks, sunstroke or have
fainted in the scorching heat.
	   Residents are plunging into the city's fountains, the dirty
Dambovita River and lakes to keep cool.
	   Bucharest's mayor, Viorel Lis, is sending the city hall staff
home at lunch time every day to avoid any heat-related accidents,
and has urged other employers to do the same.
	   Wheat and corn and sunflowers around the capital have been
burned by the heat.
	   In Sarajevo, one-time host of the Winter Olympics, the Bosnian
Federation Health Ministry was recommending people stay indoors
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. because of the high temperatures.
	   In Belgrade, Yugoslavia, several dozen people fainted on the hot
sidewalks Monday on the hottest Aug. 3 in 111 years _ 39 C (102 F)
in the shade.
	   In poverty-stricken Albania, where it was 42 C (108 F) in the
capital Tirana on Tuesday, anxious mothers were taking their babies
to hospitals in high numbers for fear of health problems.
	   Croatia's renowned beaches weren't offering much relief from the
record-breaking heat _ the Adriatic Sea was a warm 26 C to 28 C (79
F to 82 F).
	   In the Hungarian capital, Budapest, public pools have standing
room only and a streetcar line suspended operations Monday when the
tracks along one stretch buckled.
	   A 77-year-old heat record for Aug. 3 was broken Monday when the
official temperature reached 36.7 C (98 F). It was even hotter in
downtown Budapest _ 40 C (104 F) or higher.
	   ``We just can't work _ we have three fans going and it is still
35 C (95 F) in the office,'' said Melinda Kis, a secretary at a
travel agency.

Russia financing next Mir mission on credit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The next mission to the Mir space station is being
launched on credit despite the government's promises to provide
more cash, a news agency reported Tuesday.
	   Russia's Energiya company, which runs the Mir, has taken out 200
million rubles (dlrs 33 million) in commercial credit to finance
the Aug. 13 launch, company President Yuri Semenov told the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``People will be up there, so it is necessary to take credits,''
ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
	   Semenov says the government owes Energiya a total of about 800
million rubles (dlrs 120 million), and has received no payments
despite new promises in recent weeks.
	   The three-man crew scheduled to depart for the Mir include a
politician and former presidential advisor, Gennady Baturin, and
the cosmonaut who is expected to be the final person to live aboard
the station, Sergei Avdeyev.
	   Avdeyev, who has spent two previous tours aboard Mir, currently
plans to stay on board the station until it is closed down and sent
crashing back to Earth next June.
	   At least one other mission is expected to travel to the station
in coming months. Current plans call for two visiting astronauts _
one French, one Slovak _ to travel to the station in February.

Spain, Russia win key games as second round comes to end
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quote from Lithuanian coach on Karnisovas injury &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Spain defeated Lithuania 86-80 in overtime
and Russia won over Canada 81-72 to pick up key victories Tuesday
in second-round games of the World Championship, moving their
records to 5-1 entering Friday's crucial quarterfinals.
	   Spain, the surprise team of the worlds, hasn't won a medal in a
major tournament in seven years _ bronze in the '91 Europeans _ and
has hardly been heard from since it shocked itself with silver in
the 1984 Olympics.
	   Forward Alberto Herreros, the leading scorer in the tournament,
had 27 and Alfonso Reyes added 19. Arturas Karnisovas, playing with
a bandaged head after a second-half collision with a Spain's
Ignacio de Miguel that drew blood, led Lithuania (4-2) with 20. But
he was scoreless in the last 11 minutes.
	   ``I think that (injury) hurt him at the end of the game,'' said
Lithuanaia coach Jonas Kazlauskas.
	   Spain, leading most of the way,could have won in regulation but
Herreros missed an outside shot in the final seconds and Carlos
Jimenez missed a tip-in at the gun.
	   ``This has shown our basketball is decent and we're
competitive,'' said coach Lolo Sainz, who is in the first phase of
rebuilding and is expected in the next few years to dip heavily
into a rich pool of young talent.
	   ``We're not afraid of anybody,'' he added.
	   Russia _ billed as the favorite with Yugoslavia to win the title
Sunday _ was topped by Vassiliy Karassev with 21 points and Sergei
Babkov and Sergei Panov with 14. Canada (1-5) got 14 points and 11
rebounds from Greg Newton.
	   Spain and Russia were already guaranteed quarterfinal places.
Four other teams also have spots _ Greece, Yugoslavia, Lithuania
and the United States.
	   The two other places were to be decided later Tuesday with four
teams in the running _ Italy, Argentina, Puerto Rico and Australia.
	   Italy faced Puerto late with the winner guaranteed a place in
the quarterinals. Australia would get the other place if it beats
the United States in Tuesday's late game and still might advance
even if it loses.
	   On Monday, Yugoslavia fell to Italy 61-60 _ probably the key
upset of the tournament _ as the Italians avenged a loss last year
in the final of the European championship to the Yugoslavs.
	   And they were undone by two of their own from the former
Yugoslavia _ Bosnian-born Bodjan Tanjevic, the Italian coach, and
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka, who hit the winning shots.
	   The Americans improved to 4-1 with 17 from Jimmy Oliver and 12
from Brad Miller in a 75-73 win over Spain.
	   Russia demolished the host Greeks 60-48 as Sergei Babkov hit 18,
one of four in double figures. Greece was led by Fragiskos Albertis
with 12 points.
	   Lithuania, bronze medalists in the last two Olympics, beat
Argentina 84-75. Australia improved its chances of reaching the
quarterfinals with a 75-63 come-from-behind victory over Brazil.
	   Puerto Rico also stayed alive for a quarterfinal berth with a
94-81 victory over Canada.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in northern Russian have opened a
criminal investigation into an accident in a skydiving training
class in which four teen-agers are believed to have died, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The teens were carried by strong winds last Friday into Lake
Onega, a large lake in the Russian republic of Karelia. One drowned
when she became tangled in her parachute lines, and three others
remain missing and are presumed dead, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Divers have been searching the bottom of the lake, but
authorities said the area involved is so vast that the bodies are
unlikely to be found anytime soon.
	   Yuri Ivukov, the chairman of Karelia's emergencies department,
blamed a sports club for the deaths, saying trainers had neglected
elementary safety rules. However, no charges have been filed.
	   ``The jumpers were absolutely unprepared,'' Ivukov said. ``Young
men and women sky-dived for the first time in their lives. They had
studied it on the ground for only four hours.''
	   The young people involved in the jumps ranged in age from 15 to
17, ITAR-Tass said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities declared a state of emergency
in areas near Athens on Tuesday as more than 1,000 firefighters and
soldiers battled a huge forest fire raging for a second day.
	   Evidence suggested the blazes could be the work of arsonists,
officials said.
	   Premier Costas Simitis cut short his vacation on an Aegean Sea
island and flew back to the capital to assess the situation and
coordinate efforts to extinguish the blaze, which at midday had
branched off in various directions.
	   By evening, only a few of the fire's fronts were still ablaze.
The majority around the foot of Mount Pendeli, about four
kilometers (2 1/2 miles) northeast of Athens' northern suburbs, had
either died down or were under control.
	   Efforts had been hampered by gale force winds reaching 74
kilometers an hour (46 mph), which grounded firefighting planes and
Chinook helicopters dispatched to help battle the blaze around the
village of Anthousa, about three kilometers (1.8 miles) east of
Athens. That fire had died down by nightfall, authorities said.
	   Residents and volunteers assisted 650 firefighters and 500
soldiers with 30 fire trucks battling the fire, which was rekindled
during the night after being brought under control.
	   The blaze reportedly damaged several houses and a German World
War II cemetery and led to the evacuation of a convent, a military
hospital and a home for disabled children. A children's summer camp
also was severely damaged.
	   The fire began late Sunday at the foot of Mount Pendeli.
	   Local officials have said anonymous telephone callers on Sunday
threatened to burn local forests. Fire brigade and police radio
frequencies were jammed Monday by callers shouting obscenities and
reporting fires far from the actual blazes.
	   ``There was an attempt to terrorize firefighting forces and
cause anxiety,'' said Public Order Minister Giorgos Romeos.
	   No injuries due to the fires were reported. Blazes in the
Pendeli area in past years have left much of the mountainside a
landscape of charred stumps.
	   A separate large fire broke out near the southeastern seaside
resort suburb of Lagonisi. No houses or hotels were threatened, and
it also had died down by evening.
	   In another brush fire, flames had threatened some ancient sites
including the small amphitheater at Epidavros, about 60 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Athens, media reports said.
	   Two weeks ago, three firefighters and a volunteer firefighter
were killed battling a blaze that scorched the eastern edge of
Athens.
	   Wildfires are common during the hot and dry summers in Greece.
But this season has been called one of the most devastating in
decades, with fires burning daily for the past month.

 &UR; Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he expects to be re-elected &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with color, background on Free Democrats. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Unfazed by recent polls that show his
Christian Democrats trailing, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Tuesday
that he expects to win his fifth consecutive election in September
but acknowledged it'll be a tight race.
	   The outcome, Kohl told RTL television in a traditional summer
interview from his Austrian vacation spot, will be decided in the
last weeks of the campaign.
	   ``I am sure that we will win the election,'' said Kohl, smiling
broadly while seated at a old wooden picnic table with two network
moderators. ``I think that the decision will be made in the last
four weeks, and there is still a lot of movement left.''
	   Recent polls show that two-thirds of Germans expect a change in
government after Sept. 27 elections. The edge is going to the rival
Social Democrats, leading polls with 41 percent to the 37 percent
for the Christian Democrats and its allied Christian Social Union
(CSU).
	   Kohl said his party and the CSU ``don't have a single vote to
spare.''
	   But Kohl said he expects high voter turnout, upwards of 80
percent, to help his conservative coalition by making it more
difficult for smaller rival parties to get the 5 percent they need
to enter parliament.
	   In another tacit acknowledgment of a tight race, Kohl urged
supporters of the current government to vote for either his party
or the CSU rather than for the third partner in the ruling
coalition, the small, market-oriented Free Democratic Party.
	   The Free Democrats have in the past played kingmaker when no
party has a clear majority, and ruled with the Social Democrats
before helping bring Kohl to power. Some members have openly said
the party should again consider allying the Social Democrats after
the Sept. 27 election.
	   ``Whoever wants the policies of this government with this
chancellor to continue must vote for the Christian Democrats and
the Christian Social Union,'' Kohl said. ``The Free Democrats must
create their own votes, and they must consider what methods they
will use.''
	   If he wins re-election, Kohl said any new government would
include Finance Minister Theo Waigel, the CSU party leader.
	   Last summer while Kohl was vacationing, Waigel agitated the
chancellor by suggesting he wanted a new job, the foreign ministry,
perhaps.
	   This summer, he's busy stumping for Kohl. On Tuesday, Waigel
released a sweeping fiscal plan extending to the year 2010 and
repeated that Kohl's coalition is ready to implement its tax reform
plan on Jan. 1 if it wins re-election.
	   ``Unlike the opposition we have a law draft complete,'' Waigel
said.
	   The Social Democrats last year blocked Kohl's plan to cut the
rate of private income taxation to between 15 percent and 39
percent from a current range of 26 percent to 53 percent.
	   While Kohl broke off his vacation for the television interview,
Schroeder interrupted his for a 24-hour trip to Washington, where a
photo opportunity with President Clinton and a foreign policy
speech at Georgetown University Wednesday could help boost his
stature as a statesman.

Havel reported stable after morning crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with fresh quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; By ONDREJ HEJMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Ailing Czech President Vaclav
Havel was reported in stable condition late Tuesday, after doctors
used electroshocks to restore his heart function.
	   During the two-hour crisis early Tuesday, Havel's heart rate
soared to 200 beats per minute, due to blood poisoning caused by
pneumonia. Doctors had to apply electroshocks to stabilize it.
	   ``Now the president is stable, his fever is down,'' Ilja Kotik,
head of Havel's medical team, told a news conference later Tuesday.
	   Doctors described the president's condition early in the day as
``temporarily critical,'' but denied speculations that Havel's life
had been in danger at any time.
	   ``This was not a case of clinical death, because his blood
circulation did not stop,'' Kotik said, describing the event as
paroxysmal tachycardia and fibrilation.
	   On July 26, Havel underwent a long-planned abdominal surgery to
close a colostomy, an operation complicated by pneumonia he
developed Monday.
	   ``The cause of the crisis was a septic state he got into as we
tried to cure his lungs,'' said Miroslav Cerbak, coordinator of the
team.
	   The 61-year-old president, a former chain smoker and veteran of
Communist jails, has suffered from chronic bronchitis for years.
	   He has been hospitalized five times since December 1996, when a
third of his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   ``You can never rule out a relapse (of irregular heartbeat)''
Kotik said, but added Havel's current condition gave enough ground
for an optimistic prognosis.
	   According to doctors Havel was awake late Tuesday, his heart
function was normal and the president was able to communicate
through written notes.
	   ``I feared for him all night, and this morning too, but now it
seems to me he's doing better,'' the hospitalized president's wife,
Dagmar, told reporters after leaving his bedside Tuesday afternoon
at Prague's military hospital.
	   Havel served as president of Czechoslovakia for three years
after the 1989 anti-Communist revolution. He has served another
five years as president of the Czech Republic, after the federation
broke up on Jan. 1, 1993.
	   This January, he was narrowly reelected as Czech president for
his second and final five-year.
	   Assuming no further complications, doctors estimated Havel will
need at least six to eight weeks before he is able to return to
office.

Relentless heat convinces Italians to _ finally _ try air
</HEADLINE>
conditioning &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The way a lot of Italians talk about air
conditioning you'd think it was some kind of dangerous germ. Many
believe it causes sore throats, stiff joints _ even pneumonia.
	   But weeks of sizzling weather appear to be breaking down this
deeply entrenched aversion.
	   Rome air conditioning merchants say sales shot up nearly 40
percent compared to last summer.
	   ``I am not saying we're working 24 hours a day. But I haven't
had a weekend off for three months,'' said Franco Consumati, who
installs the units for the Rome store GMC.
	   Consumati said a lot of his clients are still wary about air
conditioning. Some people still think they cause colds and other
ailments; others won't put their children in the path of the cold
air.
	   ``When I made my 84-year-old grandmother let me install air
conditioning for her, she made such a fuss about how bad it was,''
said Consumati. ``Now she gets mad at me if I don't go over to
check it on the first hot day.''
	   It's so hot _ temperatures well above the seasonal norms at
consistently over 90 F (33 C) _ that everyone is talking about how
to beat the heat.
	   One expert appearing on state TV said it's fine to dunk your
feet in a fountain _ but using air conditioning is a no-no. A list
of hot-weather ``dos'' and ``don'ts'' in Corriere della Sera
newspaper had air conditioning in the ``don't'' category.
	   But people aren't listening to the experts. They just want to
get cool.
	   Italians may also be snapping up air conditioners because of a
change in how they spend their summers. In the past most fled to
the seaside or mountains when it got hot; Rome used to be a ghost
town in August.
	   But not all businesses close for a long summer vacation these
days, which means some people have to work instead of play. And
with rising unemployment, others simply can't afford to get away.
	   Many stores were caught unprepared and didn't order enough units
from the factories. Now they're stuck because the factories close
in August, Italy's near-sacred vacation month.
	   ``A lot of people came in this week asking for air
conditioners,'' said Teresa Verdeoliva, a clerk at the store I.T.C.
``But I couldn't sell them anything because we've run out.''

Iran: New missile a tool to defend the Muslim world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new medium-range missile that Iran test
fired last month is meant to defend the Muslim world and other
oppressed countries, a senior military commander said Tuesday.
	   Experience has shown that Muslims' pacifism has only made
enemies more aggressive, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in
an interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   However, Iran does not seek war and strengthening its defenses
is only aimed at deterring enemies, Qalibaf was quoted as saying by
IRNA.
	   Qalibaf is the commander of the air wing of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, a separate force in the military with a
strength of about 120,000 men.
	   Qalibaf's comments are the first time that Iran has indicated a
religious motive for developing the Shahab-3 missile, whose range
of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) makes it capable of hitting Israel
and U.S. troops stationed in Saudi Arabia.
	   Iran is staunchly opposed to any peace with Israel and calls for
its annihilation. It also backs guerrilla groups fighting Israeli
troops in South Lebanon.
	   Qalibaf said Shahab-3 is the product of an ambitious arms
development program that Iran launched during the 1980-88 war with
Iraq.
	   He rejected claims by the United States that Russia helped Iran
build Shahab-3.
	   ``The West's sensationalism and propaganda ... come at a time
when the West possesses 95 percent of the enriched plutonium in the
world enough for producing 60,000 bombs and warheads,'' IRNA said,
quoting Qalibaf.
	   He said the first Iranian-made missile was completed in February
1984.
	   On Sunday, Qalibaf disclosed that the Shahab-3 ballistic missile
is 16 meters (53 feet) long and can travel at a speed of 7,000
kilometers (4,320 miles) per hour, carrying a one ton warhead. Its
cruising altitude is 250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level.
	   The United States says Iran is working on a long-range missile
that could be deployed in two to five years, and has pledged to
redouble its efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs
to develop it.
	   But Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Saturday that his
country is determined to continue strengthening its armed forces,
regardless of international concern.
	   Iran had virtually no arms industry under the U.S.-supported
shah because Washington supplied nearly all of Iran's defense
needs. The shah was ousted during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   Iran claims it is nearly self-sufficient in arms now. Since
1992, it has unveiled its own tanks, armored personnel carriers,
missiles, and even a fighter plane.

Arazi thrown out of Dutch Open

 &UR; Eds: updates with later matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Moroccan Hicham Arazi was thrown
out of the Grolsch Open tennis tourney Tuesday for unsportsmanlike
conduct at 7-6 (11-9), 1-5 against Swede Magnus Norman.
	   Arazi had already been warned by the umpire twice for throwing
his racket, as he grew increasingly angry with himself for making
errors in the second set of this first-round match.
	   When he several times deliberately hit the ball wildly out of
bounds in an apparent attempt to throw the second set, he was given
a third warning and an automatic disqualification.
	   Arazi, ranked 42 in the world, will forfeit his prize money and
may be fined by the ATP tour administration.
	   Top-seeded Slovakian Karol Kucera met unexpectedly tough
resistance from 75th-ranked Russian Marat Safin, but struggled
through to the last 16 with a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) win.
	   Safin peppered the decisive tiebreaker with unforced errors to
trail 6 points to 3.
	   The 18-year-old Russian saved the first two match points but
netted a backhand volley to lose after 2 hours 6 minutes.
	   But this dlrs 500,000 clay court event lost two more seeds in
the first round.
	   Argentinian qualifier Mariano Zabaleta sprayed angled winners
all around the court and retrieved acrobatically to upset the No. 2
seed Felix Mantilla of Spain, 7-6 (7-2) 6-2.
	   And 66th-ranked Czech Jiri Novak ousted Italian fifth seed
Andrea Gaudenzi in straight sets 6-3, 6-2.
	   But Czech No. 8 seed Slava Dosedel advanced against Argentinian
Mariano Puerta, 7-6 (7-5), 6-1.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Tuesday that Israel has offered proposals aimed at pleasing both
sides and hoped the Palestinians would consider the ideas and
continue talks over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   After a series of direct negotiations, the Palestinians rejected
Tuesday an Israeli idea which altered the size of a withdrawal set
out in an American peace plan and did not schedule further talks.
	   The Palestinians had threatened to walk away from the sessions
if no acceptable ideas were presented at a meeting Monday between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
	   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was cautious Tuesday not to
rule out future meetings. Although he said Israeli negotiators
brought nothing new to Monday's meeting, the Palestinians were
``studying'' whether to continue the talks.
	   The sides have been haggling over an American initiative which
calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but the United States failed to get
Israeli support for it, and sent the sides back to negotiate
directly a little over two weeks ago.
	   Netanyahu however said his negotiating team had offered up
thoughtful ideas and that an agreement was still within reach.
	   ``I think there has been substantive discussions. There are some
ideas that the Palestinians have brought up, and we took a thread
or two and tried to weave them together to proposals of our own
which we presented yesterday,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Israel wants to see ``an intensive, serious and discreet set of
negotiations for the completion of an agreement,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Arafat said the Israeli offer was ``very far'' from the
existing Israel-Palestinian agreements or from the American plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel had offered to
withdraw from 10 percent of the West Bank and turn the remaining 3
percent into a nature reserve where Israel would retain overall
security control and the Palestinians would be forbidden to build.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   ``If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there is
no need for further meetings,'' Asfour said.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called Monday's
negotiating session ``a waste of time.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.
	   Meanwhile, Netanyahu was expected to face pressures from members
of his inner Security Cabinet at a meeting Wednesday to discuss
options in the talks. Ariel Sharon, a powerful minister in
Netanyahu's right-wing coalition is against turning over more than
9 percent of West Bank land, saying it would harm Israel's
security.
	   Netanyahu is also considering a Palestinian request to release
120 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a request several of his
ministers have said they oppose.

FIBA: Low attendance hurting sport's image
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new material. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Sparse attendance at the World Basketball
Championship is hampering the sport's image, the world governing
body said Tuesday.
	   ``We are the No. 1 indoor sport, but you don't get that
impression when there are 2,000 people in stadiums that seat
18,000,'' FIBA spokesman Florian Wanninger said. ``The atmosphere
in arenas is important for our image, which is why have not been
too happy.''
	   While local organizing committee officials would not release
complete attendance figures, they did acknowledge that games not
involving Greece are averaging less than 2,000 per day. Several
games have had fans in the hundreds.
	   Preliminary round games have been played at the 18,000-seat
Olympic arena and the 14,000-seat Peace and Friendship arena.
	   Rims reverberate loudly on missed shots. Timeout huddles are
hardly private _ fans 30 rows up can listen in.
	   ``We are disappointed so far,'' Wanninger said. ``We knew in
advance, and it has been verified, that Greek people love their
team but not necessarily basketball. We have had very good games in
front of 500 spectators. That's a pity.''
	   Local officials, who have tried to boost attendance by selling
tickets at newspaper kiosks around Athens, blame the lack of
interest on the absence of the Dream Team, the group of NBA stars
dropped by USA Basketball in June because of the league's ongoing
labor dispute.
	   The last major sporting event hosted by Athens, last summer's
World Athletics Championships, was also plagued by slow attendance.
	   Officials attributed that to the exodus of Athenians to islands
during August, when temperatures top 38 degrees Celsius (100 F)
daily in the city.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LET'S GET PHYSICAL: &LR;  Some of the American players are finding it
tough to adjust to the grinding style of international play.
	   ``They set picks that snap your neck,'' said Jimmy King, who
helped Michigan's Fab Five reach two U.S. NCAA college title games.
``You have to be alert.''
	   The United States has one of the smaller lineups among those
teams in the running for medals, but has managed to hold its own
under the boards by sending waves of players at the basket. It
out-rebounded its first five opponents by a 36-30 average.
	   ``It's a more physical game,'' coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``Our guys just have to keep banging and banging down low.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STATS: &LR;  Puerto Rico's burly center Jose Ortiz is the only player
averaging double figures in both points (16.8) and rebounds
(tournament-best 10.6). The 6-foot-10 (2.07-meter) Ortiz once
played for the NBA's Utah Jazz.
	   The leading scorer is Spain's Alberto Herreros, who upped his
average to 20.5 points per game after pouring in 27 against the
United States Monday night and the same total against Lithuania
Tuesday. Lithuanian forward Arturas Karnisovas, a Seton Hall
product, is next with 18.2.
	   Michael Hawkins of the United States and Argentina's Marcelo
Milanesio share top assists honors at 4.2 per game. Hawkins has
dropped off considerably after registering 10 assists, a record for
an American at a world championship, in an opening-game win over
Brazil.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   REBOUNDS: &LR;  Karnisovas led Lithuania with 20 points in Tuesday's
86-80 overtime loss to Spain, but failed to score in the last 6:31
of regulation or the extra period. With 14:53 left in regulation,
he knocked heads with Spain's Ignacio De Miguel, causing a cut that
was heavily bandaged. ... By registering a 61-60 upset Monday,
Italy became the first squad other than a U.S. Dream Team to defeat
Yugoslavia since it was allowed to rejoin international competition
in 1995.

Cross-border firing resumes in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to lede with exchange of gunfire by Indian and
Pakistani armies, killing four people on both sides. &QL; 
 &UR; By BINOO JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAMMU, India (AP) _ Indian and Pakistani gunners pounded each
other's positions for the sixth straight day Tuesday, killing at
least four people and raising the overall death toll to 92 on both
sides of the disputed frontier in Kashmir.
	   India and Pakistan blamed each other for targeting civilian
areas. Both sides used heavy mortar and artillery fire.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, which is
divided between them. Militants in the Indian-controlled part of
Kashmir want to secede or unite with Muslim Pakistan. The Indian
part of Kashmir is the country's only state with an Islamic
majority.
	   Meanwhile, unidentified assailants attacked a remote village in
the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir and killed 19 people, in what
police Tuesday described as a feud between two groups of Muslim
guerrillas fighting a separatist war in the Himalayan territory
since 1989.
	   Kashmir police chief Gurbachan Jagat said the victims were all
relatives of a militant known as Imtiaz, who is wanted by police
for alleged acts of terrorism.
	   Jagat said the suspected militant belonged to Tehrik-e-Jihad,
one of several groups fighting for Kashmir's separation from India.
	   In another attack, suspected separatists shot three Hindus at
point-blank range early Tuesday in the southern Kashmir district of
Udhampur, police said. Before fleeing, the rebels burned seven
homes in the Hindu village of Balmatkote, 200 kilometers (125
miles) northeast of Jammu, the state's winter capital.
	   The latest killings came a day after suspected Kashmiri
militants shot dead 34 laborers, most or all of them Hindus, in the
adjoining Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.
	   An Indian Defense Ministry statement said two civilians and a
soldier were killed by Tuesday's artillery and mortar fire.
	   Another 10 people, including two army officers, six soldiers and
two civilians, were injured in the firing, the statement said.
	   Pakistani military sources, on customary condition of anonymity,
said one Pakistani civilian was killed and four were injured on
their side of the border.
	   Indian officials said nearly 20,000 people living close to the
border shifted to safer towns. Nearly 150 houses have been
destroyed in three Indian villages.
	   Cross-border gunfire intensified last week when Indian and
Pakistani leaders held inconclusive talks about Kashmir.
	   In New Delhi, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told
Parliament on Thursday that the government was taking ``firm
steps'' to deal with militants in Kashmir, the Press Trust of India
reported. Opposition legislators accused the government of failing
to protect its citizens after repeated civilian massacres.
	   Apparently referring to the stalemate over Kashmir, Vajpayee
suggested freezing contentious issues with Pakistan and
concentrating on other problems to help normalize relations _ an
idea Pakistan has rejected in the past.

Israel points to brightening picture for Palestinian workers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA KING &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EREZ CROSSING POINT, Gaza Strip (AP) _ In a major turnaround,
Israel has not closed its borders to Palestinian workers once this
year, Israel's liaison with the Palestinians said Tuesday.
	   The Israeli official, Maj. Gen. Yaacov Orr, said that and other
steps in recent months mark a fundamental shift in Israel's
dealings with Palestinian workers, whose earnings from jobs in the
Jewish state are crucial to the Palestinian economy.
	   ``It's a question of opening a window, and then a door,'' Orr
told reporters at the checkpoint between Israel and the Gaza Strip.
``A stronger Palestinian economy is good for Israel.''
	   In the early 1990s, more than 100,000 Palestinians worked in
Israel. But that number has been sharply curtailed in recent years
in response to terror attacks by Islamic militants.
	   Palestinians with jobs in Israel make up only about 20 percent
of the territories' work force, but their wages represent up to 40
percent of total Palestinian earnings.
	   For the past several years, Israel's frequent sealing off of
Gaza and West Bank cost the Palestinian economy millions of dollars
in lost income and export revenues. The territories were closed for
93 days in 1996 and 62 days last year.
	   In 1998, however, the only closures have come on national
holidays when Palestinian workers would not have been on the job in
Israel anyway, Orr said.
	   The closures of previous years were generally in response to
suicide bombings or serious civil unrest in the Palestinian lands.
Orr said this year, Israel has deliberately refrained from closures
even when it was worried about potential security threats.
	   ``It's a calculated risk, but it builds the future life between
our societies,'' he said.
	   The last suicide bombing in Israel was 11 months ago, and the
last major closure was in response to it.
	   Depicting a brightening jobs picture, Orr cited measures
including the issuing of travel permits to 18,000 Palestinian
merchants and business people; permission for about 5,000 workers
to stay overnight in Israel; a small increase in truck traffic in
and out of the territories, and the building of a new Israeli
customs compound to expedite Palestinian exports from Gaza.
	   Palestinians, however, say any improvements must be seen in
light of the severity of restrictions. Fewer than 60,000 of the
nearly 3 million Palestinians in the territories have permission to
travel to Israel, and unemployment is rampant in the West Bank and
Gaza.

Former Radio Free Europe workers fight for freedom, at least in
</HEADLINE>
name &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Another freedom fight has erupted in
Poland, at least in name.
	   Former Polish employees of U.S.-sponsored Radio Free Europe are
battling their previous employer over the use of the network's
name, associated by Poles with freedom and democracy, a daily
newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The U.S. corporation protested the use of its trademark by the
former employees of its Polish division, who wanted to name their
publishing company with the Polish translation of Radio Free
Europe, according to the Rzeczpospolita report.
	   When the state licensing agency agreed with the Americans,
saying the U.S. group invented and promoted the name, the Poles
decided to lodge an appeal.
	   They said the U.S. corporation registered the name only in its
English version, the newspaper reported. If the logic of the
licensing agency were followed, they argued, then the Polish
magazine ``Czas,'' which means ``Time,'' also would have to change
its name, according to the newspaper.
	   The licensing agency's appeal body decided Monday to expand its
panel to decide the matter on an unspecified date.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Authorities in northern Russia have opened a
criminal investigation into an accident in a skydiving training
class in which four teen-agers are believed to have died, a news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   The teens were carried by strong winds last Friday into Lake
Onega, a large lake in the Russian republic of Karelia. One drowned
when she became tangled in her parachute lines, and three others
remain missing and are presumed dead, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Divers have been searching the bottom of the lake, but
authorities said the area involved is so vast that the bodies are
unlikely to be found anytime soon.
	   Yuri Ivukov, the chairman of Karelia's emergencies department,
blamed a sports club for the deaths, saying trainers had neglected
elementary safety rules. However, no charges have been filed.
	   ``The jumpers were absolutely unprepared,'' Ivukov said. ``Young
men and women sky-dived for the first time in their lives. They had
studied it on the ground for only four hours.''
	   The young people involved in the jumps ranged in age from 15 to
17, ITAR-Tass said.

Nov. 23 trial set in Bermuda murder of Canadian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A Bermudan court has set a Nov. 23
court date for a man charged with killing a Canadian teen-ager who
was vacationing on the island.
	   Justis Smith, 19, faces murder charges in the death of
17-year-old Rebecca Middleton of Belleville, Ontario, on July 3,
1996.
	   The trial date was set Monday by Bermuda Supreme Court Judge
Austin Ward.
	   Prosecutors' key witness is Kirk Mundy, who is already serving a
five-year sentence as an accomplice in Middleton's murder.
	   Mundy pleaded guilty in October 1996 in exchange for testimony
against Smith, but Smith's trial was delayed because prosecutors
claimed they later found evidence that Munday also participated in
the killing.
	   The government tried to bring new charges against Mundy, but on
July 6 the British Privy Council, the supreme court for former
British colonies in the Caribbean, rejected prosecutors' request to
try him again.
	   According to testimony at Mundy's previous trial, the two men
picked up Middleton as she waited for a taxi in the early morning
hours after attending a party.
	   Her body was found later along a road. She had been sexually
assaulted and stabbed several times. Mundy claimed Smith killed
Middleton after he walked away from the two.

Kohl, Kinkel criticize Czechs on remarks about exiled Germans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with reaction from Czech vice premier, background on
Zeman comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl slammed Czech
Premier Milos Zeman on Tuesday for comparing Germans exiled from
his nation after World War II to radical rightists and communists.
	   ``It is totally unfathomable how a government chief can use such
an absurd and completely unacceptable formulation of words,'' Kohl
told RTL television from his vacation retreat in Austria. ``Either
the man doesn't know what he's talking about or he is using it for
domestic politics.''
	   Zeman's vice premier, Egon Lansky, said told the Czech
Republic's CTK news agency late Tuesday that the ``Czech government
is not going to comment on positions taken by German politicians,
based on totally wrong interpretation of the premier's words.''
	   The dispute arose last month when Zeman spoke out against having
Sudeten Germans as members of a German-Czech dialogue forum,
comparing that to having Czech radical-rightists or communists on
the panel.
	   Zeman noted that panel member Franz Neubauer, leader of a
Sudeten German group, was opposed to the 1997 German-Czech
declaration aimed at easing tensions between the countries, as were
the Czech Republic's Communist and Republican parties.
	   The forum, set up under the declaration, is aimed at reconciling
the two neighbors following decades of hard feelings caused by Nazi
occupation during the World War II and the subsequent expulsion of
some 2.5 million Germans from the Sudetenland region of
then-Czechoslovakia.
	   ``When we finally meet, I will tell him that if that's the
policy of good neighbors, to criticize a group of people who bore
special suffering, like his people suffered under the Germans, you
can't expect that we'll be good neighbors,'' Kohl said.
	   In an interview with the Cologne-based Stadt-Anzeige, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel was a bit more diplomatic than the
chancellor.
	   ``The continuing criticism from certain Czech government
representatives is unnecessary, unfathomable and not helpful,'' the
newspaper quoted Kinkel as saying.
	   But he also said that ``certain shrill comments from Germany,''
also contributed to the dispute.

	   _President Laurent Kabila: former Marxist and rebel leader who
swept to power last year after his forces toppled longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko. A member of the Luba tribe from Congo's Katanga
province, he relied heavily on armed support from Rwandan Tutsi
soldiers and Banyamulenge Tutsis for support during his rebel war
in 1997.
	   _Banyamulenge ethnic group: Congolese Tutsis based predominantly
in the country's east. Share close ties with Rwandan Tutsis and
played an important military role in Kabila's rebel victory over
Mobutu. Along with Rwandan troops, the Banyamulenge are the lead
players in the current uprising in Congo.
	   _Col. James Kabarere: A Rwandan Tutsi soldier who was recently
fired as Kabila's chief military commander. Known while working for
Kabila as James Kabari. Wields significant influence among Rwandan
troops who fought alongside Kabila and now are staging a rebellion
against his government. Was reportedly in eastern town of Bukavu
during uprising.
	   _Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame: born
in exile in Uganda. Joined rebel forces of current Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni, then left to join the rebel Rwandan
Patriotic Front. After the death of its founder, Kagame assumed
control and after the 1994 genocide, led rebel forces who overthrew
Rwanda's extremist Hutu government. Kagame is widely believed to be
responsible for masterminding the rebellion that put Kabila in
power in Congo.

Netanyahu and Ugandan foreign minister discuss improved relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Uganda's
foreign minister Tuesday discussed improving relations between
their two countries since the overthrow of Ugandan dictator Idi
Amin almost 20 years ago.
	   Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya met with Netanyahu on
his second day of a three-day trip to Israel.
	   The two men also discussed possible joint economic projects to
help bolster growing bilateral trade.
	   Kategaya said his government was still committed to erecting a
memorial to Netanyahu's brother, Jonathan, who was killed in
Entebbe, Uganda while leading a commando raid on an Air France
plane hijacked by Palestinians in 1976 and forced to land in
Uganda.

Jane's: Myanmar barters rice for artillery pieces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Myanmar bartered rice for 20 artillery pieces from
North Korea earlier this year, Jane's Defense Weekly reported
Tuesday.
	   The respected military magazine said the deal was the first
direct arms sale since the two countries broke off diplomatic
relations in November 1983, a month after North Korean agents
bombed a South Korean presidential delegation at Rangoon's Martyrs'
Mausoleum. Nineteen people died including four South Korean Cabinet
members.
	   Quoting Rangoon-based diplomatic sources, Jane's said China has
been trying to promote reconciliation between North Korea and
Myanmar, also known as Burma, since last year.
	   The magazine said it was unclear whether the 133 mm towed
artillery pieces involved in the deal were made in North Korea or
Russia. The value of the deal was unknown, it said.
	   ``In either case, China may have played a role in brokering the
agreement,'' Jane's said.

U.S. group plans 2nd investment conference in Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.S. entrepreneurs hoping to make investment
contacts in Cuba will meet Cuban businessmen in Mexico and on the
communist island next month, the Prensa Latina news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   Kirby Jones, an American who organized a similar conference in
March, said the upcoming meeting would give delegates an
opportunity to speak directly with high-level Cuban authorities and
representatives of the private sector, the government news agency
said citing a report by Cuba's Radio Reloj.
	   Jones said businessmen from U.S., French and Israeli companies
would attend the conference, which will begin Sept. 9 in the
Mexican resort of Cancun and conclude two days later in Havana,
according to the report monitored in Mexico City.
	   In March, more than 50 U.S. business people participated in a
weekend conference carefully designed to keep them from violating
the 37-year-old U.S. economic embargo which bans them from spending
money in the communist island.

New round of talks opens to end 15-year civil war in Sudan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ The definition of what constitutes
southern Sudan and the role of the Muslim religion in that region
topped the agenda as representatives of the Sudanese government and
rebels sat down Tuesday to a new round of peace talks.
	   Government and rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Army,
whose 15-year civil war has ravaged Sudan and created a famine that
is claiming hundreds of lives a day, are at odds over the
definition of the area to vote on self-determination and Khartoum's
demand for theocratic rule throughout Africa's largest nation.
	   In May, both sides agreed in principle to hold an
internationally supervised referendum on possible independence for
southern Sudan _ but they did not agree on the territory involved.
	   The SPLA has been fighting government troops since 1983 for
greater autonomy for the largely African, Christian and animist
south from the Islamic, Arabized north.
	   More than 1.5 milion people have died due to the fighting and
resultant famines.
	   The talks are held under the auspices of the regional
Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, a six-nation body that
seeks to mediate conflict.
	   Chairing the talks on behalf of IGAD, Kenyan Foreign Miister
Bonya Godana said he hoped ``the contentious issue of the
separation of state and religion, which has been obstructing the
peace process, will be resolved once and for all in a manner
satisfactory to both sides.''
	   Godana said administrative arrangements that would precede a
referendum have yet to be worked out.
	   The parties also disagree on what exactly constitutes southern
Sudan for purposes of the referendum.
	   The SPLA wants to include Southern Kordofan and Southern Blue
Nile provinces, as well as the eastern Nuba Mountains.
	   The two provinces were included in northern Sudan at the time of
independence from British-Egyptian rule in 1956.
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Ismail and Riak Machar, a
former SPLA commander who recently joined the government side, are
heading Khartoum's delegation to the talks.
	   SPLA commander Salva Kir heads the rebel delegation.
	   On Monday Khartoum announced a unilateral, indefinite and
cease-fire in all southern Sudan to allow humanitarian relief to
access the estimated 2.4 million famine victims in the region.
	   The U.N. World Food Program is currently dropping 9,500 tons of
food to the starving and hopes to raise that number to 15,000 tons
in August, in the largest current aid operation in the world.
	   The cease-fire annoucement Monday expanded the scope of a
three-month truce agreed to last month between the government and
the SPLA in the hardest-hit southwestern region of Bahr al-Ghazal.
	   An SPLA official on Monday dismissed the announcement as
pre-talk maneuvering.
	   But British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett, who helped
mediate the original three-month cease-fire, welcomed the
announcement.
	   ``I hope this declaration will also help to facilitate the peace
negotiations on the Sudan ... It is crucial that both sides should
respect the cease-fire and negotiate seriously in Addis Ababa to
bring this long-running conflict to an end,'' he said in a
statement issued in London.

	   BERLIN (AP) _ A suspected natural gas explosion destroyed an
apartment house in Berlin early Tuesday, and rescue workers said as
many as nine people may have been buried in the rubble.
	   Among those missing was 13-year-old Sven Tornow, whose parents
and grandparents watched the rescue efforts in tears. Rescue
workers using sonar equipment said they detected signs of a
heartbeat and breathing from the back room where the boy was
believed buried.
	   His father was at work at the time of the blast and his mother
already in a new apartment that the family had planned to move into
on Friday.
	   An elderly couple was also known to be buried under the 7-meter
(23-foot) high pile of debris, and six other residents were
unaccounted for.
	   Rescuers managed to pull a 33-year-old man from the rubble
shortly after the blast and another resident of the four-story
building got out on her own; neither was seriously injured.
	   Almost 12 hours after the blast, no fatalities had been found.
	   Hundreds of police and firefighters searched for signs of life
with dozens of dogs and devices that can detect body heat and
sound.
	   Fire chief Alfred Broemme said the work would continue for at
least a day.
	   He blamed natural gas for the explosion, which ripped the house
off its foundation and sent a huge cloud of dust over the Steglitz
neighborhood. Police, however, were still investigating.
	   Residents of surrounding buildings were temporarily evacuated as
a precaution.

Sunny day could see records fall at DN Galan, athletes say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A late afternoon breeze chased away
dark clouds and intermittent rain, raising athletes' hopes for
sunshine, fast times and possible world records at Wednesday's DN
Galan Grand Prix.
	   ``The hotter it is, the better I run,'' sprinter Ato Boldon of
Trinidad said at a Tuesday news conference. Last year, he won the
100- and 200-meter races in the meet at Stockholm's 1912 Olympic
Stadium.
	   ``It's going to be very fast, very fast,'' predicted Maurice
Greene of the United States. He finished second to his training
partner and friend, Boldon, in both events last year. ``He got
lucky,'' Greene said with a laugh.
	   This year's field once again is crowded with champions in their
prime, aging record holders and rising stars, each dreaming of
breakthrough performances.
	   ``When I put the spikes on my feet and step on the track ... I
know I am very fast ... and I don't worry about anyone else,'' said
Algeria's Noureddine Morceli, the world record holder and Olympic
gold medalist in the mile.
	   Wilson Boit Kipketer of Kenya said, ``I feel in my mind that I
can run a sub 8-minute'' time in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
	   While several seconds off the world record of 7:55.72, that
still would be the best time ever the stadium, where 83 world
records have been set _ more than at any other.
	   Some of the dozens of athletes competing in 18 events have had
their best moments at Olympic Stadium. Javelin thrower Steve
Backley of Great Britain had a world record throw in 1990.
	   He was a teen-ager then and ``throwing came easily,'' he
recalled. Then came the injuries, and training and competitions
became more like work than fun.
	   Still, nearly a decade later, ``I'm probably better now than I
was then, and I'm throwing further,'' Backley said. He'd like to
add an Olympic gold medal to the silver (1996) and bronze (1992)
already in his collection.
	   ``That's the one that's missing,'' he said. ``It's always the
medals that count, if you ask the athletes.''
	   Another veteran, sprinter Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, got a little
testy when asked, yet again, whether she's finally contemplating
retirement.
	   ``I was ranked No. 2 in the world last year, so that wasn't a
good reason to quit,'' she snapped, adding she feels energized by
competition from America's Marion Jones, top ranked last year in
the 100 meters.
	   ``Marion, running well, brings out the best in me,'' said Ottey,
37, who is posting faster times these days than when she swept
first place in each of her two previous entries in the DN Galan,
way back in 1989 and 1991.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Bidding a violent farewell to outgoing
President Ernesto Samper, Colombians rebels have killed 26 people
this week in a show of strength ahead of peace talks with his
successor, authorities said.
	   The attacks by the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the National Liberation Army, killed at least 14
police officers, two secret service members and an unspecified
number of army troops and civilians.
	   The attacks by the two largest rebel groups, which took place in
14 of Colombia's 32 provinces, wounded more than 40 people.
	   A police spokesman said the overall death toll was at least 26,
but the figure apparently did not include a rebel attack Tuesday
which the army says killed seven soldiers guarding a hydroelectric
facility near Medellin, the country's second-largest city.
	   There was no word on rebel casualties.
	   The latest guerrilla onslaught follows weekend attacks by the
National Liberation Army, or ELN, which killed eight people and
included the abduction of a ruling party senator. The assaults
raised doubts about the sincerity of the group, which last month
pledged to scale back kidnappings and attacks on civilians as a
gesture to improve the climate for peace.
	   But in a Tuesday press conference President-elect Andres
Pastrana, who takes office Friday, called the guerrilla upsurge ``a
farewell for the current government'' and vowed to push ahead with
plans to make peace with both groups.
	   Defense Minister Gilberto Echeverri said the guerrillas were
making a show of force in order to obtain leverage in eventual
negotiations.
	   During Samper's term, the rebels gained militarily while largely
shunning peace talks, saying the government was illegitimate. The
guerillas have been fighting for power since the 1960s.
	   Police said the rebels have kidnapped six police officers in
central Antioquia province and had apparently seized 22 army
soldiers in combat in southern Guaviare province, a major
coca-producing region. An army spokesman said he could not confirm
the soldiers' abduction.
	   Rebels also kidnapped two small-town mayors and destroyed four
police stations, the police reported
	   The attacks late-Monday and early-Tuesday began with a bomb
explosion at a secret police barracks in the northern city of
Cucuta which killed two police officers, and a car-bomb explosion
at an army base in Medellin that killed a soldier, authorities
reported.
	   Five civilians and a police officer were reported killed in a
rebel assault late-Monday in Cordoba, a town in northern Bolivar
province.
	   Rebel attacks against army bases in the oil-producing Putumayo
region, bordering with Ecuador, ended Tuesday morning with two
soldiers killed, army chief General Mario Hugo Galan reported.
	   Other rebel actions Tuesday included an attack on an
anti-narcotics police in Guaviare province, reportedly killing two
police officers, and an assault on the Pacific port of Buenaventura
which local authorities said killed three police and a civilian.

Hardline Kosovo Albanian group slams European powers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A hard-line group of Kosovo Albanians
condemned European powers Tuesday for failing to react to the
latest Serb offensive in the Serbian province of Kosovo, Albanian
media reported.
	   The Popular Movement of Kosovo, a group supporting the
underground Kosovo Liberation Army, said in a statement issued to
state-run Albanian TV that ``with their silence, European
politicians are helping Serbia to use violence against Kosovo,''
where the rebel KLA is fighting Serb forces for independence.
	   ``The last Serbian offensive against the people of Kosovo and
KLA was aimed at eliminating the Kosovo Liberation Army forces ...
and forcing Kosovo Albanians to give up their fight for liberty and
democracy, and finally to have a government in Kosovo that is
sympathetic to Belgrade.''
	   By not acting against the Serbs, said the Switzerland-based
movement, European leaders are supporting ``the Serbian regime and
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic.''
	   The statement also said ``assured the international community''
that the KLA would not be brought down to its knees.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila
battled with rebellious Tutsi fighters Tuesday at opposite ends of
the country in an uprising aimed at toppling the president's
14-month-old regime.
	   Gunfire was reported in the eastern town of Bukavu near the
border with Rwanda, said aid workers based there. A provincial
official told The Associated Press that the rebels were in control
of the town, although some reports indicated fighting there
continued.
	   Banyamulenge Tutsis and Rwandan soldiers led the uprising
against Kabila, accusing him of widespread corruption and
government mismanagement.
	   In the southwestern village of Kitona, where rebel gunmen forced
a hijacked private airplane to land, fighting was reported at the
town's main military base, a government spokesman said.
	   It was unclear who was in control of the base in Kitona, but
Kabila has vowed to crush the uprising and called on his supporters
for help.
	   ``Be assured we will take weapons to swiftly end this
rebellion,'' Cabinet minister Pierre Victor Mpoyo said on state
radio, quoting Kabila.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza said
the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   ``At the moment a large portion of the province is under the
control of the army which is hostile to Kabila's regime,'' Serukiza
said in a telephone interview.
	   Kivu region is divided into three provinces, including North
Kivu, South Kivu and Maniema.
	   In the city of Goma, gunmen hijacked a private airplane and
ordered the pilot to fly to the military base in Kitona near the
Atlantic coastline on the opposite side of the country, said
Kabila's spokesman Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi.
	   The hijacking was led by Banyamulenge ethnic fighters.
	   The Congolese airplane owned by the private airline CAL touched
down in Kitona about 225 kilometers (140 miles) southwest of
Kinshasa, said Ndombasi.
	   He gave no other details concerning the hijacking during a brief
announcement broadcast on state television.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gun battles in two military barracks in the capital.
	   ``The government asks Congo's neighbors not to make the wrong
decisions to fight,'' Mpoyo said in a radio broadcast following the
meeting.
	   The comment was aimed directly at neighboring Rwanda, which
Kabila believes is behind the movement against his leadership.
Rwandan fighters and Banyamulenge Tutsis played a key role in
helping Kabila march to victory last year over longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Those same fighters today, however, appear to be moving to get
rid of Kabila.
	   A delicate ethnic and military alliance that helped thrust
Kabila _ a one-time obscure Marxist rebel _ into power 14 months
ago is now unraveling.
	   ``Kabila has been very aggressive against his neighbors of
late,'' said Rwandan chief of staff Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa. ``So
today is Rwanda's turn.''
	   Although Rwanda has repeatedly denied its involvement in the
rebellion, it does not deny the presence in Congo of its troops,
who stayed on as part of Kabila's defense force.
	   Kabila's chief military commander until late last month was Col.
James Kaberere, a Rwandan Tutsi soldier who was fired just days
before Kabila ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of his country.
	   Rwanda's Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame is
widely viewed as the man who orchestrated Kabila's rebel victory
over Mobutu. However, Kabila has not lived up to their expectations
and Rwanda has increasingly complained he has done little to
increase security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   The rebel forces may ``push up to Kinshasa,'' he said, adding
``It depends on how effective they will be.''
	   Congo's Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo said the government was
preparing an armed response to the rebellion in Kivu region.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in the area has close links with
Rwanda, while Kabila's support and control of the region has
faltered for months.
	   ``We're telling them to lay down their arms and end this
adventure before we immediately bring in the army,'' Kongolo said.
	   In the capital one day after shots rang out at two military
bases on Kinshasa's west end, loyal troops continued to patrol city
streets and man roadblocks.
	   A dusk-to-dawn curfew was still in effect, but life in the city
began to return to normal as abandoned streets began to fill again
with shoppers and merchants.

Russian miners ease blockade of power plant in Far East

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With coal supplies dwindling, striking miners
eased their blockade Tuesday of the main power plant on the eastern
island of Sakhalin, agreeing to allow enough coal through to keep
the plant operational.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of overdue
wages, have been blocking railroad approaches to the plant for
nearly two weeks. They agreed that 25 cars carrying about 1,500
tons of coal could go to the plant daily, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   But authorities will continue rationing electricity on the Far
Eastern island, the reports said. Homes and factories on Sakhalin
have been getting only between five and six hours of electricity a
day, it added.
	   Sakhalin Deputy Gov. Ivan Malakhov called the protest a
``terrorist'' act, ITAR-Tass said. But his boss, Gov. Igor
Farkhutdinov, disputed the accusation and revoked an earlier threat
to use force to remove the miners.
	   ``No one is going to use force,'' Farkhutdinov was quoted as
saying. ``It is not terrorism; it is an act of despair.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin was quoted by Interfax as
saying he sympathized with the strikers, but warned that police
``naturally will act consistent with the law.''
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant for electricity. About
650,000 people live on the island.
	   The strike is one of many miners' protests over unpaid wages in
recent months. But the protests have been largely uncoordinated and
in most instances have inflicted only limited damage on the
economy.
	   In other developments Tuesday:
	   _ Ambulance workers in the eastern port city of Vladivostok went
on strike to demand four months of back wages.
	   _ Coal miners in the Chelyabinsk region were blocking the
Argayashskaya power plant, which supplies energy to nuclear-waste
processing enterprise Mayak, the business daily Kommersant said.
Civil defense workers were sent to the region to ensure the safety
of nuclear storage sites, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   _ Miners in the Siberian coal center of Kemerovo lifted all
railroad blockades, allowing the traffic to pass unimpeded for the
first time in at least a month, ITAR-Tass said. Coal companies have
begun paying back wages after a government commission spent two
weeks negotiating with the miners.
	   _ In the coal-mining city of Vorkuta, a group of miners said
they would begin a sit-in demonstration in the central square
beginning Wednesday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ The union of Russian air traffic controllers said it would go
on strike Sunday to demand back wages and the resolution of various
other issues, Interfax reported.

Scientific team to investigate if Titanic ``sunk gently to rest or
</HEADLINE>
landed with a bang''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A team of British researchers said Tuesday they
will take sediment from the Atlantic Ocean around the Titanic to
see how swiftly the luxury liner sank and its impact on the sea
bed.
	   ``We hope to determine whether it fluttered gently to rest or
landed with a bang,'' said Angus Best, leader of the research team
from Southampton University's oceanography center in southern
England.
	   Best said that the expedition will begin Aug. 19, and his team
will spend two weeks moored 400 miles (600 kms) off Newfoundland,
Canada, where the ``unsinkable'' Titanic struck an iceberg and sank
in April, 1912, killing more than 1,500 of its 2,200 passengers and
crew.
	   Best's team will use a remotely-operated deep-sea submersible to
take sediment from the area immediately around the Titanic and
compare it to sediment in areas which were not disturbed when the
liner hit the ocean floor.
	   ``Analysis of the stress history of sediment collected from
around the wreck site will tell us how great the impact was and
therefore the speed at which the Titanic was traveling when it hit
the ground,'' said Best.

 &UR; Kohl, Kinkel criticize Czechs on remarks about exiled Germans &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with reaction from Czech vice premier, background on
Zeman comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl slammed Czech
Premier Milos Zeman on Tuesday for comparing Germans exiled from
his nation after World War II to radical rightists and communists.
	   ``It is totally unfathomable how a government chief can use such
an absurd and completely unacceptable formulation of words,'' Kohl
told RTL television from his vacation retreat in Austria. ``Either
the man doesn't know what he's talking about or he is using it for
domestic politics.''
	   Zeman's vice premier, Egon Lansky, said told the Czech
Republic's CTK news agency late Tuesday that the ``Czech government
is not going to comment on positions taken by German politicians,
based on totally wrong interpretation of the premier's words.''
	   The dispute arose last month when Zeman spoke out against having
Sudeten Germans as members of a German-Czech dialogue forum,
comparing that to having Czech radical-rightists or communists on
the panel.
	   Zeman noted that panel member Franz Neubauer, leader of a
Sudeten German group, was opposed to the 1997 German-Czech
declaration aimed at easing tensions between the countries, as were
the Czech Republic's Communist and Republican parties.
	   The forum, set up under the declaration, is aimed at reconciling
the two neighbors following decades of hard feelings caused by Nazi
occupation during the World War II and the subsequent expulsion of
some 2.5 million Germans from the Sudetenland region of
then-Czechoslovakia.
	   ``When we finally meet, I will tell him that if that's the
policy of good neighbors, to criticize a group of people who bore
special suffering, like his people suffered under the Germans, you
can't expect that we'll be good neighbors,'' Kohl said.
	   In an interview with the Cologne-based Stadt-Anzeige, Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel was a bit more diplomatic than the
chancellor.
	   ``The continuing criticism from certain Czech government
representatives is unnecessary, unfathomable and not helpful,'' the
newspaper quoted Kinkel as saying.
	   But he also said that ``certain shrill comments from Germany,''
also contributed to the dispute.

NASA sticks to life on Mars theory as doubts increase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The announcement stunned the world: Scientists
had found evidence of life on Mars.
	   Inside a meteorite from Mars, NASA researchers said, they had
discovered the fossilized remains of tiny, bacteria-like animals
that may have once thrived on the Red Planet.
	   The idea seized global attention and gave sudden popular
legitimacy to the possibility of extraterrestrial life. President
Bill Clinton called for a space summit. Famed scientist Carl Sagan
called it ``a possible turning point in human history.''
	   ``We'll know for sure in two years or so,'' said NASA researcher
Everett Gibson.
	   Now that two years have passed, excitement and applause have
faded to doubt and skepticism.
	   Hundreds of scientists have poked, probed, crushed, dissolved
and broken parts of the Mars rock known as Allen Hills 84001. So
far, no one has found absolute, incontrovertible evidence that the
potato-sized chunk ever contained life.
	   Then again, nobody has proven that the team led by Gibson and
David McKay was wrong.
	   ``Everyone was hopeful that it would just take a short period of
time to prove,'' said Richard N. Zare of Stanford University, a key
member of the McKay-Gibson team. ``We've seen two years go by. I
don't know of anyone who has changed their opinion.''
	   Ralph Harvey of Case Western Reserve University, an expert on
meteorites, was excited and skeptical when the McKay group made its
announcement. Now he is just skeptical and believes most other
scientists are, too.
	   ``People in the field either aren't able to confirm the work or
don't seem favorable to it,'' said Harvey.
	   John Bradley, a professor at Georgia Institute of Technology, is
even blunter: ``Early skepticism has evolved into international
consensus ... that this rock does not contain Martian fossils. I do
not know of a single other individual who believes it at this
point.''
	   McKay, Gibson, Zare and others on the Mars rock team, however,
still believe that the presence of ancient microscopic life best
explains what they found inside.
	   No one disputes the basic facts about the rock: that it formed
on Mars some 4.5 billion years ago, was catapulted into space about
16 million years ago after a comet or asteroid smashed into Mars.
	   The rock floated around for millions of years before it came
scorching through the Earth's atmosphere about 13,000 years ago and
smashed into Antarctica. It was found by meteorite hunters in 1984.
Chemistry tests later proved the rock came from Mars.
	   What's inside has caused the controversy.
	   McKay's team, using powerful microscopes, found polycylic
aromatic hydrocarbons, the first organic molecules ever seen inside
a Martian rock. The researchers also found a crystal structure
called carbonate, shaped like extremely tiny worms.
	   The team concluded the most likely explanation was that about 3
billion years ago, Martian microbes had crawled into the rock,
thrived and then died. The wormlike structures might be their
fossilized remains.
	   Rival researchers have attacked the theory on several fronts:
	   _The organic compounds can be formed in a number of ways that do
not involve biology.
	   _The wormlike structures are crystals that formed with adjacent
material when the rock cooled.
	   _Some minerals were formed in the rock at very high temperatures
_ well above the maximum for life formation.
	   _The rock contains very few minerals formed in the presence of
water. Since water is thought to be essential to life, it's
unlikely the dry rock ever contained life.
	   _Organics found in the rock are of Earth origin. The molecules
got into ALH84001 while it sat in Antarctic ice.
	   McKay, Gibson, Zare and other members of the original team have
countered each argument, doing lab experiments to reinforce their
findings. Gibson has debated scientists in open meetings.
	   The debate may never be settled, says NASA's Ed Weiler, ``until
we go there (to Mars) and get some samples.''
	   No matter how or when the question is answered, notes Zare,
science has been the winner.
	   ``Prior to this study, if you talked about searching for life on
another planet, you were considered a nut,'' he said. ``It has now
become a huge topic that is attracting the best scientists.''

Spanish prisons system approves weekend leave for banker Conde
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Tuesday agreed to let the
once high-flying banker Mario Conde, convicted of embezzlement, out
of jail two weekends per month.
	   The limited furlough was approved by an eight-member panel at
the Alcala-Meco prison outside Madrid.
	   It is there that Conde is serving a term of four years and two
months for defrauding the Banco Espanol de Credito, known as
Banesto, of 600 million pesetas (dlrs 4.3 million) while he ran the
bank. He began serving the term in late February.
	   A spokeswoman for the National Prison Directorate said the
panel's decision was a routine one for a case such as Conde's,
involving a non-violent crime with a relatively short sentence and
good behavior by the inmate.
	   Conde can choose which weekends he wants to get out on leave,
she said.
	   With his slicked-back hair and jet-set friends, Conde was for
many a garish symbol of the get-rich-quick mentality that
characterized much of the Spanish business community in the 1980s.
	   Now Conde lives alone in an 11-square-meter (120-square-foot)
prison cell, the spokeswoman said. Amenities include a personal
computer, but Conde cannot connect with the Internet, for example.
	   ``He does not have that much access to the outside world,'' she
said.
	   Since December, Conde and 10 other former directors and
associates of Banesto have been on trial on other charges --
misappropriating funds, forgery and price rigging. If convicted,
they face maximum jail sentences of 44 years.

Jane's: India negotiating spares for controversial guns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ India is finalizing the purchase of much needed
spare parts for 410 howitzers bought from the Swedish weapons
company Bofors AB in a deal that continues to rock Indian politics,
Jane's Defense Weekly reported Tuesday.
	   Official sources in India were quoted by the respected military
magazine as saying that military and Ministry of Defense officials
were completing negotiations with two Bofors subsidiaries,
CelsiusTech in Sweden and AB Celsius in Austria, for spares for the
155 mm towed howitzers.
	   For nearly 10 years, Jane's said, all dealings with Bofors and
its subsidiaries have been banned because of a corruption scandal.
	   The Indian government enacted an embargo against Bofors after it
was revealed that the Swedish company allegedly paid kickbacks of
dlrs 50 million to secure the 1986 howitzer deal with India. The
scandal brought down the government of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi,
and investigations are still continuing.
	   Since the early 1990s, Jane's said, the howitzers have
increasingly been suffering from a shortage of spare parts which
has led to widespread cannibalization. The howitzers have undergone
over 130 modifications and between 100 and 120 are inoperative, it
said.
	   Earlier attempts by the army to persuade successive Indian
governments to import spares for the howitzers failed, the magazine
said.
	   ``However, the situation has now become so acute that the only
options are either to buy a new weapon system for which there is no
money or to buy the spares from a Bofor subsidiary,'' it said.
	   Jane's also reported that Indian defense officials have visited
Britain and Israel to buy specialized equipment for the country's
special forces including submachine guns, sniper rifles, night
vision devices and crossbows. The equipment is mainly for use
against Kashmiri militants fighting for an Islamic homeland, it
said.

UN peace envoy meets veteran UNITA leader Savimbi in highland
</HEADLINE>
stronghold
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior U.N. envoy met with veteran
Angolan rebel chief Jonas Savimbi Tuesday, on the fifth day of an
emergency mission to avert a return to civil war.
	   Lakdhar Brahimi refused to comment on his talks with Savimbi _
the undisputed leader of the former rebel movement UNITA.
	   UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, fought a two-decade civil war against the
government before a U.N.-brokered agreement in 1994 sealed a
tenuous peace.
	   Brahimi's arrival in Angola last Friday was prompted by signs
that the peace process was on the point of collapse, including the
massacre of 100 civilians in a remote village and reported military
buildup on both sides.
	   UNITA's refusal to relinquish control of its rural strongholds
in compliance with the 1994 accord was at the heart of Tuesday's
conversation, UNITA spokesman Horacio Junjuvili told reporters.
	   Savimbi ``reiterated UNITA's position that we will only abandon
the sensitive areas when our political space is guaranteed,''
Junjuvili said, alleging government hostility.
	   UNITA's Secretary-General Paulo Lukamba said that unlike UNITA,
the government was not committed to peace. ``It takes two to
tango'' he said, according to the Portuguese news agency Lusa.
	   On Monday President Jose Eduardo dos Santos assured Brahimi that
his government was committed to the full implementation of the 1994
accord and blamed UNITA for the rising tension.
	   An estimated 500,000 people were killed and many thousands more
maimed by land mines in Angola's conflict, which was fueled by Cold
War geopolitics.
	   Brahimi flew some 300 kilometers (180 miles) southeast of Luanda
to meet Savimbi at his highland headquarters in one of UNITA's
controversial strongholds.
	   After whisking past reporters at Luanda airport awaiting his
return, Brahimi disappeared into talks with diplomats from the
United States, Russia and Portugal, the so-called ``troika'' of
states monitoring the peace process.
	   He was due to give a press conference on Wednesday before
leaving Angola for a tour of neighboring states whose leaders are
close to either Savimbi or Dos Santos.

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Tuesday urged the Palestinians to continue talks, saying Israel's
proposals over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal are
beneficial to both sides.
	   After a series of direct negotiations, the Palestinians on
Tuesday rejected an Israeli proposal to alter the size of a
withdrawal set out in an American peace plan. The Palestinians did
not schedule further talks.
	   The Palestinians had threatened to walk away from the sessions
if no acceptable ideas were presented at a meeting Monday between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
	   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was cautious Tuesday not to
rule out future meetings, saying the Palestinians were studying
whether to continue the talks.
	   The sides have been haggling over an American initiative that
calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but the United States failed to get
Israeli support for it, and sent the sides back to negotiate
directly a little over two weeks ago.
	   Netanyahu, however, said an agreement was still within reach.
	   ``I think there has been substantive discussions. There are some
ideas that the Palestinians have brought up, and we took a thread
or two and tried to weave them together to proposals of our own
which we presented yesterday,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israel wants to see ``an intensive, serious and discreet set of
negotiations for the completion of an agreement,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Arafat said the Israeli offer was ``very far'' from existing
Israel-Palestinian agreements or from the American plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel had offered to
withdraw from 10 percent of the West Bank and turn the remaining 3
percent into a nature reserve where Israel would retain overall
security control and the Palestinians would be forbidden to build.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   ``If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there is
no need for further meetings,'' Asfour said.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called Monday's
negotiating session ``a waste of time.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Three Swiss cyclists in the Festina
team expelled last month from the Tour de France made a low-key
return to the road Tuesday in the Cross-Lausanne event.
	   Spectators lining the streets of this lakeside city cheered Alex
Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, among 24 riders taking part
in the evening race.
	   The crowd was sparse at first but spilled into the streets for
the decisive second of two time trials over the 6.85 kilometer
(4.26 mile) course.
	   Fans cheered and clanged cowbells as the Festina riders set off
over the uphill route, some of it over the cobblestones of
Lausanne's old town.
	   Tour de France winner Marco Pantani of Italy, racing in a yellow
jersey, won both rounds. His overall time was 24 minutes 37
seconds, 1 minute 24 seconds ahead of Colorado's Bobby Julich, who
finished third in the Tour. Switzerland's Pascal Richard was third.	   Festina was thrown off the Tour because its riders were said to
have taken the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among
those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   ``I'm relieved, because I know now the public is behind me,''
Zuelle told reporters after Tuesday's first round.
	   Local rider Dufaux's name had been painted on the road at the
arrival, and banners along the route welcomed the Festina riders.
	   Dufaux finished fourth, Zuelle 11th and Meier 17th.
	   Lausanne is home to cycling's world body, the International
Cycling Union (UCI), and the International Olympic Committee. Both
have convened meetings this month to discuss the doping issue.

French, U.S. companies win natural gas contracts in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A consortium made up by Gaz de France, its
Mexican unit Mexigas and Mexican construction company Bufete
Industrial SA won bidding Tuesday to distribute natural gas in the
state of Mexico.
	   Similarly, Consorcio Energeticos de Mexico formed by Mexico's
Grupo Diavaz, Controladora Comercial e Industrial and U.S.-based
Lone Star Gas International, was awarded the contract to distribute
the fuel in Mexico City, also known as the Federal District.
	   The Mexican capital was divided into two zones for natural gas
distribution, the Federal District zone and the Cuautitlan-Texcoco
zone. The latter covers 28 suburban communities in the adjacent
state of Mexico.
	   Hector Olea, president of the Energy Regulatory Commission, said
Gaz de France won the concession in the Cuautitlan-Texcoco zone
with a bid of dlrs 1.088 per gigacalorie, to reach 374,698 users
after five years.
	   The Gaz de France consortium bid a maximum yield cap of dlrs
1.986 per gigacalorie for Mexico City so the permit was awarded to
the second lowest bid.
	   According to the regulations, bidders can only win one
distribution zone.
	   Olea said Consorcio Energeticos de Mexico bid a maximum yield
cap of dlrs 2.4233 per gigacalorie to reach 439,253 users after
five years.
	   Gas Natural Mexico, of Spain's Gas Natural SDG-Repsol, didn't
win any concession.
	   The permits carry a five-year exclusivity clause. The winners in
each zone will purchase existing distribution infrastructure in the
region owned by Diganamex, a subsidiary of the state monopoly
Petroleos Mexicanos.
	   Mexigas said its consortium plans to invest dlrs 1.2 billion
over the next 10 years in the state of Mexico distribution system.
Revenues from the distribution and marketing of gas in the area are
expected to exceed dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   Planned engineering, procurement and construction services will
total more than dlrs 400 million in the first five years.

Russian miners ease blockade of power plant in Far East
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 11th graf, `Coal miners ...,' to UPDATE
with blockaded coal beginning to burn; EDITS to trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With coal supplies dwindling, striking miners
eased their blockade Tuesday of the main power plant on the eastern
island of Sakhalin, agreeing to allow enough coal through to keep
the plant operational.
	   The miners, who are demanding eight months worth of overdue
wages, have been blocking railroad approaches to the plant for
nearly two weeks. They agreed that 25 cars carrying about 1,500
tons of coal could go to the plant daily, the ITAR-Tass and
Interfax news agencies reported.
	   But authorities will continue rationing electricity on the Far
Eastern island, the reports said. Homes and factories on Sakhalin
have been getting only between five and six hours of electricity a
day.
	   Sakhalin Deputy Gov. Ivan Malakhov called the protest a
``terrorist'' act, ITAR-Tass said. But his boss, Gov. Igor
Farkhutdinov, disputed the accusation and revoked an earlier threat
to use force to remove the miners.
	   ``It is not terrorism; it is an act of despair,'' Farkhutdinov
was quoted as saying.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin was quoted by Interfax as
saying he sympathized with the strikers, but police ``naturally
will act consistent with the law.''
	   Sakhalin is not connected to Russia's national power grid, so
much of the island is dependent on the plant for electricity. About
650,000 people live on the island.
	   The strike is one of many protests over unpaid wages in recent
months. The protests have been largely uncoordinated and in most
instances have inflicted only limited damage on the economy.
	   In other developments Tuesday:
	   _ Ambulance workers in the eastern port city of Vladivostok went
on strike to demand four months of back wages.
	   _ Coal miners in the Chelyabinsk region were blocking the
Argayashskaya power plant, which supplies energy to nuclear-waste
processing enterprise Mayak, the business daily Kommersant said.
Civil defense workers were sent to the region to ensure the safety
of nuclear storage sites, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   _ Also in Chelyabinsk, more than 200,000 tons of coal began to
smolder in scorching heat after being piled up near a blocked
railroad station at the town of Korkino, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   _ Miners in the Siberian coal center of Kemerovo lifted all
railroad blockades, allowing the traffic to pass unimpeded for the
first time in at least a month, ITAR-Tass said. Coal companies have
begun paying back wages after a government commission spent two
weeks negotiating with the miners.
	   _ In the coal-mining city of Vorkuta, a group of miners said
they would begin a sit-in demonstration in the central square
beginning Wednesday, ITAR-Tass said.
	   _ The union of Russian air traffic controllers said it would go
on strike Sunday to demand back wages and the resolution of various
other issues, Interfax reported.

Swiss cycling federation calls for single set of doping rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss cycling federation said
Tuesday it has called on the sport's international governing body
to recommend punishments against cyclists who take drugs.
	   Federation president Hugo Steinegger said it was unacceptable
that each national federation had to decide its own sanctions, and
said he expected clear guidelines from the UCI.
	   The call from the Swiss Cyclists and Motorcyclists Federation
comes as the International Cycling Union (UCI), the sport's world
body, prepares for a ``brainstorming conference'' this week between
its top officials, cyclists and team managers to examine the issue
of doping.
	   It comes in the wake of the drug scandals which dogged this
year's Tour de France, where the Festina team was expelled because
its riders were said to have taken the hormone EPO.
	   Swiss team members Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier
were among those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   Later Tuesday, Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier are expected to take
part in the Cross-Lausanne invitational event, their first race
since the Tour de France.

Saddam approves `measures' to shake off sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saddam approving steps; statement &QL;

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein Tuesday approved
``a series of measures'' aimed at shaking off U.N. sanctions
following the collapse of disarmament talks with weapons
inspectors, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The decision was taken at an emergency meeting of the powerful
Revolutionary Command Council and the ruling Baath party, chaired
by Saddam, the official news agency said.
	   ``The meeting adopted a series of measures that will be
announced soon,'' INA said without saying what those steps are
likely to be. It also said a national debate on confronting the
sanctions will begin immediately.
	   The developments came after chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard
Butler left Baghdad Tuesday, saying Iraq is refusing to conduct
further disarmament talks.
	   The Iraqi stand has thrown into uncertainty the future of the
U.N. program to eliminate Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction such
as biological and chemicals arms and long-range missiles.
	   INA said the Iraqi leadership will continue its meetings ``to
adopt further needed measures to protect Iraq's national interests
and put an end to the injustice imposed on it.''
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all its illegal weapons and has
nothing more to reveal. But until Butler's U.N. Special Commission,
a large group of international weapons experts, certifies that, the
Security Council cannot lift the sanctions.
	   UNSCOM has repeatedly said that Iraq still needs to disclose a
lot of information about its weaponry.
	   The widely disparate stands led to the collapse of Butler's
talks Monday with Iraq's chief negotiator, Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz.
	   Aziz demanded that UNSCOM give it a clean bill of health on its
weapons program.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler told The Associated Press in Bahrain,
where he arrived en route to New York. ``After I said that to him,
Aziz replied, `Then we can't talk any further,''' Butler said.
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a work schedule aimed at increasing the pace of
weapons inspection work.
	   ``The talks were getting nowhere,'' he told the AP.
	   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
which led to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin called
Iraq's refusal to hold more talks ``disturbing.''
	   Saddam has ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a chance
to end the sanctions, he said. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,'' he
said.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt UNSCOM's
seven-year search for the illegal weapons, a mission often
disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the next
step will be determined after Butler reports to the Council on
Thursday.
	   However, INA earlier quoted Butler as saying the problem has not
become a crisis. ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the
situation,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Still, experts think that the Iraq-U.N. relationship is heading
for trouble.
	   ``Confrontation is looming, definitely,'' Tim Trevan, who served
on the U.N. inspections team from 1992 to 1995, was quoted as
saying on BBC radio.
	   The previous crisis was over Iraq's refusal to allow weapons
inspectors into Saddam's palaces, bringing the country close to
being attacked by U.S. and British forces. Iraq relented in a Feb.
23 accord with Annan.
	   After that U.N.-Iraq disputes appeared to be easing until a U.S.
military lab reported in June that it found traces of deadly VX
nerve gas on fragments of Iraqi missile warheads it tested.
	   Iraq had claimed that although it developed VX it never put the
chemical on missiles.
	   Zlauvinen, Butler's adviser, said the discovery of VX opened key
issues while Iraq's biological weapons program continues to have
``many loopholes.''
	   ``It's still a big mess,'' he said.
	   The INA statement issued after the RCC meeting reiterated Iraq's
old accusation that Butler, an Australian, is a U.S. puppet.

Iran: New missile a tool to defend the Muslim world
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A new medium-range missile that Iran tested
last month is meant to defend the Muslim world and other oppressed
countries, a senior military commander said Tuesday.
	   Brig. Gen. Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf's comments are the first time
that Iran has indicated a religious motive for developing the
Shahab-3 missile, whose range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles) makes
it capable of hitting Israel and U.S. troops stationed in Saudi
Arabia.
	   Iran is staunchly opposed to any peace with Israel and calls for
its annihilation. It also backs guerrilla groups fighting Israeli
troops in South Lebanon.
	   In an interview with the official Islamic Republic News Agency,
Qalibaf said experience has shown that Muslims' pacifism has only
made enemies more aggressive. But he added that Iran does not seek
war and strengthening its defenses is only aimed at deterring
enemies.
	   Qalibaf is the commander of the air wing of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard Corps, a separate force in the military with a
strength of about 120,000 men.
	   Qalibaf said Shahab-3 is the product of an arms development
program that Iran began during the 1980-88 war with Iraq.
	   He rejected claims by the United States that Russia helped Iran
build the missile.
	   ``The West's sensationalism and propaganda ... come at a time
when the West possesses 95 percent of the enriched plutonium in the
world _ enough for producing 60,000 bombs and warheads,'' Qalibaf
said.
	   On Sunday, Qalibaf disclosed that the Shahab-3 ballistic missile
is 16 meters (53 feet) long and can travel at a speed of 7,000 kph
(4,320 mph) carrying a one-ton warhead. Its cruising altitude is
250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level.
	   The United States says Iran is working on a long-range missile
that could be deployed in two to five years, and has pledged to
redouble its efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs
to develop it.
	   But Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said Saturday that his
country is determined to continue strengthening its armed forces,
regardless of international concern.

	   _President Laurent Kabila: former Marxist and rebel leader who
swept to power last year after his forces toppled longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko. A member of the Luba tribe from Congo's Katanga
province, he relied heavily on armed support from Rwandan Tutsi
soldiers and Banyamulenge Tutsis for support during his rebel war
in 1997.
	   _Banyamulenge ethnic group: Congolese Tutsis based predominantly
in the country's east. Share close ties with Rwandan Tutsis and
played an important military role in Kabila's rebel victory over
Mobutu. Along with Rwandan troops, the Banyamulenge are the lead
players in the current uprising in Congo.
	   _Col. James Kabarere: A Rwandan Tutsi soldier who was recently
fired as Kabila's chief military commander. Known while working for
Kabila as James Kabari. Wields significant influence among Rwandan
troops who fought alongside Kabila and now are staging a rebellion
against his government. Was reportedly in eastern town of Bukavu
during uprising.
	   _Rwandan Tutsis: Ethnic group leading Rwanda's government.
Kabila last week ordered all Rwandan soldiers out of the country,
setting the stage for the latest rebellion.
	   _Rwandan Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame: born
in exile in Uganda. Joined rebel forces of current Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni, then left to join the rebel Rwandan
Patriotic Front. After the death of its founder, Kagame assumed
control and after the 1994 genocide, led rebel forces who overthrew
Rwanda's extremist Hutu government. Kagame is widely believed to be
responsible for masterminding the rebellion that put Kabila in
power in Congo.

Valerrama transfer on hold

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Carlos Valderrama remains in Miami for now, with a
deal to send the Colombian midfielder to New England apparently on
hold, if not dead.
	   Reports during the weekend said Miami was set to send Valderrama
to the Revolution for U.S. National team forward-midfielder Joe-Max
Moore, after Valderrama said he couldn't play for new Fusion coach
Ivo Wortmann.
	   ``The deal is pretty much a dead issue,'' Revolution general
manager Brian O'Donovan said Monday night. ``We were told by the
league that Valderrama made a decision to stay with Miami, and
we're pursuing other things.''
	   Major League Soccer deputy commissioner Sunil Gulati said the
deal was dead for now ``but it could be resurrected.''
	   Fusion owner Ken Horowitz said that although deal with the
Revolution was off, ``that doesn't mean there won't be a deal,''
possibly with another team.
	   Valderrama was expected to be at the Fusion's practice Tuesday,
team officials said.
	   Fusion midfielder Marcelo ``Popeye'' Herrera has left the team
to join Belgrano in Argentina's first division, which creates
another spot on the team's roster for a foreign player.
	   Evening out the foreign player-to-American player ratio was a
sticking point in the Valderrama deal, The Miami Herald reported.
Moore is American and each MLS team is only allowed five
foreigners.

Sunny day could see records fall at DN Galan, athletes say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ED McCULLOUGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A late afternoon breeze chased away
dark clouds and intermittent rain, raising athletes' hopes for
sunshine, fast times and possible world records at Wednesday's DN
Galan Grand Prix.
	   ``The hotter it is, the better I run,'' sprinter Ato Boldon of
Trinidad said at a Tuesday news conference. Last year, he won the
100- and 200-meter races in the meet at Stockholm's 1912 Olympic
Stadium.
	   ``It's going to be very fast, very fast,'' predicted Maurice
Greene of the United States. He finished second to his training
partner and friend, Boldon, in both events last year. ``He got
lucky,'' Greene said with a laugh.
	   This year's field once again is crowded with champions in their
prime, aging record holders and rising stars, each dreaming of
breakthrough performances.
	   ``When I put the spikes on my feet and step on the track ... I
know I am very fast ... and I don't worry about anyone else,'' said
Algeria's Noureddine Morceli, the world record holder and Olympic
gold medalist in the mile.
	   Wilson Boit Kipketer of Kenya said, ``I feel in my mind that I
can run a sub 8-minute'' time in the 3,000-meter steeplechase.
	   While several seconds off the world record of 7:55.72, that
still would be the best time ever in the stadium, where 83 world
records have been set _ more than at any other.
	   Some of the dozens of athletes competing in 18 events have had
their best moments at Olympic Stadium. Javelin thrower Steve
Backley of Great Britain had a world record throw in 1990.
	   He was a teen-ager then and ``throwing came easily,'' he
recalled. Then came the injuries, and training and competitions
became more like work than fun.
	   Still, nearly a decade later, ``I'm probably better now than I
was then, and I'm throwing further,'' Backley said. He'd like to
add an Olympic gold medal to the silver (1996) and bronze (1992)
already in his collection.
	   ``That's the one that's missing,'' he said. ``It's always the
medals that count, if you ask the athletes.''
	   Another veteran, sprinter Merlene Ottey of Jamaica, got a little
testy when asked, yet again, whether she's finally contemplating
retirement.
	   ``I was ranked No. 2 in the world last year, so that wasn't a
good reason to quit,'' she snapped, adding she feels energized by
competition from America's Marion Jones, top ranked last year in
the 100 meters.
	   ``Marion, running well, brings out the best in me,'' said Ottey,
37, who is posting faster times these days than when she swept
first place in each of her two previous entries in the DN Galan,
way back in 1989 and 1991.

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Three Swiss cyclists in the Festina
team expelled last month from the Tour de France made a low-key
return to the road Tuesday in the Cross-Lausanne event.
	   Spectators lining the streets of this lakeside city cheered Alex
Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and Armin Meier, among 24 riders taking part
in the evening race.
	   The crowd was sparse at first but spilled into the streets for
the decisive second of two time trials over the 6.85 kilometer
(4.26 mile) course.
	   Fans cheered and clanged cowbells as the Festina riders set off
over the uphill route, some of it over the cobblestones of
Lausanne's old town.
	   Tour de France winner Marco Pantani of Italy, racing in a yellow
jersey, won both rounds. His overall time was 24 minutes 37
seconds, 1 minute 24 seconds ahead of Colorado's Bobby Julich, who
finished third in the Tour. Switzerland's Pascal Richard was third.
	   Festina was thrown off the Tour because its riders were said to
have taken the hormone EPO. Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were among
those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   ``I'm relieved, because I know now the public is behind me,''
Zuelle told reporters after Tuesday's first round.
	   Local rider Dufaux's name had been painted on the road at the
arrival, and banners along the route welcomed the Festina riders.
	   Dufaux finished fourth, Zuelle 11th and Meier 17th.
	   Lausanne is home to cycling's world body, the International
Cycling Union (UCI), and the International Olympic Committee. Both
have convened meetings this month to discuss the doping issue.

 &UR; Netanyahu says Israel following events in Iraq closely

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday
that Israel is closely monitoring events in Iraq which announced it
was cutting off talks with the United Nations over weapons
inspections.
	   ``The entire world is worried about this question,'' Netanyahu
told reporters. ``We, like everyone else, are watching this thing
carefully and we know what to do.''
	   Until the U.N. Special Commission certifies that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not
lift economic sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which led to the Persian Gulf War.
	   Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israel
during the 1991 war.
	   In February a wave of panic swept the Israeli public when the
chief U.N. weapons inspector said that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
could wipe out Tel Aviv with biological weapons.
	   A recent missile test by Iran has also received prominent media
coverage in Israel. At a meeting of the Israeli legislature's
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, Netanyahu revealed new
information about the Shahab-3 missile, which is capable of
reaching Israel, Israel TV reported.
	   According to the report, Netanyahu said the missile can propel
itself for 100 seconds before its motor burns out and that Iran is
planning to assemble a fleet of the missiles.

<TEXT>
	   QIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After camping for days in a valley with
meager water and food, more than 1,000 ethnic Albanians got help
Tuesday from aid workers at last permitted by Serb police to enter
the area.
	   Dozens of refugees swarmed a truck loaded with boxes of infant
medicine and food and hygiene products such as toothpaste, soap and
shampoo. Many people here have been subsisting on a diet of water
and green peppers, and it was unclear when aid workers could bring
in a convoy of more nourishing food.
	   Serb police have been barring or slwoing aid groups and
diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands of refugees
driven from villages in Kosovo, where ethnic Alnbanian rebels are
fighting for independence.
	   While the International Committee of the Red Cross reached the
valley near Qirez, fighting in the area stymied plans by the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees to send an aid convoy to Malisevo --
a former Kosovo Liberation Army which fell to the Serbs in the
current offensive.
	   ``We cannot go into a battlefield,'' agency spokesman Kris
Janowski said in Geneva. He compared the situation in Kosovo to
what happened in 1992 in Bosnia, when Bosnian Serb forces embarked
on a policy of trying to empty areas of their non-Serb populations.
	   ``If this is an attempt to drive Kosovo Albanians out of
Kosovo...that would be total lunacy,'' Janowski said.
	   The refugee-filled valley is in the Drenica region, the target
of a Serb onslaught against the rebels now in its ninth day. Serb
forces are showing no signs of relenting in their offensive against
the KLA, despite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's promise
last week to stop.
	   Drenica, historically a center of ethnic Albanian nationalism,
is the largest area still under KLA control. From the hilltops,
smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages -- including Lausa,
now overrun by Serb police in a symbolic defeat for the KLA.
	   Last November, the secretive rebel group made its first public
appearance in the village. Wearing their uniform of camouflage or
all-black, berets with the red KLA patch, fighters attended the
funeral of a local schoolteacher shot in a Serb crackdown.
	   One man from Lausa, Gani Gecha, said Tuesday that Serb
helicopters sprayed the village with a chemical substance that
burned peoples' eyes and throats and made them nauseous, he said.
	   Cecha claimed Serb forces killed or kidnapped between 100 to 200
people in the Lausa attack, firing missiles and burning houses. The
KLA ``tried to defend the village but it was too hard,'' he said,
explaining that rebels have only automatic rifles that cannot match
the Serb arsenal.
	   Milosevic sent forces to crush the KLA in March. The province,
located in the Serb republic that dominates Yugoslavia, has a 2
million population of which Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   After declaring the province on the verge of humanitarian
catastrophe, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill on Tuesday visited a town
captured by Serbs last week to assess the conditions for the return
of refugees.
	   ``Some people have begin to return, but if we are going to have
more people returning, we have to improve the conditions very
quickly,'' he said after his trip to Orahovac, the site of some of
the ugliest fighting in the five-month war.
	   Veton Suroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician, claimed
Tuesday that at least 200 people were killed in Orahovac, most of
them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people, including
children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the area after no one
claimed them after more than a week.
	   Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who meet with Hill on
Tuesday, blamed the Serbs for worsening the problem in Kosovo and
demanded ``energetic intervention'' by the United States and its
allies.
	   In Washington on Monday, the Clinton Administration announced
that NATO had approved a plan to use firepower against Serb forces
in Kosovo because of the worsening refugee crisis.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
the ethnic war in Bosnia in 1995. But officials at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, said there was no military
action planned at this stage for Kosovo.

Taliban readies for attack on opposition stronghold

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army said they
launched a preemptive strike Tuesday capturing a town from
Afghanistan's opposition in preparation for an advance on the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said his fighters took the
town of Saripul, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of
Mazar-e-Sharif, after a one-hour battle Tuesday. Taliban radio
later reported its troops were in full control of the surrounding
province, also called Saripul.
	   Muttayn said the opposition, which had retreated a few
kilometers (miles) south to Saripul after losing their stronghold
of Shebergan on Sunday, had been re-grouping for a counterattack.
	   The reported Taliban victory headed-off the counterattack, which
could have slowed its march on Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the
opposition's few remaining strongholds.
	   The Taliban already control most of Afghanistan and appear
poised to take the rest of the country. Their leaders have imposed
a strict version of Islamic law in territory they control. Since
capturing the Afghan capital, Kabul, in 1996, Taliban officials
have barred girls from school and confined most women to their
homes.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is made up mostly of Afghanistan's
religious and ethnic minorities. The factions occasionally turn on
each other, weakening their ability to fight the Taliban.
	   The Red Cross evacuated the last eight foreign aid workers from
Mazar-e-Sharif to neighboring Pakistan Tuesday, fearing a repeat of
the street fighting and looting that erupted last year when the
Taliban briefly held the city. Hundreds of residents were
reportedly fleeing the city.
	   Most international organizations had pulled their workers out of
Mazar-e-Sharif last year.
	   Taliban troops engaged in minor skirmishes Tuesday as they
advanced to 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Mazar-e-Sharif,
according to both the Taliban and an opposition source in
Mazar-e-Sharif who refused to give his name.
	   Muttayn said the Taliban was now pausing to build bunkers and
take other measures to shore up defenses. It was unclear when it
would attempt to capture Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Taliban radio reported late Monday that Taliban fighters were
also east of Mazar-e-Sharif _ just 40 kilometers (25 miles) away,
within rocket range of the airport.
	   The opposition source said local residents were revolting
against warlord Rashid Dostum, a leader in the fractious
anti-Taliban coalition, allowing the Taliban to advance.
	   Dostum's whereabouts were unclear Tuesday.

UN peace envoy meets UNITA leader Savimbi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ A senior U.N. envoy met with Angolan rebel
chief Jonas Savimbi Tuesday, on the fifth day of an emergency
mission to avert a return to civil war.
	   Lakdhar Brahimi refused to comment on his talks with Savimbi _
the leader of the UNITA rebel movement.
	   UNITA fought a two-decade civil war against the government of
the former Portuguese colony before a U.N.-brokered peace agreement
in 1994 brought a tenuous halt to the fighting.
	   Brahimi's arrival in Angola last Friday was prompted by signs
that the peace process was close to collapse.
	   UNITA's refusal to give up its rural strongholds in compliance
with the 1994 accord was at the heart of Tuesday's conversation,
UNITA spokesman Horacio Junjuvili said.
	   Savimbi ``reiterated UNITA's position that we will only abandon
the sensitive areas when our political space is guaranteed,''
Junjuvili said.
	   On Monday, President Jose Eduardo dos Santos assured Brahimi
that his government was committed to the full implementation of the
1994 accord and blamed UNITA for the rising tension.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and Romania agreed Tuesday to establish
a joint parliamentary forum to resolve a dispute over the return of
Jewish property seized after World War II, Israeli lawmakers said.
	   The decision was taken by visiting Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and Israeli lawmakers who agreed to a forum for dialogue
between their respective parliaments until a solution can be found,
Israeli legislator Avraham Poraz said.
	   Poraz described the meeting with Vasile as ``heated,'' and
Israel Radio reported after a state dinner Tuesday night that
Vasile was angered by the way he was pressured at the meeting.

East Timor talks begin at United Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan launched
talks on the troubled territory of East Timor on Tuesday, meeting
with the foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia.
	   U.N. special envoy for East Timor Jamsheed Marker is chairing
talks this week aimed at brokering a peace deal for East Timor,
ruled by Portugal for centuries before Indonesia invaded in 1975.
	   Marker, who has spent years searching for a peace deal, helped
prepare a U.N. working paper which cites promises for reform by
President B.J. Habibie as reason for optimism.
	   In a gesture of good will, Habibie withdrew about 400 of 12,000
Indonesian troops from the territory last week. Another 600 are
scheduled to leave this month.
	   Discussion at this week's meeting is expected to be dominated by
an offer from Habibie to grant a form of autonomy, but not outright
independence, to East Timor, a half-island territory about 2,000
kilometers (1,200 miles) east of Jakarta.

Italy, Argentina claim final two quarterfinal places
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with United States beating Australia 96-78; Yugoslavia
beats Greece; ADDS quarterfinal pairings &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Italy and Argentina snatched the final
quarterfinal berths Tuesday, leaving the wide-open, starless World
Championship adrift without a clear favorite as it heads toward
Sunday's final.
	   The rag-tag Americans, playing their best game of the week-old
tournament, kept Australia from reaching Friday's final eight with
a 96-78 victory, which gave the berth to Argentina _ an 86-76
winner over Brazil.
	   The Americans demoralized the Aussies in the first half with hot
shooting _ just under 60 percent from the field _ and a stiff
man-to-man that forced turnovers and got the Americans running.
	   Jimmy Oliver led the U.S. attack with 18 and Jason Sasser added
15 with 10 of the 12 Americans getting on the scoreboard.
	   Australia _ silver medalists last month in the Goodwill Games _
was led by Shane Heal with 31.
	   Italy beat Puerto Rico 68-63 with the other quarterfinal place
on the line as Gregor Fucka hit 15 and scored the last five points
with a slam dunk, a layup and a free throw.
	   In Argentina's critical victory, Marcelo Nicola hit 22 and
Fabricio Oberto added 21. Brazil got 22 from Marco Aurelio Pegolo
and 20 from Joao Jose Vianna.
	   Friday's quarterfinals stack up this way as the top four teams
in each group advanced: United States (5-1) vs. Italy (3-3), Spain
(5-1) vs. Greece (4-2), Lithuania (4-2) vs. Russia (5-1), Argentina
(3-3) vs. Yugoslavia (5-1).
	   Though a quarterfinal place had already been won, the win over
Australia assured the U.S. of facing Italy and not a more highly
regarded team.
	   Under the complicated system to pair teams for the
quarterfinals, a U.S. loss could have pitted them against
Yugoslavia or Russia _ perhaps the two favorites. Every other team
faced similar last-minute twists.
	   Spain defeated Lithuania 86-80 in overtime and Russia won over
Canada 81-72 to pick up key victories as the second round ended.
	   Spain, the surprise team of the worlds, hasn't won a medal in a
major tournament in seven years _ bronze in the '91 Europeans _ and
has hardly been heard from since it shocked itself with silver in
the 1984 Olympics.
	   Forward Alberto Herreros, the leading scorer in the tournament,
had 27 and Alfonso Reyes added 19. Arturas Karnisovas, playing with
a bandaged head after a second-half collision with a Spain's
Ignacio de Miguel that drew blood, led Lithuania (4-2) with 20. But
he was scoreless in the last 11 minutes.
	   ``I think that (injury) hurt him at the end of the game,'' said
Lithuanaia coach Jonas Kazlauskas.
	   ``This has shown our basketball is decent and we're
competitive,'' said coach Lolo Sainz, who is in the first phase of
rebuilding and is expected in the next few years to dip heavily
into a rich pool of young talent.
	   ``We're not afraid of anybody,'' he added.
	   Yugoslavia, after losing Monday to Italy 61-60, dumped home-team
Greece 70-56 with 19 points for Dejan Bodiroga. Fragiskos Alvertis
led Greece with 23 as the local team dropped its second straight
game after losing Monday to Russia.
	   Russia _ billed as the favorite with Yugoslavia to win the title
Sunday _ was topped by Vassiliy Karassev with 21 points and Sergei
Babkov and Sergei Panov with 14. Canada (1-5) got 14 points and 11
rebounds from Greg Newton.
	   Italy, leading at halftime 34-31, was led by Gregor Fucka who
finished with 15 and scored the last five points of the game on a
layup, free throw and a dunk. Jose Ortiz had 21 points and 14
rebounds for the Puerto Ricans (2-4).
	   ``It would be a dream to be in the semifinals or the finals, but
right now we just have to concentrate on our next opponents,'' said
Italian center Giacomo Galanda.

Moroccan facing police questioning jumps out of courthouse window
</HEADLINE>
in Spain

<TEXT>
	   ALGECIRAS, Spain (AP) _ A young Moroccan awaiting questioning
over drugs found in a small, crowded boat in which he tried to
sneak into Spain jumped out of a courthouse window on Tuesday,
suffering serious injuries.
	   The Civil Guard in this southern port said the man fell 10
meters (33 feet) and landed on a staircase. He was rushed to
hospital in serious condition. A spokesman refused to detail the
injuries or give the man's name or age.
	   He was picked up Monday in a small boat that crossed the Strait
of Gibraltar from Morocco with 30 men aboard. Police found 10 kilos
(22 pounds) of hashish in it.
	   In another boat police picked up 25 men and two women, all of
them would-be immigrants. Both boats were intercepted just off the
southern coast of Spain.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, thousands of people attempt each year
to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa and slip into
Europe. Almost all of them are men, and most are from Morocco.
	   Some 20 would-be immigrants are believed to have drowned when
their boat overturned close to the Spanish coast last week.
	   Those caught in Spain or trying to make the crossing are
repatriated.

Searchers for Amber Room find cache of metal buried in seabed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Searchers for the Amber Room, a
long-lost Russian treasure, were investigating a cache of metal
buried in the seabed off Lithuania's coast on Tuesday.
	   A crew of German treasure hunters has been combing a beach near
the town of Preila for months in hopes of discovering the czarist
Russia treasure, which disappeared during World War II.
	   The searchers this week detected a large amount of metal buried
about 20 meters (65 feet) offshore. On Tuesday, they were building
a watertight enclosure at the site to help with the search.
	   The Amber Room, a series of ornate panels, were a gift to
Russia's Peter the Great from Prussian Emperor Friedrich Wilhelm I.
	   The Nazis took the panels from Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, in
1941 and the German government claims they were destroyed during
the 1945 Soviet invasion of Konigsberg, now the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad. Moscow has long insisted that the Nazis hid the
treasure.
	   The treasure hunters have been following leads provided by an
80-year-old former area resident who says he saw Nazi officers
carrying mysterious boxes off a warship in 1944 and then burying
them along the shore near his home.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Estelle weakened from hurricane to tropical
storm status Tuesday, churning maximum winds of 65 mph (105 kph) as
it moved farther out into the Pacific.
	   Estelle's maximum sustained winds fell below the hurricane
threshold of 74 mph (119 kph) overnight, the U.S. Hurricane Center
in Miami reported.
	   The storm was located about 1,300 miles (2,100 kilometers)
west-southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula on
Tuesday and moving to the west at 14 mph (22 kph), the center said.
	   Estelle was expected to continue weakening as it moved over
cooler waters.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An opposition party took to the streets of
Mexico City on Tuesday to whip up resistance to a dlrs 65 billion
bank bailout program whose beneficiaries allegedly include bankers,
corporations and rich businessmen.
	   The campaign of leafleting and a symbolic ``crucifixion'' of
bank debtors in the city's main square came hours after the
Democratic Revolution Party released a list of businesses whose
multimillion-dollar loans were paid off by the government under the
bailout.
	   The list contained few surprises _ many of the insolvent Mexican
companies listed have already taken over by the government _ but
still stirred outrage at the huge amounts of the loans in the
program, known as Fobaproa.
	   Fobaproa's directors said that the released list was not
accurate and insisted that the fund was not meant to benefit the
rich, but rather to protect the savers.
	   The Fobaproa program bought up loans from failing Mexican banks
in the wake of the 1994 peso devaluation, which forced many debtors
into arrears.
	   However, critics say that besides the genuinely bad loans, there
are many cases of bank fraud, insider-lending by bank officers, and
millionaires and companies who simply decided not to pay back money
they borrowed.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY (AP) _ A moderate earthquake rattled the border
region between Panama and Costa Rica, causing minor damage but no
injuries, officials said Tuesday.
	   The 5.0-magnitude quake occurred Monday night and was centered
50 kms (30 miles) west of Puerto Armuelles, a Panamanian town near
the border, the University of Panama reported.
	   The temblor caused minor damage to aqueducts in Puerte
Armuelles, authorities reported.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ U.S. entrepreneurs hoping to make investment
contacts in Cuba will meet Cuban businessmen in Mexico and on the
communist island next month, the Prensa Latina news agency reported
Tuesday.
	   Kirby Jones, an American who organized a similar conference in
March, said the upcoming meeting will give delegates an opportunity
to speak directly with high-level Cuban authorities and
representatives of the private sector, the government news agency
said, citing a report by Cuba's Radio Reloj.
	   Jones said businessmen from French, Israeli and U.S. companies
will attend the conference, which starts Sept. 9 in the Mexican
resort of Cancun and conclude two days later in Havana, according
to the report monitored in Mexico City.
	   In March, more than 50 U.S. business people participated in a
weekend conference carefully designed to keep them from violating
the 37-year-old U.S. economic embargo which bans them from spending
money in the communist island.
	   ___
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ President Hugo Banzer replaced his
finance and housing ministers Tuesday.
	   Finance Minister Herbert Muller replaced Edgar Millares, who
resigned for personal reasons.
	   The new Housing Minister Amparo Ballivian, a former World Bank
Employee, replaced Javier Escobar, who resigned after his
Conscience of Nationhood party was thrown out of the ruling
government coalition Monday.
	   The cabinet shuffle took place two days before Banzer celebrates
his first year in office.
	   Muller, an energy minister from 1989 to 1993, was a Bolivian
representative for the Argentine energy company YPF. Ballivian had
been under-secretary of foreign commerce until Tuesday's
appointment.

O'Brien drops Kuerten at du Maurier

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alex O'Brien, who qualified for the main draw
when Thomas Enqvist withdrew, upset Gustavo Kuerten 6-3, 7-6 (7-2)
Tuesday at the dlrs 2.4 million du Maurier Open.
	   O'Brien had to retire during qualifying Sunday because of
cramps. But when Enqvist, the No. 12 seed pulled out, O'Brien made
the field as the top-ranked qualifying loser.
	   ``I was so nervous (in qualifying) that I couldn't hit a ball on
the court,'' O'Brien said. ``I guess I have some mental troubles,
my mind is not too clear.
	   ``But I had an extra day and all I did was relax and sleep in
late and that seemed to help.''
	   Against Kuerten, the No. 12 seed and 1997 French Open champion,
O'Brien showed a strong serve-and-volley game.
	   ``I was thinking I was going to be on TV, I could go out there
and make a complete ass of myself and lose 6-0, 6-0,'' O'Brien
said. ``But maybe that helped me relax a little because when you
think about the worst thing that could happen to you, really, the
bottom line is it's not that bad.''
	   In 1997, O'Brien rose to No. 30 in the ATP rankings, a jump of
172 spots. He has since slid to No. 147.
	   ``The greatest feeling for a tennis player is to win,'' he said.
``The mind is 95 percent of this game and if I can keep it clear
and focused then I can win some matches.''
	   Kuerten's head was never in the game.
	   ``I've played too many tournaments,'' he said. ``I wasn't too
motivated to play and I'm a little bit tired. I didn't even see
what he was doing, what I was doing.''
	   In other matches, No. 9 seed Alberto Costa of Spain defeated
Australia's Jason Stoltenberg 7-5, 6-4 and No. 15 Fabrice Santoro
of France downed Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-4.
	   No. 16 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa retired five games into
his match with Australia's Michael Tebbutt because of a groin
injury.
	   Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev withdrew with the flu before his match
with France's Guillaume Raoux. He was replaced by Finnish qualifier
Tuomas Ketola, who lost 7-5, 6-3.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Bidding a violent farewell to outgoing
President Ernesto Samper, Colombians rebels have killed at least 40
people this week in a show of strength ahead of peace talks with
his successor, authorities said.
	   The attacks by the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia and the National Liberation Army killed at least 17 police
officers and 23 army soldiers and civilians in attacks in nearly
half of the country's 32 provinces, said police operations chief
General Alfredo Salgado. He said more than 30 guerrillas died in
the fighting, which also at least 48 police and 30 army soldiers
wounded.
	   He said seven soldiers died in a rebel attack on a hydroelectric
plant near Medellin, the country's second largest city, and an
attack on a police anti-narcotics base in southern Guaviare
province killed six police officers and three army soldiers.

	   QIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian refugees swarmed a
truck laden with food, infant formula and medicine Tuesday,
desperately seeking help after Serb police permitted aid workers
into a besieged valley in Kosovo.
	   Serb police have been barring or slowing aid groups and
diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands of refugees
driven from villages in the Yugoslav province, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   The International Committee of the Red Cross reached the valley
near Qirez, but fighting stymied plans by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees to send an aid convoy to Malisevo _ a
former Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that fell to the Serbs in
the current offensive.
	   ``We cannot go into a battlefield,'' refugee agency spokesman
Kris Janowski said in Geneva. He compared the situation in Kosovo
to what happened in 1992 in Bosnia, when Bosnian Serb forces
embarked on a policy of trying to empty areas of their non-Serb
populations.
	   ``If this is an attempt to drive Kosovo Albanians out of Kosovo
... that would be total lunacy,'' Janowski said.
	   Qirez _ a village located about 14 miles (22 kilometers)
northwest of the regional capital of Pristina _ is in a
refugee-filled valley in the western Kosovo region of Drenica. The
region is the target of a Serb onslaught against the rebels that is
now in its ninth day. Serb forces are showing no signs of
relenting, despite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's promise
last week to stop.
	   In Washington on Monday, the United States announced that NATO
had approved a plan to use firepower against Serb forces in Kosovo
because of the worsening refugee crisis.
	   NATO bombardment helped drive Milosevic into negotiations to end
the ethnic war in Bosnia in 1995. But officials at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, said there was no military
action planned at this stage for Kosovo.
	   When aid workers arrived Tuesday in Qirez, they found hundreds
of desperate people. Refugees crowded around a truck loaded with
boxes of infant medicine and food and hygiene products such as
toothpaste, soap and shampoo. Many people here have been subsisting
on a diet of water and green peppers.
	   Drenica, historically a center of ethnic Albanian nationalism,
is the largest area still under KLA control. From the hilltops,
smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages _ including the
former stronghold of Lausa _ now overrun by Serb police in a
symbolic defeat for the KLA.
	   Last November, the secretive rebel group made its first public
appearance in the village. Wearing their uniform of camouflage or
all-black and berets with the red KLA patch, fighters attended the
funeral of a local schoolteacher shot in a Serb crackdown.
	   One man from Lausa, Gani Gecha, said Tuesday that Serb
helicopters sprayed the village with a chemical substance that
burned people's eyes and throats and made them nauseous.
	   Gecha claimed Serb forces killed or kidnapped 100 to 200 people
in the Lausa attack, firing missiles and burning houses. The KLA
``tried to defend the village but it was too hard,'' he said,
explaining that rebels have only automatic rifles that cannot match
the Serb arsenal.
	   Milosevic sent forces to crush the KLA in March. Kosovo, located
in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, has a population of
2 million. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   After declaring the province on the verge of humanitarian
catastrophe, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill on Tuesday visited a town
captured by Serbs last week to assess the conditions for the return
of refugees.
	   ``Some people have begun to return, but if we are going to have
more people returning, we have to improve the conditions very
quickly,'' he said after his trip to Orahovac, the site of some of
the ugliest fighting in the five-month war.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician, claimed
Tuesday that at least 200 people were killed in Orahovac, most of
them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people, including
children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the area after no one
claimed them after more than a week.
	   Moderate Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, who met with Hill on
Tuesday, blamed the Serbs for worsening the problem in Kosovo and
demanded ``energetic intervention'' by the United States and its
allies.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Eastern Europe is sizzling from a
three-week heat wave that has reportedly claimed at least 20 lives
in Romania, buckled streetcar tracks in Hungary and smashed
temperature records across the region.
	   Temperatures soared past 40 C (104 F) again Tuesday in the
southern Balkans region, suffering through its worst heat wave in
half a century.
	   How hot is it?
	   So hot that Serb forces in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province
are heating their baked beans by setting the cans on the fiery
metal surface of armored personnel carriers.
	   So hot that prison convicts in the Romanian town of Braila
refused to work Tuesday, citing a 1986 order that gives them a
reprieve when temperatures top 35C (95 F).
	   And so hot that in Hungary, they're all screaming for
``fagylalt'' _ ice cream _ in record numbers. The country's largest
ice-cream producer, Schoeller Budatej, has boosted production to
three shifts to meet the demand, said the MTI news agency.
	   In Bucharest, Romania, where the mercury has hit at least 36 C
(97 F) every day since the first half of July, some 2,500 people
have called the capital's emergency services in the past four days
and 15 ambulances are on heat patrol.
	   Hospitals in the city of 3 million said they are crowded with
people who suffered strokes, heart attacks, sunstroke or have
fainted in the scorching heat.
	   Residents are plunging into the city's fountains, the dirty
Dambovita River and lakes to keep cool.
	   Bucharest's mayor, Viorel Lis, is sending the city hall staff
home at lunch time every day to avoid any heat-related accidents,
and has urged other employers to do the same.
	   Wheat and corn and sunflowers around the capital have been
burned by the heat.
	   In Italy, weeks of temperatures above 32 C (90 F) have sparked a
run on air conditioners, with buyers apparently ignoring beliefs
held by many Italians that the appliances cause such ailments as
sore throats and stiff joints.
	   ``When I made my 84-year-old grandmother let me install air
conditioning for her, she made such a fuss about how bad it was,''
said Franco Consumati, who installs the units for the Rome store
GMC. ``Now she gets mad at me if I don't go over to check it on the
first hot day.''

Citibank pays dlrs 195 million for Confia purchase in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Citibank has paid about dlrs 195 million to
Mexico's bank savings protection fund for a local bank, Confia SA,
a Citibank official said Tuesday.
	   Madeleine Girot, a spokeswoman for Citibank Mexico, said the
payment was made on Friday to the fund known as Fobaproa.
	   The government awarded Citibank rights to purchase Confia in
August 1997 after federal regulators stepped in when the bank's
previous owners were unable to meet capital requirements.
	   Confia's network of 200 branches is expected to be merged into
Citibank in the next three to five years. The U.S. bank assumed
management control of Confia in mid-May.

Caribbean Community secretary-general praises Castro visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Edwin Carrington, the
secretary-general of the Caribbean Community trade bloc, on Tuesday
praised Fidel Castro's tour of the region as a ``healthy'' move
toward closer relations with Cuba.
	   ``I think it is a very important initiative by the Cuban leader
and a very timely initiative by the Community to have him visit the
member states,'' Carrington said.
	   Castro ended a six-day tour of Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada on
Monday. During rallies, he urged Caribbean countries to oppose the
U.S. embargo of the communist island and promised to broaden trade
and economic development ties in the region.
	   Carrington said the visit would bolster support within the
Caribbean Community for Cuban membership in the African, Pacific
and Caribbean States, a group of former European colonies that
receive trade perks from the European Union.
	   ``We have supported the (ACP) application very strongly and we
are extremely pleased to see efforts being made to bring Cuba
closer to the rest of the Caribbean countries,'' Carrington said.
``I could think of nothing more healthy and helpful at this time
for the development of Caribbean relationships.''
	   Cuba, a former Spanish colony, is eager to win European trade
protections for its citrus exports.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Tuesday urged the Palestinians to continue talks, saying Israel's
proposals over the scope of a West Bank troop withdrawal are
beneficial to both sides.
	   After a series of direct negotiations, the Palestinians on
Tuesday rejected an Israeli proposal to alter the size of a
withdrawal set out in an American peace plan. The Palestinians did
not schedule further talks.
	   The Palestinians had threatened to walk away from the sessions
if no acceptable ideas were presented at a meeting Monday between
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.
	   But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was cautious Tuesday not to
rule out future meetings, saying the Palestinians were studying
whether to continue the talks.
	   The sides have been haggling over an American initiative that
calls for Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians accepted the plan but the United States failed to get
Israeli support for it, and sent the sides back to negotiate
directly a little over two weeks ago.
	   Netanyahu, however, said an agreement was still within reach.
	   ``I think there has been substantive discussions. There are some
ideas that the Palestinians have brought up, and we took a thread
or two and tried to weave them together to proposals of our own
which we presented yesterday,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Israel wants to see ``an intensive, serious and discreet set of
negotiations for the completion of an agreement,'' Netanyahu said.
	   But Arafat said the Israeli offer was ``very far'' from existing
Israel-Palestinian agreements or from the American plan.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said Israel had offered to
withdraw from 10 percent of the West Bank and turn the remaining 3
percent into a nature reserve where Israel would retain overall
security control and the Palestinians would be forbidden to build.
	   ``This is rejected by the Palestinians,'' Asfour said. ``Our
position is clear: We were presented with an American proposal in
March, and that is what we stand by.''
	   ``If the Israeli proposals stay along this line, then there is
no need for further meetings,'' Asfour said.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, called Monday's
negotiating session ``a waste of time.''
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said
Monday that the administration was still hopeful the sides would
continue talks.
	   Elsewhere, two Jewish settlers were shot and wounded while
patrolling their West Bank settlement of Itzhar early Wednesday,
Israeli settlers said.
	   Settler spokesman Ahron Dombe said the two settlers were in
serious condition. The Israeli army said it was checking the
report.
	   Itzhar is located 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the
Palestinian-run city of Nablus, West Bank.

Saddam approves `measures' to shake off sanctions

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Just hours after the chief U.N. inspector
left Baghdad in a dispute over arms talks, President Saddam Hussein
approved a plan Tuesday that Iraq hopes will end crippling economic
sanctions.
	   Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission, left Iraq
on Tuesday, saying the government was refusing further disarmament
talks _ throwing into uncertainty the future of the U.N. program to
eliminate Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction.
	   The Iraqi News Agency reported that Saddam, during a meeting of
his top advisers, approved measures aimed at ending the sanctions.
INA said the measures would be announced soon but did not say what
they were.
	   Butler said the impasse stemmed from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz's demand that Iraq be given a clean bill of health on its
weaponry.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route
to New York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we
can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler said he would brief the U.N. Security Council about the
impasse on Thursday.
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a proposal to speed up the pace of weapons
inspections. ``The talks were getting nowhere,'' he said.
	   Zlauvinen said much more work must be done to get a clearer
picture of Iraq's weapons capability.
	   Until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of weapons of
mass destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led
to the Gulf War.
	   In Washington, White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said Saddam
should not hope for an end to the sanctions until Iraq complies
with its obligations.
	   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Saddam had ``shot
himself in the foot'' by mishandling a chance to end economic
sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,'' Rubin said.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt the U.N.
commission's seven-year search for the illegal weapons, a mission
often disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the next
step could be determined only after Butler's report to the Security
Council.
	   Iraq's charge d'affaires at the United Nations, Said Hasan, said
it would be impossible to follow the proposed accelerated schedule
now that talks have broken down.
	   However, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Butler as saying before he
departed that the impasse should not be blown out of proportion.
	   ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the situation,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word crisis.''
	   Still, experts believe the Iraq-U.N. relationship can only
suffer.
	   ``Confrontation is looming, definitely,'' Tim Trevan, who served
on the U.N. inspection team from 1992 to 1995, said on BBC radio.
	   ``My concern is perhaps that the will of the international
community has dissipated,'' he said.
	   It was unclear if the impasse would trigger another military
crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain sent
warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential sites
to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused in February by an agreement brokered by
Annan.
	   U.N.-Iraq disputes appeared to be easing until a U.S. military
lab reported in June that it found traces of deadly VX nerve gas on
fragments of Iraqi missile warheads it tested.
	   Iraq had claimed it developed VX but never put the chemical on
missiles.
	   Zlauvinen, Butler's adviser, said Iraq's biological weapons
program also has ``many loopholes.''
	   ``It's still a big mess,'' he said.
	   Last month, Saddam said in a nationally televised speech that
the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set
a deadline.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ As Adriana Duffy steers her wheelchair
through the lunchtime business crowd, she passes a health club
filled with young stockbrokers riding stationary bikes.
	   That once was a numbingly routine activity for her. Now it's
impossible.
	   At the 1989 World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart,
Germany, Duffy was competing for Puerto Rico when she slipped
during a practice vault, dislocated her neck and was left a
quadriplegic at age 17.
	   Another 17-year-old now lies in a New York hospital. Doctors are
pessimistic that Chinese gymnast Sang Lan, seriously injured two
weeks ago during a warmup vault at the Goodwill Games, will walk
again.
	   Duffy knows exactly what Sang will face _ the pain, the pity,
the embarrassed stares, and the emotional and physical barriers.
	   But Duffy also knows the possibilities.
	   She went on to get her degree at Stanford, graduated from Yale
Law School, and is an attorney at one of San Francisco's biggest
firms.
	   Duffy hopes that Sang, who is recovering from delicate spinal
fusion surgery, discovers that life doesn't end in a wheelchair.
	   ``I don't mind being an inspiration for her, but there's sort of
a negative flipside to it, which is that there are diminished
expectations for what you can do and the kind of life you can
have,'' she said.
	   ``People are inspired because they think your life has reason to
be really horrible, and it's like totally amazing that you can have
a decent or good or wonderful life.''
	   Confined to a wheelchair, Duffy is unable to make a fist or grip
a fork naturally. She uses only her thumbs to type legal documents.
	   Now 26, Duffy has followed the news of Sang's accident with
discomfort _ not because it reminds her of her own injury, but
because of the way the Chinese athlete's future is portrayed.
	   ``The coverage tends to be very negative, about how it's such a
tragedy, how horrible that her life is over,'' Duffy said. ``I
don't like to think of it that way. I sort of cringe at that.''
	   The maneuver she was practicing in 1989 was a routine one,
featuring a hand spring and a front somersault. Her hands slipped.
As soon as she landed, she realized it was bad.
	   She moved to a rehab center in Southern California. While she
was there, she attended a gymnastics meet at Cal State-Fullerton
that included her former Stanford teammates.
	   Rather than watching from a distance, Duffy got as close as
possible to the action.
	   ``She sat at the end of the vaulting runway in a wheelchair. She
was literally a couple of feet from the landing mat,'' said Breck
Greenwood, the Stanford women's gymnastics coach at the time.
	   After a few months at home in San Juan, she returned to school
and became president of the Stanford Intersorority Council. She
also became an advocate for disabled students, helping persuade
Stanford housing officials to modify dorms to accommodate students
using wheelchairs.
	   ``I think how fast she recovered was pretty much the amazing
thing,'' Greenwood said. ``She just decided, `OK, I'll be a good
student and run for student government and wow them like that.'''
	   Duffy said: ``My life is full, I've done a lot of things ... I
don't feel any desire to have anybody else's life.''

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Two Jewish settlers were shot and killed
while patrolling their West Bank settlement of Itzhar early
Wednesday, The Israeli army said.
	   Israel placed a curfew on four surrounding Palestinian villages
and said it was searching the area for the shooters.
	   The killings come at a tense time in Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks where the two sides have been unable to agree on the scope of
a long overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from West Bank territory.
	   ``Two citizens were killed tonight at the Itzhar settlement near
Nablus from shots fired at their patrol jeep,'' the army statement
said.
	   Settler spokesman Ahron Dombe said the shooting occurred at
approximately 1:00am (22:00gmt).
	   Itzhar is located 10km (6 miles) south of the Palestinian-run
city of Nablus, West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under immense
pressure from the strong Jewish settler lobby and right-wing
members of his Cabinet to reject an American peace initiative which
calls for Israel to withdraw troops from an additional 13 percent
of the West Bank.
	   Tuesday, the Palestinians rejected an Israeli proposal to
pullback its forces from ten percent and turn an additional 3
percent into a nature reserve.
	   The two sides have spent a little over two weeks in direct talks
which have not led to any breakthrough and the Palestinians have
said they were considering walking away from the negotiations.

Michael Owen as Liverpool edged his former club Inter Milan 2-1
Tuesday in a pre-season warmup game at Anfield.
	   Ince, who joined Liverpool from Inter last season, fired his
team ahead in the 31st minute when his first shot from 25 meters
(yards) was blocked by 'keeper Gianluca Pagliuca and the midfielder
followed up to shoot home.
	   Inter, who agreed to the game as part of the transfer deal
involving Ince, leveled through Cristiano Zanetti, but Liverpool
substitute Steve Harkness fired the winner with 14 minutes left.
	   Much of the pre-match talk was about 18-year-old Owen, who
scored a stunning World Cup goal for England and looks a huge
prospect. Although he impressed with his runs, he was closely
marked by Francesco Colonnese.

British Columbia Indian tribe signs historic treaty

	   NEW AIYANSH, British Columbia (AP) _ To the rhythm of drums and
ancient songs, chiefs of the Nisga'a Indians neared the end of a
century-old quest Tuesday by signing a treaty giving them land
rights and self-government in their rugged mountain homeland.
	   Hundreds of Nisga'a in traditional robes and headdresses burst
into cheers when the treaty was signed at a community hall. Their
chiefs stood in triumph on the podium, along with top officials of
the federal and British Columbia governments which had negotiated
the treaty over the past 25 years.
	   The treaty must be approved within 90 days by a vote among the
Nisga'a, then ratified by the federal Parliament and the British
Columbia legislature. The majority parties at both the federal and
provincial level strongly support the treaty.
	   The Nisga'a chief negotiator, Joe Gosnell, told the crowd at the
signing ceremony how Nisga'a leaders paddled by canoe to the
provincial capital, Victoria, in 1887 to request a treaty. They
were rebuffed, and the Nisga'a then endured ``100 years of
darkness,'' Gosnell said.
	   ``Today, that has changed forever,'' he said. ``Today we make
history as we correct the mistakes of the past and send a signal of
hope around the world.''
	   It was an historic day not only for the 5,500 Nisga'a, but for
all Indians in British Columbia. None of the other 50 Indian
communities has obtained a treaty in this century, and the Nisga'a
settlement is expected to serve as a loose model for other deals.
	   The treaty gives the Nisga'a dlrs 190 million (dlrs 126 million
U.S.) in cash over 15 years, plus title to 1,930 square kilometers
(745 square miles) of land in the Nass Valley of northwestern
British Columbia.
	   The Nisga'a, now plagued by an unemployment rate of about 60
percent, will get rights to resources on their land, including
timber, minerals and fish. They will be able to pass their own laws
and operate their own court system; in return they relinquish their
tax-exempt status and agree to make no future claims,.
	   British Columbia's two main opposition parties have demanded a
province-wide referendum on the treaty, but Premier Glen Clark has
rejected the appeal.
	   Though the Nisga'a are expected to approve the treaty in their
own vote, many members of the community wonder if their negotiators
conceded too much. They settled for one-tenth of the the original
land claim, and agreed to make no further claims in the future.
	   ``I have mixed feelings,'' said Francine Gurney, leader of a
group of dancers from the Nisga'a village of Greenville. ``Things
are so bleak right now because of the job situation, maybe if I go
for this I'll have the opportunity to have a fulltime job.''
	   Wallace Clark, a Nisga'a administrator, says the treaty offers
his people the opportunity to succeed on their own terms.
	   ``We know we can do more than the Department of Indian Affairs
allows us to do,'' he said.

Singapore refutes Malaysian allegations over checkpoint dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore has hit back at Malaysia, rebutting
its northern neighbors allegations in an ongoing border dispute
between two ASEAN allies.
	   A Home Affairs Ministry spokesman on Tuesday refuted five
assertions made by Malaysia since Singapore relocated its
immigration, customs and quarantine post on Saturday against the
wishes of its larger neighbor, state-run television reported.
	   Malaysia has condemned the move, maintaining its immigration
officers at the original Tanjong Pagar railway station bordering
the city-state's financial district in the south of the island, a
move Singapore has deemed unlawful and counterproductive.
	   The increasingly acrimonious argument is significant against the
backdrop of progressively souring relations between the Southeast
Asian neighbors.
	   A number of unresolved, perennial issues continue to plague
jittery relations, from straightforward land disputes to the sale
of water, which resource-scarce Singapore imports liberally from
Malaysia.
	   But the nations are also allies, belonging to the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, a key regional body that also groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and
Vietnam.
	   In their blunt comments, the Home Affairs Ministry said
unsubstantiated allegations from Malaysia blaming Singapore are
nothing new, and the city-state can only conclude that Malaysian
leaders do not know the facts or have chosen to disregard them.
	   Refuting claims that the relocation was sudden, unilateral and
deliberately timed when Malaysia was facing an economic crisis, the
spokesman reiterated that the intention to shift the checkpoint was
announced as early as 1989.
	   The spokesman also noted that allegations of Singapore's
arrogance and insensitivity over the issue were typical when
Malaysia has no logical arguments to offer.
	   He said that Singapore has every right to locate its
immigrations facilities at the border, while Malaysia's about-face
on the issue last year and its demand to illegally remain at the
old checkpoint were themselves arrogant and insensitive.
	   The ministry described the accusation of a ploy to seize the
Malaysian-owned land where Tanjong Pagar is located as completely
unfounded, and argued that the dispute was a result of Malaysia
repeatedly changing its position on the issue.
	   Finally, the spokesman described as absurd Malaysian claims that
the Singapore media had an agenda to incite Singaporeans to hate
Malaysia.
	   He noted that the Malaysian media, for their part, had generally
not reported on Singapore's statements while the city-state's media
had done so.
	   The spokesman said that Malaysia has promised to provide within
three months its legal arguments to prove its right to remain at
the old checkpoint.

category codes:
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila
battled with rebellious Tutsi fighters Tuesday at opposite ends of
Congo in an uprising aimed at toppling the president's 14-month-old
regime. Gunfire was reported in the eastern town of Bukavu near the
border with Rwanda, said local aid workers. A provincial official
said the rebels were in control of the town, although some reports
indicated fighting there continued. Banyamulenge Tutsis and Rwandan
soldiers led the uprising against Kabila, accusing him of
widespread corruption and government mismanagement. In the
southwestern village of Kitona, fighting was reported at the town's
main military base, a government spokesman said. It was unclear who
was in control of the base in Kitona, but Kabila has vowed to crush
the uprising and called on his supporters for help. (CONGO)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Waterlogged levees along China's flood-swollen
Yangtze River have started to collapse, wreaking death and
destruction on a massive scale, state media said Tuesday.
Torrential rains in southwest Sichuan province also have triggered
flooding that killed at least 20 people, pushing the known death
toll from floods caused by unusually heavy and early summer rains
this year to 1,288. With a tropical storm expected, the threat
mounted of further breaches along the already weakened levees that
protect millions of people and rich farmland from the Yangtze, the
world's third-longest river. (CHINA-FLOODS)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban religious army said it
launched a pre-emptive strike Tuesday, capturing a town from
Afghanistan's opposition in preparation for an advance on the key
northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif. Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay
Muttayn said his fighters took the town of Saripul, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Mazar-e-Sharif, after a one-hour
battle Tuesday. Taliban radio reported its troops were in full
control of the surrounding province, also called Saripul. Muttayn
said the opposition, which had retreated a few kilometers (miles)
south to Saripul after losing their stronghold of Shebergan on
Sunday, had been re-grouping for a counterattack. The reported
Taliban victory headed-off the counterattack, which could have
slowed its march on Mazar-e-Sharif, one of the opposition's few
remaining strongholds. (AFGHANISTAN-FIGHTING)
	   QIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian refugees swarmed a
truck laden with food, infant formula and medicine Tuesday,
desperately seeking help after Serb police permitted aid workers
into a besieged valley in Kosovo. Serb police have been barring or
slowing aid groups and diplomatic observers from reaching tens of
thousands of refugees driven from villages in the Yugoslav
province, where ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for
independence. The International Committee of the Red Cross reached
the valley near Qirez, but fighting stymied plans by U.N. refugee
workers to send an aid convoy to Malisevo _ a former Kosovo
Liberation Army stronghold that fell to the Serbs in the current
offensive. Refugee agency spokesman Kris Janowski compared the
situation in Kosovo to what happened in 1992 in Bosnia, when
Bosnian Serb forces embarked on a policy of trying to empty areas
of their non-Serb populations. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Hours after the chief U.N. inspector left
Baghdad in a dispute over arms talks, President Saddam Hussein
approved a plan Tuesday that Iraq hopes will end crippling economic
sanctions. Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission,
left Iraq on Tuesday, saying the government was refusing further
disarmament talks _ throwing into uncertainty the future of the
U.N. program to eliminate Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction. The
Iraqi News Agency reported that Saddam approved measures aimed at
ending the sanctions, but did not say what they were. Butler said
the impasse stemmed from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's demand
that Iraq be given a clean bill of health on its weaponry. ``I told
him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't have the
evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route to New
York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we can't talk
any further.''' (IRAQ)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged Tuesday, with selling picking up
in the final minutes of trading as the Dow industrials tumbled
299.43 points in the third-biggest point loss ever. The Dow Jones
industrial average closed at 8,487.31 _ down 3.4 percent, in a
selloff that brought its losses to 9.1 percent, or 850.66 points,
from the record 9,337.97 of July 17. record. The accelerating slide
Tuesday, extending big losses of the past 2 1/2 weeks, raised
questions about the staying power of a bull market that had seen
the Dow nearly quadruple since October 1990. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A key gauge of future economic activity fell in
June for the second month in a row, caused largely by the strikes
at General Motors Corp. and signaling a further slowing of the U.S.
economy. But the Conference Board said it is premature to say a
recession is looming. The private business research group reported
Tuesday that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators for June
stood at 105, down 0.2 percent from the previous month. The decline
was in line with economists' expectations. The measure slipped 0.1
percent in May. Earlier, the board had reported it held steady
during that month. The back-to-back declines were the first since a
string of five declines in January through May of 1995, and the
Conference Board said they signaled ``slower growth ahead and only
a slight risk of a contraction.'' (US-ECONOMY)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines said
Tuesday its net profit for the first quarter of 1998 rose 12
percent to 212 million guilders (dlrs 106 million) but was dented
by Asia's economic crisis. The results for the three months ended
June 30 were supported by a one-off gain, lower costs and improved
yields but hurt by ``trading conditions in the Asia-Pacific
region,'' the airline said. It didn't elaborate. KLM said the net
profit figure didn't include subsidiary Martinair, and that
operating profit would have risen 15 percent to 285 million
guilders (dlrs 142.5 million) if it had. Overall operating income
rose 5.2 percent to 262 million guilders (dlrs 131 million), at the
low end of analysts' expectations. (NETHERLANDS-EARNS-KLM)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund has
agreed in principle to allow Thailand to run a public sector
deficit of 3.5 percent of gross domestic product for the next
fiscal year, the finance minister said Tuesday. Tarrin
Nimmanhaeminda said after a Cabinet meeting that an IMF team
conducting a quarterly review of Thailand's dlrs 17.2 billion
economic rescue package had agreed to Thai deficit proposals. They
would allow the government to have a budget deficit equivalent to
1.5 percent of gross domestic product for the year to Sept. 30,
1999, plus a state enterprise investment budget deficit of 2
percent of GDP. (THAILAND-IMF)
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Petroleum PLC said Tuesday its quarterly
profits fell 20 percent to 695 million pounds (dlrs 1.16 billion)
as it suffered the effects of a severely depressed oil market. BP
said its pre-tax profits for the three months ending June 30
compared with earnings of 874 million pounds in the same period a
year earlier. Revenues plunged 30 percent to 6.24 billion pounds
(dlrs 10.42 billion), from 8.96 billion pounds, BP said.
(BRITAIN-EARNS-OIL)
	   LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany (AP) _ Chemical group BASF said Tuesday
that earnings growth will level off in the second half of 1998
after a pre-tax profit rise of 14.5 percent in the first six months
of the year compared to the same period last year. Group sales
during the first half rose only 3.4 percent down from a 5 percent
increase predicted by market observers. Pre-tax profit rose to 2.82
billion marks (dlrs 1.58 billion) from 2.46 billion marks (dlrs
1.38 billion) and group sales were up to 28.7 billion marks (dlrs
16.1 billion) for the first half from 27.8 billion marks (dlrs 15.6
billion) during last year's like period. (GERMANY-EARNS-BASF)

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ ``ER'' stars Anthony Edwards and Noah Wyle
have signed new contracts that will keep them on the highly rated
NBC medical drama through the year 2002, series producer Warner
Bros. said Tuesday.
	   Edwards will become TV's highest-paid star in a dramatic series,
earning nearly dlrs 400,000 an episode for the next four seasons,
Daily Variety reported. Wyle's extension is similar but will pay
him a bit less.
	   According to the trade paper, Edwards' roughly dlrs 35 million
deal gives him a raise for the next two seasons, which were covered
by a previous contract, and for two additional years.
	   A Warner spokesman declined comment on the salaries.
	   The deals with Edwards and Wyle were key to the series, which is
losing George Clooney after the coming season. Clooney is focusing
on his film career.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ If Kofi Annan ever wants to quit as U.N.
Secretary-General, he knows just the man to take over: Sir Peter
Ustinov.
	   ``His qualifications are simply unbeatable,'' Annan said at a
luncheon honoring the British character actor for serving 30 years
as a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF.
	   ``He speaks French, German, English, Italian, Russian, Spanish
and even some Turkish and Greek,'' Annan said. ``Even the languages
he does not actually speak, he can imitate so well that it sounds
uncannily as if he is speaking them.''
	   And if that wouldn't be enough to fill Ustinov's day, Annan had
more work in mind for Ustinov.
	   ``He could easily double as permanent representative of all the
member states,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Newlywed Barbra Streisand is thinking about
it, but she hasn't made any definite plans for a concert tour.
	   Rumors about a possible tour next year or in 2000 reached a
crescendo in recent days, leading Ms. Streisand's publicist Dick
Guttman to release a statement Monday by the entertainer's longtime
manager Marty Erlichman.
	   No decisions have been made, Erlichman said, ``although many
attractive offers from throughout the world have been received and
the possibility is being contemplated.''
	   Ms. Streisand, who married actor James Brolin at her Malibu
estate on July 1, recently released the album ``On Higher Ground.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Prince Ernst August of Hanover was fined
dlrs 50,800 for hitting a photographer trying to take pictures of
him with Princess Caroline of Monaco.
	   Charges of assault will be dropped if the prince agrees to pay
the fine, to be divided evenly between two charity organizations
and the state of Lower Saxony, state prosecutors said Tuesday.
	   Prosecutors said the prince beat photographer Karsten Thuernau
for seven minutes with an umbrella at his estate near Hanover on
Jan. 11.
	   Thuernau, who had been waiting to photograph the royal couple,
was not seriously injured. The prince had claimed he was trying to
hit Thuernau's camera.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ Romance surrounds a 1953
Ferrari that could fetch dlrs 250,000.
	   The late Ingrid Bergman's Ferrari 212 Pinin Farina Coupe, given
to her as a wedding gift by husband Roberto Rossellini and dubbed
``my growling baby'' by the actress, is one of the 65 featured
vehicles up for bid Aug. 16 at the Exceptional Motor Cars sale at
Pebble Beach Resorts.
	   ``Titanic'' director James Cameron's 1991 Callaway Speedster,
Kimberly Hefner's 1962 Chrysler 300 convertible and a 1989 Jaguar
XJS once owned by Frank Sinatra are also on the block. And there's
the Kimberly Cooper-Climax Formula 1 car driven by Jack Brabham in
the 1961 Indianapolis 500.
	   In April 1951, Miss Bergman and Rossellini were visiting the
Turin Auto Show when Miss Bergman was immediately struck by the
Ferrari's sleek styling. Rossellini vowed to have one made for her
as a wedding present and it was completed in 1953, records showed.
	   Auction spokeswoman Beth Shepherd said it was expected to fetch
dlrs 180,000 to dlrs 250,000. In 1953, the love coupe cost
Rossellini dlrs 12,000.

Congo rebellion linked to Rwanda's desire for a secure border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ When Rwanda backed the rebellion that
drove dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from power in neighboring Zaire,
its Tutsi leaders counted on the new ruler to keep Hutu rebels away
from their common border.
	   Fifteen months later, new strongman Laurent Kabila has changed
the name of Zaire to Congo, but has failed to respect his side of
the bargain with Rwanda. And again the border region is up in arms.
	   From their bases in eastern Congo, Hutu rebels have stepped up
their attacks against Rwandan targets, and Congolese authorities
appear unable, or unwilling, to deal with them. So Rwanda has
decided to do the job itself.
	   Last month, Kabila announced that he was sending home all the
Rwandan soldiers who helped him gain power. Rwanda said it had
planned to pull them out anyway.
	   The pullout made a split between Kabila and his Rwandan Tutsi
backers evident, and that was a signal to ethnic Tutsis in the
Congolese army, known as Banyamulenge, to join forces with soldiers
and officers from other tribes in eastern Congo to oust forces
loyal to Kabila.
	   Other Banyamulenge and Rwandan troops rose against Kabila in the
Congolese capital, Kinshasa, 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) to the
west. Their goal is as yet unclear.
	   The current movement bears striking similarity to the early days
of Kabila's uprising in October 1996, when the Banyamulenge in
South Kivu province were the first to take up arms against Mobutu's
troops. Rwanda was giving covert aid to Kabila, but did not
acknowledge it publicly until a year later.
	   The rebellion in late 1996 succeeded in dispersing the estimated
100,000 Hutu rebels mingled among more than a million Hutu refugees
in camps in eastern Zaire, where they were re-arming to regain
power in Rwanda.
	   Despite Kabila's victory _ aided as well by Angola, Eritrea and
Uganda _ things did not work out the way the new Tutsi leaders in
Rwanda had planned.
	   Kabila failed to stamp out the Hutu rebels. Most are remnants of
the extremist Hutu army and militia responsible for the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, in which at least half a million Tutsis were
slaughtered.
	   The rebels still manage to receive weapons and supplies that
must pass through northeastern Congo.
	   Since he assumed power in May 1997, Kabila has been confronted
with an enormous and deeply divided nation suffering from decades
of neglect. He faces a problem similar to that which contributed to
Mobutu's downfall _ no money to pay his army.
	   He also has been under pressure from his own Baluba kinsmen and
the inhabitants of Kinshasa to reduce the influence of the
Banyamulenge _ and the Rwandans _ who are seen as bossy foreigners.
	   Hutu rebel attacks on Rwanda, meanwhile, are increasing in
intensity, creating a formidable obstacle to the government's
recovery plans.
	   Since then, thousands have died in Hutu rebel attacks and army
counterattacks _ with no end in sight.
	   On Monday, as reports emerged of fighting among factions of the
Congolese army and Banyamulenge and Rwandan troops in Kinshasa and
eastern Kivu, rumors spread of a Rwandan-backed coup.
	   Rwanda officially denied any role in the events, but one
officer, who asked not to be named, has confirmed Rwandan
involvement.

Britain rejects Argentina's right to tax companies in Falklands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The British government opposes
Argentina's intention to fine oil companies that drill in the
Falkland Islands basin without its consent, a senior Foreign Office
official said Tuesday.
	   ``We reject Argentina's right to impose taxation on companies
where Britain is sovereign,'' said Tony Lloyd, foreign minister of
state for foreign and commonwealth affairs.
	   A bill pending in congress would levy a 3 percent royalty tax on
all oil or gas extracted from the region, and would make any
company refusing to pay this tax liable to sanctions.
	   The bill initiated by Senator Eduardo Menem, brother of
President Carlos Menem, was approved by the Senate in late April
and is awaiting debate in the lower house.
	   Lloyd said his government's opposition was based on the
extra-territoriality of the law because of British sovereignty, and
also because the law seeks to punish any company on the supply or
demand end of oil operations.
	   ``It's not in the interest of Argentina to go down the road of
extra-territoriality,'' Lloyd said. ``None of us ought to go down
that road.''
	   The controversy derives from differences over the 1995 Agreement
on Cooperation in Hydrocarbons, over which the governments haven't
yet reached a final accord.
	   Lloyd also reiterated his government's intentions to maintain
the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands over which the two
countries fought a 74-day war in 1982.
	   Argentina and Britain renewed relations in 1990 and later signed
treaties on oil and fishing rights in the waters surrounding the
islands.

Telephone companies formalize privatization in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ The telecommunications companies who
bought parts of state-run phone company Telebras formalized the
deal with the government Tuesday.
	   Telebras was split into 12 separate companies that were
auctioned off for a total of 22 billion reals (dlrs 19 billion)
last Wednesday in Latin America's biggest privatization to date.
	   MCI bought Embratel, and Spain's Telefonica and Portugal Telecom
came away with the lion's share of the fixed line and celluar
services.
	   Officials from the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange, where the
auction was held, handed Communications Minister Luiz Carlos
Mendonca de Barros a check for 8.82 billion reals (dlrs 7.6
billion), 40 per cent purchase price as a down payment.

Dollar falls, Tokyo stocks edge lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early
Wednesday, while Tokyo stock prices edged lower following a steep
drop overnight on Wall Street.
	   The dollar bought 143.88 yen in early trading, down 0.74 yen
from late in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 144.97
yen overnight.
	   The dollar weakened after a sharp overnight fall on Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 299.43 points at
8,487.31 on Tuesday, its third-largest point loss ever.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 8.45 points,
or 0.05 percent, to 16,015.13 points in the opening minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 141.50 points, or 0.88
percent.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 1.50 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,233.11. The
TOPIX closed down 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.200 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.220 percent, driving its price up to 111.79 yen from 111.66 yen.

Human rights group says Taliban brutally mistreat women
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 0430 GMT Wednesday. &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA BRYSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The mother watched her daughter
writhe with stomach pain for days. She did not take her to the free
clinic, because she was too poor to own the burqa that
Afghanistan's Taliban religious army insists women shroud
themselves in from head-to-toe when they venture into public.
	   The daughter died, a casualty in what a human rights group
described Wednesday as the ``Taliban's war on women.''
	   In a report released Wednesday, Boston-based Physicians for
Human Rights called on foreign companies to halt investment in
Afghanistan, the United Nations to remove its aid workers from the
country, and the world to isolate the Taliban.
	   The report's researcher, Zohra Rasekh, said in a telephone
interview that women she met earlier this year in Afghanistan and
in refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan had the will to oppose
Taliban ideas, but not the strength to fight their weapons.
	   ``They need outside help to get themselves out of this mess,''
said Rasekh, a Muslim woman who spent part of her childhood in
Afghanistan before moving to the United States. ``They expect human
rights organizations to speak up about the situation of women in
Afghanistan.''
	   The strongly worded report comes as the Taliban army claims new
victories over its opponents in northern Afghanistan that could put
the entire country under its extreme version of Islamic law.
	   ``The `peace' imposed on that portion of the country under
Taliban rule is the peace of the burqa, the quiet of women and
girls cowering in their homes, and the silence of a citizenry
terrorized by the Taliban's violent and arbitrary application of
its version'' of Islamic law, Physicians for Human Rights said.
	   Attempts to obtain comment from Taliban officials were not
immediately successful. Taliban officials have in the past shown
little concern for international opinion.
	   To prepare the report, Rasekh spent three months questioning 200
Afghan women _ 40 face-to-face and 160 in written surveys _ about
how their lives had changed since the Taliban captured Kabul, the
Afghan capital, in 1996.
	   Rasekh, a fluent Farsi speaker and trained in public health and
journalism, spoke to the woman whose daughter died for want of a
burqa. In another interview, she heard of an 8-year-old girl who
had been caught outside without a burqa and beaten by Taliban
religious police. Her sister said the child was left so traumatized
she would no longer leave the house.
	   A doctor, who like all the women Rasekh spoke to was not named
because of fears of Taliban reprisals, said a special order
allowing her to continue working at a clinic was little comfort.
	   ``The Taliban are very unpredictable,'' she was quoted as
saying. ``One day the religious police may stop me on the street
and ask where I am going. At that point, the fact that I have
permission may mean nothing to him; he can beat me or harass me or
arrest me at his whim.''
	   Of the women who filled out Rasekh's questionnaire, 97 percent
showed symptoms of major depression. About three quarters of them
said their health and access to health care had deteriorated since
the Taliban took over Kabul.
	   In a forward to the report, Abdullahi A. An-Na'im, a Muslim and
a U.S.-based legal scholar, challenged Taliban arguments that their
policies are spelled out in the Koran, Islam's holy book.
	   ``Human rights organizations ... are condemning these policies
and practices from a human rights point of view,'' An-Na'im wrote.
``Unless Muslims do the same from an Islamic point of view as well,
the Taliban will get away with their false claim that these heinous
crimes against humanity are dictated by Islam as a religion.''

Frittering away White House privacy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to FIX slug &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-US-Clinton-Investigation &QL; 
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Again and again, the White House has been
rebuffed by courts in its battle to block testimony in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
	   Beyond the legal skirmishes of this summer, one of the legacies
of President Bill Clinton's legal struggle may well be a shrinking
of confidentiality and privilege for his successors.
	   ``Future presidents may take a dim view of President Clinton's
litigation strategy,'' said Jonathan Turley, professor of
constitutional law at George Washington University. ``He may
ultimately be viewed as something of a constitutional spendthrift
who easily frittered away the privileges of his office.''
	   In the six-month investigation of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, Clinton has waged losing battles in asserting
lawyer-client privilege, executive privilege and a special
protective privilege covering Secret Service agents.
	   A president's private conversations with administration
attorneys are not shielded from grand jury questioning because the
lawyers are working for taxpayers, not just the president, a
federal judge and an appeals court have ruled.
	   Presidents have traditionally been reluctant to test executive
privilege in the courts in order to protect future administrations
from negative, binding rulings. Clinton's staff says the president
is waging his battles to preserve protections for his successors,
to defend the institution of the presidency rather than surrender
to an out-of-control prosecutor.
	   ``This was done on principle,'' said presidential counselor Rahm
Emanuel. ``This is where politics and principle are in tandem.''
	   Clinton also lost ground in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a president
could be forced into civil litigation during his term. Jones' case
was later dismissed by the trial court, but the high court's
precedent still stands.
	   There is a spirited debate within political and legal circles
about whether Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has been too
zealous in his pursuit of the president, and whether Clinton has
been too aggressive in trying to prevent his aides and agents from
having to testify about his behavior.
	   But there is a widespread belief that the courts _ at least so
far _ have diluted presidential privacy.
	   ``The effect of these rulings is to weaken the presidency as an
institution,'' said Herman Schwartz, law professor at American
University. Seeking advice on sensitive matters, presidents will
not be able to turn to their senior aides, to their own counsel or
even to former presidents, if current rulings are upheld.
	   ``How can he seek the guidance of wise heads if those people can
be subpoenaed?'' said Schwartz. ``The only wise heads he can seek
are private lawyers at dlrs 450 an hour. It seems to me, almost
everybody who's not a lawyer is kind of startled at the continual
rulings that there's no privilege of any kind for these intensely
confidential matters. There is a commonsense assumption that people
need confidentiality in order to talk openly and if they don't get
it, they won't.''
	   The White House argues that it is Starr _ not Clinton _ who has
jeopardized the principle of presidential privilege.
	   ``I think the blame lies elsewhere,'' deputy press secretary
Barry Toiv said. ``I think it is not we who are seeking to breach
the attorney-client privilege. This has been done on a couple of
occasions and in a couple of different areas, and it was not done
by this White House.''

Japanese stocks slightly lower in early trading, dollar slides

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first 30 minutes of Nikkei trading, other
details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell slightly early Wednesday
following an overnight plunge on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar
slid against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 62.84 points, or 0.39
percent, moving to 15,960.74 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 141.50 points, or 0.88
percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section slipped 2.80 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,231.81.
The TOPIX closed down 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded its
biggest point loss of the year and its third worst ever, losing
299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31 at Tuesday's close.
	   Traders said, however, that the Tokyo market was relatively firm
despite the overnight drop in New York because of expectations for
further action from Japan's new government to stimulate the
economy.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and senior policy makers of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party Tuesday agreed Tuesday on a plan to
cut personal income taxes by about 4 trillion yen (U.S. dlrs 27.7
billion) and also by 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.8 billion) for
corporations.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 143.88 yen in
early trading, down 0.74 yen from late in Tokyo on Tuesday and also
below its late New York rate of 144.97 yen overnight.
	   The dollar weakened after the sharp overnight fall on Wall
Street.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.200 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.220 percent, driving its price up to 111.79 yen from 111.66 yen.

Alliance unraveling into violence in Congo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KAMANGA MUTOND &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The delicate ethnic and military alliance
that catapulted Laurent Kabila to Congo's presidency is unraveling,
with rebellious fighters battling his troops at both ends of the
central African country.
	   Gunfire has broken out in the eastern town of Bukavu near the
border with Rwanda, said local aid workers Tuesday. A provincial
official told The Associated Press that the rebels were in control
of the city, although some reports indicated that fighting
continued.
	   Banyamulenge ethnic fighters and Rwandan troops were leading the
uprising against Kabila, accusing him of widespread corruption and
government mismanagement.
	   Those groups played a key role in helping Kabila march to
victory last year over longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   But Kabila now accuses Rwanda _ whose vice president, Paul
Kagame, was widely viewed as helping him topple Mobutu _ of being
behind the movement against his leadership.
	   Rwanda denies orchestrating the mutiny. However, it has
increasingly complained that Kabila has done little to increase
security in the Great Lakes region of central Africa.
	   Fighting was reported at the military base in southwestern
Kitona, where rebel gunmen forced a hijacked private airplane to
land, said Kabila spokesman Yerodia Abdoulaye Ndombasi. It was
unclear who was in control of the base, 140 miles (225 kilometers)
southwest of Kinshasa.
	   The plane was hijacked by Banyamulenge fighters on the opposite
side of the country, in the eastern city of Goma. Ndombasi gave no
other details.
	   Earlier, Kabila vowed to crush the uprising and called on his
supporters for help.
	   ``Be assured we will take weapons to swiftly end this
rebellion,'' Cabinet minister Pierre Victor Mpoyo said on state
radio, quoting Kabila.
	   The vice governor of South Kivu province, Benjamin Serukiza,
said the Tutsi rebels had taken control of much of the province,
including Bukavu and its airport.
	   ``At the moment a large portion of the province is under the
control of the army, which is hostile to Kabila's regime,''
Serukiza said in a telephone interview.
	   Kabila convened an emergency cabinet meeting Tuesday to discuss
the government's response to the rebellion in the east and to
earlier gunbattles at two military barracks in the capital.
	   After he came to power, Kabila kept Rwandan troops on as part of
his defense force until he ordered them out last week. A few days
earlier, he fired his chief military officer, a Rwandan Tutsi
soldier.
	   ``Kabila has been very aggressive against his neighbors of
late,'' Rwandan chief of staff Gen. Kayumba Nyamwasa said Tuesday.
	   The ethnic Tutsi population in North Kivu has close links with
Rwanda, and Kabila's support and control of the region has been
faltering for months.

U.S. ousts Australia; Italy, Argentina in quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ American coach Rudy Tomjanovich called it
a ``do or die game'' for Australia.
	   Well, R.I.P. Australia.
	   The mix-and-match Americans _ the no-name composite of CBA,
European pros and a college player _ kept Australia from claiming
the eighth and final quarterfinal spot in the World Basketball
Championship, dumping the Aussies on Tuesday 96-78.
	   Instead, the final place in Friday's quarterfinals went to
Argentina, which beat Brazil 86-76 and then had to wait several
hours for the Americans to oust Australia so they could advance
themselves.
	   ``For our tournament to hinge on a game with the United States
was tough. Talk about being behind the eight-ball,'' said Australia
coach Barry Barnes.
	   ``We kept changing defenses. We tried pressure, we tried laying
off their shooters but nothing worked,'' he added.
	   The Americans demoralized the Aussies in the first half with hot
shooting _ just under 60 percent from the field _ and a stiff
man-to-man that forced turnovers and got the Americans running. And
the second half was more of the same in the best U.S. performance
so far.
	   Jimmy Oliver led the U.S. attack with 18 and Jason Sasser added
15 with 10 of the 12 Americans getting on the scoreboard.
	   ``We had a lot at stake,'' U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich said.
``If we win we get the number one seed. If we lose we drop all the
way to four. It was a do-or-die for Australia, too.''
	   Australia _ silver medalists last month in the Goodwill Games _
was led by Shane Heal with 31.
	   Friday's quarterfinals look like this: United States (5-1) vs.
Italy (3-3), Spain (5-1) vs. Greece (4-2), Lithuania (4-2) vs.
Russia (5-1), Argentina (3-3) vs. Yugoslavia (5-1).
	   Under the complicated system to pair teams for the
quarterfinals, a U.S. loss could have pitted it against Yugoslavia
or Russia _ perhaps the two favorites. Every other team faced
similar last-minute twists.
	   In Argentina's critical victory, Marcelo Nicola hit 22 and
Fabricio Oberto added 21. Brazil got 22 from Marco Aurelio Pegolo
and 20 from Joao Jose Vianna.
	   Italy beat Puerto Rico 68-63 to claim the other quarterfinal
spot that was on the line Tuesday as the second round ended.
Slovenian-born Gregor Fucka hit 15 and scored the last five points
with a slam dunk, a layup and a free throw to lead Italy.
	   Jose Ortiz had 21 points and 14 rebounds for the Puerto Ricans
(2-4).
	   ``It would be a dream to be in the semifinals or the finals, but
right now we just have to concentrate on our next opponents,'' said
Italian center Giacomo Galanda.
	   Spain defeated Lithuania 86-80 in overtime and Russia won over
Canada 81-72 to pick up key victories.
	   Spain, the surprise team of the worlds, hasn't won a medal in a
major tournament in seven years _ bronze in the '91 Europeans _ and
has hardly been heard from since it shocked itself with silver in
the 1984 Olympics.
	   Forward Alberto Herreros, the leading scorer in the tournament,
had 27 and Alfonso Reyes added 19. Arturas Karnisovas, playing with
a bandaged head after a second-half collision with a Spain's
Ignacio de Miguel that drew blood, led Lithuania (4-2) with 20. But
he was scoreless in the last 11 minutes.
	   ``This has shown our basketball is decent and we're
competitive,'' said coach Lolo Sainz, who is in the first phase of
rebuilding and is expected in the next few years to dip heavily
into a rich pool of young talent.
	   Yugoslavia, after losing Monday to Italy 61-60, dumped home-team
Greece 70-56 with 19 points for Dejan Bodiroga. Fragiskos Alvertis
led Greece with 23 as the local team dropped its second straight
game after losing Monday to Russia.
	   Russia _ billed as the favorite with Yugoslavia to win the title
Sunday _ was topped by Vassiliy Karassev with 21 points and Sergei
Babkov and Sergei Panov with 14. Canada (1-5) got 14 points and 11
rebounds from Greg Newton.

Greek organizers vs. Yugoslav officials and press
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Balkan neighbors Greece and Yugoslavia are
having a tiff off the basketball court.
	   The Greek organizing committee of these worlds has been
criticized in the Yugoslav press for its running of the
championship, and on Tuesday Greece replied.
	   The president of the Greek basketball federation Giorgos
Vassilakopoulos met Tuesday with FIBA president Boris Stankovic _ a
Yugoslav _ to try clearing the air.
	   ``We must not take into consideration, nor answer, nor be
affected by alleged foolish statements,'' Vassilakopoulos said in
his own statement. ``We must retain our athletic and friendly
relationships with Yugoslavia. Unfortunatley, I daily observe the
operation of a mechanism creating false news against the
championship, the organizing committee, Greece and me personally.
	   ``I am very much afraid that besides Borislav Stankovic, there
is chaos among the FIBA executives. That is why we have to do our
best to have Mr. Stankovic remain in his position.''
	   In general, the championship has been well run, but attendance _
without the Dream Team _ has been abysmal, except when Greece
plays. Organizers are expecting to lose money after talking about a
dlrs 1 profit when the Dream Team was still slated to come.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BROWNOUTS: Forest fires in the Pendeli mountain area 30
kilometers (20 miles) north of downtown Athens _ fanned by strong
winds and stoked by 40C (100F) temperatures the last week _ are
being blamed for brownouts at local hotels and at the two
basketball arenas.
	   Tuesday's second-round game between Brazil and Argentina at
Peace and Friendship stadium was stopped for 15 minutes when the
lights dimmed and _ when they didn't come back up _ officials
resumed the game. All of the lights came up a few minutes later.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OOH, CANADA: Former Duke center Greg Newton was Canada's leading
scorer through five games. The Canadians (1-5) won't play in the
quarterfinals, but Newton was pleased with his own play.
	   ``I think as the tournament progessed I've played better and
better and more opportunities have come to me,'' he said after
scoring 25 against Puerto Rico in a 94-81 loss.
	   The 2.08-meter (6-10) Newton played last season in Belgium with
Siemens but said he's looking for a new offer.
	   Canadian coach Steve Konchalski praised his main man.
	   ``He's been our leading scorer and rebounder and he's a player
we can build around,'' Konchalski said. ``The emergence of Greg
Newton is a tremendous factor for our future.

Saddam approves `measures' to shake off sanctions

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ With U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq facing an
uncertain future, the chief arms inspector is returning to New York
for talks with the Security Council.
	   Richard Butler, who heads the U.N. Special Commission overseeing
the elimination of Iraq's arsenal of mass destruction, left Baghdad
on Tuesday, saying the government was refusing further disarmament
talks. He was scheduled to meet with the council on Thursday.
	   Just hours after Butler left the country, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein approved a plan that Iraq hopes will end crippling economic
sanctions. The Iraqi News Agency said the measures would be
announced soon but did not say what they were.
	   Butler said the impasse stemmed from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz's demand that Iraq be given a clean bill of health on its
weaponry. Iraq needs such approval for international sanctions to
be lifted.
	   ``I told him that I cannot fulfill your demand because I don't
have the evidence,'' Butler said after flying into Bahrain en route
to New York. ``After I said that to him, Aziz replied, `Then we
can't talk any further.'''
	   Butler's political adviser, Gustavo Zlauvinen, said Aziz also
refused to accept a proposal to speed up the pace of weapons
inspections. ``The talks were getting nowhere,'' he said.
	   Zlauvinen said much more work must be done to get a clearer
picture of Iraq's weapons capability.
	   Until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is free of weapons of
mass destruction, the U.N. Security Council will not lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which led
to the Gulf War.
	   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
said Saddam had ``shot himself in the foot'' by mishandling a
chance to end economic sanctions. ``Iraq has only harmed itself,''
Rubin said.
	   Iraq's latest stand threatens to bring to a halt the U.N.
commission's seven-year search for the illegal weapons, a mission
often disrupted by confrontations between Iraqi and U.N. officials.
	   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said the next
step could be determined only after Butler's report to the Security
Council.
	   Iraq's charge d'affaires at the United Nations, Said Hasan, said
it would be impossible to follow a proposed accelerated schedule
now that talks have broken down.
	   However, the Iraqi News Agency quoted Butler as saying before he
departed that the impasse should not be blown out of proportion.
	   ``It is imperative not to overdramatize the situation,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``I will refrain from using the word crisis.''
	   It was unclear if the impasse would trigger another military
crisis. Earlier this year, the United States and Britain sent
warships to the Gulf after Iraq refused to open presidential sites
to U.N. inspectors.
	   That crisis was defused in February by an agreement brokered by
Annan.
	   U.N.-Iraq disputes appeared to be easing until a U.S. military
lab reported in June that it found traces of deadly VX nerve gas on
fragments of Iraqi missile warheads it tested.
	   Iraq had claimed it developed VX but never put the chemical on
missiles.
	   Last month, Saddam said in a nationally televised speech that
the sanctions must be lifted this year _ the first time he had set
a deadline.

Indonesian media gets into rhythm of new freedom, but worries
</HEADLINE>
linger &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ With decades-old curbs on press
freedom stripped away, Indonesia's media are joining an explosion
of public debate. One newspaper column even compared the nation's
former government to Nazi rule in Germany.
	   But while the new leadership preaches democratic reform, it
remains fearful that journalists may go too far in their
exuberance, spreading rumors or misinformation during a delicate
period in Indonesia. Fears of fresh unrest linger as the nation's
economic crisis weighs heavier on the poor.
	   ``The government wants the press to abide by a code of ethics
and to respect the national culture and moral values,'' Information
Minister Yunus Yosfiah said without elaborating.
	   The government began relaxing its control on the media following
the May resignation of President Suharto, who frequently shut down
publications that criticized him during his 32 years in power.
	   Now in editorial pages, it's open season on Suharto and his
family, accused by foes of deepening Indonesia's economic paralysis
by allegedly siphoning off national wealth.
	   On Tuesday, a Roman Catholic priest argued on the front page of
the respected English-language Jakarta Post that under Suharto, the
military used harsh tactics to crush separatist movements in remote
parts of the nation.
	   ``The further you traveled from Jakarta, the more common Nazi
SS-style practices became,'' wrote the Rev. Y.B. Mangunwijaya, who
is also a social worker.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, is routinely
cajoled by columnists who say he's sluggish on reform.
	   Media managers are short of cash, but euphoric editors are eager
to print. Indonesia has issued 60 licenses for new publications
since the downfall of Suharto, whose government was loathe to grant
them.
	   Detak, a weekly newspaper banned under Suharto, is publishing
again. The cover of its first edition showed Suharto, his face
mostly hidden by a superimposed ninja mask, and a story said
remnants of the old regime lurked in the shadows, still a threat to
Indonesian democracy.
	   Last month, a proposal by Habibie that reporters be required to
obtain work licenses, much like doctors or engineers, angered
journalists who labeled it a throwback to the Suharto days.
	   As research and technology minister under Suharto, Habibie was
hardly a champion of press freedom. The government shuttered
Indonesia's most respected magazine, Tempo, in 1994 after it
published articles that angered Habibie.
	   Now, at least publicly, Habibie is good-natured about criticism
and even invites it.
	   ```The press is very important as the basis or foundation or
backbone of democracy,''' Parni Hadi, head of the official Antara
news agency, quoted Habibie as saying at a meeting last month.
	   Hadi said the spread of scandal sheets, easier to publish in the
freer climate, was leading to a deterioration of journalistic
standards. Publications speculate about the love lives of
well-known Indonesians, including a son of Suharto.
	   ``There are so many fake journalists, unqualified journalists,''
Hadi said. ``We are already on the brink of going too far.''

Two Jewish settlers killed, talks stuck over West Bank withdrawal

	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ As tensions heightened between Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators over the scope of a West Bank troop
withdrawal, two Jewish settlers were shot and killed early
Wednesday in the same area Israel says it is reluctant to pull
forces from.
	   The double killings outside the Jewish settlement of Itzhar in
the West Bank was likely to further complicate peace talks, already
at an impasse.
	   The Palestinians have rejected Israeli proposals to alter an
American peace initiative which calls for Israel to withdraw its
troops from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
the strong Jewish settler lobby and right-wing members of his
Cabinet, has rejected the American plan, saying that it would harm
Israel's security by isolating several communities including
Itzhar. Israel offered to redeploy from ten percent of territory
and turn another 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel would
retain overall security but that was rejected Tuesday by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Still, Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal
would have left Itzhar cut-off and said Wednesday's killings were a
harbinger of things to come if redeployment goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur in
ten-fold when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar, and
another 18 settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said
Settler Council leader Ahron Dombe. Dombe called on Netanyahu to
cancel talks until the assailants were found.
	   Like most Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Itzhar is perched
on a dusty, barren hilltop and looks out onto several small
Palestinians village on surrounding hillsides. Israel still
controls most of the area, allowing it to clamp down on the
villages, set up road blocks and conduct door-to-door searches for
the gunmen as it did Wednesday.
	   But the impending troop withdrawal would change that. Israeli
soldiers would not longer be allowed into the villages that lay
between Itzhar and the large Palestinian-run city of Nablus, 10 km
(6 miles) away.
	   In Nablus, Palestinian police commander Isam el-Dobi said Israel
had informed Palestinian authorities of the shooting and
Palestinian police were meeting to discuss possible coordination in
the case.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been haggling for months over
the scope of the long overdue Israeli withdrawal and a U.S. peace
plan to get it off the ground. A little over two weeks of direct
negotiations, after American mediators failed to bridge gaps, has
not yielded any progress and Tuesday the Palestinians signaled they
may leave the talks altogether.
	   At Itzhar, settlers prepared funerals for the two men killed at
approximately 1:00am (22:00gmt) while on a routine nightly jeep
patrol of the settlement boundaries.
	   A statement from the Israeli army spokesman's office said the
two settlers, whose names were not immediately released, were
killed while in their jeep. Dombe said one of the men managed to
radio for help shortly after they were first fired upon. Dombe said
the assailants then came within close range of the jeep and fired
an additional bullet into the heads of each man, killing them
instantly.

Move over tequila, Mexican mezcal finding niche in export market

<TEXT>
	   OAXACA, Mexico (AP) _ The sun-broiled hills of Oaxaca are alive
_ with worms.
	   And so a marketing hook was born.
	   Zapotecan Indians and their burros trek up into the mountains
outside this southern Mexican city to harvest spiky,
iridescent-green agave plants and bring them back for cooking.
	   At crowded, smoke-filled cantinas in town, bartenders serve
locals and tourists the product of that work: the liquor mezcal,
famous for the dead agave worm bobbing in many of the bottles.
	   Once secretly brewed by tax-dodging farmers, mezcal now is being
sold by Mexican moonshiners-turned-entrepeneurs as an upscale drink
to 18 countries.
	   Some people tout mezcal as the equivalent of soaking in eight
years of sun _ the time it takes an agave plant to mature.
	   But much of the drink's appeal comes from that floating agave
worm, which Zapotecans have long considered a powerful aphrodisiac,
even making tortillas and salt from ground-up worms.
	   The worms are extracted from the hearts of agave plants during
the harvest. In 1950, Jacobo Lozano Paez, a Mexico City
entrepreneur and now owner of the company that bottles Gusano Rojo
mezcal, decided to put a worm in each bottle as a marketing gimmick
and a tradition began.
	   The liquor became a novelty drink across the border in the
southwestern United States, but its cachet has grown over the years
and demand has spread.
	   Mezcal exports have nearly tripled since 1994, according to
Mexico's export bank, Bancomext. Production doubled during that
period, and may top 1.6 million gallons (6 million liters) this
year.
	   Exporters in Oaxaca, where most mezcal is produced, say this is
no mere swill for guzzling college kids. And they are working hard
to distance mezcal from its more popular cousin _ tequila, which is
made in the state of Jalisco from a different kind of agave.
	   ``Tequila was promoted more as a party drink,'' says Cesar de la
Pena Dominguez, assistant manager of credit promotion at Bancomext
in Oaxaca. ``But we want to promote mezcal more as a fine cognac,
something different, very select, a mystical drink of the gods.''
	   Aged in oak barrels for four years and bottled in a hand-blown
pumpkin-shaped glass, Gran Reserva Beneva mezcal won a gold medal
at the 1998 World Spirit Championships. It sells for about dlrs 50
(445 pesos) a bottle.
	   Tehuana Anejo by Chagoya, a two-year mezcal priced at dlrs 33.95
(300 pesos) a bottle, also won a gold.
	   The more expensive brands don't contain the red worm. Promoters
still use worms in cheaper versions to catch people's attention
with the hope they'll move up to the aged mezcals.
	   Asian buyers want as many as five worms a bottle.
	   ``That's so each person can have a worm in their glass,'' says
Carlos Leon Monterrubio, fourth-generation owner of Joyas
Oaxaquena, which has produced mezcal since the 1800s.
	   But when dealing with the less adventuresome folks in the United
States, mezcal's marketers concentrate more on the liquor's purity.
	   By law, mezcal is guaranteed 100 percent agave with an official
seal. Faced with an overwhelming demand and limited land, most
tequila distillers add up to 49 percent cane liquor or other
alcohol unless the label states otherwise.
	   In 1996, distillers produced 1.5 million gallons (5.6 million
liters) of mezcal, of which 470,000 gallons (1.8 million liters)
worth dlrs 6.1 million (54 million pesos) was exported. Some 30
percent of exports went to the United States and 20 percent to
Asia. The rest to Europe, South Africa and South America.
	   About 29.6 million gallons (112 million liters) of tequila was
produced in the same period, including nearly 16 million gallons
(60 million liters) that was exported. Forty percent of exports
went to the United States.
	   Unlike modernized tequila factories, mezcal production has
changed little since Spanish conquerors began distilling agave in
the 1500s.
	   Fernando Romero Blas, a mezcal distiller, and a half-dozen
workers trek three hours with burros to harvest wild tobala agave,
just as his forefathers did when they began making mezcal in the
19th century.
	   Later, they will lead a horse-drawn mill stone over
bittersweet-smelling agave baked for days in an earthen pit.
	   But first, they surround the agave and ask Mother Earth's
permission before cutting the plant, which secretes a burning
liquid that causes skin rashes.
	   Romero, a Zapotecan Indian, buries hard-boiled eggs, mangos,
bananas and a burning cigarette in a pottery bowl. He pours mezcal
on the ground in the shape of a cross.
	   Then he pours a bit out for each of his men. Everyone toasts
before starting work.
	   ``We do this as a tribute to Earth,'' Romero says. ``We must
give something back.''

	   QIREZ, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Continued fighting between ethnic
Albanian refugees and Serbian forces has stymied plans to send an
international aid convoy to a devastated former rebel stronghold.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees wanted to send aid to
Malisevo _ a former Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold that fell to
the Serbs in the current offensive. The International Committee of
the Red Cross has reached the valley near Qirez, but the continuing
hostilities has stalled the project.
	   ``We cannot go into a battlefield,'' refugee agency spokesman
Kris Janowski said in Geneva. He compared the situation in Kosovo
to what happened in 1992 in Bosnia, when Bosnian Serb forces
embarked on a policy of trying to empty areas of their non-Serb
populations.
	   ``If this is an attempt to drive Kosovo Albanians out of Kosovo
... that would be total lunacy,'' Janowski said.
	   Serb police have been barring or slowing aid groups and
diplomatic observers from reaching tens of thousands of refugees
driven from villages in the Yugoslav province, where ethnic
Albanian rebels are fighting for independence.
	   Qirez _ a village located about 14 miles (22 kilometers)
northwest of the regional capital of Pristina _ is in a
refugee-filled valley in the western Kosovo region of Drenica. The
region is the target of a Serb onslaught against the rebels that is
now in its ninth day. Serb forces are showing no signs of
relenting, despite Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's promise
last week to stop.
	   When aid workers arrived Tuesday in Qirez, they found hundreds
of desperate people. Refugees crowded around a truck loaded with
boxes of infant medicine and food and hygiene products such as
toothpaste, soap and shampoo. Many have been subsisting on a diet
of water and green peppers.
	   Drenica, historically a center of ethnic Albanian nationalism,
is the largest area still under KLA control. From the hilltops,
smoke was visible Tuesday from burning villages _ including the
former stronghold of Lausa _ now overrun by Serb police in a
symbolic defeat for the KLA.
	   Last November, the secretive rebel group made its first public
appearance in the village. Wearing their uniform of camouflage or
all-black and berets with the red KLA patch, fighters attended the
funeral of a local schoolteacher shot in a Serb crackdown.
	   Milosevic sent forces to crush the KLA in March. Kosovo, located
in Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia, has a population of
2 million. Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
	   After declaring the province on the verge of humanitarian
catastrophe, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill on Tuesday visited a town
captured by Serbs last week to assess the conditions for the return
of refugees.
	   ``Some people have begun to return, but if we are going to have
more people returning, we have to improve the conditions very
quickly,'' he said after his trip to Orahovac, the site of some of
the ugliest fighting in the five-month war.
	   Veton Surroi, a prominent ethnic Albanian politician, claimed
Tuesday that at least 200 people were killed in Orahovac, most of
them in a mosque where they had taken refuge.
	   In Vienna, Austria, the respected newspaper Die Presse said
reporters had found fresh graves of more than 500 people, including
children, in the Orahovac area.
	   A Serb police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
police had buried ``a number of bodies'' in the area after no one
claimed them after more than a week.

Former deputy attorney general barred from holding office in
</HEADLINE>
Mexico &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A former deputy attorney general has been
barred from holding public office for 20 years for allegedly
allowing police to brutalize suspects while he investigated the
assassination of his brother.
	   A resolution by the Comptroller General's Office dated Monday
accused Mario Ruiz Massieu of permitting police to coerce at least
two people into signing depositions in the 1994 case.
	   Ruiz Massieu is now under house arrest in New Jersey and
fighting extradition to Mexico. The comptroller's action is
administrative and does not involve criminal sanctions.
	   The comptroller's office said that on Sept. 28, 1994, Ruiz
Massieu knew about and allowed the federal judicial police chief
and other police officers to coerce witnesses while being
questioned.
	   One of them, Maria Eugenia Ramirez Arauz, a secretary,
``suffered serious pain that resulted in several injuries.''
	   Mexico has been trying to extradite Ruiz Massieu, accusing him
of attempting a cover up in his brother's murder, as well as
alleging illegal enrichment, drug money laundering and corruption.
	   U.S. federal courts rejected the charges because of inconclusive
evidence. An immigration judge dismissed deportation proceedings
against him in May 1997. But the government appealed that decision
and he remains under house arrest.
	   However, the U.S. government won a jury verdict last year,
allowing it to seize dlrs 7.9 million from dlrs 9 million Mario
Ruiz Massieu had in bank accounts in Texas, claiming the money came
from drug traffickers.

	   LOVOZERO, Russia (AP) _ Reindeer mean almost everything to a
Sami. Here, in the capital of Russia's Sami region, there are no
reindeer.
	   The only roaming animals to be seen are starving dogs
desperately searching for food outside the school, not
understanding that the people themselves go hungry and have no
scraps to throw away.
	   ``We are surviving, barely,'' said Nicolay Brylow, mayor of this
town of 3,700 people about 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of
Murmansk on Russia's Kola Peninsula.
	   The wretched conditions in Lovozero contrast sharply with the
lives of Sami in the Arctic reaches of Finland, Sweden and Norway,
where life isn't easy but there is plenty to eat and dogs are
athletic and sleek.
	   For millennia, the Sami _ a name they prefer to Lapp _ thrived
by following their reindeer flocks across Europe's Arctic. Then the
Iron Curtain fell and about 2,000 ended up on the Soviet side.
	   That meant reindeer herds were collectivized, to be tended by a
relatively few herders. The rest of the nomads were sent to
Lovozero.
	   The town is a mix of dreary Soviet-era concrete apartments and
sagging wooden houses, the wood silver-gray from decades of hard
weather and no paint. There are few cars, except the rattletraps of
those who sell shoes and clothes at the open-air market.
	   ``There are families who are starving, and many more that don't
get a balanced diet,'' said Dr. Marina Dubovtseva, a physician at
Lovozero's run-down and poorly supplied hospital.
	   Reindeer were the center of Sami lives, providing food,
clothing, transportation and even objects of religious worship. But
the reindeer now are far away from Lovozero, deep in the tundra,
and the herders' conditions are even worse than those living in
town.
	   ``The herders live under inhuman conditions,'' said Jan Terje
Nedrejord, city manager in Karasjok, Norway, a Sami town of about
3,000 people that is the site of the Norwegian Sami Parliament.
	   The Kola herders live in tents and hovels, with inadequate heat,
food and sanitation, he said.
	   Apart from hunger, the people of Lovozero suffer from
deteriorating health care, a declining birth rate, diseases caused
by pollution and widespread alcoholism. They often lack heat in
their homes during the bitter Arctic winter, and as many as half
are unemployed.
	   Conditions appear to be getting worse.
	   Formerly state-owned ``companies that process meat are either
bankrupt or about to go bankrupt, and they can't pay for the
products,'' said Olga Novriva, director of Tundra, one of two
reindeer cooperatives in the district.
	   Norwegian Sami are buying meat and also training young Russian
Sami in modern herding and the skills needed to process meat
locally, Novriva said.
	   About 200 kilometers (125 miles) to the west, the Sami of the
Nordic countries enjoy the generous social programs of the welfare
state. They have Sami colleges, newspapers and special rights as a
native people.
	   When the Nordic Sami reestablished contact with their kinsmen in
Russia in the early 1990s, they set up language and cultural
programs. That was quickly expanded to include soup kitchens and
donations of warm clothing, medicines and even small cash gifts.
	   ``We realized things are very bad in Lovozero,'' said Ante Javo,
a Norwegian Sami who leads the Karasjok-Lovozero Friendship
Society.
	   Jobs are scarce in Lovozero, especially with the biggest
employer, a mine and smelter that employed 1,300, shutting down.
	   Reindeer herding is again the main industry, employing 220
people. That is struggling, too, because the fragile tundra can't
withstand grazing by more than the current 65,000 reindeer.
	   ``It is impossible to increase production,'' said Novriva, at
the reindeer cooperative.
	   Despite daily hardships, the Kola Sami still seek their roots.
The local culture center is full of reindeer skin boots and
clothing, beaded jewelry and traditional handcrafts for sale.
	   Jakob Jakovlev showed off a knife with a carved reindeer horn
handle that he made with tools donated by Swedish Sami.
	   ``The Kola version of the Sami knife was lost, but we discovered
it again in photographs in the national archives,'' he said.
	   In another room at the center, adult Sami struggled to learn
their ancestral Sami dialect, Kildin, in a Norwegian-financed
course.
	   ``In the past, Sami were ashamed to call themselves Sami. Now it
is very much different. People want to learn,'' said Larisa
Avdeeva, head of the Kola Sami Association. ``We never lost our
roots as Sami.''

Serbs enraged by death of Serb war crimes suspect in U.N. custody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The already strained relationship
between the Serbians and the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal has
worsened following last week's prison death of a Serb suspect in
U.N. custody
	   Milan Kovacevic, accused of atrocities during the Bosnian war,
died Saturday of a heart attack, triggering an avalanche of
allegations from Serb authorities that the Netherlands-based U.N.
court is anti-Serb.
	   In a statement published Tuesday in the state-run daily
Politika, the Yugoslav Justice Ministry said it had sent a sharp
protest to the tribunal, accusing it of ``inadequate medical
treatment for Dr. Kovacevic during his detention.''
	   The ministry said his death ``prevented Kovacevic from proving
his innocence before the tribunal'' and the court's ``reputation
has been brought into question.''
	   Kovacevic's death came just a month after another Serb suspect
in custody hanged himself in his high-security prison cell.
	   ``Only Serbs die in the Hague'' and ``Court without Justice''
were among headlines broadcast in the pro-government dailies here.
	   Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said last week that
Kovacevic had been under regular care by a heart specialist when he
died, and denied that the tribunal was lax in its care or
surveillance of jailed suspects.
	   Kovacevic, 57, had a history of health problems and had suffered
strokes. His lawyers say he had been denied medical treatment he
requested shortly before his death.
	   ``A person with such a serious heart problem had to be treated,
not left to die in a prison cell,'' said the Yugoslav government
committee in charge of cooperation with the Tribunal.
	   NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia apprehended Kovacevic last
summer. He was accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against
humanity for alleged atrocities committed in northwest Bosnia's
Prijedor region in 1992.
	   He had pleaded innocent to all 15 charges against him and faced
a possible life sentence if convicted.
	   His was the U.N. court's first trial to deal specifically with
genocide. It began on July 6.
	   Yugoslavia, widely blamed for inciting the wars in Croatia and
Bosnia, has so far refused to extradite several suspects. Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic also has dodged demands to help
extradition of two top suspects, Bosnian Serb wartime leaders,
Radovan Karadzic and Gen. Ratko Mladic, who are presumed in hiding
somewhere in the Serb half of Bosnia.
	   Yugoslavia and the Serb leaders in Bosnia have been helpful to
the tribunal only in investigations concerning crimes against
Serbs.

Official: Time running out for former interns to gain reparations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ A U.S. group on Tuesday urged Latin Americans
who were interned in Texas camps during World War II to act quickly
to take advantage of a reparations offer.
	   The United States announced two months ago that it would give
these Latins of Japanese heritage dlrs 5,000 each and an apology.
	   But the deadline for filing such a claim is Aug. 10 and many
qualified people still have not done so, Grace Shimizu of the
California-based Campaign for Justice, which fought for the
reparation, said in Lima.
	   Some 2,264 Latin Americans of Japanese descent, 80 percent of
whom were Peruvian, were held in the United States.
	   The U.S. government has never provided an explanation for the
internments, though many were later exchanged for U.S. prisoners of
war held in Japan.
	   The Latin Americans are particularly angry that
Japanese-Americans imprisoned during the war were awarded dlrs
20,000 by the U.S. government in a 1988 decision.
	   ``All of us were in the same situation, in the same
concentration camp ... It is such an open, unjust and irrational
discrimination that it is not acceptable,'' said German Yaki, who
was forcibly taken from Peru at age 12.
	   Yaki, 69, said a group of Latin Americans is planning to appeal
the U.S. decision in November, demanding the same compensation as
that received by Japanese Americans. He did not give further
details.
	   Shimizu, who visited Peru to warn people of the deadline, said
that 650 claims have been filed with the U.S. government and
another 300 to 500 people who are eligible still have not filed.
	   ``The Latin American-Japanese have waited more than 50 years for
an apology from the U.S. government. Now they can lose this if they
don't file their claim on time,'' she said.

Two Jewish settlers killed, talks stuck over West Bank withdrawal

<TEXT>
	   ITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ As tensions heightened between Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators over a proposed West Bank troop
withdrawal, two Jewish settlers were shot and killed early
Wednesday in the area that Israel says it is reluctant to give up.
	   The killings outside the Jewish settlement of Itzhar in the West
Bank were likely to complicate peace talks, already at an impasse.
	   The Palestinians have rejected Israeli proposals to alter an
American peace initiative that calls for Israel to withdraw its
troops from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank. The
Palestinians already have full or partial control over about
one-quarter of the territory.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure from
the strong Jewish settler lobby and right-wing members of his
Cabinet, has rejected the American plan, saying it would harm
Israel's security by isolating several communities that include
Itzhar.
	   Israel has offered to pull its troops from 10 percent of the
territory and turn another 3 percent into a nature reserve where it
would retain overall security. But Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
rejected the Israeli proposal on Tuesday.
	   Still, Jewish settler leaders said even a 10 percent withdrawal
would have left Itzhar cut off and said Wednesday's killings were a
harbinger of things to come if the pullback goes through.
	   ``This is a tragic example of what is likely to occur in
ten-fold when troop redeployments are carried out. Itzhar, and
another 18 settlements will be turned into isolated islands,'' said
Settler Council leader Ahron Dombe. Dombe called on Netanyahu to
cancel talks until the assailants were found.
	   Following the shootings, Israel placed a curfew on four
surrounding Palestinian villages and said it was searching the area
for the shooters.
	   Like most Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Itzhar is perched
on a dusty, barren hilltop and looks out onto several small
Palestinians village on surrounding hillsides. Israel still
controls most of the area, allowing it to clamp down on the
villages, set up road blocks and conduct door-to-door searches for
suspects.
	   But the impending troop withdrawal would change that. Israeli
soldiers would not longer be allowed into the villages that lay
between Itzhar and the large Palestinian-run city of Nablus, 10 kms
(6 miles) away.
	   In Nablus, Palestinian police commander Isam el-Dobi said Israel
had informed Palestinian authorities of the shooting and
Palestinian police were meeting to discuss possible coordination in
the case.
	   Israel and the Palestinians have been haggling for months over
the scope of the long overdue Israeli withdrawal and a U.S. peace
plan to get it off the ground.
	   More than two weeks of direct negotiations, after American
mediators failed to bridge gaps, has not yielded any progress. On
Tuesday, the Palestinians signaled they may leave the talks
altogether.
	   At Itzhar, settlers prepared funerals for the two men killed at
approximately 1:00 a.m. while on a routine nightly jeep patrol of
the settlement boundaries.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said the settlers, whose
names were not immediately released, were killed while in their
jeep. Dombe said one of the men managed to radio for help shortly
after they were first fired upon. Dombe said the assailants then
came within close range of the jeep and fired an additional bullet
into the heads of each man, killing them instantly.

Capriati knocked out of Toshiba Tennis Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARLSBAD, California (AP) _ The latest comeback attempt of
Jennifer Capriati again ended in the first round.
	   Capriati, a teen phenom on the WTA tour in the early 1990s, was
beaten 5-7, 6-2, 6-2 by Ai Sugiyama of Japan on Tuesday in the dlrs
450,000 Toshiba Tennis Classic at the La Costa Resort and Spa.
	   It was the sixth time in 10 WTA tournaments this season Capriati
has been knocked out in the first round.
	   ``So close, but yet so far,'' said Capriati, 22. ``It's been
real disappointing.''
	   In other matches Tuesday, Joannette Kruger of South Africa beat
seventh-seeded Irina Spirlea of Romania 3-6, 6-2, 6-4; No. 5
Conchita Martinez of Spain beat Kimberly Po 6-4, 6-2; and No. 8
Nathalie Tauziat of France eliminated qualifier Shi-Ting Wang of
Taiwan 7-5, 3-6, 6-1.
	   Tauziat struggled in her first match since July 4 when she lost
to Belgium's Jana Novotna in the finals at Wimbledon.
	   ``It's never easy when you play a qualifier,'' Tauziat said.
``They have played matches already and I haven't played since
July.''
	   Capriati is a two-time winner of the La Costa event, capturing
titles in 1991 and 1992. In the 1991 final, she defeated Monica
Seles, then the top-ranked player in the world. Capriati was ranked
sixth in the world as a 15-year-old in 1991.
	   After leaving the tour in late 1993, Capriati has been beset by
various off-the-court problems. She made an abbreviated
one-tournament comeback in 1994, then stayed away from tennis until
launching another comeback in February 1996. She has played
infrequently since then.
	   Capriati had to win three qualifying matches just to move into
the main draw this year.
	   ``I let up in the second set,'' she said. ``It wasn't really in
my control. I played three matches in a row. I think I was a little
fatigued.''
	   Capriati cruised in the first set. After falling behind 2-1 in
the second set, Sugiyama won the final five games.
	   ``I've been playing good first sets and letting up in the second
sets,'' Capriati said. ``You can't really do that against these
girls.''
	   Her loss showed she still has a long way to go from her current
ranking of No. 111.
	   Kruger's victory was unexpected because she's been in a slump
beginning with the French Open in June, winning just three matches
in her last five tournaments.
	   ``The only way for me to win the match is to go for it,'' Kruger
said. ``It's been a long time since I've been this aggressive for
the whole match.''

Three veterans dropped from New Zealand side
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Veteran New Zealand flanker Michael
Jones, his longtime partner Mark Carter and Walter Little have paid
the price for the All Blacks' three consecutive rugby union losses
in the Tri Nations series.
	   All three were dropped from the team that will leave for South
Africa on Friday for its last Tri Nations match on Aug. 15 in
Durban.
	   Norm Berryman has been included in the All Blacks for the first
time while Auckland fullback Adrian Cashmore has been recalled for
the first time since his axing ahead of the tour to Britain last
year.
	   Flanker Josh Kronfeld will require a clearance Thursday from a
concussion he suffered in the match against South Africa in
Wellington before he can join the 26-man squad.
	   Not considered because of injury were prop Mark Allen (back),
hooker Norm Hewitt (knee), Alama Ieremia (foot) and center Caleb
Ralph (thigh).
	   Hart said the omission of the 55-test veteran Jones resulted
from a need to look ahead to next year.
	   ``I know Michael would love to have gone to South Africa but he
understands we are now looking at players to take us through to the
rugby World Cup,'' Hart said.
	   Jones said in a statement he realized the focus of the team was
next year.
	   ``I was dearly looking forward to contributing to an All Black
team going to South Africa and Australia to restore some pride and
to have the opportunity to be in a winning All Black team again.
However, I understand why the selectors are bringing on some new
players.
	   ``They have made it clear it is nothing to do with my form and I
respect their decision to look ahead to next year.''
	   Little is being rested partly owing to form and an ongoing foot
injury.
	   The New Zealand team: Christian Cullen, Adrian Cashmore, Jeff

Paper cranes marking Hiroshima atomic bomb anniversary burned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Thousands of folded paper cranes commemorating the
53rd anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing have been
found burned in a schoolyard in Hiroshima, police said Wednesday.
	   The destruction of the cranes occurred Tuesday, as Hiroshima
prepared events to mark the U.S. atomic attack on the southwestern
Japanese city on August 6, 1945.
	   ``Because of the timing, we can't help but think the incident is
connected with the anniversary,'' said a police spokesman, who gave
his surname, Kami.
	   The 5,800 ``origami,'' or folded, cranes _ a symbol of peace and
longevity in Japan _ were part of a memorial monument in the
courtyard of a Hiroshima junior high school.
	   Police were investigating the incident, but had not found any
suspects.
	   Every year, Hiroshima residents unite on Aug. 6 for a moment of
silence and ceremonies to commemorate the atomic bombing that
devastated their city and killed about 140,000 people.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was to leave Wednesday for
Hiroshima to attend the memorial events.
	   On Tuesday, the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs
launched a three-day anti-nuclear convention in the city.
	   Entitled ``From the Nuclear Age to a Nuclear-Free 21st
Century,'' the series of seminars and events will protest the
nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan this year, organizers
said.

Tokyo stocks slightly lower in early trading, dollar slides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late morning stock, bond and currency rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices fell early Wednesday
following an overnight plunge on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar
traded lower against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 180.82 points, or 1.13
percent, to close the morning session at 15,842.76 points. On
Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 141.50 points, or 0.88 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section slipped 9.03 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,225.58.
The TOPIX closed down 10.63 points, or 0.85 percent, the day
before.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average recorded its
biggest point loss of the year and its third worst ever, dropping
299.43 points, or 3.41 percent, to 8,487.31.
	   Traders said, however, that the Tokyo market was relatively firm
despite the overnight drop in New York because of expectations for
further action from Japan's new government to stimulate the
economy.
	   On the Tokyo exchange, modest gains in some financial shares _
which have suffered heavy losses recently amid worries about the
economy _ helped offset losses in technology issues.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and senior policy makers of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party on Tuesday agreed on a plan to cut
personal income taxes by about 4 trillion yen (U.S. dlrs 27.7
billion) and corporate taxes by 2 trillion yen (dlrs 13.8 billion).
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 144.01 yen in
morning trading, down 0.61 yen from late in Tokyo on Tuesday and
lower than its late New York rate of 144.97 yen overnight.
	   The dollar weakened in line with the sharp overnight fall on
Wall Street.
	   The yen got a boost against the dollar as investors were
encouraged that the government seemed to be moving quickly to
implement its tax-cut plans, dealers said.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.210 percent from Tuesday's finish of
1.220 percent, driving its price up to 111.72 yen from 111.66 yen.

White House lawyer testifies after Chief Justice rejects plea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN SOLOMON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Pressing their investigation into the circle
of White House lawyers, prosecutors in the Monica Lewinsky case
questioned one of President Bill Clinton's legal troubleshooters
before a grand jury Tuesday after Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist refused to allow further delays.
	   White House special counsel Lanny Breuer spent several hours
before the grand jury investigating an alleged presidential affair
and coverup, but his appearance ended with another courtroom
dispute that threatened to rekindle a battle over attorney-client
privilege.
	   Breuer, White House lawyers and prosecutors from Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office met behind closed doors with U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson after the appearance over
questions he declined to answer, legal sources said.
	   The sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the court rulings left open the possibility that
the White House could try a second time to ask the U.S. Court of
Appeals or Rehnquist to spare Breuer from answering questions they
believe infringe on Clinton's right to confidential advice.
	   There was no indication at the courts late Wednesday of such a
request though.
	   An affable and respected lawyer, Breuer arrived at the
courthouse to a throng of reporters who asked his reaction about
all the fuss his appearance had caused. ``I'm honored,'' he
quipped.
	   White House officials said Breuer was unlikely to possess much
firsthand knowledge about Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
But his role in processing subpoenas, gathering documents and
contacting witnesses placed him in the middle of the president's
damage control effort.
	   Prosecutors probing possible obstruction of justice and witness
tampering are likely to press him about what he did and observed in
the early days of the Lewinsky controversy.
	   Legal sources said former White House deputy chief of staff
Harold Ickes was scheduled to appear Wednesday before the grand
jury and that it was also possible Breuer could return.
	   Breuer's appearance was made possible by a series of court
victories by Starr involving one of Breuer's colleagues, deputy
counsel and presidential confidant Bruce Lindsey.
	   A federal judge and the appeals court both ruled government-paid
lawyers like Lindsey cannot use a claim of attorney-client
privilege to refuse to answer questions in a federal criminal
investigation. The White House is appealing those rulings to the
Supreme Court.
	   With those victories in hand, Starr subpoenaed Breuer to appear
Tuesday while Lindsey recuperates from back surgery.
	   The White House asked both the appeals court and Rehnquist to
issue an emergency stay that would block any questioning of Lindsey
or Breuer until the justices decide whether to take the case.
	   The White House made clear it fears that more of its lawyers,
possibly even Counsel Charles Ruff, now will be summoned. ``We
anticipate that additional subpoenas will soon follow,'' it told
the Supreme Court in a filing.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Mike Mussina lost his perfect game with two
outs in the eighth inning Tuesday night and settled for a
two-hitter, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Detroit Tigers
4-0.
	   Mussina, who has flirted with a no-hitter twice before in his
seven-year career, retired the first 23 batters before Frank
Catalanotto lined a double into the right-field corner.
	   He was the only baserunner against Mussina (10-5) until Deivi
Cruz grounded a single up the middle with one out in the ninth.
	   Mussina did not face a three-ball count. The right-hander, who
twice before this season spent time on the disabled list, struck
out eight.
	   Mussina retired the first 25 Cleveland Indians on May 30, 1997,
before Sandy Alomar singled with one out in the ninth.
	   Eric Davis homered to extend his hitting streak to a career-high
21 games as Baltimore improved to 19-5 since the All-Star break.
	   Bryce Florie (5-6) took the loss.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Devil Rays 6 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Albert Belle and Robert Machado
homered and Chicago's bullpen limited Tampa Bay to three hits in
the last six innings.
	   Belle's homer, a solo shot in the sixth inning off Esteban Yan,
was his 34th this season and 16th in 25 games since the All-Star
break.
	   Mike Kelly hit two home runs for Tampa Bay, which did not have a
hit in between his two-run homer in the third and his solo shot in
the eighth.
	   Machado, a rookie catcher recalled from Triple-A Calgary on
Sunday, made up for an error that cost the White Sox a run with a
three-run homer off Tony Saunders (3-10).
	   Carlos Castillo (5-4) pitched three innings in relief of White
Sox starter Jim Parque for the victory. Bill Simas got four outs
for his 11th save.
 &UR; Yankees 10, Athletics 4, 1st Game &QC; 
	   In Oakland, California, Chuck Knoblauch and Darryl Strawberry
homered for the second straight game as New York won the opener.
	   Knoblauch, who had two homers and a career-high five RBIs on
Monday, hit his 13th homer of the season leading off the game.
Knoblauch, who has nine homers since the All-Star break, matched
his career-high set in 1996.
	   Strawberry added his team-leading 19th homer, a two-run shot in
the fifth to give the Yankees a 7-3 lead. Strawberry has homered in
each of his last four starts.
	   Ramiro Mendoza (7-2) allowed four runs and seven hits in 6 1-3
innings in just his second start since early June.
	   Mike Stanton retired eight straight for his sixth save.

O'Brien drops Kuerten in du Maurier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates with late matches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Alex O'Brien, who qualified for the main draw
when Thomas Enqvist withdrew, upset Gustavo Kuerten 6-3, 7-6 (7-2)
Tuesday in the dlrs 2.4 million du Maurier Open.
	   O'Brien had to retire during qualifying Sunday because of
cramps. But when Enqvist, the No. 12 seed pulled out, O'Brien made
the field as the top-ranked qualifying loser.
	   ``I was so nervous (in qualifying) that I couldn't hit a ball on
the court,'' O'Brien said. ``I guess I have some mental troubles,
my mind is not too clear.
	   ``But I had an extra day and all I did was relax and sleep in
late and that seemed to help.''
	   Against Kuerten, the No. 12 seed and 1997 French Open champion,
O'Brien showed a strong serve-and-volley game.
	   ``I was thinking I was going to be on TV, I could go out there
and make a complete ass of myself and lose 6-0, 6-0,'' O'Brien
said. ``But maybe that helped me relax a little because when you
think about the worst thing that could happen to you, really, the
bottom line is it's not that bad.''
	   In 1997, O'Brien rose to No. 30 in the ATP rankings, a jump of
172 spots. He has since slid to No. 147.
	   ``The greatest feeling for a tennis player is to win,'' he said.
``The mind is 95 percent of this game and if I can keep it clear
and focused then I can win some matches.''
	   Kuerten's head was never in the game.
	   ``I've played too many tournaments,'' he said. ``I wasn't too
motivated to play and I'm a little bit tired. I didn't even see
what he was doing, what I was doing.''
	   In other matches, sixth-seeded Richard Krajicek reached the
third round with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over South African David
Nainkin and seventh-seeded Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden defeated
Australian Scott Draper 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 in the other second-round
match.
	   Also, No. 9 seed Alberto Costa of Spain defeated Australia's
Jason Stoltenberg 7-5, 6-4; No. 15 Fabrice Santoro of France downed
Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-4; and 17th-seeded Nicolas
Kiefer of Germany beat Canada's Daniel Nestor 6-2, 7-6 (7-1).
	   No. 16 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa retired five games into
his match with Australia's Michael Tebbutt because of a groin
injury.
	   Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev withdrew with the flu before his match
with France's Guillaume Raoux. He was replaced by Finnish qualifier
Tuomas Ketola, who lost 7-5, 6-3.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Pressing their investigation into the circle
of White House lawyers, prosecutors in the Monica Lewinsky case
questioned one of President Bill Clinton's legal troubleshooters
before a grand jury Tuesday after Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist refused to allow further delays.
	   White House special counsel Lanny Breuer spent several hours
before the grand jury investigating an alleged presidential affair
and coverup, but his appearance ended with another courtroom
dispute that threatened to rekindle a battle over attorney-client
privilege.
	   Breuer, White House lawyers and prosecutors from Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's office met behind closed doors with U.S.
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson after the appearance over
questions he declined to answer, legal sources said.
	   The sources familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the court rulings left open the possibility that
the White House could try a second time to ask the U.S. Court of
Appeals or Rehnquist to spare Breuer from answering questions they
believe infringe on Clinton's right to confidential advice.
	   There was no indication at the courts late Tuesday of such a
request though.

Government promises only tax cheats will be hurt by new tax plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Wednesday promised that his new tax package, which will include a
goods and services tax, will benefit all Australians.
	   The tax plan is expected to introduce a 10 percent goods and
services tax, but will also slash diesel fuel taxes to benefit
farmers and include hefty income tax cuts.
	   Treasurer Peter Costello announced the package, which is the
centerpiece of Howard's re-election campaign, will be made public
Aug. 13.
	   Howard said everyone would be a winner under the package.
	   ``I don't believe anybody, when you look at the generality of
the package, will be worse off except tax cheats,'' Howard told a
radio station.
	   Howard rejected comments by Queensland National Party director
Ken Crooke that the Senate, where Howard's government is in the
minority, is certain to reject the tax plan.
	   ``The government will put the plan before the Australian people
at the next election, whenever it is held, to give the government a
mandate not only in the House of Representatives, but also in the
Senate,'' Howard said.
	   But many members of the junior partner in Howard's governing
coalition, the rural National Party, oppose the tax plan and say it
should at least be delayed until the Asian economic crisis eases.
	   They are saying it is electoral suicide to go into an election _
which must be held by March 1999 _ promising voters new taxes.
	   Howard's party lost in a landslide in 1993 when it campaigned on
a similar plan to introduce a goods and services tax.

Thailand's famed crocodile tamer dies at 84
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ After decades of defying death in
crocodile shows, Thailand's most famous hunter and tamer of
crocodiles has died of lung disease at the age of 84, a spokesman
for the Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm said Wednesday.
	   Yuen Charoensuk, also known as Uncle Yao, died from emphysema on
Aug. 2 at the Vajiraprakan Hospital on the outskirts of Bangkok,
said Thananya Chankrachang, public relations director for the
Crocodile Farm.
	   Tourists from around the world have witnessed Yuen's shows since
he began performing at the farm in 1973. During his act he would
always put his head inside a crocodile's jaws.
	   Part Thai and part Vietnamese, he learned to hunt and tame
crocodiles from a Buddhist monk while visiting Cambodia during the
1960s. According to local folklore, Uncle Yao used black magic to
hunt and kill hundreds of dangerous crocodiles in Cambodia and
Thailand.

Property agency says restrictive Thai laws stop sector rebound
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Restrictive laws that limit foreign
ownership are killing a potential rebound in Thailand's depressed
real estate sector, an international consultant said Wednesday.
	   Unless they are changed ``international investors will continue
to shun Thailand and will increasingly turn their attention to
opportunities elsewhere,'' said a report issued by Jones Lang
Wootton, a real estate consulting company.
	   Sales of buildings to local residents and foreign investors have
dropped drastically with few transactions reported during the first
half of 1998, the company said.
	   ``Two major reasons are the unwillingness of owners to accept
market realities and the wait-and-see approach of foreign
investors,'' the report said.
	   Massive oversupply in the property sector helped spark
Thailand's economic crisis in 1997. Banks and finance companies
lent heavily to developers who could not pay back the loans when
they could not sell their projects.
	   Yet despite oversupply and an economy in sharp recession, prices
have not dropped to levels many potential buyers want to see, the
consultant said.
	   ``Many investors are also awaiting positive changes to laws and
regulations about which there has been much talk but considerably
less action,'' the report said.
	   Among them are easing the limits on foreign ownership.
Foreigners are not allowed to own land in Thailand, and are
restricted to owning a maximum of 40 percent of any condominium
project and 49 percent of any company.
	   Although there have been proposals to change these laws, they
have met stiff resistance in parliament.
	   Jones Lang Wootton also urged that laws be changed to allow
foreigners to take leases on land or buildings for up to 99 years,
instead of the maximum 30 now allowed. Many foreign investors feel
that 30 years may not be long enough to get the return they are
hoping for on their projects, the report said.

Malaysia has 198 people detained under security law
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's prime minister said 198
people were in jail under a powerful law that allows imprisonment
without trial, according to a news report Wednesday.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said that 124 of those held
under the Internal Security Act, as the law is known, were detained
for forging national identity cards and travel documents, the Sun
newspaper reported.
	   Mahathir's comments were made in a written statement in
parliament Tuesday.
	   Another 66 people were being held for smuggling illegal
immigrants into the country, seven for deviant Islamic practices
and one person for involvement with a freedom movement in Aceh, an
independence-seeking region of Indonesia.
	   Earlier this year, 22 asylum-seekers from Aceh sought refuge in
the U.S. Embassy and U.N. compound after a violent police raid on
an illegal immigrant detention center left at least nine dead.
	   The United Nations granted the 22 men asylum, although Malaysia
does not recognize the Acehense as political refugees.
	   Mahathir said eight of the ISA detainees had been held for more
than two years, the statement said.
	   The ISA was introduced by British colonial rulers in 1948 to
fight communist guerrillas. Independent Malaysia retained the law
which allows for indefinite detention without trial.
	   It has been used in the past against opposition politicians,
activists and even academics who criticized the government.
