<HEADLINE> Fans Peeved As Stanley Cup Sold Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A glass door was rammed today by angry fans  
who camped all night in the rain only to be told that all tickets 
to the Stanley Cup finals were sold in eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hell no, we won't go!'' fans shouted outside Marine Midland  
Arena after learning shortly after 9 a.m. that no more tickets were 
left for the Buffalo Sabres' first appearance in the finals in 25 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Two fans picked up a metal barricade and rammed it into a locked  
glass door as arena employees and security officers waited for 
police to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	A burst of rain dispersed much of the crowd after a few tense  
moments, but others parked themselves on lawn chairs outside the 
arena, where they insisted they would stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted a seat,'' said Rob Blaser, who arrived at the  
arena at 9 p.m. Monday while the Sabres and Toronto Maple Leafs 
were still playing their fifth and final game of the Eastern 
Conference Finals. The Sabres won 4-2, eliminating Toronto 4 games 
to 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have not been to the finals since 1975. The chance to  
see them brought Adam Becker and his sister, Amanda, to the arena 
about 7:10 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty cold after a while,'' said Becker, who said he  
was upset with flyers indicating they could still purchase playoff 
tickets for this year with a nonrefundable $500 deposit toward the 
purchase of season tickets for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a marketing scheme so they're guaranteed to sell out  
next year,'' Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Bertovich, the Sabres' executive vice president of  
administration, said the team had reserved 200 to 300 tickets for 
that purpose. Season ticket holders are guaranteed a chance to 
purchase playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you commit now for a season ticket for next year you can  
enjoy that benefit immediately,'' Bertovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertovich said 14,000 tickets for each game of the finals were  
purchased in advance by season ticket holders and fans who 
purchased 10-packs of tickets for the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 other tickets went to the National Hockey League,  
competing teams and ownership, and 300 more were lost to an 
auxiliary press box, he said. That left about 2,000 tickets per 
game for the general public, available at the box office and 
through Tops supermarkets, an Internet site, and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	About 590 tickets sold in the first minute, Bertovich said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to put tickets in as many people's hands as  
possible,'' he said. ``There was a small quantity for the level of 
interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Schappert was one of a group of newly graduated St.  
Francis High School students willing to wait all night to spend his 
graduation money on tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew we weren't going to get tickets and they let us stay  
here overnight,'' he said, disappointed and wet from the rain. 
``There were 3,000 people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Szpylman, 16, and his 20-year-old friend Tony Failla spent  
14 hours in line, only to be shut out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my whole life to go to a Stanley Cup  
final,'' Szpylman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe this,'' Failla said. ``I want to die.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Major Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies  
Tuesday as inflation fears roiled U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was about selling dollars rather than about buying yen  
or buying the euro,'' said Rob Podoresky, a foreign exchange vice 
president at BankBoston. ``It's a dollar trade rather than a 
currency trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0442, up  
from $1.0418 Friday. U.S. currency markets were closed Monday in 
observance of Memorial Day. The dollar fell to 120.56 yen from 
121.43 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors ran from markets Tuesday as the National Association  
of Purchasing Management reported that its price index jumped to 
52.2 in May from 49.9 percent in April, the first time since 
December 1997 that manufacturers were seeing higher prices for raw 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the NAPM report showed that the industrial economy  
remained strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is the price action is creating a lot of uncertainty  
about where U.S. interest rates are going,'' Podoresky said. ``And 
currency markets don't like uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and investors interpreted the price index hike to mean  
that inflation was revving up after remaining dormant for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also were aware that the Federal Reserve last month  
said that it was prepared to raise interest rates to prevent the 
economy from overheating if inflation shows signs of returning. 
</P>
<P>
	Although rising interest rates typically are supportive of a  
country's currency, in this case they are felt to mean that 
businesses will have a harder time getting loans to conduct 
business. Inflation, in addition, would cut into profits. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. stocks were mostly lower Tuesday, extending last week's  
retreat, although the Dow industrials rebounded from a steep loss 
to end the day with a gain. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Treasury bonds fell sharply, sending long-term yields  
closer to 6 percent and the highest level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a real case of indigestion in the bond market,''  
Podoresky said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5238 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5288, and 1.4835 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4704. The British 
pound rose to $1.6121 from $1.6003. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro no longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8730 German marks, down from 1.8781; 6.2814 French francs, down 
from 6.2964; and 1,855.29 Italian lire, down from 1,858.74.

<HEADLINE> Pharmaceutical Maker Issues Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Home Products, the world's  
seventh-largest pharmaceutical maker, warned Tuesday that 
second-quarter earnings would fall significantly short of Wall 
Street estimates due to weak sales of products for protecting crops 
and livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting earnings of 41 cents a share for the  
quarter ending June 30, but results will only hit 34 cents, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the announcement was made after the markets closed,  
word leaked out enough to push American Home's stock down $5.62 1/2, 
or by almost 10 percent, to $52 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home is best known for its line of  
consumer goods, including Robitussin cough syrup, Advil pain 
reliever and Chap Stick lip balm. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the lower-than-expected earnings, American Home said its  
top drugs-- Premarin, an estrogen replacement, and rheumatoid 
arthritis drug Enbrel-- are performing well. 
</P>
<P>
	But the company said ``unsatisfactory conditions'' in the  
agricultural and livestock businesses are expected to continue into 
next year, 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously disappointed with the performance of our  
agricultural and livestock animal health businesses and are 
concerned about their outlook for the near future,'' said Mr. John 
R. Stafford, chairman and chief executive officer. ``We are 
reviewing strategic alternatives with respect to the agricultural 
product and livestock businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company has been plagued with thousands of lawsuits over its  
recalled diet drugs, Pondimin, half of the popular fen-phen 
combination, and Redux, as well as its birth control device 
Norplant. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products has been among the weaker performing big  
pharmaceutical makers. The company nearly merged with Monsanto Inc. 
last year before the deal was called off in October. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home makes numerous herbicides and insecticides that  
farmers use to protect their crops. But with commodity prices at 
their lowest levels in a decade, farmers are choosing the lowest- 
cost chemicals instead of more popular brand names, American Home 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural product sales declined 18 percent in the first  
quarter due to lower herbicide sales as wholesalers built 
inventories last year. Agriculture products make up about 16 
percent of the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the company's animal health medicines has also fallen  
as farmers try to contend with dwindling prices for beef and swine, 
the company said. Animal Health makes up less than 6 percent of 
total sales.

<HEADLINE> Officials Fear Hantavirus Outbreak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Four New Mexicans have died this year of  
hantavirus, and experts are worried this could be the beginning of 
an especially bad year for the mouse-borne disease. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico has had five cases altogether this year: the four  
deaths, plus a 10-year-old who survived a hantavirus infection. 
</P>
<P>
	In all of last year, the state had a total of six cases,  
compared with two cases in 1997 and one in 1996. There were four 
deaths in all of 1998 and none in the two previous years. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this year's cases have been from the northwestern part of  
the state, where the strain of hantavirus labeled ``Sin Nombre'' or 
``No Name'' was first recognized in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A hantavirus expert, Dr. Brian Hjelle, said there have been more  
than two dozen cases since the beginning of 1998 in the Four 
Corners states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. That 
includes two cases this year in Arizona and one in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than twice as many as in the previous three years  
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conventional wisdom is, it's El Nino,'' said Hjelle, a  
professor in the pathology department at the University of New 
Mexico School of Medicine. The cyclical warming of the Pacific 
Ocean made for a wetter-than-usual 1997-98, followed by a milder, 
drier winter just past. 
</P>
<P>
	More rainfall creates greater ground cover and a bigger food  
supply for rodents. That can mean more deer mice, which carry the 
hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease is typically transmitted by airborne particles of  
rodent feces and urine. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been  
confirmed in 30 states since the 1993 outbreak -- some of them 
older, mysterious cases that weren't solved until hantavirus was 
identified. Nearly 45 percent of all cases are fatal.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Committee Reform Talks Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Evolution, not revolution, was the  
theme as the International Olympic Committee opened debate Tuesday 
on ways to change in the wake of its biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was among several  
speakers who called on the IOC to be more open, accountable and 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	And several athletes, including speedskating great Johan Olav  
Koss, challenged the IOC to give a bigger voice to those who 
actually compete in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opening session of the IOC's new reform commission was  
also tempered by words of caution about moving too far too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates warned against radical change in a 105-year-old  
organization which has survived world wars, terrorism and boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not feel obliged to revolutionize the whole system, as  
some critics inspired by commercial and political interests have 
requested,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up the day's talks, IOC spokesman Franklin  
Servan-Schreiber said: ``We need to adapt and to update the 
structure of the IOC -- not destroy and rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday marked the first meeting of IOC 2000, an 80-member  
reform commission created in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which continues talks Wednesday, is examining ways of  
reshaping the IOC's structure and the process for selecting Olympic 
host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to consider changes to the way IOC  
members are selected, including introducing term limits and 
reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are scheduled 
to be adopted at a special IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger -- one of 36 outside members on the commission -- said  
it was time for the IOC to ``adjust to new realities'' and be more 
open and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger suggested the IOC widen its membership to include  
outside groups on a rotating basis. He said the committee's 
meetings should be open ``as far as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest words came from Koss, winner of three gold medals  
at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the IOC determined to remain a private club or open to  
transparency and accountability?'' Koss said. ``If not, the IOC 
will remain the same, which will ensure further corruption and 
abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the democratically elected IOC athletes'  
commission, Koss proposed that 10 more members be elected to the 
panel and that all 20 athletes be appointed to the IOC itself. He 
suggested that two athletes serve on the decision-making IOC 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ctvrtlik, who played on three U.S. Olympic volleyball teams,  
said athletes ``do have a voice, but it's a small voice. If we are 
to have a role as a third pillar in the Olympic movement, we have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassiba Boulmerka, the Algerian runner who won the 1,500-meter  
gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said the IOC must change 
from being an ``institution of elderly men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes ``are the most legitimate people in the IOC,'' she  
said. ``We were elected. We should have the most power.' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
urged the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bigger is not better,'' he said. ``If the games get any  
bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must 
be restraint of growth or the games will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth said the IOC should ensure that money flows to those  
who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the Olympic movement is at the top of the  
mountain of sport,'' he said. ``At the next level are sponsors and 
officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Macaloon, an Olympic scholar at the University of Chicago,  
said the IOC faced a moral crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People hope the reforms produce an IOC that is the servant of  
the Olympic movement and less an IOC that sometimes mistakes itself 
for the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports and an IOC 2000  
member, said American athletes were suffering from ``cynical ... 
self-serving'' attacks on the IOC by John Hancock insurance 
president David D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company is a top-level Olympic sponsor, said  
Ebersol was concerned that the scandal would devalue his network's 
$3.5 billion Olympics rights package. 
</P>
<P>
	--Australian IOC member Phil Coles said he would clear his name  
when he appears Thursday before a special panel investigating 
charges of ethical misconduct. Coles is accused of abusing his 
position, most recently by passing memos and evaluations of other 
IOC members to Salt Lake's bid team.

<HEADLINE>  Brack Had Everyone's Number at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, the final laps of the Indy 500  
came down to a simple matter of numbers and some long division. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and his pit crew, headed by feisty car owner A.J. Foyt,  
had the calculations figured to the last decimal point, and it all 
added up to leader Robby Gordon running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	And when that happened, it meant Brack would win the world's  
most famous car race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he would have to have to pit again,'' Brack said  
Tuesday, still aglow in his victory. ``He went in at lap 164. We 
went in at 169. To go 36 laps, you can't do it unless you have a 
bigger tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Gordon was equipped with the standard 35-gallon tank. So  
Brack was comfortable with his situation. It was just a matter of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to pit,'' Brack said. ``We weren't that worried.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, auto racing is all about speed so Brack decided in the  
final laps to step on the gas -- since he had some left and Gordon 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, after all, the possibility that, despite a fuel  
indicator pointing to empty, Gordon wouldn't pull in, gambling that 
a yellow flag would come up at the end, protecting his position. It 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had a yellow, obviously he'd be able to make it,'' Brack  
said. ``I was faster at the end. A yellow before that last lap 
would not have been so good. I was a second behind when he pulled 
in. It was a relief. After that, it was a cruise to the flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his headphone, Brack heard Foyt screaming, ``We won this  
thing!'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a payoff for careful planning by Foyt and Brack and the  
rest of their team. The Swedish driver was cautious with his last 
fill-up of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were economy driving after the last pit stop,'' Brack said.  
``By 193 or 194, we had saved enough to go faster at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was conservative at the start. I was leading. I didn't want  
to do anything stupid to keep the lead. We kept pace. I knew there 
would be more yellows and a lot of stuff happening. I stayed on my 
pace. I didn't take unnecessary risks at the start, in the middle 
or at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory was worth $1,465,190, the second biggest prize in  
Indy history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a race like this, you have to prepare every little  
detail, when to take risks and when not to take risks,'' Brack 
said. ``You don't win by taking chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how much fuel was left in Brack's tank at the end?  
</P>
<P>
	``About two gallons,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than enough, it turned out.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Committee Reform Talks Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Evolution, not revolution, was the  
theme as the International Olympic Committee opened debate Tuesday 
on ways to change in the wake of its biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was among several  
speakers who called on the IOC to be more open, accountable and 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	And several athletes, including speedskating great Johan Olav  
Koss, challenged the IOC to give a bigger voice to those who 
actually compete in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opening session of the IOC's new reform commission was  
also tempered by words of caution about moving too far too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates warned against radical change in a 105-year-old  
organization which has survived world wars, terrorism and boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not feel obliged to revolutionize the whole system, as  
some critics inspired by commercial and political interests have 
requested,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up the day's talks, IOC spokesman Franklin  
Servan-Schreiber said: ``We need to adapt and to update the 
structure of the IOC -- not destroy and rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday marked the first meeting of IOC 2000, an 80-member  
reform commission created in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which continues talks Wednesday, is examining ways of  
reshaping the IOC's structure and the process for selecting Olympic 
host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to consider changes to the way IOC  
members are selected, including introducing term limits and 
reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are scheduled 
to be adopted at a special IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger -- one of 36 outside members on the commission -- said  
it was time for the IOC to ``adjust to new realities'' and be more 
open and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger suggested the IOC widen its membership to include  
outside groups on a rotating basis. He said the committee's 
meetings should be open ``as far as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest words came from Koss, winner of three gold medals  
at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the IOC determined to remain a private club or open to  
transparency and accountability?'' Koss said. ``If not, the IOC 
will remain the same, which will ensure further corruption and 
abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the democratically elected IOC athletes'  
commission, Koss proposed that 10 more members be elected to the 
panel and that all 20 athletes be appointed to the IOC itself. He 
suggested that two athletes serve on the decision-making IOC 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ctvrtlik, who played on three U.S. Olympic volleyball teams,  
said athletes ``do have a voice, but it's a small voice. If we are 
to have a role as a third pillar in the Olympic movement, we have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassiba Boulmerka, the Algerian runner who won the 1,500-meter  
gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said the IOC must change 
from being an ``institution of elderly men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes ``are the most legitimate people in the IOC,'' she  
said. ``We were elected. We should have the most power.' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
urged the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bigger is not better,'' he said. ``If the games get any  
bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must 
be restraint of growth or the games will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth said the IOC should ensure that money flows to those  
who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the Olympic movement is at the top of the  
mountain of sport,'' he said. ``At the next level are sponsors and 
officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Macaloon, an Olympic scholar at the University of Chicago,  
said the IOC faced a moral crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People hope the reforms produce an IOC that is the servant of  
the Olympic movement and less an IOC that sometimes mistakes itself 
for the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports and an IOC 2000  
member, said American athletes were suffering from ``cynical ... 
self-serving'' attacks on the IOC by John Hancock insurance 
president David D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company is a top-level Olympic sponsor, said  
Ebersol was concerned that the scandal would devalue his network's 
$3.5 billion Olympics rights package. 
</P>
<P>
	--Australian IOC member Phil Coles said he would clear his name  
when he appears Thursday before a special panel investigating 
charges of ethical misconduct. Coles is accused of abusing his 
position, most recently by passing memos and evaluations of other 
IOC members to Salt Lake's bid team.

<HEADLINE> 1946 Victim Gets Military Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTWICK, Ga. (AP) -- More than half a century after he was slain  
by a mob and buried in an unmarked grave, World War II veteran 
George Dorsey received a full military funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was something that needed to be done,'' said Lynn  
Camp, who helped organize the Memorial Day tribute to Dorsey and 
three other young blacks gunned down by a gang of white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Camp's godfather was Dan Young, who was the mortician in charge  
of the funeral for Dorsey and his sister, Dorothy Malcom. Along 
with Roger Malcom, Dorothy's husband, and Mae Murray Dorsey, 
George's wife, they were shot near Moore's Ford Bridge in 
north-central Georgia on July 25, 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was ever charged with the crime, but the killings helped  
spark the civil rights movement. Following the killings came an FBI 
investigation, a presidential commission on race, support for 
anti-lynching legislation and the desegregation of the U.S. 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	``My godfather was involved with the FBI and tried to see  
justice served,'' Camp said. ``It never was served. In doing this, 
in promoting something positive, a kind of poetic justice is coming 
out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 people gathered for the ceremony at Dorsey's grave,  
which was marked with a granite headstone last year by the Moore's 
Ford Memorial Committee, a biracial group created to promote racial 
harmony and to remember the slain couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Fort McPherson soldiers folded an American flag and  
presented it to Columbus Dorsey, George Dorsey's nephew. Committee 
member Chris Culbreath unveiled a marker commemorating Dorsey's 
military service with the Army Engineers. As he saluted the marker, 
a Stearman biplane flew overhead. Two musicians then played taps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we tell the victims' families that they are  
appreciated,'' Culbreath said. ``Can you imagine the families not 
being able to talk about such an event? It will be 53 years in July 
since it happened, and there are people who won't even talk about 
it. They won't even whisper about it.''

<HEADLINE> No Pursuit in Skating Coach Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The United States Figure Skating Association has  
decided against pursuing a sexual misconduct case against former 
Detroit Skating Club coach Richard Callaghan. 
</P>
<P>
	The USFSA said in a letter, the contents of which were reported  
by the Detroit Free Press on Wednesday, that it does not have 
jurisdiction in the case against Callaghan, who helped Tara 
Lipinski win a gold medal at last year's Nagano Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig Maurizi, a former colleague of Callaghan's at the Skating  
Club, had filed a complaint against Callaghan with the USFSA. 
</P>
<P>
	USFSA ethics committee chairman Jon Jackson sent the letter,  
which Maurizi received Tuesday, to inform him that he had waited 
too long to file his grievance. 
</P>
<P>
	It needed to be mailed within 60 days of the alleged violation  
for the USFSA to act, Jackson wrote in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your grievance alleges misconduct that occurred approximately  
14 years ago,'' Jackson wrote. ``It appears from your own 
allegations that you were aware of the alleged misconduct at the 
time it occurred. Therefore, your grievance is hereby dismissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a story first published in The New York Times, Maurizi said  
Callaghan made improper advances to him when he was a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi, now 36, said Callaghan abused his authority three years  
later to initiate a full sexual relationship, which continued for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have thought that morally, (the USFSA) would feel they  
had an obligation to do something -- to show that they are proactive 
instead of reactive,'' Maurizi told the Free Press, from Marlboro, 
Mass., where he is director of the New England Figure Skating 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who was ``shocked and dismayed'' by the accusations,  
has vehemently denied them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that when the chair of the grievance  
committee reviews the allegations, it will find the grievance lacks 
merit and will take the appropriate action,'' Dean Groulx, 
Callaghan's attorney, had said previously. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time anyone -- including Maurizi -- has filed a  
formal complaint against Callaghan, who also coached Todd Eldredge 
to five national titles and a world championship. Maurizi continued 
working with Callaghan after their alleged relationship ended, 
coaching with him in San Diego and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi was Callaghan's assistant at the Skating Club until last  
year, when they split after Lipinski left Callaghan and decided to 
train with Maurizi. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi is still awaiting word from the Professional Skaters  
Association on his grievance filed with that coaches' organization.

<HEADLINE>  Fratello Fired As Cavs Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *JOHN AFFLECK   	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach Mike  
Fratello on Tuesday, and general manager Wayne Embry stepped aside 
to be replaced by Jim Paxson, the team's vice president of 
basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund said he told Fratello of his  
decision earlier Tuesday, nearly a month after the team ended an 
injury-plagued 22-28 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes from a coaching standpoint, teams need to go in a  
new direction, to be re-energized by new leadership on the floor,'' 
Gund said. ``We believe that is true with respect to the Cavs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Fratello's tenure the Cavs compiled a 248-212 record,  
although the team disappointed fans with a defensive style some 
considered boring. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello, who had one year left on his contract, was ``very  
surprised'' by the decision, Gund said. Fratello did not attend the 
news conference but issued a statement in which he said he 
regretted not being able to reach the goals he had set for the team 
when he took over six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``With injuries, we were in a constant state of change,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fratello, the Cavs made the playoffs four of his six years  
but failed to advance past the first round. Attendance at Gund 
Arena declined in this past strike-shortened season as the Cavs 
were wracked with injuries to starters Zydrunas Ilgauskas (broken 
left foot), forward Shawn Kemp (sprained left foot), and Brevin 
Knight (broken left hand). 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said the Cavs would try to replace Fratello before the  
NBA draft June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello coached for seven years in Atlanta then worked as a  
commentator for NBC for three seasons, earning the nickname ``Czar 
of the Telestrator'' from partner Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other move, Embry will continue as president and chief  
operating officer for the next year, but will leave the general 
manager's post, handling day-to-day basketball operations, 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry has been grooming Paxson for the past year to take his  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Embry played in the NBA for 11 years and was the first black  
general manager in the league's history when he was named to the 
post in 1972 by the Milwaukee Bucks. He held the position for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavs as general manager in 1986, Embry also  
served in the front office of the Indiana Pacers for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who joined the Portland front office after playing with  
the Trail Blazers for nine seasons, had joined the Cavs to 
coordinate scouting and player acquisition and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson played at the University of Dayton and was a first-round  
selection by Portland in the 1979 draft. He was a two-time NBA 
All-Star with Portland and played his final NBA season in 1988-89 
with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as Portland's offensive skills coach in 1993-94 and  
later became assistant to the president and most recently served as 
assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Jim, was an NBA player from 1956-58 with Minneapolis  
and Cincinnati and his brother, John, played for San Antonio from 
1983-85 and for Chicago from 1985-89.

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Measure Orbit of Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Astronomers focusing on a star at the center of  
the Milky Way say they have measured precisely for the first time 
how long it takes the sun to circle its home galaxy: 226 million 
years. The last time the sun was at this exact spot of its galactic 
orbit, dinosaurs ruled the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a radio telescope system that measures celestial distances  
500 times more accurately than the Hubble Space Telescope, 
astronomers plotted the motion of the Milky Way and found that the 
sun and its family of planets were orbiting the galaxy at about 135 
miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
	That means it takes the solar system about 226 million years to  
orbit the Milky Way and puts the most precise value ever determined 
on one of the fundamental motions of the Earth and its sun, said 
James Moran of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the finding was presented Tuesday at a national  
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our new figure of 226 million miles is accurate to within 6  
percent,'' Mark Reid, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer and leader 
of the team that made the measurements, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun is one of about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, one  
of billions of ordinary galaxies in the universe. The Milky Way is 
a spiral galaxy, with curving arms of stars pinwheeling out from a 
center. The solar system is about halfway out on one of these arms 
and is about 26,000 light years from the center. A light year is 
about 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid and his team made the measurement using the Very Long  
Baseline Array, a system of 10 large radio-telescope antennae 
placed 5,000 miles across the United States, from the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to Hawaii. Working together as a single unit, the antennae 
can measure motions in the distant universe with unprecedented 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The accuracy is such that the VLBA can look at a bit of sky that  
has an apparent size one ten- thousandth the diameter of a human 
hair held at arms length. 
</P>
<P>
	For their solar system measurement, the astronomers focused on  
Sagittarius A , a star discovered two decades ago to mark the Milky 
Way's center. Over a 10-day period, they measured the apparent 
shift in position of the star against the background of stars far 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent motion of Sagittarius A is very, very small, just  
one-600,000th of what could be detected with the human eye, the 
astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said the measurement adds supports to the idea that the  
Milky Way's center contains a supermassive black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ... strengthens the idea that this object, much smaller  
than our own solar system, contains a black hole about 2.6 million 
times more massive than the sun,'' Reid said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran said the new measurement of the solar system orbit adds  
new accuracy to a fundamental fact of the universe: everything is 
moving constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth rotates on its axis at about 1,100 miles an hour, a  
motion that creates day and night. The Earth orbits the sun at 
about 67,000 miles an hour, a motion that takes one year. The sun 
circles the Milky Way at a speed of about 486,000 miles per hour. 
And every object in the universe is moving apart from the other 
objects as the universe expands at a constantly accelerating rate.

<HEADLINE> Car-Hauler Talks Extended 24 Hours </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to auto showrooms are resuming 
contract talks after averting a strike early today that could have 
meant long delays in the delivery of some models. 
</P>
<P>
	Union President James P. Hoffa told reporters following a  
post-midnight bargaining session that the 12:01 a.m. EDT strike 
deadline was being extended for 24 hours to discuss management's 
``11th hour'' economic proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks were to resume this morning.  
</P>
<P>
	While company officials declined to comment on their new offer,  
Hoffa said, ``We have some movement by the employer, but there 
still are troubling issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said the main sticking points with the 17 affected  
companies were management proposals to pay a lower wage to newly 
hired drivers and to hire part-time workers. Hoffa told reporters 
the union still was willing to strike over both of those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said, however, that management made ``an important move''  
by dropping a demand to use Mexican drivers and trucks to deliver 
vehicles in the United States after the U.S.-Mexican border opens 
up Jan. 1 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Company 
officials had said earlier Monday that they had no plans to hire 
Mexican truckers and contended this was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, in addition to seeking wage and benefit improvements,  
wants higher retirement pay for drivers who choose to retire after 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations represented the first major challenge at the  
bargaining table for Hoffa, sworn in March 22 as president of the 
union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike by the drivers who haul cars from factories to  
showrooms could mean longer waits for popular cars, union officials 
have said. Automakers also have worried that if a strike persisted 
beyond several days they would not have space to keep vehicles as 
they come off the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year, but that the 
companies faced stiff competition from railroads and nonunion 
trucking companies. The union has cited ``record profits'' by the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in 
wages and benefits, with salaries of $55,000. The Teamsters said 
management wanted to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa has been a factor in the  
discussions. He was elected in December in the aftermath of a 
campaign finance scandal, and personally led the union negotiating 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said Chip  
Roth, the union spokesman. ``He'll be judged on his ability to 
deliver for the members. He knows the members will be watching 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said he felt ``invigorated'' by leading the bargaining  
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. ... Sure, it 
is a political concern that he has. But we're attempting at the 
table to reduce that as a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. ``Some plants 
could be affected in a day or two because they'd run out of room to 
park vehicles that are coming off the assembly line,'' Healy said. 
He added that dealers' inventories overall are ``normal to slightly 
below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, said a strike would mean 
``people would have to wait for the hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said that GM had  
``contingency plans'' but he did not elaborate. He said that during 
a car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick 
up cars from factories.

<HEADLINE> Crew To Abandon Mir in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Mir's current crew will abandon the Russian  
space station in August, and the orbiter will circle Earth unmanned 
until early next year, when it is expected to burn up in the 
atmosphere, space officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's cash-strapped government has agreed to finance the  
13-year-old space station only through August, and says it should 
be discarded then unless private funding is found. Repeated 
attempts to raise money have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of top Russian space officials decided today that the  
best option would be for the three-man crew to leave in August, 
said Vyacheslav Mikhailichenko, a spokesman for the Russian Space 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to their departure, they will install and test new  
equipment allowing ground controllers to command the station 
without a crew on board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials moved to quell fears that the 130-ton station  
could spin out of control and cause havoc on the ground with a 
fiery return. They said ground controllers would ensure that all 
fragments splash harmlessly into a remote part of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to the crew's departure, they will install and test new  
equipment allowing ground controllers to ensure a trouble-free 
flight,'' Mikhailichenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The record of Mir's predecessor, the Salyut-7, provoked doubts  
about the safety of an unmanned operation. Soviet ground 
controllers lost control of the unmanned, 40-ton space station in 
February 1991, and people the world over anxiously awaited its 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Pieces fell on a sparsely populated area in Argentina's Andes  
mountains near the Chilean border, causing no injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mikhailichenko insisted there was no danger from the Mir.  
</P>
<P>
	If there is no money to extend the Mir's flight, its orbit will  
gradually descend from its present 240 miles above Earth to 125 
miles early next year, and ground controllers will send it to burn 
up in the atmosphere in February or March, Mikhailichenko said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. space agency NASA has long urged Russia to abandon the  
Mir and concentrate its meager resources on the new international 
space station, which has been falling behind because of Russia's 
failure to build its segments on time. The first permanent crew 
isn't expected to move in until next March, almost two years behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russian space officials have been reluctant to part with the  
Mir, the last symbol of the nation's past space glory. They fear 
that without the Mir, Russia will be left playing a secondary role 
in the new station, dominated by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our station is like a thorn in the Americans' side,'' Sergei  
Gorbunov, a spokesman for Russian Space Agency chief Yuri Koptev, 
said on NTV television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mir was plagued by several serious accidents in 1997,  
including a fire, a near-fatal collision with a cargo ship and 
repeated failures of on-board computers and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been running relatively smoothly since then, but Russia  
can no longer afford the $250 million a year needed for the Mir 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't keep the station aloft, because we have no money,''  
Gorbunov said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Johnson Space Center in Houston, NASA spokesman Rob  
Navias said the U.S. agency was not involved in the Russian 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that they were going to make a decision,'' he said.  
``It's their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian space officials will now send their plan to President  
Boris Yeltsin's government for final approval.

<HEADLINE> Credit-Card Company Providian Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Garry Bowie was so worried about incurring  
late charges on his Providian credit card bills that he sent his 
payments by overnight mail. Still, he was hit with a hefty late 
charge three times. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, 38, of Long Beach, said Tuesday that he repeatedly  
complained and demanded the charges be refunded. ``Of course, they 
never were refunded,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, who has joined a class-action suit against Providian  
Financial Corp., is one of many customers claiming they were 
overcharged by the nation's ninth-largest credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the lawsuit filed last week in San Francisco  
Superior Court, the company has caught the attention of the city 
District Attorney's Office, which is looking into allegations of 
misleading and high-pressure sales tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are investigating complaints against the company, and  
that's pretty much where it stands right now,'' the D.A.'s 
spokesman, Clarence Johnson, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco-based Providian specializes in issuing credit  
cards to people other lenders dismiss, including those who 
previously had trouble paying their bills, older people who never 
had credit cards before and widowed or divorced people without 
their own credit histories. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakland's Better Business Bureau has received 850 complaints,  
many over add-on products such as credit protection or auto club 
memberships. Other complaints concern late fees and allegedly 
hidden charges. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1996 to 1998, Providian's revenues from late and over-limit  
charges, add-on products, and other customer fees grew 470 percent 
to $703.5 million, while total revenues grew only 120 percent, to 
$2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Tuesday, Providian said a recently announced  
enhanced customer service program should address the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Providian Guarantee'' will reverse late fees and cancel  
sales of add-on products if consumers hadn't intended to buy them. 
The company also hired a firm to review its payment processing 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the greatest strengths of this company is that it has  
always learned from its customers,'' Providian chairman and CEO 
Shailesh Mehta said last week. ``We are taking advantage of this 
opportunity to reinforce our satisfaction guarantee, and to further 
ensure that our customers find value in our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Phillip A. Schuman says he experienced Providian's  
practices firsthand. He applied for a credit card, but upon 
receiving it found that he had been charged an additional fee for 
credit protection -- a service he told the company he never 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said, `Unless you have this credit protection, you can't  
have the credit card,''' the San Diego lawyer said. ``So I said, 
`Well, then I don't want this credit card.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The experience caught Schuman's interest, and he began looking  
into the matter. When he sent out an inquiry on the Internet, he 
got nearly 2,000 e-mail responses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably 90 percent of the people that complained to me said  
they were charged with late fees, regardless of whether they paid 
their bill on time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuman joined forces with the San Francisco law firm of Girard  
and Green in filing the class-action complaint, which accuses 
Providian of unfair, unlawful and fraudulent business practices, 
and false advertising. The lawsuit asks that any unlawful charges 
be refunded to the customer. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people get stuck. They just plain get stuck,'' Schuman  
said. ``That's why I decided to get involved with it.''

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Begins Mission in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- The head of the U.N. team in East Timor  
began his mission in the troubled territory today, insisting 
bloodshed must end ahead of a landmark independence vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Martin is to head a team of 600 civilian U.N. personnel and  
280 foreign police advisers to oversee the Aug. 8 ballot in which 
Timorese will vote for either autonomy within Indonesia or 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	If autonomy within Indonesia is rejected, East Timor will be set  
on the path toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The territory has been torn by violence between militia groups  
opposed to and in favor of independence. The United Nations has 
demanded that Indonesian security forces restore order. 
</P>
<P>
	``An end to violence is essential to a fair campaign and  
ballot,'' Martin told reporters after arriving in Dili, capital of 
the former Portuguese colony that Indonesia invaded in 1975 and 
later annexed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to ensure a peaceful environment for both sides to  
campaign in and for a peaceful ballot,'' he said. ``We will be 
working with the Indonesians to make sure the Indonesian commitment 
is fulfilled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. polling officials are fanning out across remote parts of  
East Timor despite threats from anti-independence militiamen. About 
200 voter registration and polling stations are to be established 
by June 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4,000 Timorese also will be hired to assist the mission.  
</P>
<P>
	The woman who is a favorite to become Indonesia's next  
president, Megawati Sukartoputri, made a campaign stop in East 
Timor's capital and echoed the call for an end to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Indonesian Democratic Party for Struggle,  
considered the likely big winner in Monday's parliamentary 
election, earlier this year opposed independence for East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati has since reversed course and said that while she  
favors autonomy, East Timorese should make their own decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of supporters, chanting ``Mega for president'' and  
``Long live Mega,'' drove in a mile-long convoy of vehicles and 
motorbikes to Dili's main soccer stadium for a rally attended by 
Megawati. 
</P>
<P>
	Most fell silent when she preceded her speech by singing the  
Indonesian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be proud to make the process of East Timor's  
solution peaceful, since it is impossible for the act of violence 
to resolve the problem of East Timor,'' she told the crowds in a 
speech. ``I hope the ballot process will be conducted properly and 
the Timorese can decide their own future.''

<HEADLINE> Details Needed for War Crimes Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEGRANE, Macedonia (AP) -- Inside a sweltering canvas tent near  
the camp entrance, an Irishman named Eamonn Smyth gently guides 
refugees through a list of painful questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Why did you leave Kosovo? Were you driven out? Were you  
arrested? Did you see anyone killed? 
</P>
<P>
	The answers spill into the margins and onto the backs of the  
white forms on Smyth's clipboard. Then his final question: Are you 
willing to give a statement to the war crimes tribunal in The 
Hague? 
</P>
<P>
	Firsthand refugee accounts of atrocities are crucial to the  
tribunal's case against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, 
indicted six days ago with four top aides for crimes against 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Louise Arbour, the tribunal's chief prosecutor, said in  
announcing the indictments that the continuing flow of witness 
accounts was pivotal and could lead to additional charges against 
Milosevic, as well as the prosecution of others directly 
responsible for massacres, rapes and destruction of civilian 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators' task is to mesh thousands of accounts from  
stricken refugees, to match precise dates, names, places and 
descriptions that will prove the horrific stories being told in the 
Macedonian and Albanian camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Every refugee has a story to tell, and determining credibility  
is grueling. Traumatized by war, refugees rooted in the oral 
traditions of ethnic Albanians often merge their own experiences 
with stories they've heard from others. Human rights workers like 
Smyth use calendars and maps and ask refugees to draw their own 
maps, floor plans and village layouts -- anything to keep them 
focused on what they actually saw. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Cegrane camp, Macedonia's biggest, 32,000 refugees  
struggle with chaos every day. They wait in lines for food, for 
showers, for medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	Just outside the camp border, Smyth tried to make his tent an  
oasis of calm, interviewing just one refugee at a time or a few 
family members in the white plastic chairs around a small table. 
But frequently, confused and anxious refugees burst in, asking 
Smyth where to find relatives or how to get evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviews can take hours. Workers often talk to only two or  
three refugees a day in sessions that seem like therapy, says 
Claudia Moser of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, a group of 54 nations that monitors international human 
rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``For some, it's like a film in their heads. They remember it  
all,'' she says. ``Others are completely lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slowly, the awful pieces emerge; Smyth and the other OSCE  
workers write them down. Serb police gouged out the eyes of a young 
woman and left her writhing in front of her family for two hours 
before shooting her, says one account. Another tells of an elderly 
woman who couldn't remove her wedding ring, so Serb police cut off 
her finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``The killing is so plentiful, and the forms of torture -- it's  
indescribable,'' Smyth says. ``There's a sadism about this that's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When refugees consent, the OSCE workers pass along their  
information to investigators for the war crimes tribunal. They, in 
turn, choose refugees for additional interviews, hoping to gather 
more evidence of mass expulsions, the destruction of property and 
the random killing and organized massacre of Kosovar Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators talk to potential witnesses outside the camps to  
ensure confidentiality, says Paul Risley, a tribunal spokesman. He 
refuses to identify refugees contacted by tribunal investigators or 
to let journalists speak with the investigators themselves. But 
OSCE confirms interviews with Fahrije Jakupi and her 12-year-old 
son, Halim. Her husband was one of 52 people killed in the village 
of Racak in January. The massacre is cited in the indictment 
against Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks ago, a woman from the Hague whom the Jakupis  
described only as a foreigner came to the Jakupi tent. With an 
Albanian translator, she took Fahrije and her son to a office in 
the Cegrane town hall for an interview that lasted five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting cross-legged and barefoot in his tent, Halim repeats for  
an Associated Press reporter what he told the Hague 
representatives, his eyes darting shyly from the floor to his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	How the Serbs came at 6 a.m. and started shooting.  
</P>
<P>
	How he and his father ran into the street with other village  
males to see what was happening. 
</P>
<P>
	How police tied the men's hands behind their heads and made them  
lie on the ground, then beat them with clubs studded with nails. 
</P>
<P>
	``They teased me around my neck with the end of knife,'' Halim  
says. He could see his father in the line of men, a Serb machine 
gun pointed at his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Halim was wearing a watch. He noted the beatings started at 10  
a.m. At noon, police dragged him and the other boys to a cellar 
where the women were hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, screams lasted for two hours.  
</P>
<P>
	The women and children spent the night in the cellar. At dawn,  
Halim crawled through a small window and ran through a dusting of 
snow to a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	There he found the bodies. One of his father's eyes had been cut  
out. An arm had been pulled from its socket. 
</P>
<P>
	When they first come to the camp, refugees often are too stunned  
to remember all they've experienced. Others cannot recall the kind 
of detail necessary for a credible account, Moser says. A girl 
might describe seeing her mother killed, but she can't describe 
what badge the killer wore on his uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed by OSCE on Monday, Xhemail Metolli draws a diagram  
of where he saw Serb paramilitary police kill four refugees. Two 
men were shot in the back. Two others were told to stand back to 
back, then were killed with a single bullet. The police wore black 
masks, armbands emblazoned with a tiger's face, camouflage and 
tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bottom of the form, Metolli signs his name and marks that  
he wants to talk to war crimes investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone is willing.  
</P>
<P>
	Back at Eamonn Smyth's tent, an elderly man repeatedly presses  
his hand to his eyes. After the interview, Smyth says the man ``is 
terrified'' his statement might endanger his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Spreading his hands in a gesture of sad helplessness, Smyth  
says, ``We may just have to tear up his form.''

<HEADLINE> Fratello Fired As Cavs Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *JOHN AFFLECK   	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach Mike  
Fratello on Tuesday, and general manager Wayne Embry stepped aside 
to be replaced by Jim Paxson, the team's vice president of 
basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund said he told Fratello of his  
decision earlier Tuesday, nearly a month after the team ended an 
injury-plagued 22-28 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes from a coaching standpoint, teams need to go in a  
new direction, to be re-energized by new leadership on the floor,'' 
Gund said. ``We believe that is true with respect to the Cavs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Fratello's tenure the Cavs compiled a 248-212 record,  
although the team disappointed fans with a defensive style some 
considered boring. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello, who had one year left on his contract, was ``very  
surprised'' by the decision, Gund said. Fratello did not attend the 
news conference but issued a statement in which he said he 
regretted not being able to reach the goals he had set for the team 
when he took over six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``With injuries, we were in a constant state of change,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fratello, the Cavs made the playoffs four of his six years  
but failed to advance past the first round. Attendance at Gund 
Arena declined in this past strike-shortened season as the Cavs 
were wracked with injuries to starters Zydrunas Ilgauskas (broken 
left foot), forward Shawn Kemp (sprained left foot), and Brevin 
Knight (broken left hand). 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said the Cavs would try to replace Fratello before the  
NBA draft June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello coached for seven years in Atlanta then worked as a  
commentator for NBC for three seasons, earning the nickname ``Czar 
of the Telestrator'' from partner Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other move, Embry will continue as president and chief  
operating officer for the next year, but will leave the general 
manager's post, handling day-to-day basketball operations, 
effective July 1.

<P>
	Embry has been grooming Paxson for the past year to take his  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Embry played in the NBA for 11 years and was the first black  
general manager in the league's history when he was named to the 
post in 1972 by the Milwaukee Bucks. He held the position for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavs as general manager in 1986, Embry also  
served in the front office of the Indiana Pacers for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who joined the Portland front office after playing with  
the Trail Blazers for nine seasons, had joined the Cavs to 
coordinate scouting and player acquisition and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson played at the University of Dayton and was a first-round  
selection by Portland in the 1979 draft. He was a two-time NBA 
All-Star with Portland and played his final NBA season in 1988-89 
with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as Portland's offensive skills coach in 1993-94 and  
later became assistant to the president and most recently served as 
assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Jim, was an NBA player from 1956-58 with Minneapolis  
and Cincinnati and his brother, John, played for San Antonio from 
1983-85 and for Chicago from 1985-89.

<HEADLINE> Injured Indy Crew Member Upgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The condition of a pit crew member injured  
in a crash during the Indianapolis 500 was upgraded Tuesday to 
serious, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Fried is recovering at Methodist Hospital from injuries he  
received in Sunday's race, when he was hit from behind by Jimmy 
Kite's car, which had been struck by another car whose brakes had 
failed. Fried flipped and landed on his face, sustaining head and 
chest injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Fried, who was admitted to the hospital in critical condition,  
is chief mechanic for Robby McGehee, who finished fifth. On Monday 
night at the Victory Celebration, McGehee dedicated his rookie of 
the year trophy to Fried. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to prevent such injuries again, crews for McGehee's  
Energizer Motorsports team will wear helmets at the next Indy 
Racing League event -- at Texas Motor Speedway on June 12.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Political Family Is Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --Members of one of Mexico's wealthiest and most  
politically powerful families pose ``a significant criminal threat 
to the United States'' because of their role in drug trafficking 
and money laundering, says a U.S. government report. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the National Drug Intelligence Center says Carlos  
Hank-Gonzalez and his sons, Carlos Hank-Rhon and Jorge Hank-Rhon, 
are connected with major Mexican drug organizations, according to 
Wednesday's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank-Gonzalez, a powerful member of Mexico's ruling  
Institutional Revolutionary Party and former mayor of Mexico City, 
has held two cabinet positions in the government of Carols Salinas 
de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
	The report alleges that the family used its businesses to move  
cocaine into the United States and launder millions of dollars in 
drug money. Because of its high-level connections, the family was 
sheltered from law enforcement action, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hank family ``poses a significant criminal threat to the  
United States,'' the report says. ``Its multibillion-dollar 
criminal and business empire, developed over several decades, 
reaches throughout Mexico and into the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report drew on information from the Drug Enforcement  
Administration, FBI, U.S. Customs Service and CIA. It said 
intelligence agencies had intercepted conversations of the Hank 
family coordinating drug shipments at the family's shipping 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation was begun in December of 1997 and concluded  
earlier this year. Spokesmen for the family denied the report to 
the Post. Mexican officials called the allegations politically 
motivated.

<HEADLINE> Fiber May Lower Heart Disease Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study strongly supports the notion that a  
high-fiber diet lowers the risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of more than 68,000 women found that dietary fiber --  
particularly from breakfast cereals -- can significantly decrease 
the risk of heart attacks by improving cholesterol levels, lowering 
blood sugar, boosting sensitivity to insulin and lowering the risk 
of blood clotting. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous study of men had similar results.  
</P>
<P>
	The new study was published in Wednesday's issue of the Journal  
of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Healthy female nurses studied at Brigham and Women's Hospital in  
Boston were divided into five groups, from highest to lowest fiber 
consumption, and their diets were tracked for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Women in the highest fiber group ate about 22 grams per day.  
They had a 47 percent lower risk of heart disease than women in the 
lowest group, who consumed about 11 grams of fiber a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``For every five-gram increase in fiber -- which is equal to a  
bowl of cereal per day -- the risk of heart disease was reduced by 
more than 30 percent,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, the author of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	She said fruits and vegetables also are good sources of fiber.  
She cautioned that over-the-counter fiber supplements are not 
effective substitutes.

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Being the top-ranked tennis player in the world  
doesn't guarantee recognition, as Yevgeny Kafelnikov discovered in 
Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian winner of the 1996 French Open tried to get into the  
players changing rooms on Monday without his badge and was stopped 
by security. 
</P>
<P>
	``My name is Kafelnikov and I'm the world No. 1-seed,'' he told  
the guards, but that didn't get him in either. The guard then 
called his superior to see if Kafelnikov could enter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kafelnikov was granted access and the guard apologized. But the  
player had to promise to take his badge with him next time. 
</P>

	NO MONA LISA FOR MONICA: Monica Seles got an unwelcome surprise  
when she took some time off to visit the Louvre museum in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the Louvre,'' said Seles. ``But obviously it was on  
strike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Museum workers have been on strike for two weeks in Paris,  
closing down the Louvre and the Orsay museums, among others, to 
demand job security and better working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Like thousands of other tourists, Seles had to be content with  
touring the city's streets and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
	``With my mom, we just walked. The usual, same streets. The same  
thing as every year,'' she said, ``We keep the tradition going.''

	AGASSI FAN: When Lindsay Davenport was asked to pick her  
favorite for the men's tournament, she didn't hesitate: Andre 
Agassi.

	``I love watching Andre play,'' Davenport said. ``When he's  
playing well, there's nobody more exciting than Andre, the shots he 
can come up with, the intensity he gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport lost Tuesday in the quarterfinals to Steffi Graf but  
Agassi went on to the semifinals. Davenport was already looking 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean that it would be great if he won it,'' she said. ``And  
a lot more fun to watch.''

	FOREIGN TONGUE: The interpreter for the players' press  
conferences doesn't mince words when it comes to her likes and 
dislikes of players.

	She doesn't like Hingis. ``She smiles all the time, even when  
she answers questions. That gets annoying in the end,'' said Diane 
Bourley-Medecin in an interview with French daily Liberation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters got a better review. ``I understand them a  
lot better since they got their braces out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's tournament Bourley-Medecin had little to say.  
Gustavo Kuerten is ``a charming, polite boy'', while Marcelo Rios 
is ``insufferably scornful.''

<HEADLINE> Reinforcements Called for Fla. Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Fire officials called for reinforcements today as  
they battled a huge wind-whipped fire in the Okefenokee Swamp that 
already was being fought by crews from across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire along the Florida-Georgia state line was about 20  
percent controlled today. The blaze was more than a week old, and 
firefighters predicted containment might take an additional two 
weeks if there is no significant rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone,'' said Bill Paxton, a spokesman for  
the firefighting operation. ``We've had some real close calls -- 
fire crews barely making it over burning bridges that are the only 
way in and out of areas. Then there's the snakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, no injuries were reported and no structures had been  
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which may have been ignited by lightning on May 21,  
has burned across 53,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 30 more fire engines and a minimum of 60 extra  
firefighters are needed, said fire information officer George 
Broyles. The new manpower and equipment are expected to arrive 
within three days. 
</P>
<P>
	They would be in addition to the 482 firefighters already at  
work with 50 fire engines and 50 bulldozers. Those forces had come 
from 30 states, as far away as Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the ground forces, 11 helicopters and four planes  
had dropped more than 1 million gallons of water and 365,000 
gallons of retardants on the tinder-dry swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Containment lines were being shored up today along the swamp's  
western and northwestern edges, closest to small communities such 
as Fargo and Council in Georgia, Broyles said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty confident that those communities are all safe  
right now,'' Broyles said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, whipped by wind gusting to 20 mph, was moving toward  
busy U.S. 441, which runs north-south along the western side of the 
swamp. However, it was still nine miles east of the highway. 
Bulldozers had cleared a containment line two miles from the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, fires that started during the Memorial Day weekend  
blackened nearly 500,000 acres in Florida, forced 100,000 residents 
to flee and caused $400 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread a fire over  
11,000 acres extending from Grand Canyon National Park north to the 
Arizona-Utah line. Another lightning-caused fire 80 miles west of 
Phoenix burned 14,600 acres but was contained by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Nevada called in reinforcements to help battle a  
lightning-sparked blaze that had charred 10,000 acres of rugged 
terrain about 85 miles northeast of Las Vegas. It was only 20 
percent contained today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Joshua Tree National Park, a 13,900-acre  
lightning-sparked wildfire was contained.

<HEADLINE> Brit. Utility Buys Connecticut Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Yorkshire Water PLC is buying Connecticut-based  
water supplier, Aquarion Co., for $440 million and hopes to make 
additional acquisitions in the United States 
</P>
<P>
	The cash deal announced today is Yorkshire Water's first venture  
into the U.S. market, where the likelihood of consolidation offers 
greater opportunities than in Britain's more mature water treatment 
industry, chief executive Kevin Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	The principal business of Bridgeport, Conn.-based Aquarion is to  
provide water for a population of more than 141,000 customers in 
Connecticut and New York. It also has real estate and timber 
processing interests. Yorkshire Water has 1.9 million customers and 
operates from the city of Leeds in northern England. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchase values Aquarion shares at $37.05 each, representing  
a premium of 19 percent over the U.S. company's share price at the 
close of business Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies have been working together for several years  
in areas such as an employee exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
	The Aquarion acquisition reflects what Bond said is a limited  
number of opportunities at home. Yorkshire Water is ``very 
open-minded'' about the possibility of buying other U.S. 
businesses, and it's seeking to expand in continental Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Within five years, it hopes to generate half of its revenues and  
30 percent of its earnings from outside Britain, Bond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aquarion earned $20 million on revenue of $116 million in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	Yorkshire Water earned $211 million pounds, or $340 million, on  
sales of 671 million pounds, or $1.08 billion, in the financial 
year ending March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is still subject to approval by regulators in the U.S.  
and Britain. It is expected to boost Yorkshire Water's earnings in 
the first full financial year after completion.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Orders Kids-Violence Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Modeling his anti-school-violence campaign  
after his assault on Joe Camel and the tobacco industry, President 
Clinton ordered a government investigation today of how the 
entertainment business markets violence to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of  
violence. And it sells,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years of studies, he said, have documented that by the  
time a typical American child turns 18, he or she has seen 40,000 
``play'' murders and 200,000 dramatized acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boundary between fantasy and reality violence -- which is a  
clear line for most adults -- can become very blurred for vulnerable 
children,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million joint study by the Federal Trade Commission and  
Justice Department, expected to take up to 18 months, will examine 
industry marketing practices much as the government investigated 
tobacco ad campaigns that it determined were aimed at tempting to 
kids to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton held up ads for video games, one of which pictured a gun  
and promised ``More fun than shooting your neighbor's cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at some of these ads, it's hard to argue with a  
straight face that the games were made for adults in the first 
place,'' Clinton said. ``Advertisements have a particular role 
here. They have the power to egg children on and lure them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Garden announcement today by the president and Hillary  
Rodham Clinton comes three weeks after the Clintons convened a 
White House meeting of movie-industry lobbyist Jack Valenti and 
five dozen of the nation's leading educators, officials, 
entertainers and gun makers to brainstorm ways to reduce violence 
among youth amid a rising tide of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton cited a ``culture of violence that is engulfing  
American children every day,'' and asked: ``What kind of values are 
we promoting when a child can walk into a store and find video 
games where you win based on how many people you can kill or how 
many places you can blow up? '' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady quoted from a 1972 Surgeon General's report that  
documented how children imitate the violent scenes they see on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Attorney General Janet Reno: ``We now need to know more  
about how children learn about the existence and the content of 
violent material and why they are drawn to them -- whether it be 
movies of video cames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a White House background paper, the entertainment  
study will review ``whether and how the video game, motion picture 
and recording industries'' purposefully market adult material to 
children and only laxly restrict sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart called it a ``real  
serious study,'' but it was unclear whether the federal agencies 
would subpoena internal marketing memos and other industry 
documents. Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, 
said the FTC already has some subpoena powers and, while the study 
would be independent of White House control, Clinton envisions it 
looking beyond what is already in the public doman and into 
internal industry records. 
</P>
<P>
	A lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America did not  
immediately return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Want Lord Stanley's Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres don't care about the  
trophy they won for making the NHL finals, their first trip since 
1975. The bigger one is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the Stanley Cup,'' captain Michael Peca said. ``You  
don't grow up working as a kid to hold the conference trophy over 
your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres refused to celebrate after eliminating the Toronto  
Maple Leafs from the playoffs with a 4-2 victory in Game 5 in 
Toronto Monday night. That earned the Prince of Wales Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest series will be the one against the winner of the  
Western Conference final between Dallas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won a Stanley Cup since they joined the  
NHL in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep it very levelheaded,'' said defenseman Jason  
Woolley, the team's leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley started the play that resulted in the game-winning goal  
by Erik Rasmussen with a pass to Brian Holzinger with just over 
eight minutes left in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres celebrated too soon after they swept Montreal to  
advance to the Eastern Conference finals last season. They lit 
cigars. They cranked up the music. They smiled for the cameras. 
Then Washington knocked them out in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesson learned. Had it not been for the horde of media, the  
locker room Monday night would have been as quiet as a library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to the dance and we're not going to stand on the  
sidelines,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``I think we still have 
something to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time Buffalo played for the Stanley Cup was in  
1975, when the team lost to hard-hitting Philadelphia in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres split two games with the Stars and Avalanche this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody expected the Sabres to have a shot at the Stanley Cup  
this year, especially after goalie Dominik Hasek, the reigning 
two-time league MVP, was hurt in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo overcame injuries to key players and a regular-season  
slump. They made a mockery of the seedings, rising to the top from 
No. 7 in the Eastern Conference. They made believers of everyone, 
even their adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in first place in January, then they had some  
injuries,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``They were probably 
underestimated by a lot of people because it's Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that team now, they made some changes. They added  
talented players, and now they are doing things they didn't do 
before. They finish a lot of checks now. The Joe Juneaus, the Geoff 
Sandersons, they never finished any checks in their life, but 
they're doing it right now.''

	Ruff, captain of the Sabres during his playing days, demands  
that his players work just like he used to. That means they also

	The result was a surprisingly swift five-game series with

<HEADLINE> Gore Rallies Women for His Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore received the  
endorsement of his boss' wife Tuesday as he sought to rally women 
behind his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore has been out in front for women, for families, for  
children, throughout his life,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton told 
several hundred women at a downtown hotel. ``Now is the time for 
all of us to be out in front for him. He is my choice and I hope 
your choice for the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will officially announce his candidacy for the nation's top  
job on June 16 in Carthage, Tenn., according to spokesman Roger 
Salazar. That is the site of the Gore family farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Women are expected to play a pivotal role in the 2000 elections  
and Gore is seeking to inherit the support that President Clinton 
had enjoyed among them. His focus on family issues helped him win 
the women's vote 55 percent to 37 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a head-to-head matchup with Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
the Republican leader in early presidential polls, Gore trails 
among women by 10 points -- 52 percent to 42 percent, according to a 
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	Women were about equally split in that poll on whether Gore has  
the vision to solve the nation's problems. By a 50 percent to 32 
percent margin, they said they were less likely to vote for Gore if 
Clinton actively supports and campaigns for him. 
</P>
<P>
	At the rally, Gore talked about his pride in cosponsoring, as a  
senator, the bill that was the first signed into law under the 
Clinton-Gore administration -- the Family and Medical Leave Act, 
which gives workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of 
a new children, a seriously ill family member or personal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised additional family-friendly policies as president.  
``I have listened to working families and I know our work is not 
done,'' Gore said as the mostly female crowd waved ``Gore 2000'' 
placards or mini-American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he wants to extend the family leave law ``so parents  
can meet with their children's teacher without fearing the loss of 
their job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also talked about making preschool available to every child,  
reducing class sizes, allowing parents to pay for college tuition 
``tax-free and inflation-free'' and using new technologies to 
tailor learning to individual children. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipper Gore noted the importance of women to her husband's  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we know from past elections, when women vote Democrats  
win,'' she said. ``We need your help to share with the country his 
vision and we need your help to get the word out about his 
commitment ... on the issues that matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A partial list of female supporters distributed by the Gore 2000  
campaign names members of Congress, former governors, other state 
officials and mayors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those on stage with Gore were Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of  
D-Texas; Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C; Maryland Lt. Gov. 
Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Carol Browner, administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency.

<HEADLINE> Energy Futures Down on Glut Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Energy futures tumbled Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after European refiners announced additional cutback on 
crude purchases, moves that could worsen a world supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, gold futures fell sharply. Grain and soybeans  
also moved lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude posted its third consecutive decline as refiners continued  
to weigh in with processing cutbacks in Europe, a region that 
consumes nearly a quarter of the world's oil supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's ERG SpA said it would cut the amount of oil it uses at a  
Sicilian refinery this month, an announcement that follows BP 
Amoco's announcement last week that it would reduce processing 
rates at European refineries run in a joint venture with Mobil 
Corp. by 225,000 barrels a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal-Dutch Shell Group also cut processing last month, as  
refiners saw profit rates tumble. 
</P>
<P>
	While sharp increases in the price of oil have been good for  
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 
other world producers, refiners have been socked by tightening 
margins. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because prices of refined products such as gasoline and  
heating oil have not moved in step with rising crude prices, which 
jumped sharply after producers moved to take supplies off the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for July delivery fell 50 cents to $16.34 a barrel; July  
heating oil fell .50 cent to 39.13 cents gallon; July unleaded 
gasoline fell 1.56 cents to 47.37 cents a gallon; and July natural 
gas fell 1.3 cents to $2.345 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange as  
Australian producers dumped new supplies on the market to lock in 
prices that are likely to go lower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to find anyone positive on gold right now,'' said  
Leonard Kaplan, chief bullion trader of LFG Bullion Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold prices have tumbled 10 of the past 12 trading sessions,  
posting continuous 20-year lows, in response to Britain's decision 
to sell more than half of its reserves beginning a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are finding little that glitters in a market bogged  
down by jitters that other governments and international agencies 
will sell their stockpiles in favor of better-returning investments 
such as Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium  
have quietly sold reserves, while Switzerland and the International 
Monetary Fund are moving to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian producers now are dumping their inventories as prices  
threaten to slip below the cost of production. Other major 
producers, including Canada and South Africa, also may move to sell 
ahead of the British gold sales, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	August gold tumbled $2.50 to $269.50 an ounce.  
</P>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures prices retreated on the Chicago Board  
of Trade amid near-ideal growing conditions for spring crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters are predicting warm weather and scattered showers  
across Midwest growing regions this week. That should prove ideal 
for early growth of corn and spring wheat crops, where farmers were 
expected to have completed planting in the past week. Market 
participants expected the government this week would report about 
75 percent of soybean crops have been planted. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are worried that record soybean acreage and large corn  
acreage could lead to bumper fall harvests, at a time when weaker 
than normal world demand has lead to ample inventory buildups. 
</P>
<P>
	July wheat fell 1/2 cent to $2.51 3/4 a bushel; July corn fell 3 1/4  
cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.58 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Likely Gambling Panel Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Recommendations the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is  
expected to make, subject to final votes this week, in its report 
to be submitted June 18: 
</P>
<P>
	--Betting on college athletics -- part of legal sports betting in  
Nevada and Oregon -- should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
	--State lotteries and other forms of government-sponsored  
gambling should discontinue aggressive marketing that targets 
impoverished neighborhoods or youth. 
</P>
<P>
	--Only those 21 and older should be allowed to gamble. The  
minimum age in many states for playing the lottery or gambling on 
horses is now 18. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should dedicate a portion of casino tax revenue to  
problem gambling research, prevention, education and treatment; 
tribal governments should make similar contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	--Indian tribes that run casinos should use some of the revenue  
as ``seed money'' to diversify their finances and reduce dependence 
on gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--Governments should require ``gambling impact statements'' --  
akin to the environmental impact statements required of developers 
-- before approving new or additional casinos, slot machines or 
lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
	--Automated teller machines should be banned from the area where  
betting takes place at casinos or racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should not allow casino-style gambling to be introduced  
at horse tracks or other pari-mutuel facilities for the primary 
purpose of bailing them out financially or competing with other 
forms of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	--States should stop the proliferation of ``convenience  
gambling'' outlets, such as video gambling machines in neighborhood 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Cruises to nowhere'' that offer gambling should be prohibited  
unless states specifically allow them to operate. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Recommendations considered by the commission but not yet  
approved, and unlikely to be included in its final report: 
</P>
<P>
	--Impose federal tax on gambling proceeds.  
</P>
<P>
	--Impose state tax on lottery tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	--Require that states reach compact with neighbors before  
building casino within 50 miles of border. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let family members request that relative be excluded from  
gambling facility promotional mailings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ban state lottery advertising.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Rejects Isolationism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt urged  
Republicans on Tuesday to ``reject a politically convenient 
isolationism'' that he said has tainted the debate over the war in 
Yugoslavia and China's possible entry into the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congressional Republicans have a knee-jerk need to politicize  
nearly everything these days,'' the Missouri Democrat said of the 
reaction that greeted a bipartisan report on China's nuclear 
espionage efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of China's joining the WTO ``shouldn't be held hostage  
to the desire by many Republicans in Congress to embarrass the 
president politically'' by linking the issue to allegations of 
Chinese espionage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is plenty of bipartisan blame to go around in this  
report -- Chinese espionage took place on the watches of Presidents 
Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, on Yugoslavia, Gephardt said, ``This isn't the  
Clinton-Gore war, as many Republicans are fond of calling it. This 
is a NATO military action which has the support of all 19 countries 
that make up this alliance. We need to show the same kind of unity 
at home in order to ensure that this action is finished quickly and 
successfully.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt made his comments in a speech to the Chicago Council on  
Foreign Relations, and aides noted that he had chosen to speak on 
the subject virtually in House Speaker Dennis Hastert's political 
back yard. Gephardt did not mention the Illinois Republican by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reflection of the changed political environment, Gephardt  
listed several trade issues on which he has supported Clinton, but 
omitted the pitched battle he fought two years ago to thwart 
Clinton's attempt to extend ``fast-track'' trade authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt said he believes China should be permitted to join the  
WTO under an agreement that permits the United States strong powers 
of enforcement. ``A government that is willing to ignore individual 
rights will ignore property and commercial rights when it serves 
its purpose,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest risk to the WTO, he said, ``comes from those in  
Congress who detect a hot political issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Kosovo, Gephardt said the ``neo-isolationists would like  
us to wash our hands of this problem. They want us to bury out 
heads in the sand and walk away from the crisis in the Balkans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt stressed his support for Clinton's policy, and said his  
decision to increase military strength in the Balkans can 
``accelerate diplomatic efforts, expedite the insertion of a 
peacekeeping force into Kosovo at the appropriate time, and send a 
signal that we are prepared to expel Serbian troops from Kosovo by 
force if necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Washington State Receiver Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PULLMAN, Wash. (AP) -- Nian Taylor, Washington State's top  
receiver who was elected a team co-captain last week, was being 
held in Whitman County Jail on Tuesday after his arrest for 
investigation of domestic assault. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, three Washington State players are to be arraigned  
on burglary and theft charges in Whitman County. One is the 
Cougars' top rusher, Kevin Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Pullman police allege Taylor, 22, followed a 22-year-old woman  
to her apartment on Tuesday, kicked the door off its hinges, and 
threw the door into the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The suspect is accused of grabbing and hitting the female and  
striking her in the chest with his fist,'' according to a police 
press release. ``He is also accused of throwing water on the 
victim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was bruised, but declined medical attention, police  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor was arrested on investigation of fourth-degree assault,  
domestic violence and malicious mischief after a witness supplied 
police with a vehicle license plate number and a description. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 200-pound senior from Riverside, Calif., had been  
granted a special year of eligibility by the NCAA for the upcoming 
season. Last year, he led the Cougars with 847 receiving yards and 
eight touchdowns, catching 45 passes in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor had to sit out his freshman year because of low SAT  
scores and the NCAA's Proposition 48. But he graduated from 
Washington State in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Under new rules adopted in 1997, Prop 48 players who lost their  
freshman year of eligibility were given the year back if they 
graduated within four years. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Tuesday at the office of football coach Mike  
Price or athletic director Rick Dickson. Sports information 
director Rod Commons said Price would typically discuss the issue 
with Taylor and law enforcement officers before making any comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 20, of West Covina, Calif., rushed for 1,046 yards, a  
sophomore team record. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive back Ramin White, 19, will be a freshman and receiver  
Jason White, 20, will be a sophomore this coming season. Ramin 
White and Jason White are not related. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Price suspended all three players and said that, if  
they're convicted, they would be dismissed from the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, Jason White and Ramin White would remain on suspension  
indefinitely pending the outcome of their court cases, Price said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is imperative for our program to hold high standards, no  
matter the talent of the individual player,'' Price said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The players were arrested May 20 at a campus apartment complex.  
</P>
<P>
	The men were arrested after witnesses said they saw them enter  
an apartment through an unlocked back door and leave with a laptop 
computer and other electronics gear, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said $1,900 worth of electronics equipment was recovered.  
The players each face six to 12 months in jail if convicted of the 
felony counts.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stock Prices Surge / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks surged today after a small  
investment newspaper reported that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi may 
decide to freeze the national sales tax. The dollar fell against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 296.85  
points, or 1.84 percent, ending the day at 16,408.50. On Monday, 
the average closed up 138.97 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 121.11 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
0.25 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. Currency markets in New York 
were closed Monday for a national holiday. The dollar ranged from 
120.93 yen to 121.90 yen today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices rose on the report by the Nikkan Toshi Shimbun, or  
Japan Investment Journal, that Obuchi's government may decide in 
June to suspend the 5 percent national sales tax as part of a new 
economic stimulus measure. The little-known newspaper, which did 
not identify sources, said the announcement may come on June 16 
before the Group of Seven summit in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's strong denial of the report did not halt the  
rapid rise, while the report pushed hedge funds into the market, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also supported by Japanese jobless data and  
expectations that New York stocks might advance later today, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, the government said Japan's April unemployment  
rate stayed at the record high 4.8 percent, although a higher rate 
had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate among men rose to an all-time high of 5.0  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 20.29 points, or 1.56 percent, to 1,317.48. 
The TOPIX closed down 5.12 points, or 0.39 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 433.13 million shares, up from 375.54 million on 
Monday. Gainers outpaced decliners 848 to 327, with 128 issues 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar fell as the speculation of the  
sales tax freeze triggered selling of the U.S. currency against the 
yen, although buying by Japanese investors soon underpinned the 
dollar, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a rumor, and we are not sure whether it's true or  
not. We can't continue selling dollars on just that report,'' said 
Shigeru Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.28 yen, down  
from 128.31 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6150 percent late afternoon, up from Monday's finish 
of 1.4750 percent, driving its price down to 98.14 yen from 99.34 
yen.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall on Inflation Fears / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices plummeted Tuesday on new fears about  
higher interest rates, pushing yields to their highest level in 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury fell 1 7/32 point,  
or $12.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the 
opposite direction, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.83 percent late 
Friday. The market was closed Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds tumbled after the National Association of Purchasing  
Management said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 55.2 in 
May, higher than analysts expected and the highest level since 
October 1997. The group's index of prices paid also rose in the 
month, indicating more companies reported price increases during 
the month. 
</P>
<P>
	The report provided fresh evidence that the vigorous U.S.  
economy may be overheating heading into the summer. Traders fear 
that may cause the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates to slow 
it down. Last month, the Fed opted against a rate increase, but 
hinted that it's leaning toward a raise. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-term issues fell between 7/32 point and 11/32 point, while  
intermediate-term issues fell between 19/32 point and 1 1/32 point, 
according to Bridge Telerate, a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 4.66 percent as the  
discount rose to 4.63 percent from 4.51 percent. Six-month yields 
rose to 4.87 percent, as the discount gained 0.12 percentage point 
to 4.76 percent. One-year yields rose to 5.04 percent as the 
discount rose 0.09 percentage point to 4.80 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.06 1/4 percent from 4.87 1/2 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 19/32 to 121 1/4 from 121 27/32 Friday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.42 percent from 5.39 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Blazers Look To Recover at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Western Conference finals don't resume  
until Friday, and the Portland Trail Blazers will need every minute 
of the layoff to repair their psyche. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is the toughest loss that we've had all season,''  
Damon Stoudamire said. ``But the good thing about this is ... we've 
got three days to regroup, and then they're going to come into a 
hostile environment in Portland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers couldn't help but be rattled by Monday night's 86-85  
loss to San Antonio in Game 2. After all, they didn't trail in that 
game for 47 minutes and 51 seconds. Then Sean Elliott stood on his 
tiptoes, his feet barely in bounds, and hit the 3-pointer that gave 
the Spurs a 2-0 lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed to Portland's players that fate just wouldn't let them  
beat San Antonio. Four times this season the Blazers have taken the 
Spurs to a tight finish, only to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took incredible shots to beat us,'' Portland coach Mike  
Dunleavy said. ``I'd give (Elliott) 100 bucks to see him make that 
shot again. It was one of those shots you dream about making ... I 
told the guys they have nothing to hang their heads about. It's 
getting harder and harder for this team to beat us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich says the momentum of the  
miracle comeback from an 18-point third-quarter deficit probably 
won't last until the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we were coming back and playing tomorrow it would be  
huge,'' he said. ``But Friday is like 2 1/2 weeks from now. Nobody 
will even be able to remember this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs won't fly to Portland until Wednesday afternoon, after  
they've worked out in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs' eight-game playoff winning streak will be tested in  
the noisy Rose Garden, where the Blazers lost just three times 
during the regular season and are 5-0 in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Portland must win four out of five, including at least  
once in the Alamodome, to advance to the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see why we can't,'' Greg Anthony said. ``We're a real  
confident basketball team. We're a real talented basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers are at least comforted by the fact they weren't run  
out of the Alamodome. They lost the opener 80-76 and had a chance 
at the tying shot with six seconds to go. They led Game 2 
comfortably most of the way and lost only because of an amazing 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs' grudgingly gave the Blazers credit, but they want a  
little for themselves, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``They played two terrific games,'' Mario Elie said. ``They had  
a chance to win both games, but people seem to not give us credit. 
They said what Portland did wrong, what the Lakers did wrong. I 
just want to hear what the Spurs did right.''

<HEADLINE> Ailing 49ers Coach Back On the Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The clothes are different, but Bobb  
McKittrick insists his fight against cancer hasn't changed his 
coaching style. 
</P>
<P>
	The longtime 49ers offensive line coach watches practice from a  
golf cart and has had to give up his favored attire of shorts and 
T-shirt. He now wears heavier clothes and a floppy hat to protect 
him from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are about the only concessions the 63-year-old assistant  
has made to the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't changed me much really,'' said McKittrick, who was  
back on the job Tuesday for the start of a three-week minicamp. 
</P>
<P>
	He came home from Stanford Hospital last Thursday, three days  
after doctors were forced to cancel a liver transplant because 
exploratory surgery showed his cancer had spread. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always had a pretty good attitude and everything and I'm  
going to keep it,'' said McKittrick, who was diagnosed with cancer 
of the bile duct in January. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't cure something, but if you stay positive and keep  
charging hard, it's the best thing you can do. I talked to the 
doctor and there's no cut and dried answer on any of these things. 
But he said, `I wouldn't change any plan that you've got because of 
what's wrong.' You just go like you're going to live forever and if 
something happens, we'll work on it at that time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKittrick, who has coached five Super Bowl-winning offensive  
lines in his 21 years with the team, said he's always loved his job 
and wants to keep working as long as possible. He said it's good 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you get an adrenaline rush when you come out here,''  
said McKittrick, whose wife, Teckla, brought him to practice and 
waited for him to finish to take him to a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling better than I really am because I got an  
adrenaline rush. In a while, that'll be gone and I'll feel like 
sitting down or laying down. I still hurt. I've got incisions and 
an infection in part of the incision but I feel good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci said he and his staff and the  
players still benefit from McKittrick's insights and his 
determination to stay on the job has been a source of emotional 
strength for the entire team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He won't allow you to get choked up,'' Mariucci said. ``All he  
talks about is the other people in the hospital that are worse off 
than him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not required to be here. He's required to take care of  
himself, rest up and get healthy. But he wants to do this. He wants 
to be around the players and the coaches and he's been nothing but 
an inspiration to all of us. We're all pulling for him and praying 
for him. He's a champ.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Kids-Violence Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Modeling his anti-school-violence campaign  
after his assault on Joe Camel and the tobacco industry, President 
Clinton ordered a government investigation today of how the 
entertainment business markets violence to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of  
violence. And it sells,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years of studies, he said, have documented that by the  
time a typical American child turns 18, he or she has seen 40,000 
``play'' murders and 200,000 dramatized acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boundary between fantasy and reality violence -- which is a  
clear line for most adults -- can become very blurred for vulnerable 
children,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million joint study by the Federal Trade Commission and  
Justice Department, expected to take up to 18 months, will examine 
industry marketing practices much as the government investigated 
tobacco ad campaigns that it determined were aimed at tempting to 
kids to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton held up ads for video games, one of which pictured a gun  
and promised ``More fun than shooting your neighbor's cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at some of these ads, it's hard to argue with a  
straight face that the games were made for adults in the first 
place,'' Clinton said. ``Advertisements have a particular role 
here. They have the power to egg children on and lure them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Garden announcement today by the president and Hillary  
Rodham Clinton comes three weeks after the Clintons convened a 
White House meeting of movie-industry lobbyist Jack Valenti and 
five dozen of the nation's leading educators, officials, 
entertainers and gun advocates to brainstorm ways to reduce 
violence among youth amid a rising tide of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton cited a ``culture of violence that is engulfing  
American children every day,'' and asked: ``What kind of values are 
we promoting when a child can walk into a store and find video 
games where you win based on how many people you can kill or how 
many places you can blow up? '' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady quoted from a 1972 Surgeon General's report that  
documented how children imitate the violent scenes they see on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Attorney General Janet Reno: ``We now need to know more  
about how children learn about the existence and the content of 
violent material and why they are drawn to them -- whether it be 
movies of video cames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a White House background paper, the entertainment  
study will review ``whether and how the video game, motion picture 
and recording industries'' purposefully market adult material to 
children and only laxly restrict sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart called it a ``real  
serious study,'' but it was unclear whether the federal agencies 
would subpoena internal marketing memos and other industry 
documents. Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert said the Justice 
Department and FTC already have subpoena power and, while the study 
would be independent of White House control, Clinton envisions it 
as encompassing internal industry records. 
</P>
<P>
	A lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America did not  
immediately return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall; Dow Down 66.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell today as a new report on the growing  
U.S. economy intensified traders' fears about inflation and higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 66.07 at 10,493.67. Earlier in the session, the blue-chip 
index had tumbled as much as 150 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 11.67 at 1,290.17, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 39.08 at 2,430.81. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about inflation, which have increased the market's  
volatility over the past two weeks, were behind today's decline as 
well. Prices dropped after the National Association of Purchasing 
Management said the nation's industrial economy expanded for a 
fourth straight month in May. The report, which gauges the health 
of the nation's factories, was much stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's report is widely followed by economists because it  
usually provides the first indication of how the economy performed 
in the just-ended month. Today's report was highly anticipated as 
traders sought a sign that the economy is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the report, which revealed strong price rises in raw  
materials for the first time in 16 months, sent stocks skidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the skittishness about inflation, the real surprise  
from this report is that we didn't drop even farther, even 
faster,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also pressured bond prices. The 30-year Treasury bond  
plunged, sending its yield up to 5.93 percent from late Friday's 
5.83 percent. The yield is now at its highest level in more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders are increasingly worried that rising inflation  
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, leading to 
higher corporate borrowing costs and lower profits. Rising rates 
also make bonds a more attractive investment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Another report released today suggested some softening in the  
economy, but the news wasn't enough to offset the effects of the 
purchasing managers' survey. The Index of Leading Economic 
Indicators fell 0.1 percent in April, its first decline since June 
1998, according to the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks led today's decline, as IBM fell 4 1/8 to 111 7/8.  
Hewlett Packard fell 3 7/16 to 90 7/8 after an analyst at Banc of 
America Securities downgraded its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Telebanc Financial Corporation shot up 10 5/8 to 77 1/8 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market after online brokerage ETrade said it will acquire 
Telebanc to create an Internet-based financial services company. 
ETrade fell 3 3/4 to 40 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch led a number of brokerage stocks lower, dropping 7  
1/16 to 76 15/16, after it announced plans to offer low-fee 
Internet stock trading. Conventional brokerages are facing 
competitive pressure from the growing number of online brokerages, 
yet they fear losing their hefty commissions from full-fee 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 431.6 million shares, 
slightly behind Friday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.01 at 618.25, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 3.83 at 774.91. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 1.99 at  
436.69.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Wants Charismatic Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer D. Wayne Lukas is concerned about  
Charismatic's competition when he bids for the Triple Crown in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the best available. He doesn't want to hear comments  
about the quality of the rivals or questions about whether 
Charismatic deserves to be a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope everybody who has one ready runs him,'' Lukas  
said. ``We don't want any second-guessing on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner ran Tuesday at Churchill  
Downs on a track wet from overnight rain, his final significant 
work before Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Also working for the final time was the filly Silverbulletday,  
one of Charismatic's major challengers in what is expected to be a 
12-horse field for the 1 1/2-mile classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic worked in predawn darkness at about 6 a.m. EDT and  
went five-eighths of a mile in 1:00 2-5, going the last quarter in 
24 seconds. He galloped out three-quarters in 1:14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased,'' Lukas said. ``I was happy he was able to  
stretch his legs and open his lungs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, who will be making her debut against males,  
worked five-eighths of a mile about 2 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert said the winner of 11 of 12 starts, was  
timed in 59 1-5 and galloped out in 1:12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't she look beautiful, though,'' Baffert said as the  
filly raced down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fantastic,'' Baffert said. ``It showed me what I was  
looking for.'' Then, he quipped, ``I don't know what I was looking 
for, but it looked good when I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope she runs the way she worked,'' said owner Mike  
Pegram, also owner of the Baffert-owned Real Quiet, who failed to 
win the Triple Crown last year when he finished second in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also missed the Triple Crown in 1997 with a second-place  
Belmont finish by Silver Charm, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, 
owners of Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, Silverbulletday and three other Belmont contenders  
-- Prime Directive, Patience Game and Pineaff -- will be flown from 
Louisville to New York on Wednesday. They are expected to arrive at 
Belmont Park at about 10 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top Belmont contender, Menifee, second in both the Derby  
and Preakness, already is at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, a strapping chestnut, seems to have started acting  
like a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting a little more difficult to handle, but only since  
the Preakness (May 15),'' Lukas said. ``He's a little more on the 
muscle. That could be from (all of) the racing. It's not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont will be Charismatic's fifth race in 10 weeks. A  
fourth straight victory -- he won the Lexington on April 18 at 
Keeneland -- would make him the 12th Triple Crown winner and the 
first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will be the 21st filly to start in 131 Belmonts.  
The only two to win were Ruthless in the first Belmont in 1867 and 
Tanya in 1905. Ruthless beat three males over 1 5-8 miles, and 
Tanya beat six rivals, including another filly, at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she wins it's going to be a great race,'' Baffert said.  
``If Charismatic wins, it's going to be a great race. It will be 
good for racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected to be entered Wednesday are Adonis, Best of Luck,  
Lemon Drop Kid, Stephen Got Even, Vision and Verse and Teletable.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ready for Campaign Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he's eager to  
leave the safe confines of Texas to test his mettle as a 
presidential candidate. ``I'm a battler,'' he said. ``I love to 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have plenty of opportunities, as his political rivals seek  
to portray Bush as unproven, unworthy and unwilling to lead on 
tough issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a state legislative session he called ``successful  
and substantial,'' the Texas governor heads next week to Iowa and 
New Hampshire knowing he cannot possibly live up to the hype of his 
front-runner status. ``I understand the polls and the expectations 
are out of sight,'' Bush said in a session-closing news conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as  
they think you are.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Without spending a single day on the campaign trail, the son of  
former President Bush is the Republican's top money raiser and 
leads every GOP presidential poll. His political organization, 
seeded with endorsements of the party's establishment, has begun to 
take shape in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	He was raking in more money Tuesday night at a San Antonio  
fund-raiser, the first he has attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the big question in American politics today is whether this  
amiable, twice-elected self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' 
can hold up under campaign pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to see what happens when he's exposed to oxygen. Some  
candidates erode,'' said consultant Dick Morris, who has worked for 
Republicans and Democrats. ``He's been in sequestration for so long 
that we don't know what will happen when he gets a whiff of air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's finally time for us to determine whether he is ready for  
the big leagues,'' Tony Coehlo, chairman of Vice President Al 
Gore's 2000 campaign, said in a telephone interview from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic operatives are already in Austin combing state  
records for political landmines that could be used against Bush in 
the general election. Coehlo said Gore's campaign is researching 
Bush's professional -- not personal -- background. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's support of a concealed weapons law in Texas,  
coupled with his hedging on the gun control debate in Washington, 
will work against him in the campaign. ``You have to question 
whether he's tested,'' Coehlo said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, abortion, global warming and a few other national  
issues, Bush has responded slowly or issued ambiguous statements. 
He told reporters Tuesday not to expect detailed policy positions 
anytime soon, ducking questions about his tax policies and other 
dicey topics, such as ethanol subsidies in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be ample time during the course of the summer and  
fall to lay out a specific agenda on taxes and other measures,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to contrast herself to Bush, GOP rival Elizabeth Dole has  
scheduled what aides say is a major policy address in Iowa on the 
day Bush makes his first campaign visit to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dole campaign will be issue-based and focused,'' spokesman  
Ari Fleischer said, implying that the Bush campaign will be 
neither. ``She knows who she is and what she stands for and won't 
hesitate to speak out on politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP rivals suggest that Bush simply isn't ready for prime  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get him off the front porch and into the race,''  
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said in a telephone 
interview. ``I'm eager to find out whether he's just another 
popular governor or whether he's ready to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president under President Bush and a GOP  
presidential candidate in 2000, is warning Republicans that it 
would be a disaster to follow the polls and stampede behind the 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush bristles at suggestions that he is living off the family  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people know a little more about me than you give  
people credit for,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``They know I got a 
great mother and dad, of which I'm most proud. They're going to 
learn soon that I have a great wife. They're going to learn that I 
love my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to even learn that I'm a tax-cutter,  
that I care about education, that I care passionately about making 
sure that we don't leave people behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush plans to use the 1999 legislative session to make those  
points. He helped secure $1.8 billion in tax cuts plus a raft of 
education initiatives, including $3,000 raises for teachers. Though 
the biggest tax cut in the state's history, Bush had sought nearly 
twice as much, and the reduction will likely have a marginal impact 
on Texans (the property tax will return about $60 to the owner of a 
$100,000 home). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fixing to leave (for the campaign) and I'm looking forward  
to it,'' Bush said. ``I know I'm late in particular states. I know 
I have a lot of work to do. I know the expectations are high. But 
it's OK. I'm a battler. I love to battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bush backers say he is bound to stumble but the true  
measure of their candidate will be his ability to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have expectations this unrealistically high it is  
inevitable that there is a bit of correction,'' said GOP strategist 
Bruce Reed, a Bush ally. ``But the truth is anybody who think 
George W. Bush has a glass jaw is going to break their hand trying 
to swing at it.''

<HEADLINE> George Brett, Brothers To Make Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- After getting 3,154 hits in a Hall of Fame  
career, George Brett knows bats the way a winemaker knows grapes. 
So getting into bat production is a natural. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and his brothers just bought half-ownership of TriDiamond  
Sports, a revolutionary bat maker, and renamed it Brett Bros. Bat 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike traditional bats milled from single pieces of wood, these  
bats are composed of three strips of Northern White Ash. The strips 
are glued to form a stick said to be 20 percent stronger than the 
models swung by Hank Aaron or Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard so many good things about these bats that it was a  
no-brainer,'' said Brett, a 13-time All-Star with Kansas City who 
will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. will join a movement to replace aluminum bats with  
so-called composite wooden ones that last longer than old-fashioned 
models, said Brett, who never used an aluminum bat in a game. 
Professional baseball has never allowed aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the high cost of replacing broken wooden bats that fueled  
the rise of aluminum bats in the amateur ranks about 30 years ago. 
Since then, a generation of Little Leaguers and college players 
have played the game without ever knowing the sublime feeling of 
crushing a cowhide ball with a wooden bat. 
</P>
<P>
	But times are changing.  
</P>
<P>
	Several companies are making composite wooden bats of various  
forms, hoping to reclaim the high school and college markets, and 
even softball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who grows up and plays baseball knows wood is the way  
baseball is meant to be played,'' said Spokane businessman Bobby 
Brett, a former minor league player who brought the bat deal to his 
three brothers: George, former major leaguer Ken Brett and former 
minor leaguer John Brett. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Brett, 83-85 in a 15-year pitching career with 10 teams,  
will be vice president of marketing for the bat company. Ken Brett 
batted .262 during his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing admirable family togetherness, the Bretts also co-own  
minor league baseball, hockey and soccer teams in Spokane, and real 
estate in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Brett became aware of TriDiamond Sports about two years  
ago, when co-owner Joe Sample asked the Bretts' Class A Spokane 
Indians to try out the new composite bats. The sticks held up well 
during batting practice, and Brett was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sample, a thoroughbred horse breeder, and his partners developed  
the new bats with researchers at Washington State University's 
nearby Pullman campus who worked under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Their process electronically scans each piece of ash, screening  
the wood for imperfections that can cause a bat to break. Pieces of 
cleared wood then are glued together, shaped into bats and 
laminated for extra strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, braided fibers of aerospace materials are bonded up the  
first 18 inches of the neck, forming what look like permanent 
batting grips. No need for extra pine tar here. 
</P>
<P>
	The grips were added when research by WSU's Wood Materials and  
Engineering Laboratory found that most wooden bats break below the 
label, where the wood starts to taper towards the knob. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing proved the new bats can withstand about 20 percent more  
``impacts per bat'' than regular bats. 
</P>
<P>
	TriDiamond began marketing the bats a couple of years ago, but  
progress was slow until the Bretts entered the picture a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``TriDiamond lacked name recognition,'' Sample said. ``When the  
bats changed to Brett, it eliminated that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. has already shipped its bats to 20 major league  
teams for their farm systems, Sample said. The bats are approved 
for use in the rookie and Class A ranks of the minor leagues, and 
the company hopes for approval in higher rungs of the minors next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	George Brett, a vice president with the Royals, hands the bats  
out to interested major league players for use in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But he concedes it's unlikely major league baseball will shift  
to composite bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd have to put an asterisk on all batting records,'' Brett  
said from Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. bats are cheaper than aluminum bats, and are being  
marketed as a money-saving tool for teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Brett said his Spokane Indians broke 392 wooden bats  
during their 76-game season last year, an average of five per game, 
and he expects better from the composites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 12 unbroken bats at the end of the season,'' Brett  
said. ``We think these will save money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In college baseball, concerns have been raised about the safety  
of players due to the increasing velocity of balls bashed with 
high-tech aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Because aluminum bats hit the ball longer than wooden bats,  
college baseball has seen an eruption of power hitting, George 
Brett said. He contends wooden bats will make the college game more 
comparable to professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``College kids are used to getting jammed and still getting home  
runs,'' Brett said. ``With a wooden bat you can't do that. You've 
got to hit balls on the sweet spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweet spot is technically known as the bat's longitudinal  
nodal point. On a 35-inch, 32-ounce bat, the sweet spot is at 27.3 
inches from the handle end. 
</P>
<P>
	If hit there, the ball will sail farther and the player will  
feel no sting in the hands from vibrations. But if the player 
misses the sweet spot, the ball may not go as far, and the bat 
might break. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who grew up with aluminum bats have to be taught to  
avoid hitting a baseball on the vulnerable label of a wooden bat. 
For that reason, Brett Bats also sells a flat-faced bat designed to 
teach young players to keep the label facing up.

<HEADLINE> United Way Chief's Sentence Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let stand the  
seven-year prison sentence former United Way president William 
Aramony received for stealing money from the nation's largest 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which  
Aramony argued that his prison term exceeds federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Aramony was convicted in 1995 of defrauding the charity out of  
about $600,000. He was found guilty of fraud, tax and conspiracy 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Aramony looted United Way accounts to romance  
young women and enrich himself. He was forced to resign in 1992 
after 22 years with the charity. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, Aramony contended that the 4th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that last January upheld his 
punishment ``produces unjustifiably harsh sentences'' because it 
increases a prison term whenever a defendant ``uses his position in 
a charitable organization to perpetrate a fraud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The stiffer sentencing guidelines should apply, the appeal said,  
only when a defendant ``falsely represents that he has authority to 
act on behalf of a charitable or other organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In upholding his conviction, the appeals court said Aramony  
``did not misrepresent his authority to act on behalf of (United 
Way) but he did misrepresent that he was acting wholly on behalf'' 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Aramony vs. U.S., 98-1720.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Student Testifies at Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- In apparent violation of his doctor's orders  
against heavy exercise, Boston Celtics captain Reggie Lewis was 
running, shooting baskets and dunking days before he died in July 
1993, a former Northeastern University student said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony marking the start of the defense case at the  
malpractice trial stemming from Lewis' death, Sean Curran told how 
a chance encounter at a gym water fountain four days before Lewis' 
death led to a one-on-one practice session with his idol. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, the All-Star even fetched Curran's rebounds.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was missing a lot of shots, so he had to jump and run and  
get the ball back to me as quick as possible,'' said Curran, whose 
story suggested Lewis may have been ignoring the orders of his 
cardiologist, Dr. Gilbert Mudge, not to engage in heavy exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning by Mudge's attorney, Curran -- who testified  
that he was alone with Lewis during the 2-hour session -- said the 
practice was intense enough to make both men sweat. He also said 
that before meeting Lewis, he watched the player run up and down 
the court, taking shots and dunking. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith  
denied defense motions to dismiss the suit against Mudge and two of 
his consultants but said the case -- particularly against the 
consultants -- was far from strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, the case is very slim,'' Fremont-Smith said, without  
the jury present, in his first extended courtroom comments since 
the trial began almost a month ago. ``But that's why we have 
jurors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury will have to decide whether Drs. Mudge, Mark Creager  
and Peter Friedman were negligent in their care of Lewis, who died 
of a cardiac arrhythmia as he practiced jump shots July 27, 1993. 
He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge had told Lewis he had a neurological condition that causes  
fainting spells, going against a previous diagnosis by a team of 
doctors who said Lewis had a life-threatening, potentially 
career-ending heart ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis is suing for the money Lewis could have made  
had he lived, estimates of which have been as high as $117 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran, who practiced daily in hopes of making the Northeastern  
basketball team, said he was amazed when the former star at that 
school took the time not only to offer tips, but to engage in a 
strenuous practice session with him after the two met at the water 
fountain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a real down-to-earth person,'' said Curran, who  
attended Northeastern from 1991 to 1994. ``He didn't put on any 
airs about anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curran, now living in Ramona, Calif., and studying computer  
science, never made the team. 
</P>
<P>
	During cross-examination, plaintiff's attorney Robert Harley did  
not challenge Curran's assertions about Lewis' alleged exertion on 
the court. He sought instead to portray Curran as a failed, 
starstruck athlete and highlight the fact that Lewis was generous 
with his time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of overwhelming,'' Curran said. ``It was a very  
nice day and I'll remember it for the rest of my life.''

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Denies Ordering Key Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- On trial for his life, Kurdish  
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan rejected blame Tuesday for the 1993 
slaughter of dozens of unarmed soldiers, an attack that shattered a 
rebel cease-fire and led to a massive military crackdown on 
Turkey's Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan also denied that his group had a hand in the 1986 slaying  
of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and rejected accusations that 
he ordered attacks on Turkish tourist sites in which several 
foreigners were killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, however, accepted overall responsibility for the 15-year  
war waged by his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The conflict has 
killed 37,000 people, mostly Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the person with the highest responsibility for the deeds  
and actions of the organization,'' he told the court on the second 
day of his trial. He spoke through a microphone in a bulletproof, 
bombproof cage on the prison island of Imrali, where he is the only 
inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions by Judge Turgut Okyay, Ocalan said his  
militants have received training in camps in Greece and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's testimony appeared designed to distance himself from  
the most brutal attacks attributed to his fighters. The Kurdish 
guerrilla leader faces death if convicted of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	There is widespread support in Turkey for executing Ocalan, who  
is considered by most Turks to be personally responsible for the 
suffering caused by the war. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ocalan repeated his apology -- first made Monday -- for the  
deaths of Turkish soldiers, relatives of the war dead silently 
raised pictures of their loved ones Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took 25,000 lives from me!'' Ocalan shot back.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, about a dozen of the relatives addressed the  
court, calling for Ocalan's execution. The mother of one slain 
soldier fainted after she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the head of this snake to be crushed as soon as  
possible,'' said Metin Karabiyik, the father of a slain soldier, 
pointing at Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan told the court that the 1993 slaying of 33 unarmed  
soldiers in the southeastern province of Bingol was carried out by 
a regional PKK commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaughter ended the rebel's unilateral cease-fire and led  
the military to intensify a campaign aimed at annihilating the 
guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that campaign, soldiers have burned thousands of  
Kurdish villages, leaving large sections of the southeast 
abandoned, a tactic aimed at denying the rebels local support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not possible to condone the death of these soldiers,''  
Ocalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added there were struggles within the PKK and that dozens of  
former guerrillas had been executed for deviating from the 
organization's line. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that allegations that he was behind the  
assassination of Palme were circulated by dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been attempts to put the blame for several murders  
in Europe, including the murder of Olof Palme, on me,'' Ocalan 
said. ``The senior members of the organization who have said that 
orders for those actions were given by me, are those who are 
opposed to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ocalan -- who ruled his group with an iron hand --  
appeared conciliatory, ordering his fighters to lay down their arms 
but threatening Turkey with more bloodshed if he is hanged for 
treason. It was Ocalan's first direct call for an end to the 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	He also offered to transform his group into a political  
organization, a move certain to be rejected by Turkey, which 
regards any hints of Kurdish nationalism as a direct threat to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish newspapers expressed outrage at Ocalan's offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Traitor and coward,'' the daily Aksam said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his apology Monday, rebels attacked a police outpost  
in the southeastern province of Van, killing one soldier and 
wounding three others, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is taking place before a State Security Court. Such  
courts have been called biased by human rights organizations, since 
the three-member panel includes a military judge.

	Leading Economic Indicators Decline  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A key gauge of future economic activity declined  
in April for the first time since June 1998, suggesting some 
softening in the economy, the Conference Board said today. Still, 
economists at the nonprofit business research group said the 0.1 
percent fall in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators -- 
following six months of advances -- was not a cause for alarm or a 
suggestion that the U.S. expansion was at an end. This looks like 
only a temporary pause, although last week's drop in the stock 
market adds some complications,'' said Michael Boldin, director of 
business cycle research at the Conference Board. 

</P>
<P>
	Purchasing Managers Index Rises  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the nation's industrial economy expanded for  
a fourth straight month in May, prices paid by manufacturers rose 
for the first time in 16 months, a private report said today. The 
National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly 
index of business activity rose sharply to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in 
April -- a much stronger showing than analysts had expected. 

</P>
<P>
	Construction Spending Down 2.4 Pct.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending, which had been one of  
the driving forces in the economic expansion, fell by a sharp 2.4 
percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in more than five 
years, the government reported today. The Commerce Department said 
the declines were widespread with decreases reported in 
single-family homes, apartment buildings, office buildings and big 
government projects. The 2.4 percent drop caught analysts by 
surprise. Many had been expecting the country's construction boom 
to continue in April although at a slightly slower pace than 
previous months. The April decline followed five straight monthly 
increases.

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to auto showrooms are resuming 
contract talks after averting a strike early today that could have 
meant long delays in the delivery of some models. Union President 
James P. Hoffa told reporters following a post-midnight bargaining 
session that the 12:01 a.m. EDT strike deadline was being extended 
for 24 hours to discuss management's ``11th hour'' economic 
proposal. Talks were to resume this morning. Hoffa said the main 
sticking points with the 17 affected companies were management 
proposals to pay a lower wage to newly hired drivers and to hire 
part-time workers.

ETrade as well as long-established brokerages like Charles Schwab, 
announced today it is creating an Internet site for individuals to 
buy and sell stocks for $29.95 a trade. The nation's largest 
brokerage said in a statement the site will begin operating in 
December and will also allow users of the site to purchase mutual 
funds, bonds and other securities. The move poses a big risk for 
Merrill Lynch, which makes billions of dollars annually through 
full-fee commissions on stock and other trades and depends on its 
network of 15,000 brokers for its customer base. But mainstream 
investment firms are finding themselves increasingly pressured to 
compete with online brokerages by offering lower fees for trades 
executed online. Merrill Lynch stock is down 6 11/16 to 77 5/16.

services, the two firms announced today. Under the terms of the 
deal, ETrade will acquire Arlington-based Telebanc in a stock 
transaction worth about $1.8 billion, the companies said in a 
written statement. ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., made its 
name as a stock brokerage but has been trying to diversify. With 
Telebanc in its fold, ETrade has moved closer to becoming a 
full-service financial site, offering a range of online services

<HEADLINE> 2 To Be Tried in Mich. School Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Two 13-year-old boys accused with two  
other teen-agers of plotting a massacre at their middle school 
after the rampage in Colorado were ordered Tuesday to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge James Corden ruled that he saw enough evidence that a  
conspiracy to commit murder did exist and bound over Daniel Fick 
and Jonathan McDonald for trial. A trial date was not immediately 
set. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar hearing for co-defendants Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah  
``David'' Zinzo, both 14, was held last week. The judge in their 
case put off a ruling until attorneys can submit briefs. 
</P>
<P>
	The older boys are charged as adults; the younger two are  
charged in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	All four could face life in prison if convicted. However,  
because the 13-year-olds are charged in juvenile court, a judge 
could also decide to sentence them to juvenile detention, where 
they could be held up to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses at the younger boys' hearing Tuesday described in  
similar detail what was first revealed about the alleged plot at 
the older boys' hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	The students' classmates said the defendants talked of staging a  
robbery to obtain firearms, seizing the Holland Woods Middle School 
office, using the public address system to call an assembly in the 
gym and then slaughtering students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they foiled the plot after classmates reported  
it to school officials.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturers Spark Inflation Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A report by the nation's manufacturers of the  
first rise in prices for raw materials in 16 months sparked 
concerns in financial markets that inflation is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing figures came in a mixed bag of reports Tuesday --  
the first monthly decline in nearly a year in a key gauge of future 
economic activity and a big drop in construction spending, but 
continued strength in the industrial economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in 
April -- a much stronger showing than analysts had expected and an 
indication that the industrial sector is strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	Unexpected, however, was the rise in the association's price  
index, which jumped to 52.2 in May from 49.9 in April. It was the 
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were seeing higher prices for commodities ranging from paper to 
petroleum, the trade association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on prices rattled financial markets, which have been  
concerned that the Federal Reserve will follow through on its 
threat to raise interest rates if it sees inflation building up in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down almost 270 points last  
week as inflation jitters grew on Wall Street, was off by up to an 
additional 150 after the manufacturers' report was released 
Tuesday. But a late buying spree left the Dow with a gain of 36.52 
to close at 10,596.26 even as broader indicators fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blue-chip stocks staged a comeback, the bond market  
retreated. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, a barometer for 
long-term consumer and business borrowing costs, edged closer 
toward 6 percent, reaching the highest level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in  
Columbus, Ohio, said the purchasing managers' report on prices 
``caught the market by absolute surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it contributed to the view that ``the question is when,  
not if, rates will be raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York took a wait-and-see attitude 
about the rise in raw-material prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes up from here, I would begin to get concerned,'' Ms.  
Schaja said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other economic gauges released Tuesday suggested that  
inflationary pressures, for the time being, are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group, said  
Tuesday that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators -- a gauge of 
future economic activity -- declined in April for the first time 
since June 1998, suggesting some softening in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said construction spending  
fell by a sharp 2.4 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline 
in more than five years for an industry that has been a driving 
force in the economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers, a group that represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for manufacturers, saw some good in 
the rise in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though commodity prices are active and rising, we must keep in  
mind the extent of the decline that they have experienced. Many 
commodity producers have had a tough time over the last year and a 
half and some upward movement probably constitutes welcome 
relief,'' said the report released by Norbert J. Ore, director of 
purchasing at Chesapeake Corp., and chairman of the Business Survey 
Committee of the purchasing managers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he did not expect the price increases -- which  
showed up most strongly in petroleum products, metals, plastics and 
paper -- to be passed along by manufacturers to their customers 
because ``there is still considerable excess capacity'' in the 
industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said the Index of Leading Economic  
Indicators fell 0.1 percent in April to 107.1, the first decline 
since June 1998, when the gauge fell 0.2 percent. A revised figure 
for March showed the index unchanged at 107.2 from the previous 
month following five consecutive monthly increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting a slight rise in the index.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the  
Conference Board, said that a single month's dip in the index did 
not necessarily signal that the economy's strong growth would 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at trends over six months before we have any  
concern,'' Boldin said. He noted that despite April's decline, the 
index was up some 1.3 percent over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like only a temporary pause, although last week's  
drop in the stock market adds some complications,'' Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Jerry Jasinowski, who is president of the National  
Association of Manufacturers, agreed, saying: ``The mild decrease 
in the index comes after a long sequence of increases and is more 
of an anomaly than the start of a negative trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Those waiting for the sky to start falling are  
craning their necks in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, which  
measure current activity, rose 0.2 percent in April, while its 
lagging index which reflects the economy's past performance, rose 
0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Fighting Spills Into Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- NATO jets accidentally bombed government  
bunkers in northern Albania on Tuesday, injuring a Kosovo refugee 
as fighting raged along the border between Serb forces and ethnic 
Albanian guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	The strikes narrowly missed a group of foreign journalists  
covering the border fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	The aircraft, some of them A-10 ground attack jets, were  
attempting to bomb Serb positions just inside Kosovo when they 
unleashed their load on a line of Albanian military bunkers 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard what I thought was a low-flying aircraft overhead but  
it was a missile. It hit about 100 meters away. I could feel the 
heat. Debris from the explosion was flying overhead,'' said 
Associated Press Television News cameraman Thomas Nicholson, one of 
a dozen journalists in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondents scattered after the first explosion, and the  
jets returned again to hit the bunker line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said a  
Kosovo Albanian refugee was injured in the second bombing and taken 
by monitors to nearby Kukes for treatment. His condition apparently 
was not serious. 
</P>
<P>
	A NATO official in Brussels, who spoke on condition of  
anonymity, said a number of NATO weapons ``appear to have landed on 
Albanian territory near Morini,'' destroying an Albanian bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	The dome-shaped shelters, built during a frenzy of  
bunker-building during Communist rule, are located about 500 yards 
within Albanian territory, and about half a mile from the nearest 
Serb military target. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian villagers fled in panic near the key border crossing at  
Morini. Some tried to flag down cars. One old man ran down the 
road, shouting and holding up his hands in apparent disbelief at 
what occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Chunks of shrapnel found in deep craters around four of the  
bunkers carried assembly dates and designations of ``high 
explosive'' and ``fin-guided'' in English. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSCE said at least seven bombs were dropped as deep as 2  
miles inside Albanian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO sorties the past several days are being flown in support of  
the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting Serb forces just inside Kosovo. 
The KLA guerrillas have been attempting to move deeper into the 
embattled Yugoslav province to open up a supply corridor and 
capture the Serb border checkpoint at Morini. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSCE said Serb gunners shelled Albanian artillery positions  
and bunkers along the borders overnight, damaging the police 
station at Morini. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of a night of shelling, knots of Albanian villagers  
and refugees took to the road from the border to the 
refugee-swollen area around Kukes. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the refugees have left,'' said Seeim Tusha, 62, a shepherd  
from the hamlet of Durak, the closest Albanian settlement to the 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born here and I will die in this place,'' Tusha said  
tending a flock of sheep on a rocky hillside overlooking the border 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporadic gunfire echoing through the valley mingled with the  
buzz of NATO warplanes overhead and the bleating of sheep. 
</P>
<P>
	Several miles deeper into Albania, refugee Xhemael Ademi, his  
wife and 2-year-old son walked along the road toward Kukes, saying 
six Serb shells landed around the village where they were staying. 
A large crater was seen in the midst of a wheat field. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrying their possessions in a single handbag, the farming  
family said it had been expelled by Serb authorities from their 
home in the border village of Zhur two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee workers are concerned about the militarization of the  
northeastern Albanian frontier, the main avenue of escape for 
citizens fleeing Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The security situation both at the border crossing and to the  
north in Kruma seems to be deteriorating practically by the hour, 
which is making operations extremely difficult, especially for new 
arrivals,'' said U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman 
Rupert Colville. 
</P>
<P>
	A move is under way to relocate nearly 30,000 refugees around  
Kukes to safer camps inside Albania. The refugee camps in Kukes and 
nearby Kruma are within Serb artillery range. 
</P>
<P>
	The UNHCR says 442,000 refugees have sought refuge in Albania  
and nearly as many to Macedonia. In all, 850,000 ethnic Albanians 
have fled Kosovo since March.

<HEADLINE> Australian Economy Shows Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- The Australian economy continues to  
grow strongly in the face of the Asian crisis, expanding beyond 
expectations in the first three months of 1999, official figures 
released Wednesday show. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth was attributed to strong domestic consumer spending.  
</P>
<P>
	Australia gross domestic product grew 1.1 percent in the three  
months ended March 31, seasonally adjusted, the Australian Bureau 
of Statistics reported. 
</P>
<P>
	This brought the 12-month growth rate to 4.8 percent, the bureau  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are above the expectations of the government, which  
predicted little better than one percent quarterly growth for an 
annual figure of 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The bureau said household spending strengthened by 1.7 percent  
in the March quarter, making it 2.6 percent higher than the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Household spending grew in all areas except in purchases of cars  
and cigarettes. Major contributors were recreation and culture, 
hotels, cafes and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	General government spending was down 3.2 percent during the  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Home construction strengthened and while business investment  
also rebounded by 9.6 percent -- although it remained seven percent 
lower than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports of goods and services were down 0.6 percent, seasonally  
adjusted, for the quarter, while imports increased by 3.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Production in agriculture, forestry and fishing and mining rose,  
as did manufacturing production. Construction, however, was down 2 
percent as activity in the non-dwelling building sector weakened. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil and gas bounced back from a low December quarter and coal  
production also increased, the bureau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wholesale trade strengthened by 3.2 percent, adjusted, in the  
quarter while retail trade rose 1.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects CNN Appeal Over Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court rejected a Cable News  
Network appeal today, calling into question whether CNN will have 
to defend itself against accusations it violated a Montana couple's 
constitutional rights because its camera crew accompanied federal 
agents who raided their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without any comment, left intact a federal appeals  
court ruling that would subject CNN to a trial on those 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	But just last week, the nation's highest court said the law  
officers involved in the same Montana case cannot be sued because 
it was not clearly established in 1993, when the raid occurred, 
that allowing such news media access was unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
	If the federal agents who conducted the Montana raid cannot be  
sued, logic would seem to dictate that the camera crew they took 
with them also is immune. But a 1992 Supreme Court ruling made it 
easier to sue private citizens accused of acting with government 
officials to deprive others of their rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Private citizens do not enjoy the same ``qualified immunity,''  
the court said in its 1992 ruling because ``the public interest 
will not be unduly impaired if private individuals are required to 
proceed to trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled last week that police violate people's  
privacy rights when they bring TV camera crews and other 
journalists into homes during arrests or searches. The court ruled 
unanimously that police who allow such access can be sued for 
violating the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court also said that violation was not obvious in 1993.  
That rationale may take CNN off the hook as well, but the 1992 
decision clouds the final outcome. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals already had been told to restudy the Montana case, in which 
it said the officers involved in the 1993 raid could be sued. 
</P>
<P>
	While last week's decision made clear that police can be held  
financially responsible for such incidents in the future, it is 
still undecided whether news media organizations also can be held 
liable. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's unexplained Supreme Court order will not clarify that  
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Only governmental action -- not acts by private citizens or  
companies -- can violate someone's constitutional rights such as the 
Fourth Amendment's privacy protections. But private citizens and 
companies can be deemed to have been governmental agents under 
certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that CNN  
should be considered a government agent because it engaged in a 
``joint action'' -- one carried out ``for the mutual benefit of both 
the private interests of the media and the government officials' 
interest in publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's appeal said that ruling ``will result in less public  
scrutiny of government functions'' and ``raises important First 
Amendment issues.'' The amendment protects freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists pursuing news for independent, professional  
purposes do not act under color of law, even when their 
newsgathering activities inherently involve making arrangements 
with government officials,'' the appeal argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Supreme Court action leaves the 9th Circuit ruling  
intact as a legal precedent in nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S Fish and Wildlife Service agents raided the 75,000-acre  
ranch of Paul and Erma Berger after obtaining a search warrant to 
look for evidence that they were poisoning wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The government had been told by informants that the Bergers were  
using pesticides to poison endangered species such as eagles to 
protect their central Montana ranch's livestock from predators. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the raid, Paul Berger was charged with violating  
federal laws that protect eagles. But a trial jury acquitted him of 
all charges except improper use of a pesticide, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	After Berger's trial, CNN used portions of its footage of the  
search on the environmental news programs ``Earth Matters'' and 
``Network Earth'' as part of its coverage of government efforts to 
protect endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bergers sued the government agents and CNN.  
</P>
<P>
	The case acted on today is CNN vs. Berger, 97-1914.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Pleads Innocent in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A former Australian intelligence  
official, arrested in an FBI sting, pleaded innocent today to a 
charge of attempting to sell U.S. defense secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Philippe Wispelaere entered his plea through his attorney,  
Nina Ginsberg, who requested a jury trial. Wispelaere, wearing a 
green jumpsuit with the word ``prisoner'' stamped on the back, 
stood silently by his attorney's side during the 7-minute 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III set a Sept. 13, trial date  
after Ginsberg waived Wispelaere's right to an earlier proceeding 
under the speedy trial act. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she needed the additional time to review classified  
documents for a ``substantial inquiry into whether the information 
(Wispalaere is charged with trying to sell) could actually aid a 
foreign country or be harmful to this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Wispelaere was paid $120,000 for nearly one  
thousand secret U.S. defense documents by undercover FBI agents who 
posed as foreign spies, lured him to Virginia and arrested him at 
Dulles International Airport last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere, 28, is an Australian citizen whose last known  
address was in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	On a single count of attempted espionage, he faces a maximum  
penalty of life in prison, or even death if certain conditions, 
like disclosure of nuclear secrets, are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere worked for the Australian military intelligence from  
July 1998 until his abrupt resignation Jan. 13. The U.S. governemnt 
says that six days later he walked into the embassy of a foreign 
country, which the U.S. would not name, in Bangkok, and offered to 
sell classified U.S. documents. That country tipped off U.S. 
officials and FBI agents set up a meeting with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said he sold 713 classified U.S. defense documents,  
including photographs presumably from U.S. satellites, to an 
undercover FBI agent in Bangkok for $70,000. He also mailed more 
than 200 others to a post office box the FBI set up in Virginia for 
an additional $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The secret and top secret documents had been shared with  
Australia under U.S.-Australian defense treaties and the U.S. 
government said their disclosure could cause ``exceptionally great 
damage'' to U.S. national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere was being held without bond.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Unions Likely To See Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- The United Farm Workers and an  
inexperienced rival union face a runoff in their efforts to 
represent pickers and packers at Coastal Berry Co., the nation's 
largest strawberry grower, state labor officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the UFW and the upstart Coastal Berry of California Farm  
Worker Committee predicted victory in the votes now set for 
Thursday in Oxnard and Friday in Watsonville, where Coastal Berry 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board announced the  
runoff Tuesday after counting most of the 60 ballots that were 
contested after last week's election, which failed to give either 
union the necessary majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The ALRB said the Coastal Berry Committee has 670 votes to the  
UFW's 589. But 83 workers voted against any union representation, 
meaning the Coastal Berry Committee would need five of the six 
remaining contested ballots for outright victory. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even the upstart union's representatives don't believe  
the remaining ballots will give them the necessary margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are preparing for a runoff election while we are  
investigating the unresolved ballots,'' said Octavio Galarza, the 
ALRB agent in charge of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coastal Berry Committee's vice president, Sergio Leal,  
predicted that the UFW will fare even worse in the runoff. ``We 
know we will have the votes to win,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Efren Barajas, a UFW spokesman, said their union also believes  
it will win, despite interference by antiunion growers who have 
feared that a victory at Coastal Berry might spread to other berry 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just the Committee, but the entire industry of  
strawberry growers that was doing everything possible to make sure 
we didn't win this,'' Barajas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's president, Ernie Farley, said he simply hopes that  
the organizing would be over soon, without further disrupting the 
strawberry harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The runoff will be the third union vote at Coastal Berry. A  
victory by the same Coastal Berry Committee last year in an 
election boycotted by the UFW was thrown out because some workers 
weren't given a chance to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW targeted Coastal Berry several years ago in hopes of  
building momentum for unions throughout the state's $600 million, 
20,000 worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	At its most powerful in 1970, the UFW had 80,000 members, but  
dwindled to 20,000 by the death of its founder Cesar Chavez. Since 
then, it has grown to 27,000 members.

<HEADLINE> Environment Groups Urge IOC Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Three environmental groups today  
asked for a year's delay in choosing the host city for the 2006 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cities -- Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; and Klagenfurt;  
Austria -- are front-runners for the 2006 Games. The other 
candidates are Helsinki, Finland; Zakopane, Poland; and 
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss, Italian and Austrian branches of the World Wide Fund  
for Nature want environmental issues further examined before a site 
is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund in the  
United States. They contend the Alps aren't suitable for events on 
the scale of the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no longer acceptable that Olympic ideals ... are brought  
to life at the price of the destruction of the environment,'' the 
WWF said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel will reduce the field of six European cities to two  
finalists in South Korea on June 19. On the same day, the full 
assembly will choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC commission is looking into ways of overhauling the IOC's  
structure and the process for selecting host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF says the IOC is mistaken in choosing a host city with  
all the Olympic venues within close range. Instead, it suggests the 
IOC choose a host country or region, minimizing the construction of 
short-term facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said the IOC shouldn't wait until the 2010 Games to  
address environmental issues. The WWF wants to delay the choice of 
a site for 2006 by a year or two, allowing the candidates a year to 
produce revised bids.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Hire DeBerg as QB Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Steve DeBerg is no longer a 45-year-old  
backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He's now a 45-year-old quarterbacks coach, hired Tuesday by the  
Atlanta Falcons, for whom he finished his career last season. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg was the oldest player in the NFL when he returned last  
year after five years of retirement to back up Chris Chandler. He 
played in nine games and completed 30-of-59 passes with three 
touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
	When he started against the New York Jets, DeBerg became the  
oldest player in NFL history to start a game. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the off-season, the Falcons signed Danny Kanell, 19 years  
younger, after he was cut by the New York Giants. So coach Dan 
Reeves reassigned DeBerg to the coaching job he held for two 
seasons under Reeves with the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBerg, whose career began in 1978, was known during his career  
for preceding the likes of Joe Montana (in San Francisco) John 
Elway (in Denver) and Vinny Testaverde (in Tampa Bay). He played on 
six different teams and finishes his 17-year career ranked 13th on 
the all-time passing yards list with 34,241 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He replaces Jack Burns as the Falcons' quarterbacks coach. Burns  
now will oversee the passing game and call plays for the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a great move for us,'' Reeves said. ``I am  
glad that he decided to make coaching his profession. I think that 
he has a bright future as a coach.''

<HEADLINE> Another Fen-Phen Trial Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The family of a woman who died after taking the  
diet drug combination fen-phen is determined to get a verdict in a 
trial involving the drug's maker, an attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not interested in talking settlement,'' said Tommy  
Fibich, one of two lawyers for the family of Mary Marisa Smith, a 
34-year-old mother of two who died while trying to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit by Ms. Smith's family is believed to be the first  
relating to the death of a fen-phen user to reach trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit asserts that American Home Products Corp.  
underreported the instances of pulmonary hypertension as a result 
of using fenfluramine, the ``fen'' part of the drug combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The company in the past has contended that evidence linking the  
drug to the disease is inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fibich said Ms. Smith died of infection in late 1997 while  
waiting for a heart-lung transplant. She spent her final days 
hooked to a catheter delivering drugs directly to her lungs to keep 
blood vessels flowing, Fibich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments took place Tuesday, with testimony to begin  
Wednesday. Fibich estimated the trial will take about three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products settled another Texas case halfway into a  
trial earlier this year. The plaintiff, Sandra Moore of Johnson 
County, claimed that fenfluramine caused her heart valve damage. 
The defense had yet to begin presenting its case. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Texas woman took American Home Products to court last  
month in Canton, but the trial was delayed because lawyers said 
they could not seat an impartial jury. Debbie Stone Lovett also 
alleged fenfluramine caused heart valve damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pulled  
fenfluramine from the market, citing evidence it may have 
irreversibly -- and sometimes fatally -- scarred users' heart valves. 
An estimated 6.6 million people have used the diet drug 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated  
with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are  
pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products is the nation's  
seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. Through Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, the company marketed Pondimin, (the brand name for 
fenfluramine) and Redux, a similar product.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index surging in Tokyo on a report that the Japanese 
government may suspend a national sales tax to boost the country's 
faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
296.85 points, or 1.84 percent, ending the day at 16,408.50. On 
Monday, the average closed up 138.97 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares rose on a report by the Nikkan Toshi Shimbun, or Japan  
Investment Journal, that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government 
may decide in June to suspend the 5 percent national sales tax as 
part of a new economic stimulus measure. The newspaper, which did 
not identify sources, said the announcement may come on June 16 
before the Group of Seven summit in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's denial of the report did not halt the rapid  
rise, while the report pushed hedge funds into the market, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also supported by Japanese jobless data and  
expectations that New York stocks might advance later Tuesday, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the government said Japan's April unemployment  
rate stayed at the record high 4.8 percent, although a higher rate 
had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.11 yen in late  
afternoon trading, down 0.25 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher, boosted by a late rally  
in reaction to a surge on the Tokyo bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 216.44 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at 
12,363.56. On Monday, the index gained 87.87 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices were little changed at midday in  
absence of any market-moving news before surging in the afternoon 
following the rally on the Tokyo exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways, which has canceled  
a large number of flights because of a pay dispute with its pilots, 
managed to climb back partially from a big drop on Monday. Cathay 
shares rose 2.35 percent to close at 10.90 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
$1.39) after plunging almost 10 percent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares closed sharply higher, with the key index  
rising 2.2 percent, as investors went on a bargain-hunting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index,  
which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 16.33 points to close at 
759.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed generally mixed, but the key index  
rose for a sixth consecutive session on buying by foreign 
investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 17.70 points, 
or 2.4 percent, to 753.72. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher in line with rises at  
key Asian bourses. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index rose 
8.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 461.79. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on a technical rebound. The  
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 81.05 points, or 1.10 
percent, to 7,397.62. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 36.82 points, or 1.8 percent, 
to 2,098.22. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mostly higher, led by property  
stocks that surged on the steady softening of interest rates. The 
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 20.49 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,440.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All  
Ordinaries Index rose 15.4 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,915.6. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed mixed as a rally in retail stocks ran  
out of steam in afternoon trading. The Straits Times Index rose 
5.02 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,908.88. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed marginally lower. The  
Composite Index fell 1.985 points, or 0.3 percent, to 583.257.

<HEADLINE> US Airlines Raising Domestic Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summertime air fares are heating up, with four large carriers  
raising their standard domestic leisure rates by 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines Inc., which moved first to raise fares  
Friday, was joined Monday afternoon by American Airlines Inc., 
Northwest Airlines Corp. and U.S. Airways Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental spokesman Ned Walker said the carrier's price  
increase reflected strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to carry record loads in many of our markets,'' he  
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel expert Tom Parsons predicted that Delta Air Lines Inc.  
and United Airlines Inc. would announce a 4 percent increase ``by 
the time travel agents open their doors'' today, followed by 
America West Airlines Inc. and Trans World Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said today, ``We have taken no  
action.'' She declined comment on whether Delta will match the fare 
hikes later. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for American and United did not immediately  
return calls today from The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	If airlines hold the line on the new fare increase, it would be  
the third this year for a total increase of 11 percent on domestic 
leisure fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling for pleasure typically buy the leisure-fare  
tickets, which come with restrictions such as advance purchase 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, said business fares have risen  
3 percent so far this year and other increases could be planned.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Denies Ordering Key Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- On trial for his life, Kurdish  
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan rejected blame Tuesday for the 1993 
slaughter of dozens of unarmed soldiers, an attack that shattered a 
rebel cease-fire and led to a massive military crackdown on 
Turkey's Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan also denied that his group had a hand in the 1986 slaying  
of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme and rejected accusations that 
he ordered attacks on Turkish tourist sites in which several 
foreigners were killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, however, accepted overall responsibility for the 15-year  
war waged by his Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The conflict has 
killed 37,000 people, mostly Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am the person with the highest responsibility for the deeds  
and actions of the organization,'' he told the court on the second 
day of his trial. He spoke through a microphone in a bulletproof, 
bombproof cage on the prison island of Imrali, where he is the only 
inmate. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions by Judge Turgut Okyay, Ocalan said his  
militants have received training in camps in Greece and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's testimony appeared designed to distance himself from  
the most brutal attacks attributed to his fighters. The Kurdish 
guerrilla leader faces death if convicted of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	There is widespread support in Turkey for executing Ocalan, who  
is considered by most Turks to be personally responsible for the 
suffering caused by the war. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ocalan repeated his apology -- first made Monday -- for the  
deaths of Turkish soldiers, relatives of the war dead silently 
raised pictures of their loved ones Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You took 25,000 lives from me!'' Ocalan shot back.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, about a dozen of the relatives addressed the  
court, calling for Ocalan's execution. The mother of one slain 
soldier fainted after she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the head of this snake to be crushed as soon as  
possible,'' said Metin Karabiyik, the father of a slain soldier, 
pointing at Ocalan. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan told the court that the 1993 slaying of 33 unarmed  
soldiers in the southeastern province of Bingol was carried out by 
a regional PKK commander. 
</P>
<P>
	The slaughter ended the rebel's unilateral cease-fire and led  
the military to intensify a campaign aimed at annihilating the 
guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that campaign, soldiers have burned thousands of  
Kurdish villages, leaving large sections of the southeast 
abandoned, a tactic aimed at denying the rebels local support. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not possible to condone the death of these soldiers,''  
Ocalan said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added there were struggles within the PKK and that dozens of  
former guerrillas had been executed for deviating from the 
organization's line. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that allegations that he was behind the  
assassination of Palme were circulated by dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been attempts to put the blame for several murders  
in Europe, including the murder of Olof Palme, on me,'' Ocalan 
said. ``The senior members of the organization who have said that 
orders for those actions were given by me, are those who are 
opposed to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ocalan -- who ruled his group with an iron hand --  
appeared conciliatory, ordering his fighters to lay down their arms 
but threatening Turkey with more bloodshed if he is hanged for 
treason. It was Ocalan's first direct call for an end to the 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	He also offered to transform his group into a political  
organization, a move certain to be rejected by Turkey, which 
regards any hints of Kurdish nationalism as a direct threat to the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish newspapers expressed outrage at Ocalan's offer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Traitor and coward,'' the daily Aksam said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Hours after his apology Monday, rebels attacked a police outpost  
in the southeastern province of Van, killing one soldier and 
wounding three others, the Anatolia news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is taking place before a State Security Court. Such  
courts have been called biased by human rights organizations, since 
the three-member panel includes a military judge.

<HEADLINE> Tax Changes Slow IRS Transformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans increasingly perplexed by the  
country's complex tax laws may find little relief in sight: one out 
of every five bills introduced in Congress this year would tinker 
with the tax code, and President Clinton himself is proposing 131 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the Internal Revenue Service is starting to feel the strain  
of 6,493 tax law changes since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	The worry is that more tinkering could divert precious resources  
and slow the IRS' transformation into a more taxpayer-friendly 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``You add all these things up and the IRS can't handle it,''  
said Rep. Amo Houghton, R-N.Y., chairman of the House Ways and 
Means subcommittee that oversees that oversees the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Val Oveson, the IRS national taxpayer advocate, said rapid-fire  
changes make it difficult to interpret laws, draft forms, program 
already-overloaded computers and train employees. As a result, 
taxpayers have a harder time understanding the rules and getting 
the right answers from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Failing to understand the law results in frustration at both  
ends,'' Oveson told a congressional committee recently. ``Don't 
change the tax laws so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there is little sign that Congress and the White House are  
listening. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, for example, proposed 28 new specific tax cuts in his  
budget for fiscal 2000, including credits for care of disabled 
elderly and the newborn, and 73 ways to raise revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from both parties have dozens of bills providing tax  
relief for almost every imaginable constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS says about 20 percent of all bills introduced so far  
this year in the Republican-controlled would have some impact on 
the tax code. That compares with about 15 percent in 1993-94, the 
last time Democrats controlled the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Republican Sens. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Susan  
Collins of Maine introduced a proposal allowing teachers to deduct 
up to $250 a year for their out-of-pocket classroom expenses, such 
as supplies and instructional aids. 
</P>
<P>
	For Coverdell, the bill has a key political purpose: Teacher  
unions oppose separate legislation he proposed to allow tax-free 
IRA-like accounts to pay private school costs, but many average 
teachers like the $250 deduction idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we are confronted with the tax code we have, I will  
be among those trying to find ways to relieve pressure on the 
working people of this country,'' Coverdell said. ``We just have to 
live with the fact that we have a very complicated tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because these tax changes often are targeted for political  
reasons at the middle class, they frequently are phased out for 
higher-income taxpayers. That means the IRS must produce a way for 
taxpayers to figure out if the break applies to them, and then 
taxpayers have to do the calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do our best to try to take the law and simplify it,'' said  
Sheldon Schwartz, IRS national director of forms and publications. 
``But there is a lot of underlying complexity that is very 
difficult to get around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Clinton administration's proposed $1,000 credit  
for elderly care would be phased out by $50 for each $1,000 (or 
fraction thereof) that a taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds 
$110,000 for married people filing jointly, $75,000 for singles and 
$55,000 for married people filing separately. 
</P>
<P>
	Got it?  
</P>
<P>
	David Lifson, chairman of the tax executive committee of the  
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, noted a recent 
Associated Press poll showing 66 percent of taxpayers believe taxes 
are too complex and 56 percent pay someone to do their returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``When over half our individual taxpayers have so little  
comprehension of, or faith in, their tax system ... something is 
not right,'' he said. ``The end result is erosion of voluntary 
compliance. It is only human to disobey a law if you do not or 
cannot understand the rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in Congress are trying to simplify things.  
</P>
<P>
	Houghton has introduced a comprehensive bill eliminating some  
confusing tax provisions. He would exempt many taxpayers from 
having to fill out capital gains forms or falling into the dreaded 
alternative minimum tax, which is intended to ensure higher-income 
people do not completely escape income taxes through credits or 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., has a bill that would reduce income  
phase-outs for some of the tax credits, shorten the capital gains 
forms and repeal AMT for individuals. Neal says that would 
eliminate 200 lines from the tax forms. 
</P>
<P>
	But given the costs of such efforts and popularity of targeted  
tax relief, sponsors face an uphill climb. 
</P>
<P>
	``History says things will not get better,'' Houghton  
acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Karpov To Sue Over Chess Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The World Chess Championships -- delayed last  
year in a move to placate defending champion Anatoly Karpov -- will 
be held in Las Vegas next month, but Karpov's agent said Tuesday he 
would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiloh Quinn of Montreal, who represents Karpov, said the  
Russian champion would file a lawsuit to try and block the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's already scheduled to do things,'' Quinn said. ``They were  
supposed to consult with him and they didn't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov won the world title in January 1998 and was to have held  
it for two years. But the 150-country World Chess Federation, known 
by its French acronym, FIDE, decided the championship should take 
place annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov objected to that and to new rules that called for him to  
compete from the start of the tournament. In the past, the 100 top 
chess players from around the world competed against each other, 
with the lone survivor playing the reigning champion for the world 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to hold the tournament in Las Vegas late last year were  
scrubbed, in part because Karpov said he would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month's tournament is scheduled to be held at Caesars  
Palace, with 100 of the world's top players beginning competition 
July 30. Final play is set for Aug. 22-28.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks closed higher Tuesday as  
investors put their money into companies whose fortunes rise along 
with a growing economy. But worries that the economy is expanding 
too rapidly held the overall market lower for much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.52 to close at  
10,596.26 after being off as much as 150 points earlier in the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators closed lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
fell 7.58 to 1,294.26, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 58.49 to 
2,412.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about inflation, which have increased the market's  
volatility over the past two weeks, were behind Tuesday's declines 
as well. Stock prices dropped after the National Association of 
Purchasing Management said the nation's industrial economy expanded 
for a fourth straight month in May. The report, which gauges the 
health of the nation's factories, was much stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's report is widely followed because it usually provides  
the first indication of how the economy performed in the just-ended 
month. The May report was highly anticipated as traders sought a 
sign that the economy is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the report, which revealed strong price rises in raw  
materials for the first time in 16 months, sent stocks skidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the skittishness about inflation, the real surprise  
from this report is that we didn't drop even farther, even 
faster,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders are increasingly worried that rising inflation  
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, leading to 
higher corporate borrowing costs and lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But by midafternoon, investors began picking up cyclical stocks  
that thrive on a growing economy. Aluminum company Alcoa gained 4 7/8 
to 59 7/8, the strongest of the Dow components. Georgia Pacific, up 8 
7/16 to 94 7/8, led a number of pulp and paper companies higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks got a lift from the latest industry fare  
increase, the third of 1999. AMR., the parent company of American 
Airlines, rose 2 3/16 to close at 67 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts suggested that the afternoon rally may also have been  
fed by computer program-generated trades. Ricky Harrington, 
technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said 
index fund managers may have been responsible for some buying tied 
to the start of a new month. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks were mostly lower, including Dow component  
IBM, down 4 to 112. Hewlett-Packard fell 4 3/16 to 90 1/8 after an 
analyst at Bank of America Securities downgraded its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Telebanc Financial Corporation shot up 8 to 74 1/2 after online  
brokerage ETrade said it will acquire Telebanc to create an 
Internet-based financial services company. ETrade fell 5 3/16 to 39 
5/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, down 8 3/4 to 75 1/4, led a number of brokerage stocks  
lower after it announced plans to offer low-fee Internet stock 
trading. Conventional brokerages are facing competitive pressure 
from the growing number of online brokerages, and also fear losing 
their hefty commissions from full-fee services. 
</P>
<P>
	``The online business injects a measure of uncertainty to the  
brokerages,'' Meehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market offered little support for stocks. After the  
release of the purchasing managers' report, the 30-year Treasury 
bond plunged, sending its yield up to 5.94 percent from late 
Friday's 5.83 percent. The yield is now at its highest level in 
more than a year, presenting an attractive alternative to stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Another report Tuesday suggested some softening in the economy,  
but the news wasn't enough to offset the effects of the purchasing 
managers' survey. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.1 
percent in April, its first decline since June 1998, according to 
the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street is now looking ahead to a Wednesday speech by  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Friday's Labor 
Department report on unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those factors will cause concern all week,'' Harrington said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday, declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE consolidated volume 
totaled 824.34 million shares, compared with 782.8 million the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.98 to 621.28, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.63 to 776.11. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.22 to 437.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.84 percent.  
European indexes were mixed, as Germany's DAX index fell 1.1 
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 
ended 0.9 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger Calls for IOC Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Henry Kissinger urged the IOC today  
to be more open and accountable as it tries to recover from the 
worst crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. secretary of state addressed the opening session  
of a task force assigned with recommending reforms of the 
International Olympic Committee following the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There does seem to be a concern with transparency and  
accountability,'' he said, citing the worries of politicians and 
sponsors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger said the IOC's problems resulted from the massive  
growth of the Olympics the past two decades and asked the 
105-year-old organization to ``adjust to new realities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the IOC widen its membership to include outside  
groups on a rotating basis. He said the committee's meetings should 
be open ``as far as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger is one of 36 outside members on the 80-member IOC 2000  
commission, which was formed in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform panel is meeting today and Wednesday to begin  
examining ways of overhauling the IOC's structure and the process 
for selecting Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the commission is expected to consider  
changes to the way IOC members are selected, including introducing 
term limits and reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest words came from Norwegian speed skater Johan Olav  
Koss, winner of three gold medals at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. He 
challenged the IOC to clean up its act and give a bigger voice to 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the IOC determined to remain a private club or open to  
transparency and accountability?'' Koss said. ``If not, the IOC 
will remain the same, which will ensure further corruption and 
abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we can change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the democratically elected IOC athletes'  
commission, Koss proposed that 10 more members be elected to the 
panel and that all 20 athletes be appointed to the IOC itself. He 
suggested that two athletes serve on the decision-making IOC 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
said abuses in the Olympic bidding process extended far beyond Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City is in my opinion is probably one of the most  
innocent bid cities in recent times,'' he said. ``You know that and 
I know that. The culture that caused the problems started in 1956 
and can be easily be disposed of by this body and current 
leadership of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth asked the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
	``Bigger is not better,'' he said. ``If the games get any  
bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must 
be restraint of growth or the games will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth said the IOC should ensure that money flows to those  
who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the Olympic movement is at the top of the  
mountain of sport,'' he said. ``At the next level are sponsors and 
officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Allaire, chairman and CEO of Xerox, one of the IOC's major  
international sponsors, said, ``We expect the IOC to make dramatic 
and specific changes. Openness and transparency is a good starting 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol, whose network has a $3.5 billion  
deal for American television rights to the games of 2000-2008, 
defended the IOC against a ``perception that much is wrong with the 
movement and the movement is reluctant to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said there are people in the United States ``who don't  
want to listen'' to the steps the IOC has taken in the wake of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian track and field leader Primo Nebiolo pressed for a  
greater role for the sports federations, saying the leaders of all 
35 summer and winter bodies should be on the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just here to push for power or ask for a bigger  
piece of the pie,'' he said. ``We believe we should be equal 
partners in this movement and hope to be treated as such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 42 speakers warned against taking any radical  
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not feel obliged to revolutionize the whole system as  
some critics inspired by commercial and political interests have 
requested,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. ``The Olympic 
world doesn't need revolution but evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers included former U.N. Secretary General Boutros  
Boutros Ghali of Egypt and Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are to be 
approved at a special IOC session in December.

<HEADLINE>  Supplies Brought to Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Working like orbital bellhops, space  
shuttle Discovery's astronauts carried bag after bag of supplies 
into the new international space station Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must have worn a path in the dirt with all the trips you  
made back and forth,'' Mission Control told the crew. ``Hopefully, 
that path doesn't become a rut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night, the seven astronauts had hauled over about  
three-quarters of the 3,600 pounds of space station gear they took 
up, including computers, spare parts, trash bags and containers of 
water. They have until Thursday, when the hatches are closed and 
the shuttle undocks, to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts are getting the space station ready for its first  
permanent occupants, who are scheduled to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	With 60 percent humidity and a high of 78, the space station was  
a bit sticky for a while. The humidity shot up during repairs to 
lessen the noise inside Zarya, the Russian half of the space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	After installing foam mufflers over clattering fans, outlets and  
ducts, Discovery's astronauts noticed that the air flow was 
hampered in one spot. They took off the sound-insulating material 
from that section of the duct, and the flow immediately improved. 
The material will be left off. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had expected the humidity to rise a little anyway: A fan  
used to exchange air between the shuttle and station was turned off 
for 1 1/2 hours during the muffler installation, plus astronauts were 
toiling inside. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the noise problem, the mufflers seem to have helped,  
though officials don't yet know by how much. The concern is not for 
the visiting astronauts but rather for the permanent occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Russians launched Zarya last November, the module did  
not meet NASA's acoustic standards. The noise level inside was 
equivalent to a busy highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The American-made side of the space station, Unity, has always  
been well within NASA's limits. It was launched in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's Canadian astronaut, Julie Payette, took time out  
Tuesday night to chat with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and 
schoolchildren gathered at the National Museum of Science and 
Technology in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters wanted to know whether she was keeping up with  
the hockey playoffs and other Canadian news. The answer was no. 
They also wanted to know ``how do we get there,'' there being 
space. Her answer -- go to school, study hard, get a science degree 
-- got mixed reviews.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Content With Accomplishments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Steve Thomas will not be joining his Toronto  
Maple Leafs teammates on the golf course anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The separated right shoulder and cracked collarbone he played  
with during the NHL's Eastern Conference final will have to heal 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about this out of any kind of bravado,''  
Thomas said as the 1998-99 Leafs gathered in their Air Canada 
Centre dressing room one last time Tuesday. ``I didn't know if, at 
this stage of my career, I would be in this position again. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I wanted to play. I wanted to push myself as far as I could  
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was injured May 17, the night Toronto eliminated  
Pittsburgh, and kept it a secret while taking injections for five 
games against the Buffalo Sabres. He was bodychecked by Vaclav 
Varada on the damaged shoulder late in the first period of the 
Sabres' 4-2 series clincher Monday night, but after gathering his 
senses, and being stitched across the right eyebrow to close a cut, 
he finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be golfing for a while, that's for sure, Thomas  
said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While disappointed their season was over, the players were  
content with their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through what we went through, the intensity of these  
playoffs, is something we'll take and put in the bank,'' Thomas 
said. ``This was a learning experience that will help us get to the 
next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Mats Sundin spoke of the morning after.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an emptiness,'' he said. ``You work so hard, and now all  
you feel is that the energy has been sucked out of you. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's been by far the most exciting hockey season for  
myself. There was a great chemistry in the room, a feeling that we 
could win every night. We had a great run in the playoffs. We fell 
short in the end but we gained a lot of experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the playoffs two years in a row, the Leafs  
finished fourth in the East with 97 points -- two off the club 
record -- and won a club-record 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
	They led the NHL in goals with 268. Six Leafs scored at least 20  
as they went from a boring defensive club to a fast-skating, 
exciting team in head coach Pat Quinn's first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring Quinn and signing goaltender Curtis Joseph were keys to  
the 28-point improvement. Associate general manager Mike Smith made 
good trades, including the one that landed Bryan Berard for 
disgruntled Felix Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's contract expires, and if the ``associate'' is not  
removed from his title by GM-president Ken Dryden, Smith is 
expected to quit and search out a GM's job with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's status, and the expansion and entry drafts later this  
month provide Dryden with a heavy workload to begin the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Valk is set to become an unrestricted free agent and Quinn  
wants him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich is in line for a new contract, and  
said Tuesday he expects to re-sign without a hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a holdout,'' Yushkevich said. ``I want to  
be with the team at the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be part of this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Quinn was encouraged by the development of his younger players,  
especially defensemen Berard, Tomas Kaberle and Daniil Markov, and 
he pinpointed the change he wants added: toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play better in the pits, in the one-on-one battles  
on the boards, in front of the net,'' he said. ``It's going to be a 
challenge because there will be expectations now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most pressing on-ice personnel needs are a left-winger for  
Sundin and Thomas, and a defenseman with a booming shot to 
quarterback an impotent power play. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, is a day of rest and reflection.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were on a journey from the start of the season,'' said  
veteran forward Tie Domi. ``Pat hit the nail on the head right from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Let's not just aim to make the playoffs. Let's try  
to do something here this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're another player or two away but, hopefully, next  
year we can be where Buffalo is this year, go all the way. The city 
is starving for it.''

</P>
<P>
	STANWOOD, Wash. (AP) -- Kenneth Dodson, who wrote popular books  
about his experiences in World War II, died May 24 after a long 
battle with congenital heart disease, Parkinson's disease and 
malaria. Dodson was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodson then spent 20 years in the merchant marine before  
enlisting in the Navy shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor in 
1941. He saw action in nine major battles, including Okinawa and 
the invasion of Makin in the Gilbert Islands as part of the capture 
of Tarawa in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
	He was discharged in 1946 after his vocal cords were severely  
damaged when a machine gun mount tore loose during a training 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	After poet Carl Sandburg urged him to write about his wartime  
experiences, Dodson took writing classes at the University of 
Washington. With the success of his first effort, ``Away All 
Boats,'' published in 1954, Dodson and his family appeared on radio 
and television shows around the country . 
</P>
<P>
	The book was the basis of a film by Universal Studios. Hi other  
books include ``Stranger to the Shore,'' ``China Pirates'' and 
``Hector the Stowaway Dog,'' later made into a Walt Disney film. 
</P>
<P>
	His last book, ``The Poet and the Sailor,'' was completed  
shortly before his death.

</P>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Harold Grumhaus, a longtime Chicago Tribune  
and Tribune Co. executive, died Saturday at age 96. 
</P>
<P>
	During his nearly four decades with the Tribune, Grumhaus held  
almost every top executive position with the company, including 
chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in production, he joined the Tribune in 1934 and soon  
became a trusted aide to legendary editor and publisher Col. Robert 
R. McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
	After McCormick's death, Grumhaus moved up through the ranks of  
the company and spearheaded the restructuring of corporate 
relationships that set the stage for the company to go public in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	Grumhaus retired in 1976 as a director of Tribune Co. and  
chairman of its executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, a son, a sister, eight grandchildren  
and 12 great-grandchildren.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Richard Hunter Hemp, an editor at the San  
Francisco Chronicle for nearly four decades, died Monday of 
complications from cancer. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp rose from copy boy to reporter, eventually becoming one of  
the staff's most respected editors. 
</P>
<P>
	For 19 years, Hemp served as night city editor, and was  
assignment editor from 1969 to 1988. Hemp later worked on the 
editorial page and retired on Nov. 5, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II in the Marine Corps, Hemp served in Puerto  
Rico, the Virgin Islands and Okinawa, and he did postwar duty in 
Tientsin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemp is survived by his wife, a brother and several nieces and  
nephews.

	BOURNEMOUTH, England (AP) -- Submarine commander Rupert Lonsdale,  
the only British naval captain to surrender his warship during 
World War II, died April 25. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale later became a minister in the Church of England and  
finally Canon Emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale was the captain of the mine-laying submarine Seal,  
which was surrendered to the Germans in the Kattegat, the channel 
between Denmark and Sweden, on May 5, 1940. Lonsdale and his crew 
became prisoners-of-war. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonsdale was court-martialed when he returned to England at the  
end of the war in 1945, charged with failing to take immediate 
action to engage enemy aircraft and failing to ensure that the Seal 
was sunk. He testified that he deeply regretted the surrender, 
``but at the time it seemed the only thing to do.'' He was 
acquitted with honor.

	The Austrian-born Ringel worked for the U.S. Army's intelligence  
unit during World War II before becoming a judge and serving in 
various courts in New York for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1969, he was in a three-judge panel that ruled ``Blue Movie''  
obscene. The judges said the film's graphic sex was portrayed 
``with no redeeming social value.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Violence, Kids Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, brandishing a cartoonish  
magazine ad for a video game ``more fun than shooting your 
neighbor's cat,'' ordered a government investigation Tuesday into 
whether -- and how -- the entertainment business markets violence to 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of  
violence,'' Clinton said, that amounts to the typical child 
witnessing 40,000 play murders and 200,000 dramatized acts of 
violence by his 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a barrage blurs the line between ``fantasy and reality  
violence'' for too many young people, the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know this stuff sells,'' Clinton exhorted Hollywood from a  
lectern in the Rose Garden. ``But the time has come to show some 
restraint, even if it has a short-term impact on the bottom line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million, 18-month review by the Justice Department and  
Federal Trade Commission is the latest initiative from a president 
grasping for solutions to an increasingly deadly spate of shootings 
in the nation's schools. Having already introduced new gun 
controls, Clinton trained on the entertainment industry's business 
practices the same microscope he focused on cigarette companies, 
and their juvenile-aimed Joe Camel ads, when he cracked down on 
teen smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said federal investigators will ``study the extent to  
which the video game, music and movie markets do actually market 
violence to children'' and whether those industries only laxly 
restrict sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said his staff will, as in probes  
of the tobacco and alcohol industries, look into the entertainment 
companies' internal marketing records even if it takes subpoenas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope we could talk to these companies and get  
voluntary compliance. But certainly if we feel that we can't 
complete our responsibility here, we're going to turn to compulsory 
processes,'' Pitofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital  
Software Association, promised cooperation with a ``fair-minded 
review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the dais with Pitofsky, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and  
Attorney General Janet Reno, Clinton held up several colorful 
video-game ads that he considered offensive. 
</P>
<P>
	One, for the game ``N2O Nitrous Oxide,'' showed a souped-up  
handgun and promised: ``More fun than shooting your neighbor's 
cat.'' Another, for a PlayStation package called ``Guilty Gear,'' 
pictured comic-book-type warriors lobbing fireballs. ``Kill your 
friends guilt-free,'' it beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at some of these ads, it's hard to argue with a  
straight face that the games were made for adults in the first 
place,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisements have a particular role here. They have the  
power to egg children on and lure them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By ordering the study himself and paying for it with existing  
funds, Clinton pre-empted a Senate-passed measure introduced by 
Kansas Republican Sam Brownback. Senate Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, released a statement welcoming 
Clinton and his ``newfound interest'' to the Republican fold. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's Rose Garden announcement came three weeks after  
he and Mrs. Clinton convened a meeting of movie-industry lobbyist 
Jack Valenti and five dozen of the nation's leading educators, 
officials, entertainers and gun makers to brainstorm a national 
campaign against youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Valenti's spokesman, Rich Taylor, said the Motion  
Picture Association of America had no comment on the impending FTC 
study. A separate entertainment industry source, however, suggested 
Clinton was alienating Hollywood just as it was trying to help his 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The WB network recently shelved two violent episodes of ``Buffy,  
the Vampire Slayer,'' and CBS yanked a bloody new drama series 
about the mob from its fall lineup after April's high school 
massacre in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Lowenstein, whose trade association represents video game  
developers: ``The nation should not lose sight of the fact that 
parents -- not kids -- buy most games. And therefore, keeping games 
not appropriate for children out of their hands starts and ends at 
home.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Maps Didn't Always Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Watching the daily weather map chart a  
hurricane edging toward the coast or hot, humid air spreading north 
or a blizzard crossing the Great Lakes, almost anyone can become an 
amateur forecaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy to understand, the weather map on television or in the  
daily paper has become a comfortable part of daily life, taken for 
granted by millions. 
</P>
<P>
	But like many modern conveniences, it hasn't always been there --  
indeed it wasn't always obvious that mapping weather information 
would serve any useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
	Once someone tried it, the value quickly became obvious. And  
that usefulness has increased as technological improvements enabled 
more data to be collected and delivered quickly to a central 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The first weather maps -- published 180 years ago -- brought new  
understanding to the science, but weren't much help at forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Those first maps were compiled by Heinrich Wilhelm Brandes, a  
physics professor at Prussia's University of Breslau. Today, 
Breslau is in Poland and known as Wroclaw. 
</P>
<P>
	After three years' work, he published 365 daily weather maps in  
1819, covering Europe's weather for the year 1783. 
</P>
<P>
	That ``hindcast'' gave scientists new knowledge, revealing  
closed circles of low pressure that form storms and showing that 
the winds around these systems all seek to flow inward, Mark 
Monmonier reports in his new book, ``Air Apparent: How 
Meteorologists Learned to Map, Predict and Dramatize the Weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had collected weather reports for centuries, but ``it  
wasn't until about 1816 that people realized that you can take 
weather data and map them,'' said Monmonier, a cartographer at 
Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was amazed by the fact that they had this organization in  
Germany, which had a very rich data base, which they did not map 
because they had no clue that there was any relationship between 
space and (air) pressure and wind,'' he said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	But to make those maps a regular thing took a disaster --  
specifically a storm on Nov. 14, 1854, that sank several French and 
British ships during the Crimean War. After that, weathermen were 
able to reconstruct the conditions on maps and realized that it 
could have been predicted easily and warnings sent. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was the issuance of a daily weather bulletin from  
Paris starting Jan. 1, 1858. Britain began its daily forecasts 
Sept. 3, 1860, with its first storm warning going out Sept. 1, 
1861. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, scientists criticized the weather maps compiled from  
reports sent by telegraph, saying they lacked sound theoretical 
background. That pressure led to the suicide of Adm. Robert 
FitzRoy, head of the British meteorological office. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict between pure scientists and practical  
meteorologists continued for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Monmonier quotes George Bliss, a U.S. Weather Bureau forecaster,  
who in 1917 described his job as requiring ``a special facility for 
intuitively and quickly weighing the forces indicated on the 
weather map ... rather than by profound study of atmospheric 
physics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detailed atmospheric physics is a bigger part of today's  
forecasts, thanks to the guidance provided by massive computers 
running complex programs that analyze and predict what the weather 
will do. 
</P>
<P>
	Weather maps today are often produced in sharp, colorful images  
by private weather services, but they are still based on National 
Weather Service data.

<HEADLINE> `Phantom' Strong at Box Office / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Notting Hill'' with Julia Roberts and Hugh  
Grant opened with a strong $27.7 million against the powerhouse 
``The Phantom Menace,'' which had a huge Memorial Day weekend that 
put it over the $200 million mark in a record 13 days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Phantom Menace'' grossed $66.9 million over the four-day  
weekend to lead the North American box office and bring its 
two-week total to $207.1 million. It took previous record holder 
``Independence Day'' 21 days to reach the $200 million milestone in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	While second-place ``Notting Hill'' enjoyed big business as a  
romantic alternative, two other films withered under the force of 
the Force: ``The Thirteenth Floor'' opened with a disappointing 
$4.3 million in fifth, and ``The Love Letter'' dropped 59 percent 
to collect just $1.4 million in its second week for 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mummy'' continued to do well, however, with $12.9 million  
for third place. ``Entrapment'' was fourth with $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In art houses, ``Tea With Mussolini'' remained a big draw, with  
another $1.2 million in its third week.

<HEADLINE> Jamaica Raises Taxes on Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- An increase in Jamaica's tax on  
departing visitors took effect Tuesday, sparking criticism from 
hoteliers who said it undermines efforts to strengthen the island's 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	The fee rose from $21 to $28 per person. Cruise ship passengers  
are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jamaica Hotel and Tourism Association called the fee ``an  
exorbitant sum'' at a time when the country is trying to repair its 
image as a tropical paradise following widespread riots in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to understand why Jamaica would wish to  
increase the tax at this time,'' the association said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The increase is a setback at a time when Jamaica is trying to  
build the family market,'' the organization said, noting an average 
family of four would have to pay more than $110 upon leaving the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel agents have complained they will have to absorb the  
increase on pre-booked tours. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax is part of a package of revenue-raising measures  
announced April 15 by Finance Minister Omar Davies. Another tax 
increase, one on gasoline, touched off a week of riots. 
</P>
<P>
	The unrest subsided after the government rolled back part of the  
gasoline tax and replaced it with a 15 percent levy on traded 
securities. On Tuesday, banks retaliated by raising mortgage rates 
10 percent.

<HEADLINE> NBC Sports Chief Assails Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The head of the Olympics' biggest  
revenue source accused a major sponsor of damaging fund raising for 
American athletes through ``cynical ... self-serving'' attacks on 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol described David D'Alessandro,  
the president of John Hancock insurance and the most vocal 
corporate critic in the Salt Lake City scandal, as a ``bully'' 
motivated by a thirst for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's motivated by his own desire to be on a soapbox,''  
Ebersol said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, D'Alessandro said Hancock was  
dedicated to helping athletes directly and will continue to support 
Olympic organizers in Sydney and Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we are saying is, until we see what the reforms are, don't  
support the IOC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said he had not spoken with Ebersol during the  
scandal. He called the NBC chief's statements a ``desperate and sad 
commentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Dick Ebersol and had hitched my career to the  
Olympics, I'd be pretty scared, too,'' D'Alessandro said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has a $3.5 billion deal with the IOC for the U.S. television  
rights to five Olympics between 2000 and 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock pays more than $40 million for a berth in the  
International Olympic Committee's highest-level sponsorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, D'Alessandro pulled out of negotiations with  
NBC for $20 million in ads during Olympic telecasts to protest the 
IOC's handling of the Salt Lake crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also has removed the Olympic rings from the  
company's annual report, billboards and stationery. He has accused 
the IOC of failing to take decisive action or commit to true 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has probably, more than anyone else, deeply harmed fund  
raising efforts for American athletes,'' Ebersol said in an 
interview. ``The IOC has raised all the money they are going to 
raise in the United States and NBC is doing fine with our 
advertising efforts. The only ones being hurt are American athletes 
and Salt Lake organizers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said many other U.S. companies are ready to step in as a  
replacement for Hancock in the financial services sponsorship 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was me, I'd give back the money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol also said NBC is not interested in signing any  
advertising deal with D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need him,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC has already sold ad time to another American  
insurance company, which he declined to identify, and expects to 
sign deals with three others before the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol is a member of IOC 2000, a reform commission that met  
for the first time Tuesday to begin studying ways of restructuring 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said D'Alessandro had refused to acknowledge that the  
IOC had taken significant steps to clean up the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he thought through his actions,'' Ebersol said.  
``He's been so eager to say the big, attention-getting statement, 
that he hasn't paid attention that there have been serious reforms 
addressed in the last couple of months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the wake of  
the scandal, the biggest purge in the committee's 105 years. 
Besides IOC 2000, the committee also formed an ethics panel with 
outside members. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro has said Hancock will honor its Olympic contract  
that runs through the 2000 Games in Sydney but is undecided whether 
to sign up for the next IOC program that would go through at least 
2004. He cited ``preliminary indications'' the IOC might not invite 
Hancock back. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro recently questioned the makeup of IOC 2000, which  
expanded from a planned 24 members in March to 80 members, 
including 44 IOC delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have now loaded your reform committee with people who have  
Olympic DNA, and clearly the offspring of that union will be as 
cross-eyed as the other results you've brought so far,'' 
D'Alessandro said.

<HEADLINE> Ecuadorean Family Mourned in Conn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) -- As mourners said goodbye to four little  
boys and their mother killed in a train accident, the most touching 
words came from children who wrote messages on their caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry,'' wrote one. ``Enjoy the rest of eternity,'' wrote  
another. 
</P>
<P>
	Julia Toledo de Urgiles and her sons -- Carlos, 11, Jose, 10,  
Angel, 6, and Pedro, 3 -- were killed last week while walking along 
train tracks in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	The family was buried Monday following an emotional service in  
which the youngsters and their mother were eulogized as simple, 
humble people who were always smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happiness is born. It was born in them,'' said Nora Toledo,  
the boys' aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	The family emigrated from the Ecuadorean village of Cojitambo 18  
months ago, settling in Bridgeport, where Mrs. Urgiles' sister and 
brother had lived for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But life in Bridgeport proved difficult. Within a few months,  
Mrs. Urgiles' husband, Carlos, returned to Ecuador. She filed for 
divorce and struggled on her janitor's wages to raise the children 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Urgiles and her boys had been living in a homeless shelter.  
The night of the accident, she had packed up her family and left. 
It was still unclear Monday why she left. 
</P>
<P>
	They were struck from behind by an Amtrak train in Fairfield.  
Mrs. Urgiles, Pedro, Angel and Carlos were killed instantly. Jose 
was declared brain-dead two days after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 500 people attended the Spanish-language funeral  
service at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where 
the family had been active members. Carlos Urgiles sat with his 
in-laws in the front pew. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel very bad because I didn't get a chance to speak to them  
before their death,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who paid their respects wrote messages with markers in  
both Spanish and English on the light-colored caskets. 
</P>
<P>
	Three large flower arrangements had the word ``Classmates''  
embossed in gold lettering. Another arrangement was made out of 
brightly colored tissue paper. 
</P>
<P>
	A handmade card made into the form of a white dove bore the  
hand-written message of a child: ``Jose, We Love You.''

<HEADLINE> Avondale May Accept Litton Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avondale Industries Inc., a major Navy  
shipbuilder, says it is prepared to accept a $500 million cash 
buyout offer from defense contractor Litton Industries Inc. but is 
giving a rival bidder two days to top it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton offer is better than the $470 million stock swap deal  
that Avondale previously accepted from Newport News Shipbuilding, 
Avondale chairman Albert L. Bossier Jr. said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton offer amounts to $39.50 per share.  
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, based in New Orleans, said it has given Virginia-based  
Newport News 48 hours notice of its intention to go with the Litton 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Newport News-Avondale merger was apparently doomed Friday  
when Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon would 
probably tell the Justice Department to reject Litton's $1.3 
billion bid for Newport News for anti-competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Cohen said the Navy had determined it would  
not oppose Litton's offer for Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News had no comment on Avondale's announcement, said  
company spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton owns Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss. Litton  
made its bids for Avondale and Newport News earlier in May after 
Cohen rejected an attempt by General Dynamics Corp. to acquire 
Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Cohen said that the Navy had made a ``preliminary  
determination'' that Litton's bid for Newport News would 
excessively limit competition in naval shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News deal would have reduced the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale and Ingalls Shipbuilding have few overlaps in their  
projects, although they both build amphibious ships and both have 
competed for cruise ships. Newport News, which builds aircraft 
carriers and nuclear submarines, has a distinctly different product 
line from Avondale.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a criminal  
charge Tuesday alleging that presidential friend Webster Hubbell 
engaged in a scheme to conceal his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 decision that was a win for Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr, the appeals court rejected Hubbell's argument that one of 15 
charges against him should be dismissed as too vague. His trial is 
to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	An 85-paragraph section of the indictment enumerates some 50  
alleged lies by Hubbell over a six-year span to regulators from the 
Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be the case that the more elaborate the scheme or  
the more numerous the acts of concealment, the less able the 
government is to charge a crime,'' said the court decision. The 
judges were Stephen Williams and Laurence Silberman, Republican 
appointees, and David Tatel, a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell's ... argument that the indictment fails to give  
sufficient notice because it provides too much detail is, to be 
charitable, unconvincing,'' the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson had ruled that the  
allegations against Hubbell were not specific enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say the land development involved, a  
1,050-acre tract south of Little Rock called Castle Grande, was 
riddled with insider dealing and fictitious sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was owned by Mrs. Clinton's former Whitewater  
partner, Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. Mrs. 
Clinton has testified repeatedly that she remembers almost nothing 
of her work on Castle Grande in 1985-86. Her work on the project 
was disclosed when her missing law firm billing records turned up 
in the White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Grande cost McDougal's savings and loan close to $4  
million. The government eventually took over the failing 
institution at a cost to taxpayers of $65 million.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Edge Up Early / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was lower against the yen Wednesday  
morning, while Japanese stocks edged up on expectations the 
government may hammer out additional measures to buoy up nation's 
slumping economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.59 yen at midday, down 0.52 yen from late  
Tuesday in Tokyo but marginally higher than its late New York level 
of 120.56 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 24.71  
points, or 0.15 percent, to 16,433.21 at the end of the morning 
session. On Tuesday, the index rose 296.85 points, or 1.84 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar's weakness followed its trend in  
New York, where the currency slipped as inflation fears pushed down 
U.S. stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was under selling pressure after a  
stronger-than-expected manufacturing report on Tuesday increased 
speculations the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to 
cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its price  
index rose to 52.2 in May from 49.9 in April, leading analysts and 
investors to interpret that as an indication inflation was revving 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	Although higher interest rates typically are supportive of a  
nation's currency, in this case they are felt to mean that 
businesses will have a harder time getting loans to conduct 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.05 yen, down  
from 126.28 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices opened mixed on profit-taking after  
Tuesday's rise and buying on hopes for more economic stimulus 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buying and selling are intertwined,'' said Kunihiro Hatae,  
general manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said investor sentiment improved somewhat following a  
report Tuesday in a small Japanese investment newspaper saying that 
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi may decide later this month to suspend 
Japan's unpopular 5-percent national sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 9.93 points, or 0.75 percent, to 1,327.41. The 
TOPIX rose 20.29 points, or 1.56 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.52 points  
to close Tuesday's session at 10,596.26. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6200 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.6050 
percent, driving its price down to 98.10 yen from 98.23 yen 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Suzuki Boosts Hungarian Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Suzuki Motor Corp. of Japan is  
expanding its operations in Hungary to build a car jointly with 
General Motors, Suzuki's chief executive officer announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Osamu Suzuki said at a news conference that 16 billion forints  
($67 million) will be invested in the city of Esztergom, where a 
third Suzuki plant will be built. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki said overall annual capacity will remain at about 70,000  
vehicles but that some 20,000 of them will be new-model cars 
manufactured jointly with General Motors. 
</P>
<P>
	The new vehicle has yet to be named, but currently is being  
referred to as a Suzuki-GM Opel compact. Production is to start in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for production to rise to 30,000 vehicles to 50,000  
vehicles a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts for the new car will be manufactured in Hungary and in  
Poland, at the General Motors Polska plant, which will turn out 
120,000 of the new vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Suzuki's Esztergom plant, 25 miles north of Budapest,  
produced 66,000 cars.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Manager Boles Sidelined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins manager John Boles, who had hoped  
to be back in the dugout Tuesday, will remain sidelined until next 
week with a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles has been out since Friday because of the ailment. He also  
missed two games in early May to undergo emergency back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles came to the ballpark Tuesday but was sent home before the  
game against St. Louis. He'll stay at home the rest of the week 
while Fredi Gonzalez manages the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disappointed and depressed,'' Boles said. ``I'm just  
not over this thing yet. As much as I'd like to proclaim I am, I 
need a little more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boles will undergo therapy the rest of the week, and he hopes to  
return for Florida's series at home against Baltimore beginning 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Through Monday, the Marlins were 1-5 with Gonzalez as interim  
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came in today expecting to coach third base,'' Gonzalez  
said. ``Bolesy says, `You're managing again,' and I said, `Aw, 
shoot.'''

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Raises Heart Attack Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Cocaine users are 24 times more likely to have a  
heart attack within the first hour of taking the drug, according to 
researchers who said their study was the first to quantify the 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rare to see such a strong association'' between cocaine  
use and heart attack, said Dr. Murray Mittleman, an internist at 
Harvard Medical School's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
``It's larger than all of the other triggers that bring on the 
onset of heart attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Mittleman and published in today's issue of  
Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long known that cocaine can raise the risk of a  
heart attack. Mittleman said this is the first controlled study to 
actually quantify the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Research over the past decade has shown adrenaline-like drugs  
such as cocaine can trigger health problems such as increased heart 
rate, high blood pressure and stroke. More than 30 million 
Americans are believed to have tried cocaine, with an estimated 5 
million becoming regular users. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was based on interviews at 64 hospitals across the  
United States with 3,946 patients, ages 20 to 92, who had suffered 
heart attacks. Researchers conducted the interviews between 1989 
and 1996. All patients were guaranteed anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight reported cocaine use in the year prior to their  
attack, with nine reporting use of the drug within an hour before 
their heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittleman said the risk of a heart attack appeared to drop  
significantly after the first hour of cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	The cocaine users who had a heart attack were 44 years old on  
average. By comparison, the average age for all heart attack 
patients in the United States is 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven Manoukain, a cardiologist at Emory University School  
of Medicine in Atlanta, said the risk as calculated by the Harvard 
researchers was higher than he thought it would be.

<HEADLINE> Japan Expecting Low Tax Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's national tax revenues will most likely fail  
to meet the government target and fall to an 11-year low because of 
the country's prolonged economic slump, the Finance Ministry said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of the end of April, tax receipts for last fiscal year  
totaled $352 billion, 85 percent of the most recent projection. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortfall -- some $74.7 billion less than the forecast in  
last year's budget -- stems mainly from a big drop in income tax 
receipts from businesses and individuals, said Kyohei Shimada, a 
ministry official in charge of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Japanese companies were hit hard because of the country's  
protracted recession, and the ministry has already cut its tax 
revenue estimates twice. 
</P>
<P>
	As of the end of April, corporate tax revenues totaled $59.8  
billion, down 15 percent from the year before, according to the 
ministry's latest statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's tax revenues peaked at $498.7 billion in fiscal 1990.  
The fiscal 1998 tax revenue is expected to fall below $414.93 
billion for first time in 11 years, Japan's leading economic 
newspaper Nihon Keizai reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Shimada said the ministry will announce the final results in  
early July, when taxes paid in May are tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 40 percent of corporate taxes come from companies that  
close their books in March and pay taxes in May.

<HEADLINE> Dakar Discovery Leaves Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Egyptians on a war footing, Soviets on  
the hunt, even Americans bearing a grudge: The conspiracy theories 
surrounding the disappearance of an Israeli submarine 31 years ago 
have dissipated with its discovery and the likelihood that its 69 
men were the victims of a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	But Israelis are still seeking answers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction was one of closure, that we know they found the  
submarine,'' said Micha Marcovici, whose brother was a mechanic 
aboard the Dakar. ``But until they pull it out, we won't be 
satisfied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dakar was identified on Saturday by search and salvage  
experts working for Nauticus -- a Maryland-based company that 
identified the Titanic. The Israeli sub was found about 300 miles 
off the Israeli coast, near the Greek island of Crete. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli navy officers, who accompanied the U.S. salvage experts  
on the search, believe the Dakar's periscope was swiped by a cargo 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no formal declaration by the navy yet,'' Doron Amir,  
a captain in the naval reserves, said Tuesday. ``But it was an 
accident.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli officers believe the Dakar's sonar failed to detect the  
cargo ship until the last minute because of stormy weather. The 
crew dived to avoid the hull, but it was too late: a huge tear sent 
the sub plunging nearly two miles to the ocean floor. The 69-man 
crew was dead within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	They base their conclusions on the way the submarine wreckage is  
strewn across the sea floor and the way the jagged metal pieces 
look. The cargo ship would have been unaware of the accident, 
unable to distinguish the impact of the submarine hit from that of 
a strong wave, the officers say. 
</P>
<P>
	Conspiracy theories had raged for years.  
</P>
<P>
	Some believed the Egyptian navy had hit the T-class sub, on its  
way home from Britain, where it had been purchased and where the 
crew had been trained. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt in 1968 was still smarting from its humiliating 1967  
defeat at the hands of Israel, and some Egyptian generals readily 
fueled the theory. 
</P>
<P>
	It was bolstered when the Dakar's emergency buoy was washed up a  
few miles north of Egyptian waters in 1969. The location was off 
course, but naval researchers theorized at the time that the sub -- 
known to be making better time than expected -- embarked on an 
exploratory adventure before docking. 
</P>
<P>
	Others speculated that one of the many Soviet military vessels  
plying the Mediterranean at the time sunk the Dakar as a favor to 
Arab allies. Still others reckoned an American hit -- revenge for 
the accidental Israeli strafing of a U.S. spy ship during the 1967 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	The Israeli navy clearly hopes the discovery of the sub on its  
designated route kills all the talk of conspiracies and 
adventurism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an accident,'' Amir said.  
</P>
<P>
	Amir wants to bring the families out to the site of the Dakar  
for a final ceremony, and rejects calls to raise the sub. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should we lift it up, what good will it do to spend an  
enormous amount of money to expose pieces of metal to the 
atmosphere?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such talk demonstrates a patronizing attitude that has  
infuriated the victims' families, said Marcovici, who chairs a 
committee of families. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents were going to their graves not knowing what happened  
to their sons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions the families want answered are why the  
Remote Operated Vehicle that identified the sub, available since 
1995, was not hired for the search sooner? And why did it take 
until 1999 to search the ship's designated route? 
</P>
<P>
	``The mysteries are over, now the questions begin,'' said naval  
researcher Mike Eldar, whose book on the Dakar has been censored 
under the official secrets act. 
</P>
<P>
	Eldar -- like many of the families -- believes that military  
arrogance is behind the delays. He says the Dakar is unlikely to 
hold any secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from answers, the families want to bid a final farewell to  
their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't leave them there, it's unbelievably cruel,'' said  
Nurit Manor, whose husband Dan was aboard the Dakar. 
</P>
<P>
	The chances of finding bodies is remote, said Nauticus  
operations director Tom Dettweiler, who screened a few minutes of 
video images Tuesday of the Dakar's detritus -- a roll of cord, a 
smashed ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dettweiler said he had never encountered human remains in all  
his deep sea searches. 
</P>
<P>
	He said finding the Dakar moved him even more than the discovery  
of the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were sailors like us who were doing their job and doing  
it well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Giants Miffed by Gomes Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies closer Wayne Gomes  
likes to celebrate. The San Francisco Giants don't like to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take offense to it,'' Giants second baseman Jeff Kent  
said Tuesday. ``I just think it shows a lack of class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gomes got the attention of the slumping Giants on Monday night  
with a demonstrative celebration on the mound after striking out 
Rich Aurilia and Brent Mayne in the eighth inning of the Phillies' 
4-3 comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander spun around on the mound and pumped both arms  
several times while running to the dugout. Gomes then pitched a 
1-2-3 ninth for his fourth save, sending the Giants to their fifth 
straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just an emotional person,'' said Gomes, who recently took  
over the closer's job when Jeff Brantley went down with a 
season-ending shoulder injury. ``I really can't hold that in. Big 
outs put food on my table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gomes and the Giants have a history.  
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of a brawl last Aug. 2, J.T. Snow homered off  
Gomes, watched the ball's flight and then flipped his bat 
derisively to the side. The next day, Gomes struck out Snow and 
waved both arms as if shooing him off the field. Words were 
exchanged, and the two players had to be separated. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies were swept in four games by San Francisco during a  
seven-game losing streak that effectively ended their chase for an 
NL wild card spot. Philadelphia manager Terry Francona doesn't 
expect Gomes' actions on Monday night to fuel more hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would it?'' Francona asked. ``That was last year.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kent, a quietly fiery presence who disdains showboating, said  
the Giants plan to get Gomes back with their bats and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he's established himself to celebrate like  
that,'' Kent said. ``It's not like it was a playoff game. I think 
it's magnified because we had a situation with him last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gomes said, ``I don't mean to disrespect their ballclub or  
anybody on that team. That's just how I pitch. I just get excited 
out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the incident with Snow last year, Gomes sent the Giants  
first baseman a letter of apology. Snow said he received the note 
but never responded.

	``He'll learn to have more self-control the longer he pitches,''  
Kent said. 
</P>
<P>
	Francona said he talked briefly with Gomes, urging the  
26-year-old closer to concentrate on pitching instead of 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to take away any of his enthusiasm,'' Francona  
said. ``But I also don't want the other team to have extra 
incentive to beat him.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Takes Steps on Path to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- As the International Olympic  
Committee considers how to restructure itself, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch has made it clear there isn't any imminent change at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch reiterated Monday his intention to serve the final two  
years of his term as IOC president, dismissing speculation -- 
including from one of his own deputies -- that he might step down 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Samaranch said he  
will heed the wishes of the IOC delegates who gave him an 
overwhelming vote of confidence -- 86-2 -- during the crisis meeting 
in March on the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position depends on the IOC members,'' Samaranch said  
Monday. ``The secret ballot we had in Lausanne was very clear. The 
IOC members think I am the right man at this moment to lead the 
changes we need in the IOC. With the confidence of the IOC members, 
I am ready to finish my mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been in office since 1980, was re-elected to  
his latest four-year term in 1997 and is due to serve until the IOC 
session in Moscow in September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada, a leading presidential  
contender, recently suggested that Samaranch could decide to retire 
at the end of this year after ushering in a series of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual public rebuke by a fellow IOC executive board  
member, Kevan Gosper of Australia -- another presidential hopeful -- 
said Pound's remarks were ``rather unfortunate to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His postulation that Samaranch might go early was unwelcome,''  
Gosper said. ``Samaranch's intentions are quite clear: he intends 
to see out his mandate. He has repeated that to me and I fully 
support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who wrote to Pound expressing disappoinment at his  
comments, said Monday that the two remain on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't judge what he said or did not say,'' Samaranch said.  
``What I am judging with Dick Pound is our relations of 18-19 
years. He is always working very close to me. I am giving him the 
most important responsibilities. Dick Pound was one who always 
defended me. I consider Dick Pound one of the most important 
members of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke on the eve of the inaugural meeting of the IOC's  
new reform commission, an 80-member task force charged with 
reshaping the 105-year-old organization after its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC 2000 panel, meeting today and Wednesday, will begin  
examining ways of overhauling the IOC's structure and the process 
for selecting Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the commission is expected to consider  
changes to the way IOC members are selected, including the 
possibility of term limits and reduction of the age limit from 80 
to between 70 and 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is scheduled to submit a preliminary report June  
20 at the next IOC general assembly in Seoul, South Korea. 
Samaranch hopes final recommendations will be approved at a special 
IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meeting is only the beginning,'' Samaranch. ``We cannot  
expect any kind of resolution this week. Our aim is to have final 
decisions by the end of the year. If that's not possible, then by 
the spring of next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the reforms would not be dictated by pressure  
from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other congressional critics who 
have threatened to enact legislation that would punish the IOC 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do what they desire,'' Samaranch said. ``But I  
repeat: The IOC is run by the IOC members. ... We highly respect 
the Senate of the United States, but I am sure they also will 
respect the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Originally planned as a group of 20-24 people, the reform  
commission has expanded to 80 members -- 44 from the IOC and 36 from 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is divided into three working groups: the  
composition and structure of the IOC, the role of the IOC, and the 
selection of Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	A 26-member executive committee, divided equally among IOC and  
non-IOC members, will oversee the reform process. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most prominent non-IOC members on the commission are  
Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State; Peter 
Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games; Italian 
industrialist Giovanni Agnelli; former U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt; NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol; and 
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Costa Rica president Oscar 
Arias Sanchez.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Decorators' Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two interior decorators convicted of  
conspiring to launder money for a Colombian drug cartel kingpin 
whose many properties they filled with expensive furnishings lost a 
Supreme Court appeal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, without comment, left intact the lengthy prison  
sentences Antony Blarek II and Frank Pellecchia received after a 
federal trial in New York for their ties to the late Jose 
Santacruz, identified by prosecutors as a leader of the Cali drug 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal rejected today, Harvard law professor Alan  
Dershowitz argued for the two decorators that they are being 
treated as criminals for helping Santacruz ``spend his money on 
non-narcotics-related activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If Blarek's and Pellecchia's activities constituted money  
laundering, then money laundering has been redefined to include all 
market transactions between those who lead criminal enterprises and 
those who provide lawful goods and services to them,'' the appeal 
said. ``If that is so, thousands of doctors, dentists, merchants 
and other business people and professionals are in serious 
jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Department lawyers urged the nation's highest court  
to reject the appeal. They noted that the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals, in upholding the convictions last year, found 
``considerable evidence'' to ``support the inference that (they) 
conspired with Santacruz to aid his enterprise's drug business 
through money laundering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blarek was a Miami-based interior designer when in 1979 he met  
Santacruz in Cali, and was hired to decorate the drug lord's 
palatial new home. In 1981, agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement 
Administration told Blarek that Santacruz was a drug dealer but by 
1985 he and Pellecchia were spending millions of dollars for 
Santacruz. 
</P>
<P>
	The two decorators worked together, their appeal said, on  
projects that included an apartment for Santacruz's wife in Bogota, 
several Cali apartments used by the family and friends, and homes 
and apartments for two of Santacruz's mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were arrested in 1997. They were convicted of  
conspiring to launder money in violation of the federal Racketeer 
Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act. Blarek was sentenced to five 
years and eight months in prison; Pellecchia to four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The government confiscated the $750,000 in cash found in their  
safe deposit boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Blarek vs. U.S., 98-1391.

<HEADLINE> Clapton To Bid for His Guitar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Bidders vying for some of Eric Clapton's guitars  
at an auction later this month may find themselves competing 
against ... Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton said Tuesday he hadn't realized how difficult it would  
be to part with 100 of his instruments. As he result, he will be 
``bidding in secret'' for one guitar he realized he just couldn't 
let go. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, I am not going to say which one it is, but it is a  
guitar that has been around my house for years and I've picked it 
up in times of great stress like a comfort blanket,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clapton hopes the June 24 auction at Christie's in New York will  
raise between $700,000 and $1 million for the Crossroads drug 
treatment center he founded in Antigua. He has kept about 20 
guitars. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have kept those that I play virtually every day, and I have  
made sure I still have what I need,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Angry As Stanley Cup Sold Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Mike Szpylman was wet, tired and ticketless  
after waiting 14 hours through a rainy night for a chance to see 
his beloved Sabres in the Stanley Cup finals, where they haven't 
been since 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't help but cry.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting my whole life to go,'' the 16-year-old fan  
said, a tear forming at the corner of his eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Fan Tony Failla, also unable to get tickets, seemed to take it  
even harder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to die,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 fans found themselves out of luck Tuesday  
morning when the limited number of tickets available to the general 
public sold out in eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of them had waited through the night at Marine Midland  
Arena and were outraged when told there were no more tickets left, 
chanting, ``Hell no, we won't go!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two men rammed a metal barricade into a locked glass door as  
employees and security officers waited for the police. A burst of 
rain dispersed much of the crowd after a few tense moments. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-2 Monday night to win  
the Eastern Conference title, four games to one. 
</P>
<P>
	The chance to see the Sabres' long-awaited return to the Stanley  
Cup finals brought Adam Becker of Buffalo and his sister, Amanda, 
to the arena at about 7:00 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty cold after a while,'' Becker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Season-ticket holders and fans who bought 10-packs of tickets  
for the regular season purchased in advance 14,000 tickets for each 
game of the finals, said Ron Bertovich, the Sabres' executive vice 
president of administration. 
</P>
<P>
	About 2,000 other tickets went to the NHL, competing teams and  
ownership, and 300 more were lost to an auxiliary press box, he 
said. That left about 2,000 tickets per game for the general 
public, available at the box office and through Tops supermarkets, 
an Internet site, and by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	About 590 tickets sold in the first minute, Bertovich said. At  
least two games, perhaps as many as three, will be played in 
Buffalo because the Western Conference champion will have home-ice 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to put tickets in as many people's hands as  
possible,'' Bertovich said. ``There was a small quantity for the 
level of interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Schappert was among a dozen or so newly graduated St.  
Francis High School students willing to wait all night in the rain 
to spend his graduation money on tickets. He wished someone would 
have told him he had virtually no chance of getting them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew we weren't going to get tickets,'' he said, ``and  
they let us stay here overnight.''

<HEADLINE>  Supplies Brought to Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's highly skilled  
astronauts turned into low-tech haulers today, toting suitcases 
stuffed with supplies into the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew must pack 3,600 pounds of tools, spare  
parts, computers, water and clothes into the outpost's two modules 
by Thursday, when Discovery is to depart from the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not real easy,'' flight director Wayne Hale said. ``Every  
single bag, every single item has got an exact place it's supposed 
to go, and the crew's been trained to put them in one and only one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reminds me a lot of packing for going on a long camping  
trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Ellen Ochoa is the so-called ``loadmaster'' of the  
mission, charged with making sure the equipment gets from the 
shuttle into the station. She stays inside Discovery, handing off 
the bulky, soft-sided suitcases to her crewmates, who do the 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian astronaut Julie Payette checks off each bag as it  
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	By this morning, more than half the equipment had been  
transferred and stowed. Some bags go behind wall panels; others are 
attached to the floor and walls of the modules with Velcro strips. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies -- which range from trash bags to laptops -- are for  
future station visitors, particularly the first permanent crew, due 
to arrive next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts delved into their moving chores after  
repairing several components aboard the Russian-built Zarya control 
module and the U.S.-built Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	After entering the station late Sunday, the astronauts fixed a  
broken data communications system aboard Unity, replacing two 
electronic boxes. The radio link was lost in April, four months 
after the module was hoisted into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the crew finished replacing flawed battery packs in  
Zarya and installing foam mufflers over noisy fans and ducts inside 
the Russian component. Permanent station crews could suffer hearing 
damage unless the noise is reduced significantly or ear plugs are 
worn. 
</P>
<P>
	The relative humidity inside Zarya rose to 60 percent this  
morning, partly because the air flow was hampered in one spot by 
the new foam mufflers. The crew took the sound-insulating material 
off that section of the duct, removing the kink, and the flow 
immediately improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight director Mark Ferring said the humidity always remained  
within acceptable limits. The temperature in the space station was 
also up this morning, to 78 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatches will be sealed early Thursday, and Discovery will  
pull away that evening. The shuttle is due back on Earth on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Worsens in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The number of unemployed people in Japan rose to a  
new all-time high in April, while the jobless rate among men hit a 
record 5 percent, the government announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's overall jobless rate, however, remained steady at a  
record high of 4.8 percent in April, the statistics bureau of the 
Management and Coordination Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of people without jobs increased to 3.42 million, a  
rise of 0.9 percent from March, while the number holding jobs in 
April fell 630,000, or 1 percent, from a year earlier to 64.69 
million, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate among men broke the previous record set in  
March of 4.8 percent as more men were forced out of their jobs, 
said an agency official, who briefed reporters on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The jobless rate for women fell 0.3 of a percentage point to 4.5  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment situation is still very severe,'' Chief  
Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said. ``It is our urgent task to 
remove anxiety ... and put the economy on a recovery track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonaka also said the government was putting together proposals,  
to be submitted to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on June 11, to 
increase industrial competitiveness and deal with soaring 
unemployment. He added that a supplementary budget and legislation 
may be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's jobless rate has worsened in recent months, increasing  
pessimism about the nation's economy, which is struggling through 
its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists in Tokyo had forecast the overall jobless rate would  
rise to 4.9 percent, Dow Jones Newswires reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's data highlighted the recent sharp rise in the number  
of people losing jobs because of corporate restructurings or 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Of all the jobless people currently seeking work, a record high  
1.15 million were forced out of their jobs, while 1.08 million left 
previous positions voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	April was the first time since June 1987 that the number of  
people forced from work exceeded the number of those who left on 
their own, the agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official also said that men have been especially hard hit by  
the effects of restructuring. Of those, men between 55 and 64 years 
old most felt the sting, with the jobless rate for that age group 
rising to 7.2 percent in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation for women, however, appears to be improving.  
</P>
<P>
	``Joblessness among women seems to be leveling off,'' the agency  
official said, adding that employment in the services and retail 
sectors was looking favorable for them. 
</P>
<P>
	In an indicator of demand for labor, the government also  
announced Tuesday that there were only 48 jobs per 100 job seekers 
in April. That was down slightly from 49 jobs per 100 job seekers 
in March, the Labor Ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Six Die in Crash on Penn. Turnpike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEDFORD, Pa. (AP) -- Two sets of Amish sisters were among six  
people killed when their van swerved through a highway divider and 
plowed into an oncoming truck. 
</P>
<P>
	A seventh occupant of the van survived and was hospitalized. The  
truck driver was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ford van was traveling west on the Pennsylvania Turnpike  
early Monday about 115 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was returning to an Amish community in southwest Homer  
City after a weekend trip to Intercourse, in the southeastern part 
of the state, said surviving passenger Benjamin King. He was in 
fair condition today at UPMC-Bedford Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The van went out of control, hit the divider and crossed into  
the eastbound lane, state police said. Three passengers were thrown 
from the vehicle when it struck the tractor-trailer rig head-on and 
then burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	State police said the cause of the wreck was still under  
investigation. King, who was being treated for a broken collarbone 
and punctured lung, said he was asleep before the crash and didn't 
know what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as King's brother, Amis King, 21, of  
Penn Run; Martha Stoltzfus, 19, and her sister, Anna Mae, 17, both 
of Homer City; Lydia King, 20, and her sister, Suzie, 16, both of 
Gap; and the van's non-Amish driver, Randy Brubaker, 40, of Homer 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	The Amish often hire drivers because their religious beliefs  
discourage driving.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: No Compromise on Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO will not compromise on its demand that  
the alliance be ``at the core'' of any peacekeeping force that 
enters Kosovo as part of a settlement to end airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia, the Clinton administration said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``By being at the core, that means there must be a command and  
control structure that is NATO's in charge of any peacekeeping 
operation,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters after 
addressing a suburban Washington high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, after meeting with  
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, said the United States and 
Italy are ``solidly behind these objectives and we will not settle 
for less.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dini, agreeing, said Italy was not proposing a pause in NATO's  
air campaign until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepted 
all the conditions set out by the alliance. ``We cannot, at this 
point, fall into negotiating tricks,'' Dini said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is planning to put as many as 50,000 armed troops in a  
peacekeeping force, but Cohen reiterated that the alliance would 
enter Kosovo only after Milosevic gives up fighting ethnic Albanian 
rebels and withdraws his troops -- not to invade and expel Serb 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO military representatives met in Brussels, Belgium, on  
Tuesday to determine how many peacekeepers each member country 
would contribute to the 50,000-troop total. At the Pentagon, 
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the United States would provide about 
15 percent of the total, which would be about 7,500. Bacon would 
not be more specific, but he indicated the administration would 
announce a firm figure shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon also raised the possibility that NATO would not get  
peacekeepers into Kosovo soon enough to return all of the more than 
1 million displaced ethnic Albanians to Kovoso before the winter 
sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if there were a peace agreement tomorrow or next week,  
it's not reasonable to assume that every refugee would return home 
instantly, and some may end up in Macedonia or Albania through the 
winter,'' Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also ruled out a pause in the 70-day-old NATO bombing  
campaign, as demanded in a letter delivered from Belgrade on 
Tuesday to German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer in which 
Yugoslav officials said they accepted a peace proposal by the G-8 
group of major industrialized nations and Russia. On the sticky 
question of allowing NATO into Kosovo, the letter acceded to ``a 
United Nations presence, mandate and other elements to be decided 
by a U.N. Security Council resolution in accordance with the United 
Nations charter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the bombing would stop only when Milosevic accepted  
all of NATO's main demands, including the return of hundreds of 
thousands of ethnic Albanians refugees, and withdrawal of his 
troops to demonstrate his acceptance of peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pause would only serve Milosevic's interests,'' Cohen said.  
``He is seeking to try to divide the alliance. He's seeking delay. 
We are now at the point where the air campaign is being intensified 
on a 24-hour basis.'' He said the bombing is exacting a ``heavy 
penalty'' from Milosevic and his military. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright met with Dini as part of a series of sessions with NATO  
foreign ministers to show unity in the alliance. She said Milosevic 
had accepted the principles established by Russia and seven 
industrialized democracies but not NATO's conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The G-8 nations did not specify, as the alliance does, that all  
Serb troops must quit Kosovo and that NATO be at the core of the 
peacekeeping mission designed to guarantee safe return of ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foreign Minister Dini and I, along with other allies, remain  
committed to concluding the conflict on the basis of the conditions 
NATO set and the international community endorsed,'' Albright said. 
``The Serb forces must leave Kosovo so that the refugees and 
displaced persons may return safely to their homes. And (an) 
international military presence with NATO at its core must be 
established. And the people of Kosovo must be allowed democratic 
self-governance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Bonn, Germany, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and  
Russia's special Balkans envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, met with 
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott in hopes of establishing a 
common position that Ahtisaari and Chernomyrdin could take to 
Belgrade on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to students at Woodbridge High School in Woodbridge,  
Va., Cohen portrayed NATO's air war against Yugoslavia as a 
struggle to reverse Milosevic's inhumane treatment of ethnic 
Albanians, who before the start of NATO's bombing made up about 90 
percent of Kosovo's population. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Kosovo we have a situation in which one man has decided  
that a whole group of people should be expunged from the face of 
the Earth -- that they should be ethnically cleansed,'' Cohen said 
to several hundred students. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that more than 1 million ethnic Albanians have been  
driven from their homes in the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot continue to watch this kind of a campaign carried  
out, something we thought was beyond our imagination, that we 
thought was over at the end of World War II,'' Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Lukas Wants Charismatic Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer D. Wayne Lukas is concerned about  
Charismatic's competition when he bids for the Triple Crown in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the best available. He doesn't want to hear comments  
about the quality of the rivals or questions about whether 
Charismatic deserves to be a Triple Crown champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope everybody who has one ready runs him,'' Lukas  
said. ``We don't want any second-guessing on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kentucky Derby-Preakness winner ran Tuesday at Churchill  
Downs on a track wet from overnight rain, his final significant 
work before Saturday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Also working for the final time was the filly Silverbulletday,  
one of Charismatic's major challengers in what is expected to be a 
12-horse field for the 1 1/2-mile classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic worked in predawn darkness at about 6 a.m. EDT and  
went five-eighths of a mile in 1:00 2-5, going the last quarter in 
24 seconds. He galloped out three-quarters in 1:14. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased,'' Lukas said. ``I was happy he was able to  
stretch his legs and open his lungs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, who will be making her debut against males,  
worked five-eighths of a mile about 2 1/2 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Bob Baffert said the winner of 11 of 12 starts, was  
timed in 59 1-5 and galloped out in 1:12. 
</P>
<P>
	``Doesn't she look beautiful, though,'' Baffert said as the  
filly raced down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fantastic,'' Baffert said. ``It showed me what I was  
looking for.'' Then, he quipped, ``I don't know what I was looking 
for, but it looked good when I saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope she runs the way she worked,'' said owner Mike  
Pegram, also owner of the Baffert-owned Real Quiet, who failed to 
win the Triple Crown last year when he finished second in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert also missed the Triple Crown in 1997 with a second-place  
Belmont finish by Silver Charm, owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, 
owners of Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, Silverbulletday and three other Belmont contenders  
-- Prime Directive, Patience Game and Pineaff -- will be flown from 
Louisville to New York on Wednesday. They are expected to arrive at 
Belmont Park at about 10 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Another top Belmont contender, Menifee, second in both the Derby  
and Preakness, already is at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, a strapping chestnut, seems to have started acting  
like a star. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's getting a little more difficult to handle, but only since  
the Preakness (May 15),'' Lukas said. ``He's a little more on the 
muscle. That could be from (all of) the racing. It's not a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belmont will be Charismatic's fifth race in 10 weeks. A  
fourth straight victory -- he won the Lexington on April 18 at 
Keeneland -- would make him the 12th Triple Crown winner and the 
first since Affirmed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday will be the 21st filly to start in 131 Belmonts.  
The only two to win were Ruthless in the first Belmont in 1867 and 
Tanya in 1905. Ruthless beat three males over 1 5-8 miles, and 
Tanya beat six rivals, including another filly, at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she wins it's going to be a great race,'' Baffert said.  
``If Charismatic wins, it's going to be a great race. It will be 
good for racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also expected to be entered Wednesday are Adonis, Best of Luck,  
Lemon Drop Kid, Stephen Got Even, Vision and Verse and Teletable.

<HEADLINE> Air Fares Hike Upwards Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The cost of flying to your favorite vacation spot  
is up almost 11 percent this year after another fare increase from 
the major airlines at the start of the summer travel season. 
</P>
<P>
	The third fare increase of 1999 is expected to stick since  
Northwest Airlines Corp. has gone along with a 4 percent increase 
levied by Continental Airlines last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest has been the stickler in the fare game for the air  
industry. Last year, more than a dozen attempts to raise airline 
fares failed because Northwest declined to go along with other 
airlines' prices. 
</P>
<P>
	As the fare hike spread, shares of many airline companies got a  
lift Tuesday on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4 percent increase instituted this weekend had been in doubt  
for several days. Continental moved first to raise fares on Friday. 
But by Monday, several airlines rolled back the increase while 
Northwest's position was unknown. Later Monday, American Airlines 
and U.S. Airways Inc. had once again upped their prices. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Tuesday, Continental, American, Delta, Northwest, United  
and TWA had increased their seven-, 14- and 21-day advance fares, 
effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must be appropriate with June 1 being the beginning of the  
hurricane season that airfares are blowing all over the place,'' 
said Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling for pleasure typically buy the leisure-fare  
tickets, which come with restrictions such as advance purchase 
requirements. Fares are lower if purchased further in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Parsons said a roundtrip fare on American tickets  
from Dallas to Los Angeles, purchased 21 days in advance for 
midweek travel, rose to $484 from $465 while seven-day fares 
between the same cities increased to $1,030 from $990. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental spokeswoman Sarah Anthony said the increases are  
only for leisure fares at this point, although business fares have 
seen industrywide increases of 3 percent so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The demand for seats has been a major reason behind the higher  
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental spokesman Ned Walker said the increased fares  
reflect strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to carry record loads in many of our markets,''  
said Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anthony agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's based on supply and demand and the market dictates  
fares,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, overcapacity at the airlines is expected to be a problem  
this year with the number of available seats rising by 5.6 percent 
in this quarter alone, according to analyst Susan Donofrio of BT 
Alex. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Add to that, revenues were down in April and off to a weak start  
in May, according to the Air Transport Association. Full-fare 
business traffic was reported to have declined by 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Continental is addressing the problem by  
announcing it would trim back its growth from 9 percent to 6 
percent by retiring some aircraft early. Fort Worth, Texas-based 
American also has announced a modest acceleration in its retirement 
schedule for some of its older planes, mainly to keep capacity 
growth under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons said the overcapacity and tumbling revenues create  
pressure on the airlines to raise prices to keep analysts happy. 
Rising jet fuel prices also are contributing. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the reasons behind higher costs, people will  
continue with their vacation plans. Thirteen percent of Americans 
are expected to fly this summer, up 3 percent from a year ago, 
according to the Travel Industry Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR Corp.,  
the parent of American, was up $2.18 3/4 at $67.25 a share, while 
Delta was up $1.56 1/4 at $58.93 3/4 and Continental was up $1.62 1/2 at 
40.87 1/2. But UAL Corp., the parent of United, was down on the NYSE 
and TWA dipped on the American Stock Exchange. Northwest was up 75 
cents at $34 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Gambling Panel Begins Final Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pro-gambling members of a national study  
commission have one more chance to argue against a proposed 
moratorium on new lotteries and casinos as the panel writes its 
final report. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission meets here this  
week to conclude two years of work taking stock of the 
proliferation of legalized gambling across America. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission was going into its final meetings Wednesday and  
Thursday with dozens of recommendations already decided, including 
a nationwide minimum age of 21 to place bets, less aggressive state 
lottery advertising and more funding of programs to treat gambling 
addicts. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few major issues still must be resolved.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Richard Leone, who opposed introducing casino  
gambling in Atlantic City, N.J., while state treasurer, wants 
states to emulate New Jersey's ban on political campaign donations 
by anybody from the gambling business. Defeating that idea is the 
casino lobby's chief goal this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The meetings will also represent the last chance for  
pro-gambling commissioners to change or remove a controversial 
sentence from the panel's draft report -- the language that would 
urge state and local governments to consider a moratorium on 
gambling expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one commissioner, MGM Grand Inc. chairman J. Terrence  
Lanni, has said he will write a minority report if the moratorium 
suggestion remains intact when the commission finishes its report. 
The study is to be presented to the White House and Congress on 
June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission cannot unilaterally impose a moratorium. But the  
mere suggestion of one has caused debate around the country. In 
Wisconsin, for instance, Lt. Gov. Scott McCallum invoked the 
commission's name in urging a moratorium in his state on Indian 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other hand, several states have taken steps toward  
introducing or expanding gambling in just the past several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kialegee tribe has proposed building Georgia's first casino.  
Illinois state lawmakers approved a riverboat casino near Chicago. 
Washington state's gambling commission rejected Gov. Gary Locke's 
call for a moratorium on ``mini-casino'' card rooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission will submit its report to Congress, the White  
House, state governors and tribal leaders. After that, all bets are 
off. Congress or state legislatures would have to turn the 
recommendations into real change. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las Vegas,  
said she expects ``a rash of legislation'' from gambling opponents 
in Congress. But ``this is a state issue,'' she said. ``If 
individual states don't want gaming or want to regulate gaming, 
they can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., a gambling critic who sponsored  
legislation to create the commission, said he plans to introduce 
bills in line with commission recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	On the state level, the National Coalition Against Legalized  
Gambling plans to use the report as ammunition against the 
proliferation of video gambling in neighborhood stores and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the year 2000, we're going to roll back 'convenience  
gambling' somewhere,'' said the group's spokesman, Bernard Horn. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming  
Association, said the commission's report will focus needed 
attention and government resources on the problem of gambling 
addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``But really, the vast majority of these regulations are aimed  
at governors and state legislators,'' he said. ``And historically, 
state legislators resent people in Washington telling them what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner James Dobson, an opponent of gambling, said he has  
heard from state legislators and private citizens interested in 
using the report's findings in their fights against gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Dobson, president of the conservative group Focus on the Family,  
said his greatest hope is that ``the American people will begin to 
look at what gambling does (and) begin to recognize that it has a 
definite downside.''

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Down on Good Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply  
early today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid near-ideal growing 
conditions for spring crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors quickly removed a risk premium added amid uncertainty  
over weather conditions during the long Memorial Day weekend. 
Forecasters now are predicting warm weather and scattered showers 
across Midwest growing regions this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Those weather conditions should prove ideal for early growth of  
corn and spring wheat crops, where farmers were expected to have 
completed planting in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat also was pressured by upcoming active harvesting of the  
winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 4 3/4 cents to $2.47 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn fell 5 1/4 cents to $2.14 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 2 cents to 
$1.21 a bushel; July soybeans fell 7 3/4 cents to $4.54 a bushel 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle and pork futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .05 cent to 64.20 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .23 cent to 75.75 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .93 cent to 52.02 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .72 
cent to 52.65 cents a pound.

	COMPUTER FACTOIDS: Dell Computer Corp., observing the 25th  
anniversary of the personal computer, has gathered some interesting 
high-tech trivia. Dell notes that the first PC was an Altair 
computer that sold for $400, operated at 2 MHz and contained 256 
bytes of RAM, the computer's primary workspace. By contrast, 
today's newest PCs run at 500 MHz and have 3 million times as much 
RAM. Looking back even further, Dell cites a machine called the 
ENIAC (for Electronic Numeral Integrator and Computer) as the first 
electronic computer. Built in 1946, the ENIAC weighed more than 30 
tons and filled a room the size of a tennis court. Today, PCs that 
fit on a desk perform 20,000 times as fast as the ENIAC, Dell says.

	PROTECTING YOUR HOME: If you're going on vacation, you can make  
your house less tempting to burglars, the Insurance Information 
Institute says. The trade group offers some suggestions: Try to 
make your home look like there's someone there, by leaving window 
blinds in their usual position and using automatic timers to turn 
lights and radios on and off. Have a friend or neighbor pick up 
your mail, and arrange to have your lawn mowed and flowers watered. 
Stop your newspaper delivery, and lower the sound of your telephone 
and answering machine so they cannot be heard outside. Ask the 
police or a friend to check on your house or get involved with a 
neighborhood watch group.

	NOT YOUR ORDINARY CAR DEALERSHIP: When Mike Hale decided to  
build a new home for his auto dealership in Park City, Utah, he 
shied away from the usual steel and glass and went instead for 
stone fireplaces, wood beams and animal heads mounted on the walls. 
Hale, whose company is profiled in the trade magazine Ward's Dealer 
Business, chose the ski lodge look to fit in with his Northern Utah 
locale. Hale is also catering to his customers, who tend to be 
affluent and, he says, looking for high standard of service. So, 
when they're buying a pickup truck or SUV, they can sign the papers 
while sitting in rocking chairs set by the fire.

<HEADLINE> GM Installs 'Black Box' on Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has a device in many of  
its new cars that functions like the black box recorder in 
airplanes: It collects data as a car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors and government officials say that information can help  
them better understand how the human body tolerates car crashes. It 
could then be applied to construct safer cars, improve the 
treatment of crash victims and write government auto safety 
standards that would better protect crash victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the so-called auto black box system also is  
raising sensitive privacy questions about whether such information 
can be used in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The most sophisticated version of GM's device, known formally as  
a sensing and diagnostic module, is in hundreds of thousands of GM 
cars from the 1999 model year, GM says. It is part of the air bag 
sensing system on the 1999 Buick Century, Park Avenue and Regal, 
the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and SeVille, the Chevrolet Camaro 
and Corvette and the Pontiac Firebird. 
</P>
<P>
	The module will be in almost all GM vehicles within the next few  
years, the company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The module stores information in the seconds before a car sensor  
identifies a crash and fires the air bags. The data includes the 
speed of the car, whether the driver was wearing a seat belt, when 
an air bag deployed and whether the driver used the brakes. It can 
also determine whether a warning light was illuminated on the 
dashboard telling an owner to service an air bag. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has quietly installed different versions of the sensing  
system on some cars throughout the 1990s, but the modules have 
become more sophisticated over time. Their existence became public 
in a paper written by GM and government engineers and presented at 
a conference last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until now, government crash investigators could only take an  
educated guess at the speed of a car involved in an accident based 
on evidence at the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
	``Technology allowing vehicle safety researchers to collect  
objective data would open the door to a new generation of 
understanding,'' the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is currently the only automaker that makes such data and the  
tools to recover it available to researchers, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lange, director of engineering safety for GM, said he wanted  
to use the information to better understand the injuries of people 
of all ages in crashes so that autos could be designed to ``reduce 
the likelihood of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been using the technology on Indy race cars since 1992  
and it has led to better crash protection for drivers, Lange said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an incredible opportunity to improve safety,'' said  
Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering 
Network. Augenstein said if doctors know more about crashes, they 
can target their treatment of patients, in some cases including 
checks for serious injuries they might have missed. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hinch, a research engineer at the National Highway Traffic  
Safety Administration and one of the authors of the paper, said he 
saw ``lots of potential'' in using the module's data. GM hopes to 
have laptops available so government crash investigators can 
download data independently of the company by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can understand crashes better, we can have better  
sensors (in automobiles), better air bags,'' Hinch said. ``NHTSA 
can build better (safety) rules and have better information for 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers also seem to favor so-called black boxes for cars, in  
part because it would help them determine who is at fault in 
accidents. But they say courts will first have to sort through how 
such devices could be used in litigation and whether they are 
reliable if contradicted by eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Jolly, an attorney who has litigated auto cases, said he  
has already seen auto companies try to use air bag deployment 
information stored on a car computer chip as a defense in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes companies will not be able to keep such information  
private. ``They're going to know if your case has merit, and vice 
versa,'' Jolly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. said a more limited version of the module was on  
all its 1999 vehicles, but the company is unable to retrieve the 
data for customers.

<P>
	In his absence, the 500-person Microsoft research department  
will be run by Rick Rashid, vice president of research. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Myhrvold's first stops after leaving his Redmond office  
will be eastern Montana, to look for tyrannosaurus and triceratops 
fossils. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going on a major dinosaur expedition this summer with Jack  
Horner,'' the famed paleontologist for the Museum of the Rockies, 
Myhrvold said. He plans to spend two weeks digging in the Hell 
Creek Formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Myhrvold, 39, formerly a postdoctoral fellow in physics to  
cosmologist Stephen Hawking at Cambridge University, came to 
Microsoft in 1986 when it acquired his software company, Dynamical 
Systems Research. 
</P>
<P>
	He became a top adviser to chairman Bill Gates on trends in  
technology and had a hand in a number of key projects, including 
development of the Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded one of the first research departments at a personal  
computer software company in 1991 and was named chief technology 
officer in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Magazine this week reported that rumors inside Microsoft  
had him the victim of ``a very private ousting'' by Microsoft 
President Steve Ballmer. 
</P>
<P>
	But Myhrvold said Monday ``there's absolutely no truth that I'm  
getting the boot. Steve Ballmer is not involved in this. It's 
entirely my own decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer, who hired Myhrvold, recently reorganized Microsoft  
after being given charge of the day-to-day operations by Gates. 
Those changes had nothing to do with his decision to leave, 
Myhrvold said, adding that Gates told him his job will be there 
when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could not be further from the truth that there is any  
problem with me and Steve,'' he said in a phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been thinking about this for last two or three years.  
Bill, frankly, wants me to stay, but he and I both realize that if 
we look for a perfect time, there never will be a perfect time. 
There will always be a crisis in our business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a news release, Gates said he still plans to draw on  
Myhrvold's expertise from time to time while he is on leave. ``I 
would rather he continue his work at Microsoft,'' Gates said, ``but 
I support his decision to take a much-needed break and explore his 
passion for science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides dinosaur-hunting, Myhrvold said he wants to pursue  
interests in physics, mathematics and biology. He has a doctorate 
in theoretical and mathematical physics and master's degrees in 
mathematical economics, geophysics and space physics.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Working on China Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Fewer restrictions and the advent of larger  
airplanes mean U.S. airlines are brawling over carrier rights to 
China, the world's largest market with some of the tightest 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of Beijing and Washington signed an agreement in  
April that relaxes the rules on flying to and from China. Those 
changes, along with the recent introduction of the Boeing 777, 
which can fly farther and bypass gate-restrictive Japan, will allow 
air carriers to fly straight to Asia, where air travel is growing 
10 percent annually. The 777 is capable of carrying up to 328 
passengers a distance of 8,300 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 777 certainly makes China a reality for American,'' said  
John Hotard, a spokesman for the Fort Worth-based airline. ``Now, 
nonstop or direct service into China will make it much easier for 
the U.S. carriers to do business in that region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China, which let foreign investors into the country 20 years  
ago, has long kept some sectors, such as aviation, closed to 
outside investment. The country had been offering to make 
concessions in its trade barriers to get backing for World Trade 
Organization membership, a goal it has sought for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But deliberations between China and the U.S. faltered not long  
after the aviation deal was struck. The success of further talks 
has grown unlikely recently due to violent anti-U.S. demonstrations 
in Beijing to protest NATO's mistaken bombing of the Chinese 
Embassy in Belgrade and by recent allegations of Chinese nuclear 
spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Those incidents will not effect the aviation deal signed April  
9, according to Bob Adams, a spokesman for the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will double the total number of passenger and cargo  
flights among all U.S. airlines between the two countries from 27 
to 54. The Department of Transportation plans to award eight new 
flights immediately and nine more on April 1, 2000. The rest will 
be added in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement removes all restrictions on gateway departure  
cities from the United States. Passengers traveling to China 
currently must go from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Anchorage, 
Alaska, San Francisco, Honolulu, Seattle and Detroit. They must 
land in Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
	And the changes allow each country to authorize one more carrier  
to fly between the nations. Currently, United Airlines, Northwest 
Airlines and Federal Express fly to China. 
</P>
<P>
	-- FedEx, the world's largest air express shipping company, has  
four flights a week landing at either Beijing or Shanghai. The unit 
of Memphis, Tenn.-based FDX Corp. would like to triple its number 
of flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The cargo-only air carrier said it would petition for eight more  
slots, but did not release what other cities it hopes to serve. 
</P>
<P>
	-- United Airlines plans to ask for rights to launch new nonstop  
service from San Francisco to Shanghai. United currently serves 
Shanghai and Beijing with one-stop service in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Northwest operates five nonstop flights to Beijing from  
Detroit and sends other passengers from Detroit to Beijing via 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success to Beijing was wonderful,'' said Northwest  
spokesman Jon Austin. About 80 percent of seats are sold on 
Northwest's four-times-a-week flights to China, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has not announced where it would add new flights.  
</P>
<P>
	With only one additional carrier to receive permission to fly to  
China under the deal, the interested airlines will lobby Washington 
for the routes. 
</P>
<P>
	-- American is considering Dallas-Fort Worth and Chicago as  
origination gateways, but hasn't yet filed for anything specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mainly we have just said we're interested in serving China  
when those routes become available,'' Hotard said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines has said it hopes to fly between  
Portland, Ore., and China. As the carrier prepares its bid to fly 
to China, it has cut service between Portland and Seoul, South 
Korea, and postponed its Osaka, Japan, launch because of the 
economic downturn in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	China's own fledgling commercial airlines, all but two of which  
are government-owned, lost $300 million last year. Chinese airlines 
had been forced to cancel up to 900 domestic flights a week, 
according to Airline Industry Information. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, airline capacity to the Pacific will top all other routes  
during most of the year, according to Salomon Smith Barney's 
Quarter Regional Capacity Analysis.

<HEADLINE> SFX To Buy Most of Livent's Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a bid to become a major player on Broadway,  
SFX Entertainment, the nation's leading producer of live music 
shows, is offering to buy most of the assets of troubled Canadian 
musical producer Livent. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed Tuesday by either company,  
although published reports last week put the expected purchase 
price at more than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court,  
includes Livent theaters in New York, Chicago and Toronto as well 
as rights to current Livent productions, which include ``Fosse,'' 
``Ragtime'' and the Toronto production of ``The Phantom of the 
Opera.'' It does not include a theater in Vancouver or Livent's 
headquarters in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX already is a powerhouse on the road, not only in staging and  
promoting concerts and other live entertainment, but in touring 
Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Through its subsidiary, Pace Theatrical Group, it is producing,  
co-producing or has investments in current tours of ``Cabaret,'' 
``Evita'' and ``Chicago,'' among other shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Pace also has produced or co-produced several Broadway musicals,  
including the long-running ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde,'' and ``The Civil 
War,'' which has been struggling at the box office since opening in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX was born out of SFX Broadcasting, a radio company founded by  
Robert F.X. Sillerman in 1992 and which he sold five years later 
for millions. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, SFX has aggressively purchased  
amphitheaters, ticketing agencies and music-promoting offices. The 
company controls more than 82 venues and last year produced or 
promoted over 13,000 events attended by 37 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent filed for bankruptcy protection in November after its new  
owners, which include Hollywood super-agent Michael Ovitz, said 
they discovered accounting fraud by the company's Canadian 
founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities filed fraud and conspiracy charges against  
Drabinsky and Gottlieb, but the two men have denied any wrongdoing 
and remained in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX also will acquire rights to projects Livent had in  
preparation, including a musical version of the film ``Sweet Smell 
of Success'' and ``The Seussical,'' based on the Dr. Seuss stories, 
which has a score by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, who wrote 
``Ragtime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Livent's sale comes at a time when two of the shows  
Drabinsky nurtured and brought to fruition, ``Fosse'' and 
``Parade,'' are the top contenders for the best musical prize at 
the 1999 Tony Awards this Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Four Dead in Chicago Apartment Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A fire that killed two children, their mother and  
their grandmother may have been deliberately set, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arson-sniffing dogs detected an accelerant inside the  
three-story brick building, and investigators hauled away evidence 
for laboratory testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a loud boom and the next thing I saw was flames  
shooting through the roof,'' said Terry Davis, 28, who was with 
friends outside a neighboring building when the fire broke out at 
about 3 a.m. Monday. ``We ran inside and started banging on doors 
to try to get people out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cook County Medical Examiner's office identified the dead as  
5-year-old Juanita Jones; Jackie Jones, a 6-year-old boy; Gloria 
Jones 32; and Juanita Jones, 53. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Paul Jakes, a minister and activist who counseled  
surviving family members Monday, said Gloria Jones was the mother 
of the two children, and Juanita Jones was her mother. Two other 
people were in critical condition at Cook County hospital Monday 
evening, a hospital administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said there were no smoke detectors in the apartment  
where all six victims were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakes said Juanita Jones was also the grandmother of a boy, then  
8, who was charged with a 7-year-old friend last summer in the 
slaying of 11-year-old Ryan Harris. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against the boys was dropped and a 30-year-old  
convicted sex offender was charged this spring with murder.

<HEADLINE> Fratello Fired As Cavs Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *JOHN AFFLECK   	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach Mike  
Fratello on Tuesday, and general manager Wayne Embry stepped aside 
to be replaced by Jim Paxson, the team's vice president of 
basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund said he told Fratello of his  
decision earlier Tuesday, nearly a month after the team ended an 
injury-plagued 22-28 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes from a coaching standpoint, teams need to go in a  
new direction, to be re-energized by new leadership on the floor,'' 
Gund said. ``We believe that is true with respect to the Cavs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Fratello's tenure the Cavs compiled a 248-212 record,  
although the team disappointed fans with a defensive style some 
considered boring. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello, who had one year left on his contract, was ``very  
surprised'' by the decision, Gund said. Fratello did not attend the 
news conference but issued a statement in which he said he 
regretted not being able to reach the goals he had set for the team 
when he took over six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``With injuries, we were in a constant state of change,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fratello, the Cavs made the playoffs four of his six years  
but failed to advance past the first round. Attendance at Gund 
Arena declined in this past strike-shortened season as the Cavs 
were wracked with injuries to starters Zydrunas Ilgauskas (broken 
left foot), forward Shawn Kemp (sprained left foot), and Brevin 
Knight (broken left hand). 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said the Cavs would try to replace Fratello before the  
NBA draft June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello coached for seven years in Atlanta then worked as a  
commentator for NBC for three seasons, earning the nickname ``Czar 
of the Telestrator'' from partner Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other move, Embry will continue as president and chief  
operating officer for the next year, but will leave the general 
manager's post, handling day-to-day basketball operations, 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry has been grooming Paxson for the past year to take his  
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Embry played in the NBA for 11 years and was the first black  
general manager in the league's history when he was named to the 
post in 1972 by the Milwaukee Bucks. He held the position for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavs as general manager in 1986, Embry also  
served in the front office of the Indiana Pacers for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who joined the Portland front office after playing with  
the Trail Blazers for nine seasons, had joined the Cavs to 
coordinate scouting and player acquisition and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson played at the University of Dayton and was a first-round  
selection by Portland in the 1979 draft. He was a two-time NBA 
All-Star with Portland and played his final NBA season in 1988-89 
with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as Portland's offensive skills coach in 1993-94 and  
later became assistant to the president and most recently served as 
assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Jim, was an NBA player from 1956-58 with Minneapolis  
and Cincinnati and his brother, John, played for San Antonio from 
1983-85 and for Chicago from 1985-89.

<HEADLINE> Oil Crisis Closes 400 Venezuela Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- A reduction in Venezuelan oil  
production has caused some 400 private oil companies to shut down 
and thousands of workers to lose their jobs, according to industry 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are facing a recession never before seen in the country's  
history,'' Hugo Hernandez, first vice-president of the Venezuelan 
Petroleum Chamber, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela, which competes with Saudi Arabia as the No. 1 foreign  
supplier of oil to the United States, has cut its oil production 
this year as part of an effort to prop up sagging prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The policy has been largely successful, with the price of a  
barrel of Venezuelan oil having gone from a low of $7 last year to 
a current price of about $14. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the oil sector has paid a heavy price.  
</P>
<P>
	Central Bank official Armando Leon told The Associated Press  
that his organization expects the petroleum sector to contract by 8 
percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past eight months, some 12,000 oil workers have been laid  
off, according to the Petroleum Workers Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil accounts for about 40 percent of all economic activity in  
Venezuela, and about three-quarters of the country's export 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez said the 400 petroleum companies that have closed were  
in the areas of engineering, drilling, well services, construction 
and supplies.

<HEADLINE> AL, Indians' Wright Hold Discussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jaret Wright and AL president Gene Budig met  
Tuesday about the perception of some that the Cleveland Indians 
star has a tendency to throw many inside pitches. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL apparently wants the issue put to rest because officials  
think they might have gone too far in announcing the meeting with 
Wright about his ``deportment on the mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I regard the content as private,'' Budig said. ``It was a  
meaningful discussion. The matter is closed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians hope the matter is closed for Wright, who was  
affected by the public announcement of the meeting last Thursday. 
Wright was hammered for eight runs and nine hits in a season-low 3 
2-3 innings in a 12-5 loss to Boston the next night and later 
admitted the discussion got ``into his head a little bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright, who likes to control the inside part of the plate, kept  
most of his pitches away against the Red Sox and paid the price. 
The Indians want to make sure he doesn't make the same mistake 
Wednesday against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jaret was really unfocused and distracted in his last start,''  
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``He has to compartmentalize his 
thoughts better. Good athletes are able to do that. He did not do 
that his last start because there was still a lot of stuff 
unresolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said the 75-minute meeting resolved most of those  
issues. Wright refused to talk before Tuesday's game against the 
Yankees, but Hargrove said his pitcher seemed more at ease when 
they left the league offices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good meeting, a good exchange of ideas,'' Hargrove  
said. ``All of my fears were put to rest. Beyond that, we agreed to 
keep the rest private.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright has a history of hitting batters. He hit 11 last year and  
four already this season. He was suspended for five games earlier 
this season for hitting Boston outfielder Darren Lewis in the head 
and he was called into Budig's office after hitting Detroit's Tony 
Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright also raised the ire of the Yankees in spring training in  
1998, when he broke Luis Sojo's hand with a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be able to pitch inside, but you don't have to hit  
people,'' Hargrove said. ``Roger Clemens does that as well as 
anybody. Jaret Wright is just a younger version of that type of 
power pitcher.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Calls Kosovo a 'Blunder' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan  
said Tuesday that the NATO attacks on Kosovo were a blunder that 
``may prove the ruin of the most successful alliance in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to set himself apart from his rivals for the GOP  
presidential nomination, Buchanan said George W. Bush, John McCain, 
Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes were ``virtual Xerox copies'' of 
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore when it comes to the 
Balkans and a variety of other trade and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican nominee next year must take a different stand on  
such policies or lose voters, he said in a speech at the National 
Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``While all are good and able individuals, all four endorsed the  
president's decision to launch this war on Serbia,'' he said. ``Mr. 
Bush, Mrs. Dole and Sen. McCain even endorse sending a U.S. Army to 
fight its way into the Balkans to occupy Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a citizen of the world; I am an American,'' Buchanan  
said. ``And I am not running for president of the world, but for 
president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing of Yugoslavia is unfairly targeting utilities and  
other basic services that hurt the ordinary people of Serbia, he 
said, adding the bombing campaign ``may prove the ruin of the most 
successful alliance in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is running in single digits in the latest national and  
New Hampshire polls of GOP candidates. But he said he's not worried 
about his distance behind front-runner Bush, the Texas governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're gauging things compared to how we were doing in May and  
June at this time in the last election,'' he said in an interview 
after his speech. ``There are far more people coming out. There's 
no doubt you don't have the explosive electricity you had in 
January and February of 1996.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett said there's a higher  
expectation for Buchanan this year since he was winner of the 
state's primary in 1996, but he noted Buchanan made the most impact 
in the closing weeks before the primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duprey, New Hampshire GOP party chairman, said Buchanan  
has more competition for the conservative vote this time from 
Forbes, former Vice President Quayle and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he comes up here, he sounds out his themes and he has a  
real good ear,'' Duprey said. ``He figures out which message 
resonates with voters and then hammers it out with a real 
discipline. Anybody who underestimates him is making a big 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan ruled out a third-party bid if he doesn't win the GOP  
nomination.

<HEADLINE> Court Refuses N.Y. Harassment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Having recently decided that schools can be  
sued under one federal law for failing to stop student sexual 
harassment, the Supreme Court today refused to clarify whether such 
lawsuits can rely on another federal law as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away the case of a New York  
girl who says school officials did nothing to stop her male 
classmates from sexually harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had refused to reinstate a civil rights  
claim made in the girl's behalf. It said her school district could 
be sued only under a law banning bias in federally funded schools -- 
a claim she already had lost in a jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Eve Bruneau said she and other female classmates were repeatedly  
harassed by boys in her sixth-grade class at South Kortright 
Central School during the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawsuit said boys regularly called the girls derogatory  
names and that the boys grabbed the girls' breasts, stuffed paper 
down their blouses and cut their hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit said Bruneau and her mother repeatedly complained to  
school officials who did little about the problem and refused to 
transfer her to another class. In March 1994, she transferred to 
another school. 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother, Pat Schofield, sued under a much-used federal civil  
rights law, alleging a violation of her daughter's constitutional 
right to equal protection. The suit also invoked an anti-bias law 
known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which bans 
gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in Binghamton, N.Y., ruled for the school  
district on the civil rights claim, saying Congress intended for 
such lawsuits to be filed under Title IX. After a trial, a jury 
ruled against Mrs. Schofield's Title IX claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to revive the  
civil rights lawsuit. Title IX provides the exclusive remedy for 
such claims, the appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled last week that schools can be sued under  
Title IX when school officials fail to stop students from sexually 
harassing other students. But that decision did not address school 
liability under the separate civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Schofield and Bruneau  
said Congress did not intend to shut off civil rights lawsuits when 
it enacted Title IX. Federal appeals courts have split on that 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The school district's lawyers said she should not be allowed to  
sue again because she already lost a sex-harassment claim based on 
the same facts. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Bruneau vs. South Kortright Central School District,  
98-1541.

<HEADLINE> Wheelchair Mom Charged Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who uses a wheelchair and was  
accused of endangering her daughter by cruising city streets with 
the girl in her lap has now been accused of operating the chair 
recklessly on a street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they received a complaint that a woman was forcing  
cars to swerve to avoid hitting her. Officers saw Kelly Dillery, in 
her wheelchair, swerve from the edge of the street into the middle, 
said Robert Runner, assistant police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Friday charged Ms. Dillery, 31, with being a  
pedestrian in the street. She could be fined $100 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was convicted of the same charge in January. In  
March, she was acquitted of a charge that she put her 5-year-old 
daughter in danger by strapping the girl to her lap and riding in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney did not return a message seeking comment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, who has muscular dystrophy, has said she sometimes  
has to travel in the street because not all sidewalks are 
accessible to her wheelchair.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturers Spark Inflation Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A report by the nation's manufacturers of the  
first rise in prices for raw materials in 16 months sparked 
concerns in financial markets that inflation is heating up. 
</P>
<P>
	The disturbing figures came in a mixed bag of reports Tuesday --  
the first monthly decline in nearly a year in a key gauge of future 
economic activity and a big drop in construction spending, but 
continued strength in the industrial economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in 
April -- a much stronger showing than analysts had expected and an 
indication that the industrial sector is strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
	Unexpected, however, was the rise in the association's price  
index, which jumped to 52.2 in May from 49.9 in April. It was the 
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were seeing higher prices for commodities ranging from paper to 
petroleum, the trade association said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report on prices rattled financial markets, which have been  
concerned that the Federal Reserve will follow through on its 
threat to raise interest rates if it sees inflation building up in 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down almost 270 points last  
week as inflation jitters grew on Wall Street, was off by up to an 
additional 150 after the manufacturers' report was released 
Tuesday. But a late buying spree left the Dow with a gain of 36.52 
to close at 10,596.26 even as broader indicators fell. 
</P>
<P>
	Although blue-chip stocks staged a comeback, the bond market  
retreated. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, a barometer for 
long-term consumer and business borrowing costs, edged closer 
toward 6 percent, reaching the highest level in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in  
Columbus, Ohio, said the purchasing managers' report on prices 
``caught the market by absolute surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it contributed to the view that ``the question is when,  
not if, rates will be raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;  
Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York took a wait-and-see attitude 
about the rise in raw-material prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it goes up from here, I would begin to get concerned,'' Ms.  
Schaja said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other economic gauges released Tuesday suggested that  
inflationary pressures, for the time being, are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group, said  
Tuesday that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators -- a gauge of 
future economic activity -- declined in April for the first time 
since June 1998, suggesting some softening in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department, meanwhile, said construction spending  
fell by a sharp 2.4 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline 
in more than five years for an industry that has been a driving 
force in the economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers, a group that represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for manufacturers, saw some good in 
the rise in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though commodity prices are active and rising, we must keep in  
mind the extent of the decline that they have experienced. Many 
commodity producers have had a tough time over the last year and a 
half and some upward movement probably constitutes welcome 
relief,'' said the report released by Norbert J. Ore, director of 
purchasing at Chesapeake Corp., and chairman of the Business Survey 
Committee of the purchasing managers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he did not expect the price increases -- which  
showed up most strongly in petroleum products, metals, plastics and 
paper -- to be passed along by manufacturers to their customers 
because ``there is still considerable excess capacity'' in the 
industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said the Index of Leading Economic  
Indicators fell 0.1 percent in April to 107.1, the first decline 
since June 1998, when the gauge fell 0.2 percent. A revised figure 
for March showed the index unchanged at 107.2 from the previous 
month following five consecutive monthly increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting a slight rise in the index.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the  
Conference Board, said that a single month's dip in the index did 
not necessarily signal that the economy's strong growth would 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at trends over six months before we have any  
concern,'' Boldin said. He noted that despite April's decline, the 
index was up some 1.3 percent over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like only a temporary pause, although last week's  
drop in the stock market adds some complications,'' Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Economist Jerry Jasinowski, who is president of the National  
Association of Manufacturers, agreed, saying: ``The mild decrease 
in the index comes after a long sequence of increases and is more 
of an anomaly than the start of a negative trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``Those waiting for the sky to start falling are  
craning their necks in vain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, which  
measure current activity, rose 0.2 percent in April, while its 
lagging index which reflects the economy's past performance, rose 
0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox Give Portugal Time Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox pitcher Mark Portugal is taking a  
few days off to address personal issues after struggling in his 
most recent start. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he had some things on his mind other than  
pitching,'' general manager Dan Duquette said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal will meet with management again this week, and Duquette  
expects a resolution by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal, who signed as a free agent in the offseason, is 3-3  
with a 5.33 ERA in 10 starts. He gave up six runs in three innings 
Monday, but the Red Sox rallied for an 8-7 win over the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	After that game, Portugal met with Red Sox manager Jimy  
Williams, then left the clubhouse without speaking to reporters. 
His locker was almost empty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Portugal met with Red Sox management to discuss his  
choices, but Duquette would not specify what was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has some personal issues that need to be resolved before he  
comes back to work,'' Duquette said. ``He's considering a couple of 
different options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Portugal appeared to injure his left shoulder during  
the second inning, Duquette said Portugal was not injured and would 
not be placed on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Rapp will start in Portugal's spot on Sunday against the  
Atlanta Braves.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Won't Whoop It Up Until Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres don't care about the  
trophy they won for making the NHL finals, their first trip since 
1975. The bigger one is all that matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't the Stanley Cup,'' captain Michael Peca said. ``You  
don't grow up working as a kid to hold the conference trophy over 
your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres refused to celebrate after eliminating the Toronto  
Maple Leafs from the playoffs with a 4-2 victory in Game 5 in 
Toronto Monday night. That earned the Prince of Wales Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest series will be the one against the winner of the  
Western Conference final between Dallas and Colorado. That series 
was tied 3-3 when Dallas won 4-1 Tuesday night. Game 7 will be 
Friday night in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have never won a Stanley Cup since they joined the  
NHL in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to keep it very levelheaded,'' said defenseman Jason  
Woolley, the team's leading scorer in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Woolley started the play that resulted in the game-winning goal  
by Erik Rasmussen with a pass to Brian Holzinger with just over 
eight minutes left in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres celebrated too soon after they swept Montreal to  
advance to the Eastern Conference finals last season. They lit 
cigars. They cranked up the music. They smiled for the cameras. 
Then Washington knocked them out in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lesson learned. Had it not been for the horde of media, the  
locker room Monday night would have been as quiet as a library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to the dance and we're not going to stand on the  
sidelines,'' Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff said. ``I think we still have 
something to prove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time Buffalo played for the Stanley Cup was in  
1975, when the team lost to hard-hitting Philadelphia in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres split two games with the Stars and Avalanche this  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody expected the Sabres to have a shot at the Stanley Cup  
this year, especially after goalie Dominik Hasek, the reigning 
two-time league MVP, was hurt in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo overcame injuries to key players and a regular-season  
slump. They made a mockery of the seedings, rising to the top from 
No. 7 in the Eastern Conference. They made believers of everyone, 
even their adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in first place in January, then they had some  
injuries,'' Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn said. ``They were probably 
underestimated by a lot of people because it's Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at that team now, they made some changes. They added  
talented players, and now they are doing things they didn't do 
before. They finish a lot of checks now. The Joe Juneaus, the Geoff 
Sandersons, they never finished any checks in their life, but 
they're doing it right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, captain of the Sabres during his playing days, demands  
that his players work just like he used to. That means they also 
hit and contribute in some way. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was a surprisingly swift five-game series with  
Toronto, a team that led the league in scoring this season after 
failing to make the playoffs the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Not bad for a bunch of no-names.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason we're still here is because of our depth,''  
said Sabres wing Dixon Ward, who finished the Maple Leafs with an 
empty-net goal in the closing seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the past few years, we've learned one or two lines and  
four or five defensemen won't win the Cup. We have 20 guys all 
going in the same direction.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Case Vs. Lewis Docs Is 'Slim' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge refused today to dismiss a malpractice  
suit against two doctors who treated the late Boston Celtics guard 
Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, the judge described the case against  
the two consultants as ``very slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith's comments came this morning as the  
defense's case was about to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants frequently ask judges for so-called ``directed  
verdicts,'' the equivalent of a dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was referring to Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman,  
not to Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the noted cardiologist and lead physician 
who cared for Lewis, who collapsed while shooting baskets in July 
1993 at the age of 27.. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis, the basketball player's widow, sued Mudge  
and the consultants, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated her 
husband. A third consultant settled the case for an undisclosed 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, the case (against Creager and Friedman) is very slim,  
but that's why we have jurors,'' the judge said after four weeks of 
prosecution testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultants' defense lawyers had suggested the doctors did  
little to care for Lewis, beyond administering tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said their involvement was greater than that, but said  
in Creager's case especially, the participation was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues in my mind are not black and white or clear cut,''  
Fremont-Smith said. ``A better procedure in a case such as this is 
to allow it to go to a jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993, and saw a  
team of doctors at New England Baptist Hospital. They diagnosed him 
with a life-threatening and potentially career-ending heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis then sought another opinion from Mudge, who said he had a  
far less serious neurological ailment that causes fainting spells.

	First American has struggled since acquiring Deposit Guaranty  
Corp. of Jackson, Miss., last year. The banks had trouble merging 
their operations centers, and the resulting errors drove away some

<HEADLINE> US Airlines Raising Domestic Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summertime air fares are heating up, with four large carriers  
raising their standard domestic leisure rates by 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines Inc., which moved first to raise fares  
Friday, was joined Monday afternoon by American Airlines Inc., 
Northwest Airlines Corp. and U.S. Airways Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental spokesman Ned Walker said the carrier's price  
increase reflected strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to carry record loads in many of our markets,'' he  
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel expert Tom Parsons predicted that Delta Air Lines Inc.  
and United Airlines Inc. would announce a 4 percent increase ``by 
the time travel agents open their doors'' today, followed by 
America West Airlines Inc. and Trans World Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives in Texas for American and Continental did not  
return calls today seeking comment on the fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
	If airlines hold the line on the new fare increase, it would be  
the third this year for a total increase of 11 percent on domestic 
leisure fares. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling for pleasure typically buy the leisure-fare  
tickets, which come with restrictions such as advance purchase 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, said business fares have risen  
3 percent so far this year and other increases could be planned.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Release Receiver Davis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys on Tuesday released wide  
receiver Billy Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing of wide receiver Raghib Ismail to a seven-year,  
$21.5 million deal in April made Davis largely expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, his first as a starter, Davis had a career-high 39  
receptions for 691 yards and three touchdowns. He also had 11 
special teams tackles.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A thigh injury might prevent  
Ronaldo from playing for Brazil in two exhibition games against the 
Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	The star striker, who plays for the Italian club Internazionale,

	Serbs Say NATO Derailing Peace  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Less than 24 hours before  
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic is to meet with 
international envoys, NATO bombing remains intense, and Serb 
officials are saying that means NATO wants to derail any peace 
efforts. Every time a breakthrough seems near, Goran Matic, a 
government minister who is believed close to Milosevic said, there 
is ``an intensification of the bombing that turns these diplomatic 
efforts useless.'' NATO, for its part, showed no letup in the air 
bombardment, striking Serb military targets across Kosovo and 
hitting several locations.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Time is winding down for the contract talks  
between companies that haul new cars to dealerships and the 
Teamsters, with a midnight strike deadline looming. The talks were 
already extended after a last-minute offer by the companies last 
night. ``We're making progress but it's going to be a late 
evening,'' Teamsters president James P. Hoffa said. Among remaining 
points of contention that Hoffa has said the union is willing to 
strike over are the companies' proposals to start new workers at 
lower wages and to hire part-time drivers.

	Jones Lawyers Want Fee From Clinton

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- President Clinton's proposal for what  
he should pay in his Paula Jones case ``would do little precious to 
redress'' his misconduct, a Jones representative said. In documents 
filed today, John W. Whitehead and the Rutherford Institute said 
the sanctions proposed by Clinton would be of little help. Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers have asked the court to order Clinton to pay almost 
$500,000. Clinton's lawyers on May 21 proposed that the president 
pay $33,737 to the court and other attorneys for Mrs. Jones.

Clinton interviewed potential campaign staff at the White House 
today. She also told at least two associates that she intends to

Clinton is virtually certain to seek the seat being vacated by 
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and is close to finalizing 
that decision. A senior adviser to the first lady said the decision 
is not quite final, ``but she's edging awfully close to it.''

to a U.S. federal court judge's demand that the Cuban government 
pay the families of three of four civilian pilots killed in a 
shootdown off the island's coast in 1996. The tribunal said that 
the U.S. government had caused far more death and damage with 
incursions into Cuban territory and attacks on diplomatic missions

	DALLAS (AP) -- The cost of flying is up almost 11 percent this

start of the summer travel season. The third fare increase of 1999 
is expected to stick since Northwest Airlines Corp. has gone along 
with a 4 percent increase levied by Continental Airlines last week. 
Northwest has been the stickler in the fare game for the air 
industry. Last year, more than a dozen attempts to raise airline

<HEADLINE> Baseball: Umpires Faulted for Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires erred in consulting a TV replay to  
reverse a call and will be barred from doing so in the future, 
baseball officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman said umpire Frank Pulli should not have  
used television to decide that Florida's Cliff Floyd hit a double 
and not a home run Monday in the fifth inning of the Marlins' 5-2 
loss to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said Pulli, who with 28 years is second in seniority  
among NL umpires, was ``acting in good faith'' but made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable practice,''  
Coleman said. ``Part of the beauty of baseball is that it is 
imperfect. Players make errors. Managers are constantly 
second-guessed. But the game is played and determined by two teams 
between the white lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed the drive was a homer because it bounced off the  
facade behind the left-field scoreboard in Miami. Second-base 
umpire Greg Gibson thought the ball hit off the scoreboard and 
called it a double, but after the Marlins began to argue, the 
umpiring crew conferred briefly, and Pulli -- the crew chief and 
third-base ump -- changed the ruling to a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals then protested, and the game was delayed for more  
than five minutes while Pulli studied replays on a TV camera near 
the Marlins' dugout. After consulting the replay, Pulli changed the 
call back to a double. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, baseball has relied on the eyes of the umpires  
as opposed to any artificial devices for its judgments,'' Coleman 
said. ``I fully support this policy. Occasionally, however, the 
umpires too will make mistakes; that is also part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, speaking in Miami before tonight's game, agreed with  
Coleman's decision. He said allowing replays would lead to more 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You set yourself up for it to happen again, and you're going  
to have tons of people thrown out of the game. They'll be arguing 
until they're green in the face,'' Floyd said. ``Most guys make 
history by hitting two grand slams in a game or something. I make 
history by hitting a ball that's reviewed on instant replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Bottenfield, the winning pitcher in the game, also thought  
replays were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never cared for it in football,'' he said. ``I'm kind of  
a traditionalist, and I'd rather not see it in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig agreed with his NL counterpart.  
</P>
<P>
	``Major league games are determined between the lines, and  
electronic assistance is not permitted,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins filed a written protest today, but because Florida  
would have gained only one more run if the play had been ruled a 
homer, it's unlikely the protest will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli said he consulted the replay because he became confused  
about the ground rules. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things went through my mind,'' he said Monday. ``I  
hope I don't have to go to the replay again. I don't want it to 
become like football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had replay from 1986-91 and reinstated it last March  
after a series of game-deciding calls that replay showed were 
incorrect. It is limited to out-of-bounds, goal line and possession 
calls and is based on a coaches' challenge system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intended for the crucial, game-deciding play, not the  
third-and-10 in the first quarter,'' NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA does not allow replays and the NHL allows it only to  
determine goals. College basketball has allowed officials to use 
replays to help reset the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, soccer's International Board rejected the use of  
replays by officials, an idea proposed by Germany and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious television doesn't take over the game by  
controlling the referee,'' said Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's general 
secretary and now its president. ``Football is composed of human 
beings, human frailties, mistakes and errors. We have to live with 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Witness:Merger Won't Hurt Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to soothe a judge's concerns about  
implications of the $10 billion merger of two of Microsoft's 
biggest rivals, a government witness said Tuesday the deal is too 
little, too late to pose a credible threat to the software giant. 
</P>
<P>
	The testimony of Franklin Fisher, an economist, clearly was  
aimed at easing misgivings that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield 
Jackson had expressed earlier in the Microsoft trial, when he said 
America Online's purchase of Netscape Communications Corp. ``might 
be a very significant change in the playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Final testimony in the trial began Tuesday, with the government  
using Fisher as a lens to focus the judge's attention on the 
Microsoft Corp.'s alleged aggression toward rivals and away from 
the impact on the AOL-Netscape alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc. currently distributes a version of  
Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser to its more than 17 million 
subscribers and is contractually obligated to continue until 
January 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher said that even if AOL were to distribute Netscape's  
software, which he described as ``very, very unlikely,'' the move 
would be insufficient to revive Netscape as a threat to the 
dominance of Microsoft's Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's too late, and I think Microsoft thinks it's too  
late,'' Fisher said. ``It's enough for Microsoft to obtain a high 
share of the browser business, and that they've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher testified earlier Tuesday that Microsoft's business  
decisions -- such as spending millions to create its Internet 
Explorer software, then giving it away -- were illogical unless its 
intent was to protect its lucrative Windows monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers contend Microsoft feared that Netscape's  
browser threatened to evolve into a system that could displace its 
flagship Windows software by running a new generation of computer 
programs using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft argues that it bundled its Internet Explorer software  
free into newer versions of Windows because it offered consumers 
technical benefits, such as the ability to ``browse'' a computer's 
storage devices the same way that people browse for information on 
the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent hundreds of millions on development of a product,  
and they gave it away,'' Fisher said. ``Microsoft documents do not 
say, `We're doing this to make a lot of money.' ... These are 
practices that make no economic sense on their own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft ``can't possibly lead to the recoupment of the money  
that was spent on the development of Internet Explorer,'' Fisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology, also derided earlier testimony by Richard Schmalensee, 
the dean of MIT's Sloan School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee, appearing as a Microsoft witness, argued forcefully  
earlier in the trial that Microsoft isn't a monopolist and doesn't 
behave as one. Schmalensee will take the stand again later this 
month as one of the final witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher said Schmalensee's focus on the entire software industry,  
rather than on the narrow slice that sells computer operating 
systems, presents ``a whole series of problems'' and ``muddled 
results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Fisher did offer that exactly how to define the specific  
market where Microsoft wields its influence is ``not a question 
with a very definitive answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible to disagree what the market is,'' Fisher said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also mildly criticized Schmalensee's previous testimony that  
Microsoft's accounting records were kept ``by hand on sheets of 
paper.'' Fisher wouldn't comment on the claim except to say that 
Schmalensee, ``with his usual good nature, was rather credulous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Tuesday's testimony centered on Fisher's economic  
analysis of Microsoft's business, which even Fisher conceded grew 
dry in parts. He prefaced one answer by warning, ``I'm not sure 
this is going to be the most exciting part of this day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You could always tell me it's a meaningless nuance,'' joked  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	But even as Fisher greeted Boies from the witness stand to open  
his testimony, Fisher clearly anticipated the aggressive 
questioning he faces from Microsoft lawyers later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Boies, it's nice to be here, so far,'' Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> Students Return to Columbine High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to Columbine High  
School today, some of them choked up and in tears, to retrieve 
belongings left behind during the deadly April 20 attack on the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students left backpacks and other things -- purses, glasses,  
keys, credit cards -- as they ran from the building or hid in 
classrooms when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers met outside with students who were in their classes  
when the attack began. Then, in groups of about 15, the students 
were led into those classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Galina Vol, who graduated last month, emerged from the school  
with tears streaming down her face because her visit reminded her 
of life in the days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing projects and just enjoying the last few weeks of  
school. And we just didn't get to finish it there, and I'm really 
sad about that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was one of the lucky ones,'' she said. ``I got out pretty  
fast. I lost a lot of great people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But although she and some others were tearful, most faces were  
dry. Many students seemed relieved, sometimes breaking into smiles 
as they hugged and spoke with friends, parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors and clergy members were on hand to help. Parents also  
were invited, though most students came by themselves, driving or 
walking to the suburban school. 
</P>
<P>
	``Myself, personally, I think it will bring a lot of closure to  
myself and probably a lot of other students,'' said Zach Pearsy, 
who left a backpack, keys and a jacket inside the school. ``So I 
think it will be good for a lot of us today to get back in the 
school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Vol said her visit provided no sense of closure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really see any hope for that,'' she said. ``It gave me  
a little piece of mind to see everybody one last time and make sure 
they're all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students were barred from some areas -- including the library,  
where Harris and Klebold killed most of their 13 victims and where 
their own bodies were found. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three areas are still off-limits. The library and science room  
are still a crime scene. The cafeteria is being cleaned up,'' said 
Rick Kaufman, spokesman for Jefferson County Public Schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for some items being held as evidence, belongings left in  
the library, the hallways or the cafeteria, where the shooting 
inside the school started, were placed in the auditorium for the 
students to pick up. Items left in lockers -- searched by 
authorities after the shooting -- were sorted, labeled and left in 
the gymnasium, Kaufman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold, both seniors, began firing shots outside the  
school as lunch period began on a sunny Tuesday morning, then 
charged in and terrorized their schoolmates with guns and bombs. 
They killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded 21 more before 
taking their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students finished out the school year at nearby  
Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Students who were unable to make it today will be allowed in the  
school Wednesday morning, but Kaufman said he expected the bulk of 
the 1,900 students to retrieve their belongings today. 
</P>
<P>
	The district will spend the summer renovating the rooms damaged  
by bombs, bullets and water. Construction crews were arriving 
alongside students. 
</P>
<P>
	``Other than the library, the entire school was turned over to  
the district today, and the cleanup work begins today,'' Kaufman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the dispute over how to memorialize the 15 deaths  
simmered as 13 crosses made a brief return to a hill overlooking 
the school in a Memorial Day tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter Greg Zanis, whose crosses have been the subject of  
controversy since they were first erected, put them up again on the 
hill Monday for a brief tribute. He then moved them to private 
property, where they will remain until a decision is made on how to 
remember those killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials have promised to build a memorial in Clement  
Park, but the design has not been finalized.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Pak Signs Contract Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Se Ri Pak, who played the Maxfli  
Revolution ball when she won two majors and two other LPGA tour 
events last year as a rookie, will finally get paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
	In her first equipment contract since turning over her  
management to IMG, Pak signed a three-year contract with Maxfli on 
Tuesday. In exchange for what one official said was the largest 
ball contract in women's golf, Maxfli got a piece of Pak's hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The hat is the most visible marketing tool in golf, but the  
front of it belongs to Samsung, the Korean electronics company that 
has a 10-year sponsorship agreement with Pak. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxfli settled for the right side of the hat, as well as the  
right to use Pak in advertisements, which should be particularly 
helpful in Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all my years, this is very near the top,'' IMG agent Jay  
Burton said of the contract. ``That's a reflection on Se Ri herself 
and how Maxfli views women's golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations are still proceeding with Callaway Golf -- Pak uses  
the X-12 irons -- although the Maxfli signing likely will change the 
structure of any deal. The only advertising space left is on part 
of her bag and the shirt sleeve, which would diminish the size of 
any contract.

	 *CAPTAIN JAMES:* The best way for a mid-40s man to get his game  
back in shape apparently is to become a Ryder Cup captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago while running spread sheets on his potential Ryder  
Cup team, Tom Kite finished second to Tiger Woods in the Masters 
and wound up 35th on the money list. By September, he raised 
speculation whether he would be a playing captain. 
</P>
<P>
	European captain Mark James, 45, has a tougher dilemma. By  
finishing second in the Volvo PGA Championship behind Colin 
Montgomerie, James moved up to seventh in the Ryder Cup standings. 
</P>
<P>
	James, who said he would not be a playing captain at The Country  
Club, is not ruling himself out. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the moment, it's still a bit too early, but I guess if I  
were to go on like this much longer, I would have to sit down with 
the powers that be and think about what might happen,'' he said. 
``It's better not to rule anything out, isn't it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	James is third on the European money list and has played on  
seven Ryder Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``His wife can captain the team and he can play,'' Montgomerie  
said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	 *SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY:* Mississippi volunteers at the Women's  
Open are serious when they say they'll give you the shirt off their 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
	Se Ri Pak arrived at Old Waverly Golf Club on Monday afternoon.  
Her luggage did not. Charlotte Portera, one of more than 1,400 
volunteers, asked Pak what size she wore and secured a volunteer's 
uniform -- khaki shorts and white shirt, complete with Old Waverly 
and U.S. Women's Open logos. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking more like a volunteer than the defending champion, Pak  
headed to the range to pound balls. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN EXEMPTIONS:* Andrew Magee and Scott Gump picked the right  
tournaments to play their best. Both finished second in $5 million 
tournaments, which helped them avoid qualifying for the British 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 50 in the world ranking and the top 20 on the PGA Tour  
money list as of this week are exempt from final qualifying for 
Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee is No. 43 this week. He was 50th going into the Match Play  
Championship, where he lost in a 38-hole final to Jeff Maggert. 
That's been is only top 10 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gump finished behind David Duval in The Players Championship and  
earned $540,000, enough to put him 18th on the money list. Take 
away that second-place check, which is $90,000 more than Rich Beem 
got for winning the Kemper, and Gump would be 87th on the money 
list. This will be his first time to play the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Others exempt from Open qualifying through the world rankings  
are Jeff Maggert, Jeff Sluman, Bill Glasson, Loren Roberts, Steve 
Pate, Bob Tway, Bob Estes, Stewart Cink, Fred Funk, Brandt Jobe, 
Dudley Hart and Tim Herron. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix Open champion Rocco Mediate also got in by being 20th on  
the money list. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STROKE CHALLENGE:* Corey Pavin lost a chance to win for the  
first time in three years with a blowup late in the third round of 
the Kemper Open and a 5-over 76 in the final round. He also lost 
his bet with Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavin wound up with 13 birdies in the Kemper, giving him 46 for  
the month in the American Stroke Challenge. Lopez turned in 14 
birdies in the Corning Classic and finished with 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Bayer Aspirin donated $1,500 for each birdie in May to the  
American Stroke Association. The total for the month, including 
$93,500 raised in New York's Central Park on May 3, was $233,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In five years of the program, Bayer has donated $720,200 to  
stroke and heart research. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OPEN SNUB:* Mark James may be debating whether he should play  
or be captain in the Ryder Cup, but the 45-year-old Englishman is 
crystal clear on one thing: He has about as much affinity for the 
U.S. Open as Scott Hoch as for the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not into the U.S. Open,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	James rejected an invitation to The Olympic Club for last year's  
U.S. Open. He says his decision was only affirmed after watching it 
on television. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a joke,'' he said. ``It was like watching people putt  
through hoops at the seaside. All they needed on the 18th was a 
little windmill.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland, in a deep slump on  
the European tour, has dumped coach Pete Cowen and sought help from 
Butch Harmon. ... Needing to win the Corning Classic to get into 
the Women's Open, Kathryn Marshall of Scotland led after the first 
round but then faltered. She still got to Old Waverly as an 
alternate when Lisa Walters had to withdraw with a hand injury. ... 
Flint Hills National Golf Club in Andover, Kan., has been selected 
as site of the 2001 U.S. Women's Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Justin Rose has more consecutive missed cuts  
(20) that years on earth (19).

<HEADLINE> Golfer Seeks To Defend NCAA Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHASKA, Minn. (AP) -- James McLean never thought he'd be this  
nervous as he prepared to defend his title at the NCAA men's golf 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, he didn't count on being without his driver, either.  
</P>
<P>
	McLean, the University of Minnesota sophomore known for his long  
tee shots, nervously awaited a new driver Tuesday after a friend 
accidentally broke his precious club at Hazeltine National Golf 
Course, site of this week's 72-hole tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``The driver's nonexistent at the moment,'' said McLean, who  
expected to get a new one by day's end. ``Definitely, I'm a little 
nervous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following Monday's practice round, McLean headed to the driving  
range, where fellow Australian Adam Scott, a freshman from UNLV, 
asked if he could borrow his driver to hit a few shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``He bent down to pick up a tee and snapped it accidentally,''  
McLean said. ``I didn't know what to think. Panic sunk in. He went 
into shock. He was really speechless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club manufacturer was on hand and went scrambling with  
McLean's specifications to get a replacement in time for 
Wednesday's first round of the four-day tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, it shouldn't take too long to get used to it,''  
said McLean, who is trying to become the first player since Phil 
Mickelson (1989-90) to win consecutive NCAA titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Even without the distress over his driver, McLean was preparing  
himself for a tough week in which he figures a 5- or 6-under par 
might win the title. Last year, he tied a championship record with 
a 17-under at Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean and Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar, who won the U.S. amateur  
championship two years ago and sparkled in the Masters and U.S. 
Open, lead a remarkably balanced field in which any one of 40 or 
more golfers stand a decent chance to win the individual title. 
</P>
<P>
	The field is so tough that top-ranked Joel Kribel of Stanford  
and SMU's Hank Kuehne, defending U.S. amateur champion, failed to 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say 30 or 40 could win it. It might be more than that,''  
McLean said. ``I came out of the pack last year and I wasn't 
expected to do it. And I'm sure a guy could do just the same this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McLean, Kuchar and the rest of the NCAA field, including  
defending team champion UNLV, will take on a 7,196-yard, par-72 
layout featuring big greens, U.S. Open-like rough and a reputation 
for turning into a monster if the winds whip up. 
</P>
<P>
	They did that Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't learn the whole course in a couple of days,'' said  
Paul Casey of Arizona State, who shot a collegiate record 
10-under-par 60 in the final round of the Pac-10 championship last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	The private course is difficult on so many levels.  
</P>
<P>
	``The length is definitely a factor,'' McLean said. ``The greens  
are hard and fast and they can tuck the flags away if they want to. 
And the rough's up. So, all that tends to make the course pretty 
tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The benefit for McLean and his teammates, who won the Big Ten  
title two weeks ago, is they've played this complicated course 
many, many times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely a little bit of an advantage, just knowing the  
course, knowing the greens,'' McLean said. ``But still, you've got 
to play the course and it's a tough course. You can't really get 
complacent out there because it will jump up and bite you. So, I've 
got to play it fairly safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And you can bet McLean won't be lending out that new driver this  
week, either.

<HEADLINE> Aussie Pleads Innocent in Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- A former Australian intelligence analyst,  
lured to this country and arrested in an FBI sting last month, 
pleaded innocent Tuesday to a charge of attempting to sell U.S. 
defense secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Philippe Wispelaere entered his plea through his  
court-appointed attorney, Nina Ginsberg, who requested a jury 
trial. The sandy-haired 28-year-old, wearing a green jumpsuit with 
``Prisoner'' printed on the back, stood silently beside his 
attorney during the seven-minute proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III set trial for Sept. 13 after  
Ginsberg waived Wispelaere's right, under the Speedy Trial Act, to 
have it begin in late July. 
</P>
<P>
	Ginsberg said she needed additional time for a ``substantial  
inquiry into whether the information (Wispelaere gave undercover 
agents) could actually aid a foreign country or be harmful to this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the agreement of prosecutor Robert Spencer, Ginsberg sought  
an Oct. 1 trial date to give her co-counsel, Greg Beckwith, time to 
get a security clearance and help review the classified 
information. But Judge Ellis settled on September instead, noting 
that judges in the northern Virginia district prefer speedy 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Wispelaere was paid $120,000 for nearly  
1,000 secret and top secret U.S. defense documents by undercover 
FBI agents who posed as foreign spies, lured him to Virginia and 
arrested him at Dulles International Airport last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Unmarried, Wispelaere is an Australian citizen whose last known  
address was in Australia. He told undercover FBI agents he needed 
money for a knee operation and other concerns ``involving 
females,'' according to an FBI affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
	On a single count of attempted espionage, he faces a maximum  
penalty of life in prison, or even death if certain conditions, 
such as disclosure of nuclear secrets, are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere worked for Australian military intelligence from July  
1998 until his abrupt resignation Jan. 13. The U.S. government 
alleges that six days later he walked into the Bangkok embassy of a 
foreign country, which U.S. officials would not identify, and 
offered to sell classified U.S. documents. That country tipped off 
U.S. officials and FBI agents set up a meeting with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said he sold 713 classified U.S. defense documents,  
including photographs presumably from U.S. spy satellites, to an 
undercover FBI agent in Bangkok for $70,000. He also mailed more 
than 200 others to a post office box the FBI set up in Virginia for 
an additional $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents had been shared with Australia under  
U.S.-Australian defense treaties, and the U.S. government said 
their disclosure could cause ``exceptionally great damage'' to U.S. 
national security. 
</P>
<P>
	Wispelaere is being held without bond.

<HEADLINE> Court: Juries Must Cite Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it harder for  
prosecutors to win convictions in federal cases alleging a 
continuing illegal-drug enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Juries in such cases must agree which specific illegal acts were  
committed by a defendant, the court ruled 6-3 in ordering restudy 
of the conviction of the alleged leader of a Chicago street gang. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not enough for jurors to agree more generally that a  
defendant committed a series of violations without specifying which 
ones, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer noted that the  
law has 90 sections describing various acts that could be 
considered violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The breadth of the law makes it more likely that allowing jurors  
to reach a verdict without agreeing on specific violations ``will 
cover up wide disagreement among the jurors about just what the 
defendant did, or did not, do,'' Breyer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless jurors are required to focus on specific details, Breyer  
said, they may ``fail to do so, simply concluding from testimony, 
say, of bad reputation, that where there is smoke there must be 
fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision set aside a lower court ruling that affirmed  
Eddie Richardson's conviction and life sentence. Prosecutors say 
that in 1970 Richardson formed a street gang on Chicago's west side 
called the Undertaker Vice Lords, and that his title was King of 
all the Undertakers. 
</P>
<P>
	He was charged in 1994 with conspiracy to sell narcotics,  
including heroin and crack cocaine, and with engaging in a 
continuing narcotics criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug-enterprise law requires proof that a defendant  
committed a federal felony drug violation that was part of a 
``continuing series of violations'' involving five or more other 
people supervised by the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the Chicago scheme involved thousands of drug  
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial judge told jurors that to convict Richardson, they had  
to unanimously agree that he committed at least three federal 
narcotics violations, but they did not need to agree on which 
specific offenses he committed. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial judge's  
ruling and upheld Richardson's conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	In appealing to the Supreme Court, Richardson's lawyers relied  
on a 1970 Supreme Court decision that said prosecutors must prove 
every element of a crime. The series of violations were an element 
of the crime and therefore jurors must unanimously agree on each 
specific violation, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration argued instead that the criminal  
enterprise law focused on a course of conduct, not the identity of 
any particular offense. Requiring jury agreement on which specific 
offenses someone committed could lead to defendants being acquitted 
even though jurors agreed that they committed a series of offenses, 
government lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled against the government, and ordered  
lower courts to consider analyzing whether the error should be 
considered harmless in Richardson's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Breyer's opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H.  
Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, David H. 
Souter and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the three, Kennedy called the ruling a ``substantial  
departure from what Congress intended,'' adding that it ``rewards 
those drug kingpins whose operations are so vast that the 
individual violations cannot be recalled or charged with 
specificity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Richardson vs. U.S., 97-8629.

<HEADLINE> National Spelling Bee To Go Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They've gone through dictionaries and gleaned  
word lists. One contestant has spent five hours a day on spelling 
drills. They've studied thousands of words since January. 
</P>
<P>
	But can they speed things up a bit?  
</P>
<P>
	In this year's Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee, which  
begins Wednesday and ends Thursday, a new policy will encourage the 
249 young spellers to move things along by giving judges more 
guidance in disqualifying the exceptionally slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very easy to lose track of time,'' said director Paige  
Kimble. ``We examined time and round statistics for the last six 
years and found that spellers on average were spending longer at 
the microphone. And we could not reasonably continue that trend 
without extending the length of the bee itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not an ironclad time limit, but if a speller pauses long  
enough, judges can request an immediate response, and then 
disqualify a speller who fails to give it. Under the guidelines, 
adequate times to spell words are 90 seconds for easier words from 
the first day and a two minutes for the harder words in the final 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	While few children take longer than a minute to spell a word,  
some contestants take four or five. One year, a speller left judges 
and the audience hanging for nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The competitors, ages 9 to 15, arrived this holiday weekend for  
the two-day annual contest that ends Thursday with a single crowned 
champion. They spent Monday and Tuesday getting acquainted with one 
another and with the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can sort of understand why you can't just have somebody just  
standing up there on stage,'' said Kyra Davies, 13, an eighth-grade 
speller from Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now I've been spelling words sort of fast,'' said Kyra,  
a national bee first-timer sponsored by the Kentucky Derby Festival 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've rarely seen a speller take so long that judges have to  
ask them to start spelling,'' said Edmund Gillett III, a 
14-year-old eighth-grader from New York City, making his second 
national bee appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmund, who has learned about 4,000 words since January, is not  
intimidated by the time factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``A minute would be the most time I've taken,'' said Edmund, who  
is sponsored by the New York Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the words come from the Paideia -- rooted in the Greek  
word for education -- a directory of difficult words distributed to 
spelling bee contestants. 
</P>
<P>
	Contestants in the national bee all have won regional bees to  
qualify. Those who pass the first few rounds today will compete for 
the championship Thursday. The winner will receive $10,000, a 
choice of encyclopedias and other prizes. Each contestant will 
receive a commemorative watch from Scripps Howard and a cash prize 
determined by rank. 
</P>
<P>
	A bee rule from last year has created a controversy of sorts  
this year. Jamaica, home of the reigning champ, has been banned 
from this year's competition after having sent spellers to the 
national bee two years in a row. The island nation has to sit this 
one out because of a rule requiring eligible spellers to have 
participated in qualifying contests held no earlier than this Feb. 
1.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Revokes 'Prozac' Dr.'s License </HEADLINE>

<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- State officials have taken away the license  
of the psychologist dubbed the ``pied piper of Prozac'' because of 
his aggressive promotion of the antidepressant drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Health Department's Examining Board of Psychology had  
charged Dr. James Goodwin with unprofessional conduct for failing 
to comply with a 1996 disciplinary order that he enter into an 
agreement with an adviser to monitor his practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In an order Tuesday, the board called Goodwin's conduct  
unprofessional and wrote that revoking his license is ``the only 
sanction that sufficiently protects the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 52, said he planned to appeal in federal court in hopes  
of winning back his license. He also said he would continue to see 
patients as a mental health therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin contends he has followed the wishes of the examining  
board, and he added: ``There are people on the licensing board 
running psychology in this state who are mentally ill and causing 
many of us problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin has been in practice in the north-central Washington  
city of Wenatchee since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, he attracted widespread attention for his  
belief that everyone suffers from at least some level of depression 
and would benefit from a combination of antidepressants and 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1993, the licensing board accused Goodwin of  
breaching patient confidentiality, diagnosing patients without 
adequate evaluation, pressuring patients into taking Prozac and 
retaliating against a psychologist who protested his treatment 
methods.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders Kids-Violence Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Modeling his anti-school-violence campaign  
after his assault on Joe Camel and the tobacco industry, President 
Clinton ordered a government investigation today of how the 
entertainment business markets violence to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of  
violence. And it sells,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years of studies, he said, have documented that by the  
time a typical American child turns 18, he or she has seen 40,000 
``play'' murders and 200,000 dramatized acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The boundary between fantasy and reality violence -- which is a  
clear line for most adults -- can become very blurred for vulnerable 
children,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million joint study by the Federal Trade Commission and  
Justice Department, expected to take up to 18 months, will examine 
industry marketing practices much as the government investigated 
tobacco ad campaigns that it determined were aimed at tempting to 
kids to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton held up ads for video games, one of which pictured a gun  
and promised ``More fun than shooting your neighbor's cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at some of these ads, it's hard to argue with a  
straight face that the games were made for adults in the first 
place,'' Clinton said. ``Advertisements have a particular role 
here. They have the power to egg children on and lure them in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rose Garden announcement today by the president and Hillary  
Rodham Clinton comes three weeks after the Clintons convened a 
White House meeting of movie-industry lobbyist Jack Valenti and 
five dozen of the nation's leading educators, officials, 
entertainers and gun makers to brainstorm ways to reduce violence 
among youth amid a rising tide of school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton cited a ``culture of violence that is engulfing  
American children every day,'' and asked: ``What kind of values are 
we promoting when a child can walk into a store and find video 
games where you win based on how many people you can kill or how 
many places you can blow up? '' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady quoted from a 1972 Surgeon General's report that  
documented how children imitate the violent scenes they see on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Attorney General Janet Reno: ``We now need to know more  
about how children learn about the existence and the content of 
violent material and why they are drawn to them -- whether it be 
movies of video cames.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to a White House background paper, the entertainment  
study will review ``whether and how the video game, motion picture 
and recording industries'' purposefully market adult material to 
children and only laxly restrict sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart called it a ``real  
serious study,'' but it was unclear whether the federal agencies 
would subpoena internal marketing memos and other industry 
documents. Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, 
said the FTC already has some subpoena powers and, while the study 
would be independent of White House control, Clinton envisions it 
looking beyond what is already in the public doman and into 
internal industry records. 
</P>
<P>
	A lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America did not  
immediately return a call for comment.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says Cyberstores Need Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cybershopping is soaring, but a new survey found  
that improved customer service would help take online sales to new 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
	Online sales are expected to increase to $18 billion this year,  
up from $8 billion in 1998, but only 5.75 percent of consumers who 
visit e-commerce Web sites actually try to make a purchase, 
according to a poll by Net Effect and published in today's edition 
of USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	And 67 percent of those attempted purchases are not completed,  
falling victim to the lack of real-time customer service and 
support, the five-month survey showed. 
</P>
<P>
	Net Effect, a British Internet consultant, studied two dozen  
companies, including Amazon.com, eToys and Dell Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer concerns included deliveries, returns and product  
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet retailers should consider greeting new customers to  
their Web sites and recognizing them on future visits and be able 
to move customers with questions from an automated-response system 
to personal responses when needed, Julie Schoenfeld, chief 
executive officer of Net Effect, told USA Today.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects CNN Appeal Over Raid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court left in doubt Tuesday the  
fate of a lawsuit accusing Cable News Network of violating a 
Montana couple's privacy rights because its camera crew accompanied 
federal agents who raided their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices rejected, without comment, a CNN appeal of a  
federal appeals court ruling that said the network should have to 
defend itself at trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week the justices threw out the Montana couple's  
lawsuit against the federal agents who agreed to let CNN accompany 
them on the 1993 raid. The court ruled last week that the federal 
officers cannot be sued because it was not clearly established in 
1993 that allowing such news media access was unlawful. 
</P>
<P>
	Logic would seem to dictate that CNN, too, should be protected  
against being sued. But a 1992 Supreme Court decision complicates 
matters. In that ruling, the court made it easier to sue private 
citizens accused of acting with government agents to violate 
someone's rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Private citizens do not enjoy the same ``qualified immunity''  
when violating a right that was not yet clearly established, the 
court said then, because ``the public interest will not be unduly 
impaired if private individuals are required to proceed to trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where does that leave CNN? ``The short answer is `I don't know  
the answer,''' said Lee Levine, a Washington lawyer who filed a 
friend-of-the-court brief for a coalition of news organizations in 
the Montana case. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Atlanta-based network said CNN does not  
comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still celebrating,'' said Henry Rossbacher, a Los  
Angeles lawyer representing the Montana couple. ``Now that the 
Supreme Court has denied review, we anticipate this case soon will 
go to trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The justices ruled last week that police violate people's  
privacy rights when they bring TV camera crews and other 
journalists into homes during arrests or searches. The court ruled 
unanimously that police who allow such access can be sued for 
violating the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on unreasonable 
searches and seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	But the court also said that violation of privacy rights was not  
obvious in 1993 and ordered the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 
to restudy the Montana case. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN could be expected to argue that last week's decision  
scuttled the entire case -- against the federal agents and the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	While last week's decision made clear that police can be held  
financially responsible for such incidents in the future, it 
remains undecided whether news media organizations also can be held 
liable. 
</P>
<P>
	Only governmental action -- not acts by private citizens or  
companies -- can violate someone's constitutional rights such as the 
Fourth Amendment's privacy protections. But private citizens and 
companies can be deemed to have been governmental agents under 
certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th Circuit court ruled in the Montana case that CNN should  
be considered a government agent because it engaged in a ``joint 
action'' -- one carried out ``for the mutual benefit of both the 
private interests of the media and the government officials' 
interest in publicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's appeal said the ruling ``will result in less public  
scrutiny of government functions'' and ``raises important First 
Amendment issues.'' The amendment protects freedom of the press. 
</P>
<P>
	``Journalists pursuing news for independent, professional  
purposes do not act under color of law, even when their 
news-gathering activities inherently involve making arrangements 
with government officials,'' the appeal argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court's rejection of the appeal left intact the  
appeals court ruling as a legal precedent in nine Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents raided the 75,000-acre  
ranch of Paul and Erma Berger after obtaining a search warrant to 
look for evidence that they were poisoning wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
	The government suspected the Bergers were using pesticides to  
poison endangered species such as eagles to protect their central 
Montana ranch's livestock from predators. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the raid, Paul Berger was charged with violating  
federal laws that protect eagles. But a trial jury acquitted him of 
all charges except improper use of a pesticide, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	After Berger's trial, CNN used portions of its footage of the  
search on the environmental news programs ``Earth Matters'' and 
``Network Earth'' as part of its coverage of government efforts to 
protect endangered species.

<HEADLINE>  Brack Had Everyone's Number at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, the final laps of the Indy 500  
came down to a simple matter of numbers and some long division. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and his pit crew, headed by feisty car owner A.J. Foyt,  
had the calculations figured to the last decimal point, and it all 
added up to leader Robby Gordon running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	And when that happened, it meant Brack would win the world's  
most famous car race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he would have to have to pit again,'' Brack said  
Tuesday, still aglow in his victory. ``He went in at lap 164. We 
went in at 169. To go 36 laps, you can't do it unless you have a 
bigger tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Gordon was equipped with the standard 35-gallon tank. So  
Brack was comfortable with his situation. It was just a matter of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to pit,'' Brack said. ``We weren't that worried.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, auto racing is all about speed so Brack decided in the  
final laps to step on the gas -- since he had some left and Gordon 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, after all, the possibility that, despite a fuel  
indicator pointing to empty, Gordon wouldn't pull in, gambling that 
a yellow flag would come up at the end, protecting his position. It 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had a yellow, obviously he'd be able to make it,'' Brack  
said. ``I was faster at the end. A yellow before that last lap 
would not have been so good. I was a second behind when he pulled 
in. It was a relief. After that, it was a cruise to the flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his headphone, Brack heard Foyt screaming, ``We won this  
thing!'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a payoff for careful planning by Foyt and Brack and the  
rest of their team. The Swedish driver was cautious with his last 
fill-up of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were economy driving after the last pit stop,'' Brack said.  
``By 193 or 194, we had saved enough to go faster at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was conservative at the start. I was leading. I didn't want  
to do anything stupid to keep the lead. We kept pace. I knew there 
would be more yellows and a lot of stuff happening. I stayed on my 
pace. I didn't take unnecessary risks at the start, in the middle 
or at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory was worth $1,465,190, the second biggest prize in  
Indy history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a race like this, you have to prepare every little  
detail, when to take risks and when not to take risks,'' Brack 
said. ``You don't win by taking chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how much fuel was left in Brack's tank at the end?  
</P>
<P>
	``About two gallons,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than enough, it turned out.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Hit More Federal Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spate of high-tech vandalism against the  
government continued this week, as computer hackers defaced two 
more federal Web sites and left a taunting note promising to attack 
other sites because of a related FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers from different organizations defaced Web sites Monday  
for the Interior Department and a federal supercomputer laboratory 
in Idaho Falls, Idaho, claiming ``it's our turn to hit them where 
it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the perils of open government,'' said Stephanie  
Hanna, an Interior spokeswoman. ``We try to make as much of the 
materials of the Interior Department as open and available as 
possible. The consequence of that is, those who choose to do 
damaging things can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the attacked sites suggest they were vandalized  
to retaliate against what was said to be the FBI's harassment of 
specific hacker groups, including the group that boasted of 
breaking into the White House site last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI confirmed it executed four search warrants last week in  
Texas related to an investigation into allegations of computer 
intrusion, including one search at the home of a prominent hacker 
in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, hackers claiming to be from another group defaced the  
Web site for the Senate, causing it to be taken offline through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also was forced to take down its own Internet site last  
week after hackers launched an electronic attack against it. It 
remained inaccessible Monday, along with the Web site for its 
National Infrastructure Protection Center, which helps investigate 
computer crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Interior's Web page, the hackers left a message Monday saying  
they were ``going after every computer on the Net with a .gov 
(suffix). ... We'll keep hitting them until they get down on their 
knees and beg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the site maintained by the Idaho National Engineering and  
Environmental Laboratory, a note threatened the electronic 
destruction of the powerful computers that ``serve'' pages on the 
Internet ``if the FBI doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have done worse, like destroying completely all  
servers,'' the note said. ``We can do it if we want, but hackers 
are waiting for Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an online interview with The Associated Press, the hacker  
claiming responsibility for the laboratory attack warned that 
further FBI investigation would result in more severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker identified himself only as M1crochip, living in  
Portugal and part of a group calling themselves F0rpaxe. The 
interview was arranged through a mutually trusted third party. 
</P>
<P>
	``If FBI doesn't do anything and doesn't stop arresting people  
and making our life miserable, each member of F0rpaxe will discuss 
an eventual destruction of every single server,'' he said. ``If 
that happens, everything goes down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``We don't want to proceed that way,'' and called the  
electronic attacks the ``only resource'' of the hacker community. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI in Washington declined comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted  
Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion. Burns 
reportedly is known on the Internet as ``Zyklon'' and is believed 
to be a member of the group that claimed responsibility for the 
attacks on the White House and Senate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was accused of breaking into a computer used by the U.S.  
Information Agency between August 1998 and January 1999. The grand 
jury also said Burns broke into two other computers, one owned by 
LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of 
Washington.

Open semifinals. Ten years later, Steffi Graf, Monica Seles and 
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario are going at it again. 
</P>
<P>
	All three, 11 French Open titles among them, advanced to the  
semifinals Tuesday, along with top-ranked Martina Hingis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is definitely a big achievement for us as veterans, though  
every time it gets harder,'' said Sanchez-Vicario, a three-time 
French champion, after beating Austria's Sylvia Plischke. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's 6-1, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3 win over Lindsay Davenport was the  
best match of the women's quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The first set took just 23 minutes. Then Davenport dug in,  
winning the second set in a tiebreaker and forcing a final set. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, a five-time champion in Paris, seemed to be breezing into  
the final four when she won the first set with a deft backhand drop 
shot that Davenport scrambled in vain to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the fourth game of the second set the match turned.  
Trailing 2-1, Davenport took heart after saving a break point in a 
close game of three deuces. She went on to win the tiebreaker 7-5 
with a backhand volley. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf broke in the fourth and sixth games of the final set to  
take a 5-1 lead, but again Davenport wasn't finished, breaking at 
love and then holding serve. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next game, Davenport saved two match points. But on the  
third, she couldn't handle Graf's serve. 
</P>
<P>
	``On clay, experience helps,'' Graf said.  
</P>
<P>
	The other three semifinalists didn't have to work as hard.  
</P>
<P>
	Sylvia Plischke beat Sanchez-Vicario at the recent Italian Open,  
but there would be no repeat Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was completely different,'' the 27-year-old Spaniard  
said. ``I played really well from the beginning, trying to stop her 
being in front, attacking the ball. I learned a lesson from Rome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez-Vicario returned whatever the Austrian could throw at  
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Down 2-1 in the second set, Plischke twice missed what should  
have been winners. Her confidence sank, and the defending champion 
went on to win 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, who plays Graf in the semifinals, said her 6-1, 6-4  
victory against Conchita Martinez was tougher than the score 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt my shots were not going anywhere,'' Seles said. ``I  
told myself, `Hang in there, there are going to be some long 
points, just run for every ball.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis lost the first two games against Barbara Schwartz, but  
stormed back to win the next seven, and the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz beat Venus Williams in the fourth round but made far  
too many errors to trouble the No. 1 player. Her double fault at 
match point summed up the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Austrian hit more winners than Hingis (27 to 23) but made 31  
errors. Hingis had just 13 in the entire match. 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis' victory had perfect symmetry: 6-2, 6-2, exactly 30  
minutes per set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I almost didn't miss anything today,'' Hingis said. ``I played  
clever. Otherwise, I would have been shut off the court.''

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Rules Error on Umpires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball told umpires to keep their eyes on the  
ball, not the videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpire Frank Pulli's decision to view a replay and change a home  
run to a double in Florida's 5-2 loss to St. Louis was wrong, NL 
president Len Coleman said Tuesday. Commissioner Bud Selig and AL 
president Gene Budig immediately echoed that view. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable practice,''  
Coleman said. ``Part of the beauty of baseball is that it is 
imperfect. Players make errors. Managers are constantly 
second-guessed. But the game is played and determined by two teams 
between the white lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball, the NBA, NCAA football and soccer do not allow  
officials to use replays, while the NHL permits it to determine 
goals and NCAA basketball allows it in a few specific instances. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had replay from 1986-91 and reinstated it on a limited  
basis last March after several game-turning calls that replays 
showed were incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, baseball has relied on the eyes of the umpires  
as opposed to any artificial devices for its judgments,'' Coleman 
said. ``I fully support this policy. Occasionally, however, the 
umpires too will make mistakes; that is also part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed his drive Monday was a homer because it bounced  
off the facade behind the left-field scoreboard in Miami. 
Second-base umpire Greg Gibson thought the ball hit off the 
scoreboard and called it a double, but after the Marlins argued, 
the umpires conferred and Pulli -- the crew chief and third-base ump 
-- changed the ruling to a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals then protested, and the game was delayed for more  
than five minutes while Pulli studied replays on a TV camera near 
the Marlins' dugout. After consulting the replay, Pulli changed the 
call back to a double. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said Pulli, who with 28 years is second in seniority  
among NL umpires, was ``acting in good faith'' but made a mistake. 
Coleman did not rule on Florida's written protest. Because the 
Marlins would have gained only one more run if the play had been 
ruled a homer, it's unlikely the protest will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, speaking in Miami before Tuesday night's game, agreed  
with Coleman's decision. He said allowing replays would lead to 
more arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You set yourself up for it to happen again, and you're going  
to have tons of people thrown out of the game. They'll be arguing 
until they're green in the face,'' Floyd said. ``Most guys make 
history by hitting two grand slams in a game or something. I make 
history by hitting a ball that's reviewed on instant replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Bottenfield, the winning pitcher in the game, also thought  
replays were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never cared for it in football,'' he said. ``I'm kind of  
a traditionalist, and I'd rather not see it in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida manager John Boles said his team found ``a document that  
came out in the late '80s from the commissioner's office that 
explicitly says video is not to be used when determining a call.'' 
Budig took a similar stance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Major league games are determined between the lines, and  
electronic assistance is not permitted,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig backed the decision, saying he was very concerned about  
the ``pace of the game'' but didn't want to talk extensively so as 
not to offend umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	The players' association said its position was still being  
determined. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players, while not supportive of an extensive use of  
replay, are not opposed to it for the purposes of determining home 
runs, foul or fair, above or below the line,'' said Gene Orza, the 
union's No. 2 official. ``But this is based only on conversations 
with a few players and we'll have to seek a broader consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the Major League Umpires  
Association. Pulli declined comment after Coleman issued his 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things went through my mind,'' he said Monday night.  
``I hope I don't have to go to the replay again. I don't want it to 
become like football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the NFL, replays will now be limited to out-of-bounds, goal  
line and possession calls and is based on a coaches' challenge 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intended for the crucial, game-deciding play, not the  
third-and-10 in the first quarter,'' NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, soccer's International Board rejected the use of  
replays by officials, an idea proposed by Germany and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious television doesn't take over the game by  
controlling the referee,'' said Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's general 
secretary and now its president. ``Football is composed of human 
beings, human frailties, mistakes and errors. We have to live with 
that.''

	Serbs Say NATO Derailing Peace  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO is continuing with its intense  
bombing of Yugoslavia, despite Wednesday's scheduled talks between 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and international envoys. 
That indicates NATO's intent to destroy peace, some Serbs say. 
Every time a breakthrough seems near, Goran Matic, a government 
minister who is believed close to Milosevic said, there is ``an 
intensification of the bombing that turns these diplomatic efforts 
useless.''

information. The talks were already extended after a last-minute

contention that Hoffa has said the union is willing to strike over 
are the companies' proposals to start new workers at lower wages 
and to hire part-time drivers.

members on the 52-member council, was elected on a 26-25 vote. 
Besides her party colleagues, support came from the Social 
Democratic and Labor Party, which moderate Catholics support, and 
the middle-of-the-road Alliance Party, which draws support from 
both sides of the community.

	HAVANA (AP) -- Saying that it has suffered in U.S. attacks over  
the last four decades, Cuba filed a lawsuit demanding $181 billion 
from the U.S. government for damages, the Communist Party daily 
Granma reported Tuesday. The lawsuit filed Monday was in response 
to a U.S. federal court judge's demand that the Cuban government 
pay the families of three of four civilian pilots killed in a 
shootdown off the island's coast in 1996. The tribunal said that 
the U.S. government had caused far more death and damage with 
incursions into Cuban territory and attacks on diplomatic missions 
and aircraft in the last 40 years.

the sanctions proposed by Clinton would be of little help. Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers have asked the court to order Clinton to pay almost 
$500,000. Clinton's lawyers on May 21 proposed that the president

	DALLAS (AP) -- The cost of flying is up almost 11 percent this  
year after another fare increase from the major airlines at the 
start of the summer travel season. The third fare increase of 1999 
is expected to stick since Northwest Airlines Corp. has gone along 
with a 4 percent increase levied by Continental Airlines last week. 
Northwest has been the stickler in the fare game for the air 
industry. Last year, more than a dozen attempts to raise airline 
fares failed because Northwest declined to go along with other 
airlines' prices.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Ordered JFK Coffin Dumped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Loaded with 240 pounds of sand and drilled  
with holes so it would stay on the ocean floor, the coffin that 
carried John F. Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington was dumped 
at sea in 1966 under orders of the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents released Tuesday by the National Archives showed that  
despite concerns over whether the casket should be destroyed, the 
government honored the Kennedy family wishes and took pains to 
ensure that the casket would remain in a watery grave. 
</P>
<P>
	The Defense Department even sought the advice of a submarine  
officer with special training in hydraulics to devise a way to 
airdrop the coffin at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, assassinated in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, was buried at  
Arlington National Cemetery in a mahogany coffin obtained in 
Washington. The first coffin, made of bronze and lined with brushed 
satin, had been purchased from Dallas undertaker Vernon Oneal to 
take the body to Washington. It was replaced because it was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	Its whereabouts had long been a mystery. And Kennedy  
assassination researchers consider the coffin evidence that should 
not have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents show that the casket was in the basement of the  
National Archives building in downtown Washington in February 1966 
when Robert Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from New York, called the 
General Services Administration, which oversees government 
property, and asked for it to be released to the military for 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it belongs to the family and we can get rid of it any  
way we want to,'' Kennedy told Lawson Knott, GSA administrator, 
according to a memo recounting the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I would like to have done is take it to sea,'' Kennedy  
told Knott. ``I don't think anybody will be upset about the fact 
that we disposed of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy family spokeswoman Melody Miller said Tuesday that  
destroying the casket was appropriate and ``in keeping with the 
tradition of President Kennedy's naval service and his love of the 
sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure that the coffin would sink, three 80 pound bags of  
sand were put inside, metal banding tape was wrapped around it and 
it was placed inside a pine box that was also wrapped in metal 
tape, documents said. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous holes were drilled in both the casket and the box ``to  
ensure that no air pockets would develop,'' according to a memo 
written by John Steadman, special assistant in the office of the 
Secretary of Defense. 
</P>
<P>
	One last precaution was taken: To keep the 660-pound load from  
shattering when it hit the water, two parachutes were attached to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 18, 1966, an Air Force van picked up the casket and  
transported it to Andrews Air Force Base, where it was loaded onto 
a C-130 airplane, the documents said. The plane took off at 8:38 
a.m. and flew over a calm ocean to a point approximately 131 
nautical miles off the Maryland-Delaware coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop point -- in 9,000 feet of water beyond the continental  
shelf -- was chosen because it was away from regularly traveled air 
and shipping lines in an explosives dumping area. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot descended to 500 feet and at 10 a.m., the plane's tail  
hatch was opened and the load was pushed out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The entire rigged load remained intact and sank sharply,  
clearly and immediately after the soft impact,'' wrote Steadman, 
who was on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving nothing to chance, the plane circled the drop point for  
20 minutes ``to ensure that nothing returned to the surface.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knott had cautioned Kennedy that destroying the coffin might  
``raise loads of questions'' in light of an upcoming book about the 
assassination. It was unclear whether the casket was covered by a 
law that mandated that certain items of evidence related to the 
Kennedy assassination be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department would have to authorize release of the  
casket, Knott told Kennedy, who had been attorney general before he 
entered the Senate in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was adamant and said he would call his successor as  
attorney general, Nicholas Katzenbach. Eight days later, Katzenbach 
wrote Knott and said the casket had no evidentiary value and didn't 
need to be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as the casket remains ... there is always the  
possibility that it could be misused or misappropriated,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents show that Oneal, the Dallas undertaker, wanted to get  
the casket back and display it in his funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
	Author David Lifton believes the government was wrong to dump  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dealing with evidence,'' said Lifton, whose 1981 book  
detailed medical evidence in the Kennedy assassination.

<HEADLINE> Environment Groups Urge IOC Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Three environmental groups today  
asked for a year's delay in choosing the host city for the 2006 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Three cities -- Sion, Switzerland; Turin, Italy; and Klagenfurt;  
Austria -- are front-runners for the 2006 Games. The other 
candidates are Helsinki, Finland; Zakopane, Poland; and 
Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss, Italian and Austrian branches of the World Wide Fund  
for Nature want environmental issues further examined before a site 
is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	The groups are affiliated with the World Wildlife Fund in the  
United States. They contend the Alps aren't suitable for events on 
the scale of the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no longer acceptable that Olympic ideals ... are brought  
to life at the price of the destruction of the environment,'' the 
WWF said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC panel will reduce the field of six European cities to two  
finalists in South Korea on June 19. On the same day, the full 
assembly will choose the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC commission is looking into ways of overhauling the IOC's  
structure and the process for selecting host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The WWF says the IOC is mistaken in choosing a host city with  
all the Olympic venues within close range. Instead, it suggests the 
IOC choose a host country or region, minimizing the construction of 
short-term facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said the IOC shouldn't wait until the 2010 Games to  
address environmental issues. The WWF wants to delay the choice of 
a site for 2006 by a year or two, allowing the candidates a year to 
produce revised bids.

<HEADLINE> Menifee Looking Good for Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Menifee, looking to duplicate stablemate Victory  
Gallop's success in the Belmont Stakes, had his final tune-up for 
Saturday's race, going 5-8 of a mile in a brisk 59 seconds at 
Belmont Park on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer Elliott Walden, minus the crutches that supported him in  
the winner's circle last year, said he could not be happier with 
the progress of Menifee, who was second to Charismatic in both the 
Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	``He worked very well this morning,'' said Walden, whose horses  
have finished second in four of the last five Triple Crown races. 
``He's a talented horse, and he's doing great. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing I can do about finishing second. I don't worry  
about things I can't control. Sure, I'd like to win Saturday, but 
all we can do is get him ready the best way we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under exercise rider Shannon Ritter, Menifee galloped out 6  
furlongs in 1:11 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little faster than I liked but he went easy,'' Walden  
said. ``It looks like he handles this racetrack pretty well.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ZITO LOOKS TO MAKE UP GROUND:* Like Elliott Walden, trainer  
Nick Zito has a history of second-place finishes, but in the 
Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Of Zito's eight Belmont starters, four finished second: Thirty  
Six Red (1990), Strike the Gold (1991), Go for Gin (1994) and Star 
Standard (1995). 
</P>
<P>
	``All I need is 5 lengths, not 20. Anyone know where I can get 5  
lengths?'' asked Zito, who Saturday will saddle Stephen Got Even 
and Adonis in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Got Even was 14th in the Derby and fourth in the  
Preakness, about 7 lengths behind the winner Charismatic. Adonis 
finished 17th in the Derby and sixth in the Preakness, almost 11 
lengths behind Charismatic. 
</P>
<P>
	Zito won the Derby with Strike the Gold in 1991 and Go for Gin  
in 1994, and took the Preakness in 1996 with Louis Quatorze. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FILLIES AT BELMONT:* Silverbulletday will become just the 21st  
filly to run in the Belmont Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Two have won -- Ruthless, who won the first running in 1867 and  
Tanya, who won the first running of the Belmont at the new Belmont 
Park in 1905. 
</P>
<P>
	My Flag was the last filly to run in the Belmont, finishing  
third behind Editor's Note and Skip Away in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHECK IS NOT IN THE MAIL:* Before the 1997 Belmont Stakes,  
officials at VISA had a $5 million bonus check already made out to 
Bob and Beverly Lewis, the owners of Silver Charm. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm finished  
second in the Belmont and was denied the Triple Crown and VISA's $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Charismatic, also owned by the Lewises, will be  
going for the Triple Crown and the $5 million bonus. This time, the 
check won't be made out before the fact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked them not to make it out before it's time,'' Bob Lewis  
said, ``It's like counting your chickens before they hatch.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FINISH LINES:* The Bill Mott-trained Vision and Verse had his  
final tuneup for the Belmont on Tuesday, breezing 5 furlongs in 
1:01 1/5 on the main track. ... Charismatic's jockey Chris Antley, 
who started an on-line investing newsletter before his return to 
riding this year, is scheduled to ring the opening bell at the New 
York Stock Exchange on Friday. Antley also gained the mount aboard 
'97 Derby and Preakness winner Silver Charm. ... Trainer Scotty 
Schulhofer said Lemon Drop Kid worked 5 furlongs in 1:01 2/5 
Monday, not 6 furlongs as clockers reported.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Controversy in S.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The new manual for South Carolina  
legislators has the Confederate flag in pictures on its cover, 
bringing about protests Tuesday from black lawmakers who want the 
book reprinted. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we send this out to our constituents, I mean they are going  
to really think we are crazy, have lost our minds,'' said state 
Sen. Robert Ford, a black Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 South Carolina Legislative Manual includes photos of  
the newly renovated House and Senate chambers. The U.S., state and 
Confederate flags are in the backgrounds of those pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker David Wilkins, a Republican, said the photos were  
not meant to offend anyone and were merely used to show the 
interior of the Statehouse. Wilkins said the House would ``look at 
the cost'' of redoing the manual, but he was uncertain if it would 
be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina is the only state to fly the Confederate battle  
flag, with its red background, blue cross and white stars, above 
its Statehouse dome and in its legislative chambers. Whether to 
lower remove them has been a recurring, divisive issue for 
lawmakers in a state where a third of the population is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Black legislators say the flag is a painful reminder of slavery.  
Those who support the flag say it symbolizes South Carolina's 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-Gov. David Beasley's attempt to lower the flag two years  
ago was resoundingly rejected by his Republican colleagues. The 
issue came back to haunt Beasley last year as he lost his bid for 
re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators had avoided the issue this year, although the Senate  
passed a bill providing for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday only 
after it also included recognition of Confederate Memorial Day. A 
House committee has refused to act on the bill.

<HEADLINE> New Fund Voices on the 'Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Any time you go prospecting for mutual-fund  
information on the Internet, don't limit yourself to the official 
World Wide Web sites operated by fund companies, regulators and 
trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
	New realms of data and commentary keep opening up at sites run  
by independent advisers who have no direct stake in the fund 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Befitting the Web's freewheeling reputation, these voices tend  
to be irascible, irreverent and occasionally downright wacky. You 
probably wouldn't want to use any of them as your sole source of 
guidance for setting up a prudent portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
	But at their best the independent sites entertain and amuse  
while they inform, cutting through the officialese you may 
encounter wherever sites operate under the constraints of good 
business manners and the securities statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Example, from Errold F. Moody Jr., who bills himself as ``the  
Internet's financial consumer advocate'' at www.efmoody.com: 
``There never has been, nor is there currently, any reason for ever 
buying an investment or insurance at a bank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moody argues that costs are usually higher, and the investment  
expertise of the staff lower, at banks than at more specialized 
financial services firms. ``If it was sold by someone without a 
true investment background,'' he says, ``you invariably are buying 
the wrong thing at the wrong time and at the wrong risk level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, you may or may not agree with that assertion. But even if  
you decide he is way off base, Moody's comments arm you with a 
measure of healthy skepticism for the next time your footsteps take 
you to a bank branch's securities and insurance desk. 
</P>
<P>
	At journalist Dian Vujovich's site, Dian's Fund Freebies  
(www.diansfundfreebies.com), the watchword is convenience. Ms. 
Vujovich has collected descriptive pamphlets, financial planning 
tools and other material offered free by many fund groups, and 
organized it all by topic -- for instance, mutual fund basics, 
retirement, taxes, and college planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the site also offers a directory of hundreds  
of funds' toll-free telephone numbers and Web site addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	The site that has made the biggest splash lately is Fund Alarm  
(www.FundAlarm.com), run by Roy Weitz, a Los Angeles accountant 
with both business and law degrees (``I have never -- I swear -- 
practiced law,'' he avers). 
</P>
<P>
	Weitz rates funds on a scale of No-Alarms (good) to Three-Alarms  
(bad), offers a ``bulletin board'' where visitors can post 
questions or reply to queries, and provides links to other Web 
sites of interest to fund investors, all salted with his trenchant 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
	``See what all the excitement isn't about!'' he proclaims at a  
link to a new fund research service that is struggling to make room 
for itself in an already crowded field. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime attraction of FundAlarm is Weitz's monthly commentary  
on developments all around the world of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, he threw jabs at laggard large-cap growth funds,  
``socially responsible'' funds, and funds run by big Wall Street 
firms. Of the latter, he said, ``funds sponsored by large brokerage 
firms have a bad reputation ... A review of this month's Fund Alarm 
database shows that the reputation is mostly deserved. 
</P>
<P>
	``On average, for every 10 times these funds are compared to  
their respective benchmarks, they underperform eight times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weitz also took a turn at dissecting the largest fund of them  
all, Fidelity Magellan: ``My, what big assets you have: Fidelity 
Magellan recently passed the $90 billion mark in net assets. Laid 
end to end, we have absolutely no idea how far 90 billion dollars 
would stretch ... But we have come up with some interesting ways to 
start a conversation, or stop one, depending on your social circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``--The technology holdings of Magellan are more than 3 1/2 times  
the size of the largest stand-alone technology fund, T. Rowe Price 
Science and Techology. 
</P>
<P>
	``--The utilities holdings of Magellan are 2 1/2 times the size of  
the largest stand-alone utility fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``--The single largest holding of Magellan (General Electric, at  
an estimated $3.6 billion) is by itself larger than all but 91 
domestic stock mutual funds.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial To Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As final testimony begins in the Microsoft  
Corp. antitrust trial, the software company is trying to convince a 
judge that federal intervention isn't necessary to keep the 
high-tech industry robust, while minimizing the ill effects of its 
past actions on competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The company wants the judge to peer into the computer industry's  
future, where Microsoft officials believe their flagship Windows 
software will face unprecedented competition from a raft of 
fledgling technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Government attorneys, however, are arguing that the judge should  
focus on Microsoft's aggressive behavior toward its rivals earlier 
this decade and on its dominance now. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial was resuming today after a 13-week recess, despite  
ongoing secret efforts to settle the landmark case. The verdict, 
expected as early as this fall, could dramatically change the way 
consumers buy software during a period when the industry is making 
huge technology strides and helping drive the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers from each side met unsuccessfully last spring to  
negotiate a truce and have met privately at least twice more since 
the trial began last fall, once in late February and again on March 
24. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lawyers remain far apart on some core issues after  
months of an acrimonious courtroom battle, such as how Microsoft 
can continue adding new technology to its Windows operating system 
without undercutting competitors that offer similar software 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The government and Microsoft each have identified three  
witnesses who will testify during this phase of the trial, when the 
sides rebut earlier allegations. Franklin Fisher, an economist who 
testified previously for the government, was to take the stand 
again today. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's most important witness will be Garry Norris, an  
IBM Corp. manager who will describe pressure Microsoft allegedly 
exerted on IBM to sacrifice its rival OS/2 operating system 
software during the early 1990s. That software competed directly 
with Windows until its popularity waned in late 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition last week, Norris claimed Microsoft told IBM it  
was charged a higher price for Windows in 1995 than other computer 
makers ``because you compete with us,'' and because IBM included 
what Microsoft called ``objectionable software'' from other rivals 
on its machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris also testified that major computer makers, such as Compaq  
Computer Corp., agreed not to sell OS/2 on their machines in 1993 
because Microsoft threatened ``to make it difficult for Compaq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what was considered a shortcoming in its legal case, the  
Justice Department was previously unable to persuade any of the 
nation's computer makers to testify at trial against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will focus its testimony in the coming weeks on  
encouraging U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to consider 
future competition to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the last courtroom testimony, America Online Inc.  
finalized its $10 billion purchase of Netscape Communications 
Corp., the Internet pioneer whose Web browser software competes 
with Microsoft's own Internet Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyer David Boies has derided Microsoft's emphasis on  
the merger as a sideshow, but the judge remarked previously that 
the deal ``might be a very significant change in the playing 
field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft contends that AOL, as the world's largest Internet  
provider, could resuscitate Netscape's popularity as the most 
popular browser, and that other alliances would fuel the 
development of handheld, wireless devices that don't use Windows 
and could displace Microsoft's importance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deposition last month with AOL Chairman Steve Case,  
Microsoft also suggested that future high-speed Internet 
connections for consumers threaten to reduce the industry's 
reliance on Windows.

<HEADLINE>  Olympic Committee Reform Talks Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Evolution, not revolution, was the  
theme as the International Olympic Committee opened debate Tuesday 
on ways to change in the wake of its biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was among several  
speakers who called on the IOC to be more open, accountable and 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	And several athletes, including speedskating great Johan Olav  
Koss, challenged the IOC to give a bigger voice to those who 
actually compete in the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the opening session of the IOC's new reform commission was  
also tempered by words of caution about moving too far too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates warned against radical change in a 105-year-old  
organization which has survived world wars, terrorism and boycotts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not feel obliged to revolutionize the whole system, as  
some critics inspired by commercial and political interests have 
requested,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. 
</P>
<P>
	Summing up the day's talks, IOC spokesman Franklin  
Servan-Schreiber said: ``We need to adapt and to update the 
structure of the IOC -- not destroy and rebuild it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday marked the first meeting of IOC 2000, an 80-member  
reform commission created in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which continues talks Wednesday, is examining ways of  
reshaping the IOC's structure and the process for selecting Olympic 
host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is expected to consider changes to the way IOC  
members are selected, including introducing term limits and 
reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are scheduled 
to be adopted at a special IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger -- one of 36 outside members on the commission -- said  
it was time for the IOC to ``adjust to new realities'' and be more 
open and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger suggested the IOC widen its membership to include  
outside groups on a rotating basis. He said the committee's 
meetings should be open ``as far as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest words came from Koss, winner of three gold medals  
at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the IOC determined to remain a private club or open to  
transparency and accountability?'' Koss said. ``If not, the IOC 
will remain the same, which will ensure further corruption and 
abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the democratically elected IOC athletes'  
commission, Koss proposed that 10 more members be elected to the 
panel and that all 20 athletes be appointed to the IOC itself. He 
suggested that two athletes serve on the decision-making IOC 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ctvrtlik, who played on three U.S. Olympic volleyball teams,  
said athletes ``do have a voice, but it's a small voice. If we are 
to have a role as a third pillar in the Olympic movement, we have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassiba Boulmerka, the Algerian runner who won the 1,500-meter  
gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said the IOC must change 
from being an ``institution of elderly men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes ``are the most legitimate people in the IOC,'' she  
said. ``We were elected. We should have the most power.' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
urged the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bigger is not better,'' he said. ``If the games get any  
bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must 
be restraint of growth or the games will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth said the IOC should ensure that money flows to those  
who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the Olympic movement is at the top of the  
mountain of sport,'' he said. ``At the next level are sponsors and 
officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Macaloon, an Olympic scholar at the University of Chicago,  
said the IOC faced a moral crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People hope the reforms produce an IOC that is the servant of  
the Olympic movement and less an IOC that sometimes mistakes itself 
for the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports and an IOC 2000  
member, said American athletes were suffering from ``cynical ... 
self-serving'' attacks on the IOC by John Hancock insurance 
president David D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company is a top-level Olympic sponsor, said  
Ebersol was concerned that the scandal would devalue his network's 
$3.5 billion Olympics rights package. 
</P>
<P>
	--Australian IOC member Phil Coles said he would clear his name  
when he appears Thursday before a special panel investigating 
charges of ethical misconduct. Coles is accused of abusing his 
position, most recently by passing memos and evaluations of other 
IOC members to Salt Lake's bid team.

	``How can we change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a member of the democratically elected IOC athletes'  
commission, Koss proposed that 10 more members be elected to the 
panel and that all 20 athletes be appointed to the IOC itself. He 
suggested that two athletes serve on the decision-making IOC 
executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will the IOC, who claim that the Olympics are for the  
athletes, support the athletes, empower the athletes, give them 
full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ctvrtlik, who played on three U.S. Olympic volleyball teams,  
said athletes ``do have a voice, but it's a small voice. If we are 
to have a role as a third pillar in the Olympic movement, we have a 
long way to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hassiba Boulmerka, the Algerian runner who won the 1,500-meter  
gold medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games, said the IOC must change 
from being an ``institution of elderly men.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes ``are the most legitimate people in the IOC,'' she  
said. ``We were elected. We should have the most power.' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
urged the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bigger is not better,'' he said. ``If the games get any  
bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must 
be restraint of growth or the games will fail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth said the IOC should ensure that money flows to those  
who really need it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me the Olympic movement is at the top of the  
mountain of sport,'' he said. ``At the next level are sponsors and 
officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Macaloon, an Olympic scholar at the University of Chicago,  
said the IOC faced a moral crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``People hope the reforms produce an IOC that is the servant of  
the Olympic movement and less an IOC that sometimes mistakes itself 
for the Olympic movement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports and an IOC 2000  
member, said American athletes were suffering from ``cynical ... 
self-serving'' attacks on the IOC by John Hancock insurance 
president David D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro, whose company is a top-level Olympic sponsor, said  
Ebersol was concerned that the scandal would devalue his network's 
$3.5 billion Olympics rights package. 
</P>
<P>
	--Australian IOC member Phil Coles said he would clear his name  
when he appears Thursday before a special panel investigating 
charges of ethical misconduct. Coles is accused of abusing his 
position, most recently by passing memos and evaluations of other 
IOC members to Salt Lake's bid team.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Tuesday,  
with the key index surging in Tokyo on a report that the Japanese 
government may suspend a national sales tax to boost the country's 
faltering economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained  
296.85 points, or 1.84 percent, ending the day at 16,408.50. On 
Monday, the average closed up 138.97 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares rose on a report by the Nikkan Toshi Shimbun, or Japan  
Investment Journal, that Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government 
may decide in June to suspend the 5 percent national sales tax as 
part of a new economic stimulus measure. The newspaper, which did 
not identify sources, said the announcement may come on June 16 
before the Group of Seven summit in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's denial of the report did not halt the rapid  
rise, while the report pushed hedge funds into the market, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were also supported by Japanese jobless data and  
expectations that New York stocks might advance later Tuesday, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the government said Japan's April unemployment  
rate stayed at the record high 4.8 percent, although a higher rate 
had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.11 yen in late  
afternoon trading, down 0.25 yen from late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks closed sharply higher, boosted by a late rally  
in reaction to a surge on the Tokyo bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 216.44 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at 
12,363.56. On Monday, the index gained 87.87 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices were little changed at midday in  
absence of any market-moving news before surging in the afternoon 
following the rally on the Tokyo exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways, which has canceled  
a large number of flights because of a pay dispute with its pilots, 
managed to climb back partially from a big drop on Monday. Cathay 
shares rose 2.35 percent to close at 10.90 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. 
$1.39) after plunging almost 10 percent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian shares closed sharply higher, with the key index  
rising 2.2 percent, as investors went on a bargain-hunting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index,  
which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 16.33 points to close at 
759.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed generally mixed, but the key index  
rose for a sixth consecutive session on buying by foreign 
investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 17.70 points, 
or 2.4 percent, to 753.72. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher in line with rises at  
key Asian bourses. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index rose 
8.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 461.79. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed higher on a technical rebound. The  
market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 81.05 points, or 1.10 
percent, to 7,397.62. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 36.82 points, or 1.8 percent, 
to 2,098.22. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed mostly higher, led by property  
stocks that surged on the steady softening of interest rates. The 
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected companies rose 20.49 
points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,440.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher. The All  
Ordinaries Index rose 15.4 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,915.6. 
</P>

out of steam in afternoon trading. The Straits Times Index rose 
5.02 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,908.88. 
</P>

	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed marginally lower. The

	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A ninth-grade dropout was executed  
Tuesday night for the rape, stabbing and strangling of a woman in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
	William Hamilton Little, 38, was convicted of killing  
23-year-old Marilyn Peter at her rural home 30 miles northeast of 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the woman had been raped, stabbed more than 19

two workmen who had come to install a clothes dryer at her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Little confessed to killing Ms. Peter but said the sex was  
consensual. He said he knew the victim because she had sold him 
marijuana.

<HEADLINE>  Kissinger Calls for IOC Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Henry Kissinger urged the IOC today  
to be more open and accountable as it tries to recover from the 
worst crisis in Olympic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The former U.S. secretary of state addressed the opening session  
of a task force assigned with recommending reforms of the 
International Olympic Committee following the Salt Lake City 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``There does seem to be a concern with transparency and  
accountability,'' he said, citing the worries of politicians and 
sponsors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger said the IOC's problems resulted from the massive  
growth of the Olympics the past two decades and asked the 
105-year-old organization to ``adjust to new realities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the IOC widen its membership to include outside  
groups on a rotating basis. He said the committee's meetings should 
be open ``as far as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kissinger is one of 36 outside members on the 80-member IOC 2000  
commission, which was formed in the wake of the vote-buying scandal 
stemming from Salt Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform panel is meeting today and Wednesday to begin  
examining ways of overhauling the IOC's structure and the process 
for selecting Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the commission is expected to consider  
changes to the way IOC members are selected, including introducing 
term limits and reducing the mandatory retirement age, which is now 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	The strongest words came from Norwegian speed skater Johan Olav  
Koss, winner of three gold medals at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. He 
challenged the IOC to clean up its act and give a bigger voice to 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the IOC determined to remain a private club or open to  
transparency and accountability?'' Koss said. ``If not, the IOC 
will remain the same, which will ensure further corruption and 
abuse of power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How can we can change the soul of the IOC back to where it was  
supposed to be?'' he said. ``What we have seen in the last eight 
months is the IOC has not taken its responsibility. ... The chosen 
men and women of the IOC have not been the right role models.''

full status in the Olympic family?'' Koss said. ``If it's not about 
the athletes, then what is it about?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games,  
said abuses in the Olympic bidding process extended far beyond Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salt Lake City is in my opinion is probably one of the most  
innocent bid cities in recent times,'' he said. ``You know that and 
I know that. The culture that caused the problems started in 1956 
and can be easily be disposed of by this body and current 
leadership of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth asked the IOC to curb the size of the Olympics.  
</P>

bigger, no city or country will be able to do it well. There must

officials. Toward the bottom are the athletes and young people. Why 
not become a service organization serving those people and turn the 
mountain upside down?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Allaire, chairman and CEO of Xerox, one of the IOC's major  
international sponsors, said, ``We expect the IOC to make dramatic 
and specific changes. Openness and transparency is a good starting 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol, whose network has a $3.5 billion  
deal for American television rights to the games of 2000-2008, 
defended the IOC against a ``perception that much is wrong with the 
movement and the movement is reluctant to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said there are people in the United States ``who don't  
want to listen'' to the steps the IOC has taken in the wake of the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian track and field leader Primo Nebiolo pressed for a  
greater role for the sports federations, saying the leaders of all 
35 summer and winter bodies should be on the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just here to push for power or ask for a bigger  
piece of the pie,'' he said. ``We believe we should be equal 
partners in this movement and hope to be treated as such.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the 42 speakers warned against taking any radical  
steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not feel obliged to revolutionize the whole system as  
some critics inspired by commercial and political interests have 
requested,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. ``The Olympic 
world doesn't need revolution but evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other speakers included former U.N. Secretary General Boutros  
Boutros Ghali of Egypt and Italian industrialist Giovanni Agnelli. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is divided into three working groups, is  
to submit a preliminary report June 20 at the next IOC general 
assembly in Seoul, South Korea. Final recommendations are to be 
approved at a special IOC session in December.

<HEADLINE>  Supplies Brought to Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's highly skilled  
astronauts turned into low-tech haulers today, toting suitcases 
stuffed with supplies into the international space station. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew must pack 3,600 pounds of tools, spare  
parts, computers, water and clothes into the outpost's two modules 
by Thursday, when Discovery is to depart from the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not real easy,'' flight director Wayne Hale said. ``Every  
single bag, every single item has got an exact place it's supposed 
to go, and the crew's been trained to put them in one and only one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It reminds me a lot of packing for going on a long camping  
trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Astronaut Ellen Ochoa is the so-called ``loadmaster'' of the  
mission, charged with making sure the equipment gets from the 
shuttle into the station. She stays inside Discovery, handing off 
the bulky, soft-sided suitcases to her crewmates, who do the 
carrying. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian astronaut Julie Payette checks off each bag as it  
arrives. 
</P>
<P>
	By this morning, more than half the equipment had been  
transferred and stowed. Some bags go behind wall panels; others are 
attached to the floor and walls of the modules with Velcro strips. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies -- which range from trash bags to laptops -- are for  
future station visitors, particularly the first permanent crew, due 
to arrive next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts delved into their moving chores after  
repairing several components aboard the Russian-built Zarya control 
module and the U.S.-built Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	After entering the station late Sunday, the astronauts fixed a  
broken data communications system aboard Unity, replacing two 
electronic boxes. The radio link was lost in April, four months 
after the module was hoisted into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the crew finished replacing flawed battery packs in  
Zarya and installing foam mufflers over noisy fans and ducts inside 
the Russian component. Permanent station crews could suffer hearing 
damage unless the noise is reduced significantly or ear plugs are 
worn. 
</P>
<P>
	The relative humidity inside Zarya rose to 60 percent this  
morning, partly because the air flow was hampered in one spot by 
the new foam mufflers. The crew took the sound-insulating material 
off that section of the duct, removing the kink, and the flow 
immediately improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight director Mark Ferring said the humidity always remained  
within acceptable limits. The temperature in the space station was 
also up this morning, to 78 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatches will be sealed early Thursday, and Discovery will  
pull away that evening. The shuttle is due back on Earth on Sunday.

	By this morning, more than half the equipment had been  
transferred and stowed. Some bags go behind wall panels; others are 
attached to the floor and walls of the modules with Velcro strips. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplies -- which range from trash bags to laptops -- are for  
future station visitors, particularly the first permanent crew, due 
to arrive next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's astronauts delved into their moving chores after  
repairing several components aboard the Russian-built Zarya control 
module and the U.S.-built Unity module. 
</P>
<P>
	After entering the station late Sunday, the astronauts fixed a  
broken data communications system aboard Unity, replacing two 
electronic boxes. The radio link was lost in April, four months 
after the module was hoisted into orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the crew finished replacing flawed battery packs in  
Zarya and installing foam mufflers over noisy fans and ducts inside 
the Russian component. Permanent station crews could suffer hearing 
damage unless the noise is reduced significantly or ear plugs are 
worn. 
</P>
<P>
	The relative humidity inside Zarya rose to 60 percent this  
morning, partly because the air flow was hampered in one spot by 
the new foam mufflers. The crew took the sound-insulating material 
off that section of the duct, removing the kink, and the flow 
immediately improved. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight director Mark Ferring said the humidity always remained  
within acceptable limits. The temperature in the space station was 
also up this morning, to 78 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	The hatches will be sealed early Thursday, and Discovery will  
pull away that evening. The shuttle is due back on Earth on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Chancellor Sells Billboard Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chancellor Media Corp. is selling its outdoor  
advertising business to Lamar Advertising Co. for $1.6 billion, 
leaving Chancellor to focus on its sizable radio holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash-and-stock deal will leave Chancellor, soon to be  
renamed AMFM Inc., with a 30 percent stake in Lamar, a leading 
out-of-home advertising company based in Baton Rouge, La. 
Chancellor plans to use some of the proceeds to pay down debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor's move to get out of outdoor ads comes just days  
after its main rival in the radio business, the Infinity 
Broadcasting subsidiary of CBS Corp., made a move in the opposite 
direction. Last Thursday, Infinity agreed to buy the nation's 
leading outdoor advertising firm, Outdoor Systems, for $6.5 billion 
in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS is hoping that the addition of a major outdoor advertising  
outlet will increase its clout with advertisers, allowing it to 
offer packages of ads spanning network TV, radio, and advertising 
on billboards and public transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chancellor is going the other way, choosing instead to work  
on its massive radio portfolio of some 465 stations across the 
country. In terms of revenue, Chancellor is the largest U.S. radio 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agreement enables Chancellor's senior operating management  
team to focus on our industry-leading radio station portfolio,'' 
Chancellor chairman Thomas O. Hicks said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Chancellor's outdoor business will give Lamar  
some 118,500 advertising display faces, making it a major player in 
the outdoor advertising industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Another major radio company, Clear Channel Communications of San  
Antonio, also has a large presence in outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors gave the deal a thumbs-up. Lamar's shares jumped  
$2.93 3/4, or 9 percent, to $37.06 1/4 while Chancellor's shares rose 18 3/4 
cents to $51. Both trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Hit More Federal Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A spate of high-tech vandalism against the  
government continued this week, as computer hackers defaced two 
more federal Web sites and left a taunting note promising to attack 
other sites because of a related FBI investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers from different organizations defaced Web sites Monday  
for the Interior Department and a federal supercomputer laboratory 
in Idaho Falls, Idaho, claiming ``it's our turn to hit them where 
it hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the perils of open government,'' said Stephanie  
Hanna, an Interior spokeswoman. ``We try to make as much of the 
materials of the Interior Department as open and available as 
possible. The consequence of that is, those who choose to do 
damaging things can do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the attacked sites suggest they were vandalized  
to retaliate against what was said to be the FBI's harassment of 
specific hacker groups, including the group that boasted of 
breaking into the White House site last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI confirmed it executed four search warrants last week in  
Texas related to an investigation into allegations of computer 
intrusion, including one search at the home of a prominent hacker 
in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, hackers claiming to be from another group defaced the  
Web site for the Senate, causing it to be taken offline through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI also was forced to take down its own Internet site last  
week after hackers launched an electronic attack against it. It 
remained inaccessible Monday, along with the Web site for its 
National Infrastructure Protection Center, which helps investigate 
computer crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Interior's Web page, the hackers left a message Monday saying  
they were ``going after every computer on the Net with a .gov 
(suffix). ... We'll keep hitting them until they get down on their 
knees and beg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the site maintained by the Idaho National Engineering and  
Environmental Laboratory, a note threatened the electronic 
destruction of the powerful computers that ``serve'' pages on the 
Internet ``if the FBI doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have done worse, like destroying completely all  
servers,'' the note said. ``We can do it if we want, but hackers 
are waiting for Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an online interview with The Associated Press, the hacker  
claiming responsibility for the laboratory attack warned that 
further FBI investigation would result in more severe damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The hacker identified himself only as M1crochip, living in  
Portugal and part of a group calling themselves F0rpaxe. The 
interview was arranged through a mutually trusted third party. 
</P>
<P>
	``If FBI doesn't do anything and doesn't stop arresting people  
and making our life miserable, each member of F0rpaxe will discuss 
an eventual destruction of every single server,'' he said. ``If 
that happens, everything goes down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``We don't want to proceed that way,'' and called the  
electronic attacks the ``only resource'' of the hacker community. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI in Washington declined comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted  
Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion. Burns 
reportedly is known on the Internet as ``Zyklon'' and is believed 
to be a member of the group that claimed responsibility for the 
attacks on the White House and Senate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was accused of breaking into a computer used by the U.S.  
Information Agency between August 1998 and January 1999. The grand 
jury also said Burns broke into two other computers, one owned by 
LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of 
Washington.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 104.37 on Economic News / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as a new report on the  
growing U.S. economy intensified traders' fears about inflation and 
higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 104.37 at 10,455.37. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was down 15.23 at 1,286.61, and the Nasdaq 
composite index was down 38.01 at 2,432.51. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about inflation, which have increased the market's  
volatility over the past two weeks, were behind today's decline as 
well. Prices dropped after the National Association of Purchasing 
Management said the nation's industrial economy expanded for a 
fourth straight month in May. The report, which gauges the health 
of the nation's factories, was much stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAPM's report is widely followed by economists because it  
usually provides the first indication of how the economy performed 
in the just-ended month. Today's report was highly anticipated as 
traders sought a sign that the economy is not overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the report, which revealed strong price rises in raw  
materials for the first time in 16 months, sent stocks skidding. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all the skittishness about inflation, the real surprise  
from this report is that we didn't drop even farther, even 
faster,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also pressured bond prices. The 30-year Treasury bond  
plunged, sending its yield up to 5.91 percent from late Friday's 
5.83 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock traders are increasingly worried that rising inflation  
will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, leading to 
higher corporate borrowing costs and lower profits. Rising rates 
also make bonds a more attractive investment alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	Another report released today suggested some softening in the  
economy, but the news wasn't enough to offset the effects of the 
purchasing managers' survey. The Index of Leading Economic 
Indicators fell 0.1 percent in April, its first decline since June 
1998, according to the Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks led today's decline, as IBM fell 3 11/16 to  
112 5/16. Hewlett Packard fell 2 7/8 to 91 7/16 after an analyst at 
Banc of America Securities downgraded its stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Telebanc Financial Corporation shot up 9 3/4 to 76 1/4 on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market after online brokerage ETrade said it will acquire 
Telebanc to create an Internet-based financial services company. 
ETrade fell 3 11/16 to 40 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 13-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 291.7 million 
shares, slightly behind Friday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 5.94 at 616.32, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 6.81 at 771.93.

<HEADLINE> Court Reinstates Hubbell Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court reinstated a criminal  
charge Tuesday alleging that presidential friend Webster Hubbell 
engaged in a scheme to conceal his and Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
legal work on a fraudulent Arkansas land deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 decision that was a win for Independent Counsel Kenneth  
Starr, the appeals court rejected Hubbell's argument that one of 15 
charges against him should be dismissed as too vague. His trial is 
to begin Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	An 85-paragraph section of the indictment enumerates some 50  
alleged lies by Hubbell over a six-year span to regulators from the 
Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be the case that the more elaborate the scheme or  
the more numerous the acts of concealment, the less able the 
government is to charge a crime,'' said the court decision. The 
judges were Stephen Williams and Laurence Silberman, Republican 
appointees, and David Tatel, a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hubbell's ... argument that the indictment fails to give  
sufficient notice because it provides too much detail is, to be 
charitable, unconvincing,'' the court added. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge James Robertson had ruled that the  
allegations against Hubbell were not specific enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators say the land development involved, a  
1,050-acre tract south of Little Rock called Castle Grande, was 
riddled with insider dealing and fictitious sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The project was owned by Mrs. Clinton's former Whitewater  
partner, Jim McDougal, and Hubbell's father-in-law, Seth Ward. Mrs. 
Clinton has testified repeatedly that she remembers almost nothing 
of her work on Castle Grande in 1985-86. Her work on the project 
was disclosed when her missing law firm billing records turned up 
in the White House family residence in 1996 under still-unexplained 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Castle Grande cost McDougal's savings and loan close to $4  
million. The government eventually took over the failing 
institution at a cost to taxpayers of $65 million.

<HEADLINE>  Fratello Fired As Cavs Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mike Fratello has been the master of  
slow-paced, half-court basketball and the ``Czar of the 
Telestrator.'' He was never the coach of a playoff winner in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's out of a job.  
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund, looking for new blood, more wins  
and more fans in the arena that bears his name, dumped Fratello a 
month after the team ended an injury-plagued 22-28 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello was fired Tuesday as part of a shakeup in which general  
manager Wayne Embry stepped aside to be replaced by Jim Paxson, the 
team's vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello still has a year left on his contract, which the Cavs  
will buy out. His reaction to the news: ``I think shocked,'' Gund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes from a coaching standpoint, teams need to go in a  
new direction, to be re-energized by new leadership on the floor,'' 
Gund said. ``We believe that is true with respect to the Cavs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Fratello's six-year tenure, the Cavs compiled a 248-212  
record and made the playoffs four times. But Cleveland's playoff 
record was just 2-12 during that time and the Cavs never made it 
out of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello's teams always seemed to be playing hurt, playing slow  
or both. 
</P>
<P>
	When injuries took out stars like Brad Daugherty in his early  
years, Fratello employed a defensive, use-the-shot-clock style that 
set records for points allowed and made the most of thin rosters. 
But some fans got bored in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked better going into last season, as Cleveland  
featured a young team that had surpassed expectations by reaching 
the playoffs in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the injury bug hit again. Starters Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
(broken left foot), forward Shawn Kemp (sprained left foot), and 
Brevin Knight (broken left hand) were out by the end of the 
strike-shortened year. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at Gund Arena dropped from an average of 16,942 in  
1997-98 to 14,120 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With injuries,'' Fratello said in a statement released by the  
team, ``we were in a constant state of change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello, 52, did not attend a news conference where Gund  
announced the front office changes. But in his statement he thanked 
the Cavs and said he regretted not being able to reach the goals he 
had set for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund said repeatedly he didn't blame Fratello for the Cavs'  
performance this year and the team's style of play was not the 
reason he fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked what will bring fans back, Gund said ``I think  
winning has a lot to do with it. And I hope if they see an 
exciting, fast-paced game that will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said the Cavs would try to replace Fratello before the  
NBA draft on June 30. Gund, Embry and Paxson would not speculate on 
who the candidates will be to replace Fratello. The criteria for 
the new coach were still being drawn up, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello coached for seven years in Atlanta then worked as a  
commentator for NBC for three seasons, earning the nickname ``Czar 
of the Telestrator'' from partner Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other move, Embry will continue as president and chief  
operating officer for the next year, but will leave the general 
manager's post, handling day-to-day basketball operations, 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, 62, has been grooming the 41-year-old Paxson for the past  
year to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Embry played in the NBA for 11 years and was the first black  
general manager in the league's history when he was named to the 
post in 1972 by the Milwaukee Bucks. He held the position for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavs as general manager in 1986, Embry also  
served in the front office of the Indiana Pacers for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who joined the Portland front office after playing with  
the Trail Blazers for nine seasons, had joined the Cavs to 
coordinate scouting and player acquisition and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson played at the University of Dayton and was a first-round  
selection by Portland in the 1979 draft. He was a two-time NBA 
All-Star with Portland and played his final NBA season in 1989-90 
with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as Portland's offensive skills coach in 1993-94 and  
later became assistant to the president and most recently served as 
assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Jim, was an NBA player from 1956-58 with Minneapolis  
and Cincinnati and his brother, John, played for San Antonio from 
1983-85 and for Chicago from 1985-94.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Iraq Businessman's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Police have asked the FBI to look into  
the international connections of an Iraqi-American with business 
dealings in Iraq who was murdered along with his wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
	Police alerted by an anonymous call on Friday found the bodies  
of Fuad Khazi Taima, 63; his wife, Dorothy Mae, 54; and son, Leith, 
16, in their home in McLean, a Washington suburb. All had died of 
gunshots to the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no sign of forced entry and it was not a  
murder-suicide or robbery, said Fairfax County Police spokeswoman 
Katie Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	Taima traveled frequently to Iraq, and the FBI was called in  
because of his international dealings, Ms. Hughes said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears they were targeted,'' she said. ``We're not  
alluding to who would have targeted them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Susan Lloyd said federal agents were ``checking  
various intelligence sources,'' but she refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither police nor the FBI would cite any motive for the  
killings, and neither would comment on news reports that they were 
looking into whether the crime involved either the Iraqi government 
or its opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Taima was prominent in the Iraqi-American community as founder  
of the American-Iraqi Foundation, which aimed at improving 
U.S.-Iraqi relations during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post reported Tuesday that Taima had told  
colleagues he recently visited Iraq and landed a large business 
deal. Details of the reported deal were not immediately known. The 
Post said he had worked as a consultant in oil and high technology 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly possible that he was engaged in some type of  
commercial deal with the Iraqi government that went bad,'' said 
Michael Hudson, a Georgetown University professor with the Center 
for Contemporary Arab Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed Chalabi, the Washington representative of the opposition

but said the murders fit the pattern of killings carried out by 
Iraqi government agents.

<HEADLINE> Canada Funeral Co. Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- The Loewen Group Inc., which ran up huge  
debts in expanding its funeral business in the United States, on 
Tuesday sought Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors for 
itself and about 870 of its U.S. subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian-based funeral services company applied to  
reorganize its debts under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
and under Canadian law. 
</P>
<P>
	Although based in Vancouver, British Columbia, the company  
derives 90 percent of its revenue from U.S. operations. The company 
operates in the United States under the name Loewen Group 
International Inc. Loewen's United Kingdom subsidiaries, which 
generate less than 1 percent of its revenues, were excluded from 
the filings. 
</P>
<P>
	John S. Lacey, the chairman of Loewen, said the company will  
honor all of its outstanding contracts for prepaid funeral services 
at 1,100 funeral homes and 400 cemeteries in the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our clients should ... be assured that monies held in trust  
accounts for pre-need contracts are secure and protected by state 
and provincial regulations,'' Lacey said in a statement. ``It is 
the company's intent to continue operations without interruption,'' 
Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loewen said its American subsidiaries have a commitment of $200  
million from First Union National Bank to cover trade and employee 
obligations and other cash needs during the court-supervised 
attempt to restructure its debt. 
</P>
<P>
	It petitioned the U.S. court Tuesday to receive $23 million of  
those funds immediately. Loewen said its Canadian operations ``have 
sufficient liquidity to fund daily operations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loewen has long been struggling to make payments on more than $2  
billion of debt that it took on to finance aggressive acquisition 
of cemetery space in the United States. Tuesday's action came as a 
$17 million interest payment came due. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy filing buys the company time to return to its  
focus as a funeral service company with some ancillary cemetery 
operations, Lacey said. The company also said it has suspended any 
new acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Tuesday before Chief Judge Joseph Farnan of the  
U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Bradley Stam, senior vice 
president in the law department of Loewen, said the company does 
not have any immediate plans to lay off any of its staff of 13,000 
but would review some of its operations for potential layoffs in 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
	According to papers filed with the court, Loewen earned $190  
million in 1998 but paid out $187 million of that in interest on 
long-term debt incurred by previous management. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will emerge sooner rather than later'' from bankruptcy,  
said Richard Cieri, another lawyer for Loewen. 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed with the court, the U.S. operating company  
listed assets of $4.15 billion and liabilities of $3.25 billion. 
The company had $2.1 billion of debt outstanding, including $1.2 
billion of publicly traded high-yield debt maturing from 2001 
through 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	After Judge Farnan concludes preliminary hearings, the case will  
be assigned to the Chief Judge Peter Walsh of the Bankruptcy Court 
in Wilmington, where Loewen's U.S. operations are incorporated.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Fighting Spills Into Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORINI, Albania (AP) -- Fighting spilled across the Kosovo  
frontier into Albania today and NATO planes apparently bombed 
government bunkers by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	Villagers fled Serb shelling and journalists joined the exodus  
after jets attacked as they were filming bomb damage. 
</P>
<P>
	No casualties were reported. There was no official confirmation  
from NATO of the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO jets continued their attacks against Serb border positions  
through much of the night following intense airstrikes and clashes 
Monday between Serb forces and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	An Albanian army officer at the Morini border crossing said NATO  
warplanes destroyed four defensive bunkers several hundred yards 
inside Albanian territory. 
</P>
<P>
	As Western journalists and television crews were filming bomb  
damage this afternoon, jets appeared overhead and launched another 
attack. As the journalists sped deeper into Albania, a jet appeared 
to follow them, dropping bombs nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said at  
least seven bombs were dropped -- some falling two miles inside 
Albania. The OSCE did not identify the planes as NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	The OSCE also said Serb gunners shelled Albanian artillery  
positions and bunkers along the border overnight, damaging the 
Morini police station. 
</P>
<P>
	In wake of a night of shelling, many Albanian villagers and  
refugees took to the road, heading for Kukes, 12 miles to the 
southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the refugees have left,'' said Seeim Tusha, 62, a shepherd  
from the hamlet of Durak, the closest Albanian settlement to the 
frontier. ``I was born here and I will die in this place,'' Tusha 
said, tending sheep on a rocky hillside overlooking the border 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	KLA guerrillas have been trying to move deeper into Kosovo  
territory in an apparent effort to open up a supply corridor and 
capture the Serb border checkpoint at Morini. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb artillery and mortars have been pounding the guerrillas,  
while NATO warplanes are flying daily sorties in support of the 
pro-independence KLA.

<HEADLINE> `Three Strikes Law' Open for Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Tragedy bound two fathers -- at least for a  
while -- in their fight for one of the nation's most influential 
tough-on-crime laws. The machinery of the media and the power of 
politicians kicked it up a notch. But how well did voters really 
understand ``three strikes,'' and is the popular law working? 
</P>
<P>
	``The Legacy: Murder &AMP; Media, Politics &AMP; Prisons,'' from  
filmmaker Michael J. Moore, attempts to answer those questions. The 
documentary airs Tuesday as part of ``P.O.V.,'' the PBS showcase 
for independent nonfiction films. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1 1/2-hour film tells the story of parents and crime victims  
Mike Reynolds and Marc Klaas and how tragedy, politicking and 
public outrage worked together to enact the state's three-strikes 
sentencing law for repeat felons. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been touted as a way of locking up violent repeat felons.  
But by June 1998, more than one in four California inmates had been 
sentenced under three strikes and more than 80 percent of those 
were sentenced for nonviolent offenses, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally with legislation, you have a whole system of checks  
and balances. ... All of that gets factored into it. A Fresno 
photographer (Reynolds) made this law,'' Moore said in an interview 
at a showing of his film in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds' campaign was motivated by personal tragedy. His  
18-year-old daughter, Kimber, was shot and killed in 1992 when she 
refused to give a thief her purse. Klaas' 12-year-old daughter, 
Polly, was kidnapped from her home in 1993, prompting public 
outrage and one of the state's most extensive crusades for a 
missing child. She was later found murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects in both cases were previously convicted felons.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was no sleep. There was no food. There was nothing but  
anger at the person that had committed the crime against Polly and 
the system that had allowed him to be in a position to do something 
like that. And that was what had to be corrected,'' Klaas said in 
the film. ``And we were going to use anger to correct it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just three weeks after his daughter was killed, Reynolds said,  
he gathered an informal group of judges, attorneys and law 
enforcement officials for a barbecue in his backyard to talk about 
how one law could ``solve the problem of the re-release of the same 
criminals over and over again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was this man out on parole committing more crime?''  
Reynolds asks in the film. ``The state's responsibility is what 
we're talking about here. They're the one unindicted perpetrator in 
my daughter's murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Out of this meeting grew the California three strikes  
initiative, which doubles the minimum sentence for two-time felons 
and mandates sentences of 25 years to life for three-time 
offenders, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	About four months later, just days after Richard Allen Davis was  
arrested and subsequently charged in Polly's murder, Klaas learned 
of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like a movement that I should be involved in, so we  
climbed on board three strikes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly quickly became the poster child for the measure,  
galvanizing public support and offering people an outlet for their 
rage. Petitions were signed; rallies were held. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Moore set himself up at the polls and talked to about  
100 people after they voted on the initiative. He says he was 
appalled at how little they knew about three strikes, which they 
all had supported. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just so sinister how policy is made and how it's  
promoted,'' Moore said. ``We citizens feel like we're making a 
difference, but really it's money, media ... There's just no debate 
about policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Corrections Department told lawmakers back in 1994, a few  
days before they approved three strikes, that two-thirds of the 
people affected by the law would be nonviolent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	But the wheels already were in motion and politicians were  
piggybacking on the rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones announced his  
candidacy for secretary of state and his support for three strikes. 
He brought the bill to lawmakers with the financial support of the 
Republican Party, the state's prison guard association and the 
National Rifle Association, among others. Less than two months 
later, the bill was signed into law by then-Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Klaas by then had withdrawn his support of the measure, saying  
it did not restrict itself to violent felons. Burglary was a felony 
in California and Klaas didn't think it was right to send someone 
to prison for life on a burglary conviction. Reynolds countered 
that the man who kidnapped Polly was a robber before he murdered 
Polly. 
</P>
<P>
	``If three strikes had been law my daughter and his daughter  
would be alive today,'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Polly's grandfather, Joe Klaas, said: ``You don't have to  
put half the population of the state in prison to get at people 
like (Polly's killer) Davis, all you've got to do is get at people 
like Davis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Klaas said he understands Reynolds, because both are driven  
by the same thing: ``Our daughters were murdered by people that 
shouldn't have been out there to murder children.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Fratello Fired As Cavs Head Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mike Fratello has been the master of  
slow-paced, half-court basketball and the ``Czar of the 
Telestrator.'' He was never the coach of a playoff winner in 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's out of a job.  
</P>
<P>
	Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund, looking for new blood, more wins  
and more fans in the arena that bears his name, dumped Fratello a 
month after the team ended an injury-plagued 22-28 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello was fired Tuesday as part of a shakeup in which general  
manager Wayne Embry stepped aside to be replaced by Jim Paxson, the 
team's vice president of basketball operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello still has a year left on his contract, which the Cavs  
will buy out. His reaction to the news: ``I think shocked,'' Gund 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes from a coaching standpoint, teams need to go in a  
new direction, to be re-energized by new leadership on the floor,'' 
Gund said. ``We believe that is true with respect to the Cavs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Fratello's six-year tenure, the Cavs compiled a 248-212  
record and made the playoffs four times. But Cleveland's playoff 
record was just 2-12 during that time and the Cavs never made it 
out of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello's teams always seemed to be playing hurt, playing slow  
or both. 
</P>
<P>
	When injuries took out stars like Brad Daugherty in his early  
years, Fratello employed a defensive, use-the-shot-clock style that 
set records for points allowed and made the most of thin rosters. 
But some fans got bored in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Things looked better going into last season, as Cleveland  
featured a young team that had surpassed expectations by reaching 
the playoffs in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the injury bug hit again. Starters Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
(broken left foot), forward Shawn Kemp (sprained left foot), and 
Brevin Knight (broken left hand) were out by the end of the 
strike-shortened year. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendance at Gund Arena dropped from an average of 16,942 in  
1997-98 to 14,120 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With injuries,'' Fratello said in a statement released by the  
team, ``we were in a constant state of change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello, 52, did not attend a news conference where Gund  
announced the front office changes. But in his statement he thanked 
the Cavs and said he regretted not being able to reach the goals he 
had set for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Gund said repeatedly he didn't blame Fratello for the Cavs'  
performance this year and the team's style of play was not the 
reason he fired him. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked what will bring fans back, Gund said ``I think  
winning has a lot to do with it. And I hope if they see an 
exciting, fast-paced game that will help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson said the Cavs would try to replace Fratello before the  
NBA draft on June 30. Gund, Embry and Paxson would not speculate on 
who the candidates will be to replace Fratello. The criteria for 
the new coach were still being drawn up, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fratello coached for seven years in Atlanta then worked as a  
commentator for NBC for three seasons, earning the nickname ``Czar 
of the Telestrator'' from partner Marv Albert. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other move, Embry will continue as president and chief  
operating officer for the next year, but will leave the general 
manager's post, handling day-to-day basketball operations, 
effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Embry, 62, has been grooming the 41-year-old Paxson for the past  
year to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's ready,'' Embry said.  
</P>
<P>
	Embry played in the NBA for 11 years and was the first black  
general manager in the league's history when he was named to the 
post in 1972 by the Milwaukee Bucks. He held the position for six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Cavs as general manager in 1986, Embry also  
served in the front office of the Indiana Pacers for one year. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson, who joined the Portland front office after playing with  
the Trail Blazers for nine seasons, had joined the Cavs to 
coordinate scouting and player acquisition and development. 
</P>
<P>
	Paxson played at the University of Dayton and was a first-round  
selection by Portland in the 1979 draft. He was a two-time NBA 
All-Star with Portland and played his final NBA season in 1989-90 
with Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as Portland's offensive skills coach in 1993-94 and  
later became assistant to the president and most recently served as 
assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Jim, was an NBA player from 1956-58 with Minneapolis  
and Cincinnati and his brother, John, played for San Antonio from 
1983-85 and for Chicago from 1985-94.

<HEADLINE> Banks Merging in $5.3 Billion Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- AmSouth Bancorp plans to buy First  
American Corp. of Tennessee in a $5.3 billion stock deal, creating 
one the largest banks in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will create a bank with $40 billion in assets and 680  
branches in nine Southeastern states, including the fast-growing 
markets of Tennessee and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisition was originally worth $6.3 billion, but investors  
pushed shares of AmSouth down nearly 14 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange,  
AmSouth shares were trading down $3.93. 3/4 at $24.43 3/4. First 
American stock was trading up $2.81 1/4, or 7 percent, to $43.62 1/2, 
also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the AmSouth decline, analysts said the acquisition had  
the potential to make the Birmingham-based bank a regional 
powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they get they numbers they are looking for, I think they  
will be in a position to be one of the strongest financial 
institutions in the Southeast,'' said analyst Mike Granger of 
Fox-Pitt, Kelton Inc. ``If they don't, they may be vulnerable to a 
takeover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Directors of both companies unanimously approved the deal, which  
gives First American shareholders 1.871 shares of AmSouth common 
stock for each First American common share. The deal, which the 
banks expect to be completed by the end of the year, still faces 
shareholder and regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The headquarters will be in Birmingham, but AmSouth chief  
executive C. Dowd Ritter said the company will seek ways to keep 
``significant operations'' in Nashville, Tenn., where First 
American is based. 
</P>
<P>
	AmSouth spokesman Jim Underwood said there would be ``minimal''  
branch closings since the only cities where AmSouth and First 
American overlap are Nashville and Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Both banks have about $20 billion in assets. But AmSouth, the  
third-largest bank in Alabama, currently has 290 offices, compared 
to 390 for First American, the No. 2 bank in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	First American has struggled since last year, when it acquired  
Deposit Guaranty Corp. of Jackson, Miss. The banks had a hard time 
merging their operations, and the resulting errors and lines drove 
away some customers and led to lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged company will have 1,350 automatic teller machines. It  
will operate in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter will serve as president and CEO of the combined company.  
</P>
<P>
	First American chairman and chief executive Dennis C. Bottorff  
will be the chairman and be available to assist Ritter until Jan. 
1, 2001, when Ritter will become chairman.

<HEADLINE> Saab Recalls 26,000 for Air Bags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saab Cars USA Inc. said Tuesday that it will  
recall about 26,000 Saab 9000 cars to fix a defect that could 
affect the air bag's ability to function properly in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall is of Saab 9000s from model years 1992 through 1994.  
The automaker said it determined that the covers on the air bag's 
electronic control module, located in the engine compartment, could 
allow moisture to enter and corrode its circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, could cause the air bag to malfunction. Saab said  
no accidents or injuries had been reported as a result of the 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The '92-93 models were equipped with driver's side air bags  
only, while 1994 models came with driver and passenger-side air 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected cars will be notified by mail in July and  
asked to schedule an appointment with their Saab dealer to have the 
parts replaced, if necessary, free of charge. Saab spokesman Steve 
Janisse said the same models are being recalled in Canada as well, 
but that he did not know how many. 
</P>
<P>
	Saab Automobile AB, based in Sweden, is half-owned by  
Detroit-based General Motors Corp.

<HEADLINE> Flood Report May Halt Nev. Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Groundwater flooded the proposed Yucca Mountain  
nuclear waste site in Nevada thousands of years ago, a Russian 
geologist reported Tuesday, raising questions about the project's 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Designers of the long-delayed project hope to seal off the  
radioactive waste underground for 10,000 years or more, when it 
will have decayed to safer levels. 
</P>
<P>
	But geologist Yuri Dublyansky of the Russian Academy of Sciences  
said the flooding problem he found may be a ``potential 
show-stopper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Paces, who has studied the site with the U.S. Geological  
Survey, challenged the finding. He said the evidence indicates 
there has been seepage of rainwater, not water welling up from 
below. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists were speaking during a panel discussion on Yucca  
Mountain at a conference of the American Geophysical Union, a group 
of astrophysicists, geologists and other Earth and space 
scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Energy Department is studying whether to bury spent,  
highly radioactive fuel from the nation's nuclear plants and 
weapons programs at Yucca Mountain, about 90 miles from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, more than 42,000 tons of lethal commercial  
waste is being kept at nuclear plants, mostly in cooling pools not 
designed for permanent safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Yucca Mountain is the only site under consideration for  
permanent storage. The waste would sealed in metal containers 
within rock tunnels about 1,000 feet underground and 1,000 feet 
above the water table. The site would begin operations in 2010 at 
the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Not-in-my-backyard politics and fears of earthquakes and water  
seepage have slowed progress. Government officials have 
acknowledged they cannot be certain the site will keep waste 
totally sealed for thousands of years. But they have said the site 
appears workable. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work, Dublyansky studied the formation of calcite mineral  
crystals beneath the mountain. He said imperfections in the crystal 
indicate the surrounding temperature was about 170 degrees. 
Dublyansky said only groundwater heated by the interior of the 
Earth could reach such a temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he could not determine when the flooding occurred. The  
youngest deposits he studied were a few hundred thousand years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Paces argued strongly that other research techniques indicate  
the crystals were formed by rainwater seepage. ``There's pretty 
good evidence that the repository was never saturated,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paces said government researchers will be looking more into the  
possibility of groundwater flooding.

<HEADLINE> Internet Futures Investing Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Buying low and selling high has become more of a  
challenge in the volatile world of Internet stocks, but one of the 
nation's futures exchanges is hoping to make life simpler. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City Board of Trade on Tuesday launched the  
first-ever futures contract based on an index of 50 companies that 
derive most of their revenue from the Internet industry, including 
America Online and eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet sector is very volatile. That's the  
attractiveness of having an index like this -- providing a basket of 
companies to invest in,'' said Steve Harmon, senior investment 
analyst for internet.com LLC, the oldest Internet stock index in 
the marketplace. It is partnering with the Kansas City exchange to 
launch the futures and options index. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading of The Internet Stock Index, known as Isdex, comes at a  
time when Web stocks appear to be losing their luster on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Stalwarts such as Amazon.com and e-Trade have seen their stocks  
slump -- some falling as much as 50 percent from their peaks -- as 
investors' love affair with anything to do with the Web shows signs 
of souring. Analysts say more investors are taking a closer look at 
a company's bottom line or its future earnings potential. 
</P>
<P>
	``This speaks to the need for a good hedge vehicle,'' said  
Michael Baude, the Kansas City exchange's president and chief 
executive. ``Anybody who is really nervous about a big run-up in 
their portfolio of Internet stocks or doesn't want to sell them for 
tax reasons can look at the (Isdex) as an attractive option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all futures trading, investors in Isdex essentially ``bet''  
the underlying value of the portfolio will be higher or lower at a 
given point, becoming winners or losers if they're right. 
</P>
<P>
	An option gives buyers the right -- but not the obligation -- to  
buy or sell a commodity in the future, so if investors aren't sure 
of a fall or rise, they can take a little longer to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Isdex, which also includes such companies as RealNetworks,  
Yahoo, CDnow and Beyond.com, has quarterly contract months at $100 
multiplied by the futures price. That currently represents a basket 
of stocks with an underlying value of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial money down is $1,875, with prices fluctuating at a  
minimum of $5 per contract, or .05 point. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange initially expects to attract sophisticated smaller  
investors and larger, institutional hedge funds, but it also hopes 
to draw people from around the world who may be unsure about 
betting on an individual company, said Jeff Borchrdt, the 
exchange's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Borchrdt noted the futures contract, if successful, could help  
remove some of the volatility of Internet stocks since the index 
would most likely be used to balance potential losses from 
individual investments. That could help prevent panic selling, 
lower broker commission costs and cut tax obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, futures trading is not for the faint-hearted. The active  
contract swung 100 points in the first two hours of trading, from a 
high of 598.33 to a low of 494.36. If trading started at 500 
points, someone made more than $9,830 at the high, while another 
investor lost $600 at the low. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say investors may be more interested in betting the  
index will fall over time, but few could be willing to bet it will 
rise. That could create a gap between buyers and sellers that would 
render the index useless. 
</P>
<P>
	To interest investors, the exchange is offering free real-time  
quotes off its Web site (www.kcbt.com) and simulated trading for up 
to one month.

	Feds Study Violence in Entertainment  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is urging the movie industry  
and video-game makers to ``show some restraint'' in using bloody 
images to market their products. Clinton announced today that the 
government will investigate marketing practices of the 
entertainment industry. Clinton read from a series of ads for video 
games which touted their gory realism. Clinton said Americans 
``cannot be surprised'' when impressionable kids see such material, 
and get confused about the difference between violent fantasy and 
reality. The $1 million joint study by the Federal Trade Commission 
and Justice Department is expected to take up to 18 months.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Students returned to Columbine High  
School today to retrieve their belongings for the first time since 
a deadly shooting spree, and crews began cleaning up and repairing 
the damage from the April 20 rampage. Students left backpacks and 
other things as they ran from the building or hid in classrooms 
when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold opened fire. Fifteen people, 
including the shooters, died in the attack. The students were 
barred from some areas -- including the library, where most of the 
victims were found.

	Va. Family's Murder Called Targeted  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI and area police are investigating the  
``targeted'' killing of an Iraqi-American businessman, his school 
teacher wife and their 16-year-old son. A police spokeswoman said 
the shooting appeared to be ``a targeted incident and does not 
appear to be a random incident.'' Fuad Khazi Taima; his wife, 
Dorothy Mae Taima, and their son, Leith Fuad, all died of gunshot 
wounds, police said. Taimi has been prominent in the Iraqi-American 
community as founder of the American-Iraqi Foundation to help 
improve U.S.-Iraqi relations during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly released documents show that the Kennedy  
family insisted that the polished bronze casket used to carry 
President Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington be dumped into 
the ocean. Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in a 
mahogany coffin after he was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963. The 
660-pound coffin was paid for by the government but was considered 
property of the family. It was dropped into 9,000 feet of water 
beyond the continental shelf, a site chosen because it was away 
from regularly traveled air and shipping lines and would not be 
disturbed by trawling and other sea-bottom activities, the 
documents said.

seven-year prison sentence former United Way president William 
Aramony received for stealing money from the nation's largest 
charity. The justices rejected an appeal in which Aramony argued 
that his prison term exceeds federal guidelines. Aramony was 
convicted in 1995 of defrauding the charity out of about $600,000. 
He was found guilty of fraud, tax and conspiracy charges. Aramony 
was forced to resign in 1992 after 22 years with the charity.

bandits also threw two security guards overboard and beat a crew 
member before speeding off in another boat, local officials said. 
One of the security guards has been rescued, but the other is still

	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Henry Kissinger urged the IOC today  
to be more open and accountable as it tries to recover from the 
worst crisis in Olympic history. Kissinger is one of 36 outside 
members on the 80-member IOC 2000 commission, which was formed in 
the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The reform panel is 
meeting today and tomorrow to begin examining ways of overhauling 
the IOC's structure and the process for selecting Olympic host 
cities.

<HEADLINE> 'Phantom Menace' Hits $200M Mark / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The ``Star Wars'' prequel is setting  
box-office records, but it is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' was North  
America's top film over the four-day Memorial Day weekend, bringing 
in $64.8 million for a total gross of $205 million in a record 13 
days. ``Independence Day'' set the previous record in 21 days in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But another kind of star power -- Julia Roberts -- helped  
``Notting Hill'' pull in $27.8 million, the biggest opening ever 
for a romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Wedding Singer,'' with Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore,  
earned $21.9 million in three days last year. The comparable 
three-day figure for ``Notting Hill'' was $22.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Wars'' locked up the children's audience and the ``thrill  
ride'' fans, studio executives said, while the love story between 
Ms. Roberts as a Hollywood star and Hugh Grant as a quirky British 
bookstore owner drew an older crowd for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the ``Star Wars'' film is flying. It already holds  
records for opening day and five-day totals, and is the fastest to 
break the $100 million barrier (five days). 
</P>
<P>
	``The movie's like a thoroughbred. We put it on the track every  
day and it doesn't disappoint you,'' said Tom Sherak, distribution 
head for 20th Century Fox. He said families are the key to the 
repeat business if ``Phantom'' is to thrive in the summer 
blockbuster season. 
</P>
<P>
	Universal's strategy to open its films before and after ``Star  
Wars'' paid off. ``The Mummy,'' the studio's own thrill ride movie, 
was in third place last weekend with $12.7 million. It has grossed 
$117.1 million in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace has got to support more than one movie. There  
are different tastes,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for 
Universal. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other new film in wide release, ``The Thirteenth  
Floor,'' opened in fifth place. The sci-fi film noir had a 
disappointing $4.3 million, industry estimates showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Love Letter,'' also billed as a romantic alternative,  
tanked in its second week, dropping out of the top 10 list with a 
gross of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Monday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $64.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``Notting Hill,'' $27.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``The Mummy,'' $12.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Entrapment,'' $6.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' $4.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Matrix,'' $3.1 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' $2.004  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Never Been Kissed,'' $2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Life,'' $1.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``Election,'' $1.38 million.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Try To Contain Blaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Whipped by winds and fed by crackling brush, a huge  
fire burned throughout the night in the Okefenokee Swamp, gobbling 
up dry pines and palmetto trees. 
</P>
<P>
	Without significant rain, firefighters predicted it might take  
another two weeks to fully contain the blaze, which was about 20 
percent controlled early today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like a war zone,'' said Bill Paxton, a spokesman for  
the firefighting operation. ``We've had some real close calls -- 
fire crews barely making it over burning bridges that are the only 
way in and out of areas. Then there's the snakes. Again, some close 
calls. No one bitten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 fire engines and 50 bulldozers along with 482 men and  
women were fighting the fire. Thirty states have sent volunteer 
crews and equipment from as far away as Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven helicopters and four tanker planes have dropped more than  
1 million gallons of water and 365,000 gallons of retardants on the 
swamp, which straddles northern Florida and southern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to confine it to the swamp,'' said Willie  
Burkhardt, an information officer for the firefighting operation. 
So far, the fire, which may have been ignited by lightning on May 
21, has burned 53,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday evening, the fire was advancing on U.S. 441, which  
runs north-south along the western side of the swamp in Florida and 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, devastating fires that started over the Memorial Day  
weekend scorched nearly 500,000 acres, forced 100,000 residents to 
flee and caused $400 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the West, wind gusts up to 50 mph helped spread a fire over  
11,000 acres from Grand Canyon National Park north to the 
Arizona-Utah line. Another lightning wildfire 80 miles west of 
Phoenix burned 14,600 acres but was contained by Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters in Nevada called in reinforcements to help battle a  
lightning-sparked blaze that had charred 10,000 acres in rugged 
terrain about 85 miles northeast of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Joshua Tree National Park, a 13,900-acre  
lightning-sparked wildfire was contained as crews started work on 
restoring the fragile desert habitat blackened by the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters surrounded the flames Monday evening -- four days  
after they started -- and expect to have them under full control by 
Wednesday. A second fire that burned 1,900 acres was also under 
control.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Looks To Clear Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Australian IOC member Phil Coles  
said Tuesday he would clear his name when he appears before a 
special panel investigating charges of ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said it was a ``good sign'' he had been asked to appear  
before the three-member panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot to say, a lot to present,'' Coles said.  
``I've got every confidence in that special commission, they are 
very capable people. I wanted to come. I couldn't see the meeting 
taking place without me being here to present my information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he doesn't believe the panel will recommend his  
expulsion from the International Olympic Committee when it reports 
its findings to the executive board at its next meeting June 16 in 
Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that will happen but we'll just play that as it  
comes,'' Coles said. ``But I really don't believe that will 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice presidents Keba Mbaye and Anita DeFrantz and executive  
board member Marc Hodler could recommend that the case be dropped 
or that Coles be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the 
full IOC assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has already received a severe warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other incentives from Salt Lake 
bidders, and is under investigation for further allegations of 
abusing his Olympic positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife told the IOC that the couple received jewelry valued  
at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid for the 
1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, the Australian has been accused of compiling  
secret dossiers on IOC members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid. 
Those files were also passed on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles again denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	``They certainly have attacked me without any consultation or  
any knowledge of where it all came from but we'll have the 
opportunity,'' he said. ``But it was terribly embarrassing to have 
private memo notes published.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The continued controversy has taken its toll on Coles, who was  
subdued and cautious throughout a news conference hours after his 
arrival from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an absolute nightmare,'' Coles said. ``I've never  
seen such vilification. But I'm confident there are brighter 
horizons ahead. ... I'm hoping this will be the finish of it 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Supplies Brought to Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Working like orbital bellhops, space  
shuttle Discovery's astronauts carried bag after bag of supplies 
into the new international space station Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You must have worn a path in the dirt with all the trips you  
made back and forth,'' Mission Control told the crew. ``Hopefully, 
that path doesn't become a rut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday night, the seven astronauts had hauled over about  
three-quarters of the 3,600 pounds of space station gear they took 
up, including computers, spare parts, trash bags and containers of 
water. They have until Thursday, when the hatches are closed and 
the shuttle undocks, to finish the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts are getting the space station ready for its first  
permanent occupants, who are scheduled to move in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	With 60 percent humidity and a high of 78, the space station was  
a bit sticky for a while. The humidity shot up during repairs to 
lessen the noise inside Zarya, the Russian half of the space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	After installing foam mufflers over clattering fans, outlets and  
ducts, Discovery's astronauts noticed that the air flow was 
hampered in one spot. They took off the sound-insulating material 
from that section of the duct, and the flow immediately improved. 
The material will be left off. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA had expected the humidity to rise a little anyway: A fan  
used to exchange air between the shuttle and station was turned off 
for 1 1/2 hours during the muffler installation, plus astronauts were 
toiling inside. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the noise problem, the mufflers seem to have helped,  
though officials don't yet know by how much. The concern is not for 
the visiting astronauts but rather for the permanent occupants. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Russians launched Zarya last November, the module did  
not meet NASA's acoustic standards. The noise level inside was 
equivalent to a busy highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The American-made side of the space station, Unity, has always  
been well within NASA's limits. It was launched in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's Canadian astronaut, Julie Payette, took time out  
Tuesday night to chat with Prime Minister Jean Chretien and 
schoolchildren gathered at the National Museum of Science and 
Technology in Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The youngsters wanted to know whether she was keeping up with  
the hockey playoffs and other Canadian news. The answer was no. 
They also wanted to know ``how do we get there,'' there being 
space. Her answer -- go to school, study hard, get a science degree 
-- got mixed reviews.

<HEADLINE> Users Irate As 2nd Line Slows Modems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Some people who buy a second phone line for  
their computers are getting a nasty surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed modems, those things that connect the computer to the  
Internet over the phone lines, sometimes slow their data processing 
speeds dramatically. U S West blames aging copper phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some Internet providers believe the company is using  
the problem to push its own Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Baby Bell acknowledges that certain equipment it uses can  
slow modems. But U S West denies it is taking advantage of the 
situation to boost its own business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Attorney General's Office has received complaints about the  
slowdowns from angry Web surfers, but wouldn't directly confirm if 
an investigation is under way. Assistant Attorney General Karen 
Fisher said, ``We have a policy of not talking about current and 
ongoing investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown is caused when the company installs equipment  
called ``pair gain'' or ``multiplexers'' to increase the capacity 
of existing lines, said Peggy Moore, U S West regulatory manager. 
</P>
<P>
	While that doesn't affect voice transmission, it can slow data  
transfer significantly, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hank LeMieux, president of the New Mexico Internet Professionals  
Association, thinks the company will be more likely to provide a 
dedicated phone line rather than a multiplexer to someone who 
orders U S West's Internet package. 
</P>
<P>
	A few Internet providers, he said, have complained that the  
company will remove a multiplexer from the line of someone who 
switches to the U S West Internet provider from another service. 
</P>
<P>
	Marianne Granoff, an Internet consultant, said she turned over  
to the Public Regulation Commission, which oversees 
telecommunications businesses, a handful of e-mail messages from 
users who complained that the company suggested they switch to U S 
West's Web product when they called about slow modem speeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore says the company doesn't give preferential treatment for  
signing onto the company's Internet offering. 
</P>
<P>
	Multiplexer equipment, she said, is installed wherever there are  
too few existing copper lines to handle demand regardless of 
whether the customer relies on U S West for Web access. 
</P>
<P>
	That's true, but it highlights the company's failure to upgrade  
its system, said Chuck Noble, PRC legal division director.

<HEADLINE> Jones Attys. Want Fee From Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Paula Jones' lawyers said Tuesday that  
President Clinton's proposal for what he should pay to resolve the 
civil contempt citation against him is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents filed Tuesday, John W. Whitehead and the Rutherford  
Institute said the sanctions proposed by Clinton ``would do 
precious little to redress'' his misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright found Clinton in  
contempt in April for giving intentionally false testimony about 
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his January 1998 
deposition in Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment case. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge then ordered Clinton to pay Mrs. Jones' lawyers any  
``reasonable'' expenses they incurred as a result of his false 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' lawyers have asked the court to order Clinton to pay  
almost $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's lawyers on May 21 proposed that the president pay  
$33,737 to the court and other attorneys for Mrs. Jones, and 
nothing to Whitehead and the Rutherford Institute, a conservative 
legal group. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attorneys said the request from Mrs. Jones' side was  
unreasonable and ``bears no relationship to the actions that gave 
rise'' to the contempt order. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton attorney Robert Bennett also argued that the Rutherford  
Institute provided no legal services to Mrs. Jones, performing only 
fund-raising and public-relations tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Jones' attorneys contended in Tuesday's filing that the  
institute provided services that Mrs. Jones' other attorneys could 
not handle alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Any payment would be in addition to the $850,000 Clinton has  
already paid Mrs. Jones to settle the sexual harassment case 
without admitting wrongdoing. Clinton denies any wrongdoing and has 
said he settled the case simply to bring an end to a public crisis.

<HEADLINE> Baseball To Decide on Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future in baseball could be  
decided within a week, baseball commissioner Bud Selig said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a guess as to what's likely to transpire, and I don't  
engage in guesses in matters of this kind,'' union lawyer Gene Orza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old New York Yankees outfielder has been suspended  
since April 24 following his arrest for cocaine possession. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN/Sports Illustrated reported Monday ``that in the next 48  
hours major league baseball will announce Strawberry will be 
suspended for up to 90 days, retroactive to his April 14 arrest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 90th day of his suspension would be July 13, the date of the  
All-Star game at Boston's Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on Strawberry by doctors for owners and the players'  
association and by lawyers for the commissioner's office and the 
union will be submitted to Selig by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who served a 90-day suspension in 1995 after testing  
positive for cocaine, was put on ``administrative leave'' by Selig. 
That term is not defined in baseball's rules, but carries the same 
penalties as a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest to drug and solicitation charges last  
Wednesday in Tampa, Fla., and was sentenced to 18 months' probation 
and 100 hours' community service. He also must undergo more drug 
treatment, be tested twice and week and pay $456 in court fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said he hadn't heard of  
any decision. The team says Strawberry will need three weeks of 
working out and minor league games to be ready to play in the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are obviously concerned with Darryl's well being because  
all of us love and support him as much as we can,'' Yankees manager 
Joe Torre said. ``I don't know how that translates into him being 
here.''

<HEADLINE>  Ocalan Denies Ordering 1993 Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IMRALI ISLAND, Turkey (AP) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah  
Ocalan rejected responsibility today for one of the deadliest 
attacks blamed on his guerrillas, Turkey's state-run television 
reported on the second day of his treason trial. 
</P>
<P>
	TRT quoted Ocalan as telling the court he did not order the 1993  
attack, which killed 33 soldiers in Turkey's southeastern Bingol 
province. The slaughter ended a cease-fire declared by his 
Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has been fighting the Turkish 
government for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said the assault was carried out by renegade guerrillas  
acting independently, the television report said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 139-page indictment against Ocalan, he is accused of  
ordering the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan also denied accusations that he had given orders for bomb  
attacks on Turkey's tourist sites in the early 1990s, which killed 
and injured several foreigners, TRT said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said his group had not killed Swedish Prime Minister Olof  
Palme, but that rebels that had broken away from his group may have 
had a hand in the 1986 assassination. 
</P>
<P>
	Palme, whose government had declared Ocalan's group a terrorist  
organization, was gunned down on a Stockholm street. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan surprised the Turkish court at the opening of his trial  
Monday by ordering his fighters to end their struggle and 
threatening massive bloodshed if he is hanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkish newspapers expressed outrage today at Ocalan's mix of  
begging and bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's too late,'' declared a headline in the daily Zaman  
newspaper. ``Traitor and coward,'' said the daily Aksam; ``Apology 
and threat!'' said the daily Turkiye. 
</P>
<P>
	``The armed clashes should immediately cease and arms should be  
immediately laid down,'' Ocalan said Monday through a microphone in 
a bulletproof and bombproof cage on the island of Imrali, where he 
is the only prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Ocalan's first direct call for an end to the guerrilla  
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has rejected Ocalan's previous calls for a cease-fire and  
regards any hints of Kurdish national identity as a direct threat 
to the republic. 
</P>
<P>
	There is overwhelming support in Turkey for executing Ocalan,  
commonly referred to as a ``bloody terrorist'' and ``baby-killer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurds marked the opening of the trial with demonstrations in  
Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland and Denmark. There 
were no reports of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan said he wanted the guerrilla group to ``give up its  
stance against the state and prepare for the legalization 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that if he were allowed to contact his fighters, he  
could talk them into laying down their weapons within three months 
and end the rebellion that has killed 37,000 people, the majority 
of them Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who know the history, political and economic situation  
of the two people, will know that breaking up cannot happen,'' 
Ocalan said in a statement published by several newspapers today. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan's offer to transform his group into a political  
organization comes as his guerrilla fighters have faced serious 
setbacks on the battlefield and appears designed to save his life 
and what is left of his guerrilla group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 250,000 Turkish soldiers and police backed by helicopter  
gunships and warplanes have pushed the rebels deep into the 
mountains and northern Iraq, where they carry out only occasional 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, a spokeswoman for the group said it was premature  
to comment on Ocalan's statements. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement to the court, Ocalan also complained that the  
newspapers he was receiving were censored and his radio only 
received Turkey's state-run station.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices retreated  
Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid near-ideal growing 
conditions for spring crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters are predicting warm weather and scattered showers  
across Midwest growing regions this week. That should prove ideal 
for early growth of corn and spring wheat crops, where farmers were 
expected to have completed planting in the past week. Market 
participants expected the government this week would report about 
75 percent of soybean crops have been planted. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are worried that record soybean acreage and large corn  
acreage could lead to bumper fall harvests, at a time when weaker 
than normal world demand has lead to ample inventory buildups. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures also were pressured by upcoming active harvesting  
of the winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 1/2 cent to $2.51 3/4 a bushel; July  
corn fell 3 1/4 cents to $2.16 1/4 a bushel; July oats fell 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.21 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.58 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Live cattle futures were mixed, while feeder cattle futures  
advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures 
retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .25 cent to 64.50 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .35 cent to 75.87 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 1.48 cents to 51.47 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .67 
cent to 52.70 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pilots Threaten Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- As a sickout by Cathay Pacific Airways pilots  
entered its fifth day and grounded about a third of the carrier's 
flights Tuesday, the air crew union intensified the dispute by 
threatening to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the company's plans to fire pilots who don't  
accept proposed salary cuts, the Hong Kong Aircrew Officers 
Association decided to call a strike vote if anyone loses his job, 
said John Findlay, the union's secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
	Findlay said the measure was supported by more than 700 of the  
850 union members who voted. Those numbers suggested a strike vote 
could pass, Findlay told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay managers declined to say Tuesday night what they would do  
if pilots walk off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the level of disruption escalates, we will respond  
accordingly,'' the company's director of corporate development, 
Tony Tyler, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also urged management to enter into arbitration. Tyler  
said Cathay bosses were open to the idea, but he later added that 
the sides were too far apart to simply ``split the difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong-based Cathay canceled 37 of 110 scheduled flights  
Tuesday, halting its services throughout Asia and into Europe and 
North America, company spokeswoman Katherine Wang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said it would transfer passengers to other flights,  
including 10 chartered services it had hired from other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation is under control,'' Tyler said. ``The  
overwhelming majority of our passengers are getting to their 
destinations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay has canceled a total of 140 flights, affecting more than  
16,000 passengers, since pilots began calling in sick en masse on 
Friday, claiming they are under too much stress because of layoff 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides have been locked in the dispute since Cathay asked  
senior pilots in March to take an 8 percent pay cut in exchange for 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Cathay abruptly pulled out of nine weeks of talks and  
gave the pilots a June 11 deadline to decide whether to accept a 
revised pay offer, including a smaller pay cut and better stock 
options, resign or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said the pilots' counter offer, which includes annual pay  
increases after two years of cuts and a yearlong pay freeze, was 
unacceptable. The company has refused to reopen talks unless the 
pilots give up demands for pay rises. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots' union said it has not organized the sickout, noting  
that Hong Kong law allows pilots to stay home due to stress. 
Neither side would say how many pilots have called in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse is hurting Hong Kong's tourism industry and has  
sparked calls for the government to step in, but the territory's 
secretary for education and manpower, Joseph Wong, said there were 
no immediate plans for intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay operates nearly a third of all flights in and out of Hong  
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Lopez Seeks Women's U.S. Open Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Dan Marino has never won a Super Bowl.  
Greg Norman has never worn a green jacket. John Stockton and Karl 
Malone may end their careers without an NBA title. Roger Clemens 
has yet to pitch for a World Series winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Lopez knows the feeling.  
</P>
<P>
	Considering all that she has meant to her sport, perhaps no  
other athlete deserves to fill a glaring void in an otherwise 
illustrious career. 
</P>
<P>
	For Lopez, already a member of the Hall of Fame with 48  
victories and three major championships, what might be her last 
chance starts Thursday in the U.S. Women's Open at a course she 
calls home. 
</P>
<P>
	She played the first official round at Old Waverly Golf Club and  
returns once a year for corporate outings. She feels positive vibes 
just driving down the two-lane road and past the Southern 
plantation-style clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to look at it as if this is my best opportunity, the  
best one I've ever had,'' Lopez said Tuesday. ``It's there for me 
to take. If it's going to happen, this is the time for it to 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may be her last chance because of the black brace wrapped  
snugly around her left knee. Lopez first started feeling the pain 
of arthritis about three months ago, when her legs ached at night 
and she had trouble walking in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be her last chance because her attitude has never been  
better. Lopez was among those who waved white flags of surrender 
last year at Blackwolf Run, a course she despised but was too 
gracious to say so until months later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel really good this week,'' Lopez said after an 18-hole  
practice round, followed by a 30 minutes' rest. ``My confidence 
level is very high. I'm at a place where I feel comfortable. I love 
the golf course, and I feel it likes me a little bit, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether Old Waverly loves Lopez enough to reward  
her with a U.S. Open victory. 
</P>
<P>
	At 42, Lopez is trying to juggle the grind of the LPGA tour with  
the joy of spending time with her three daughters. She always finds 
enough daylight to sweat under the hot Georgia sun, trying to 
recapture that magic putting stroke and dreaming about finally 
winning a U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	More often than not, she thinks about the ones that got away.  
</P>
<P>
	Lopez was 18 years old, not even a freshman at the University of  
Tulsa, when she matched strokes with her idol, JoAnne Carner, and 
finished second behind Sandra Palmer in the 1975 Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, before she even had her LPGA tour card, Lopez  
made a spirited run at three-time Open champion Hollis Stacy but 
again settled for second. 
</P>
<P>
	Surely, it was just a matter of time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I probably thought that I would have a lot of opportunities to  
win the Open, and that hopefully I would win a few,'' Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
	She had a chance in 1985 when she led after 36 holes and was in  
the final group at Baltusrol in 1985 until a 77 in the final round 
dropped her into a tie for fourth. In 1989, she closed with a 68 
but came up two strokes short and was runner-up again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's got to be some way to win an Open,'' she said. ``You  
almost think there's a way to figure it out, and there's not. But I 
keep thinking that I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She quit believing for a while. Lopez wanted to win the Open so  
badly that she put too much pressure on herself and never got the 
right results. She had only one top-10 finish over the next seven 
years, but got new life at Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Just like the first time she set foot on Old Waverly, Lopez fell  
in love with Pumpkin Ridge. She shot in the 60s all four rounds, 
the only player in the 53-year history of the Women's Open to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	And even that wasn't enough. Her 20-foot birdie putt on the 72nd  
hold to force a playoff with Alison Nicholas stopped an inch from 
the heart of the cup. Lopez was in tears, but came away believing 
she wasn't done quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was like a rebirth,'' she said. ``I was going to have a  
chance to win another Open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This may be her last chance.  
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Marino, facing fourth-and-goal from the 5 and needing a  
touchdown to win the Super Bowl. Or Stockton and Malone, setting up 
the pick-and-roll with the score tied in the final seconds of Game 
7 in the NBA Finals. Or Norman, standing over a 20-foot putt on the 
18th green at Augusta National on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Imagine Lopez, flashing her unforgettable smile and shedding the  
tears of an Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know my game is there,'' she said. ``I know it can win.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition Courts S.African Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Relegated to a minor role in  
South Africa's election, white voters have been wooed by a 
half-dozen opposition groups, including a former anti-apartheid 
party now making headway with calls to reinstate the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	No single party has emerged as the clear-cut standard bearer for  
the 4.5 million whites who comprise 11 percent of South Africa's 
population. 
</P>
<P>
	But polls indicate the largest bloc of white votes in the  
election Wednesday is likely to go to the Democratic Party, formed 
a decade ago as a coalition of anti-apartheid whites but now 
appealing to conservatives with calls for get-tough policies on 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party is a direct descendent of the Progressive  
Federal Party, which fought to ease segregation and extend 
political rights to blacks during the heyday of apartheid. Now, 
with the black-led African National Congress in power and favored 
to win re-election, the Democratic Party has adopted the slogan 
``Fight Back'' and transformed itself into a vehemently anti-ANC 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ANC wants to colonize every possible nook and cranny of  
our society,'' said the Democratic Party's pugnacious leader, Tony 
Leon. ``Its appetite is bottomless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Party's gains in the polls have come largely at  
the expense of the New National Party, the current version of the 
National Party that ruled during more than four decades of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of its reign, the National Party was supported loyally  
by most of the country's 3 million Afrikaners, the mainly 
Dutch-descended whites who began settling in South Africa in the 
1600s. 
</P>
<P>
	Hard-line Afrikaners began deserting the National Party during  
the 1980s, when the government tried to moderate the apartheid 
system. Pollsters say a new wave of Afrikaner defections is 
occurring as the New National Party woos mixed-race voters while 
the Democratic Party hammers away with anti-ANC messages. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been an ironic reversal of the old roles of the  
two white-led parties, with the New National Party depicting itself 
as multiracial and accusing the Democratic Party of catering to 
white fear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The isolationist and adversarial approach now offered by  
parties such as the Democratic Party is counterproductive,'' New 
National Party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk said Tuesday. ``The 
fueling of racial antagonism ... belongs to the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the far-right of the political spectrum, a couple of  
hard-line, Afrikaner-led parties are seeking votes from whites 
still tempted by talk of a white homeland. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Allows Drug Trafficking Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let Kentucky prosecute  
two men on drug-trafficking charges after having required them to 
pay a tax on the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away an appeal in which  
Joseph Nicholson and Robert Bird said their prosecutions, following 
payment of the drug tax, would unlawfully punish them twice for the 
same crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson and Bird were arrested in 1995 by Lexington-Fayette  
Urban County police and charged with trafficking in a controlled 
substance. Police had seized a small amount of powder cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Using information provided by the police, state revenue  
officials assessed a tax, penalty and interest on the cocaine of 
about $4,000 for Nicholson and $6,000 for Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky law levies an annual tax on controlled substances, due  
at the time someone possesses a drug. The tax rate is two times the 
drugs' market value. People can pay the tax anonymously and receive 
a tax stamp to be attached to the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	If police seize drugs from someone and a tax stamp is not  
attached, the seizure is reported to revenue officials who assess 
the tax. That's what happened to Nicholson and Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	After paying the tax, the two men asked a state judge to dismiss  
the cocaine-trafficking charges on grounds the prosecution would 
subject them to double jeopardy, which the Constitution's Fifth 
Amendment prohibits. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge dismissed the charges, basing the decision on a 1994  
Supreme Court ruling that barred Montana from forcing drug 
offenders to pay a tax in addition to criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	A state appeals court agreed, but the Kentucky Supreme Court  
ruled that Nicholson and Bird could be prosecuted on the cocaine 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the Montana drug tax, Kentucky's highest court said, the  
Kentucky levy is more tax than punishment and is due regardless of 
whether a person has been arrested on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeals acted on today, lawyers for Nicholson and Bird  
said the drug tax and criminal prosecution both seek to punish the 
same conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases are Nicholson vs. Kentucky, 98-1297, and Bird vs.  
Kentucky, 98-1331.

<HEADLINE> Internet Futures Investing Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Amazon.com? America Online? Yahoo? With more and  
more ``dot.coms'' being offered to investors, how do you 
differentiate a darling from a dumpling? 
</P>
<P>
	Why bother when you can bet the 'Net, the Kansas City Board of  
Trade suggested Tuesday as it launched the first-ever futures 
contract based on an index of 50 companies that derive most of 
their revenue from the Internet industry, including America Online 
Inc. and eBay Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet sector is very volatile. That's the  
attractiveness of having an index like this -- providing a basket of 
companies to invest in,'' said Steve Harmon, senior investment 
analyst for internet.com LLC, the oldest Internet stock index in 
the marketplace. It is partnering with the Kansas City exchange to 
launch the futures and options index. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading of The Internet Stock Index, known as Isdex, comes at a  
time when Web stocks appear to be losing their luster on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Stalwarts such as Amazon.com Inc. and e-Trade Group Inc. have  
seen their stocks slump -- some falling as much as 50 percent from 
their peaks -- as investors' love affair with anything to do with 
the Web shows signs of souring. Analysts say investors are taking a 
closer look at a company's bottom line or its future earnings 
potential than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This speaks to the need for a good hedge vehicle,'' said  
Michael Baude, the Kansas City exchange's president and chief 
executive. ``Anybody who is really nervous about a big run-up in 
their portfolio of Internet stocks or doesn't want to sell them for 
tax reasons can look at the (Isdex) as an attractive option.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all futures trading, investors in Isdex essentially ``bet''  
the underlying value of the portfolio will be higher or lower at a 
given point, becoming winners or losers if they're right. 
</P>
<P>
	An option gives buyers the right -- but not the obligation -- to  
buy or sell a commodity in the future, so if investors aren't sure 
of a fall or rise, they can take a little longer to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Isdex, which also includes such companies as RealNetworks  
Inc., Yahoo! Inc., CDnow Inc. and Beyond.com Inc., has quarterly 
contract months at $100 multiplied by the futures price. That 
currently represents a basket of stocks with an underlying value of 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial money down is $1,875, with prices fluctuating at a  
minimum of $5 per contract, or .05 point. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange initially expects to attract sophisticated smaller  
investors and larger, institutional hedge funds, but it also hopes 
to draw people from around the world who may be unsure about 
betting on an individual company, said Jeff Borchrdt, the 
exchange's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Borchrdt noted the futures contract, if successful, could help  
remove some of the volatility of Internet stocks since the index 
would most likely be used to balance potential losses from 
individual investments. That could help prevent panic selling, 
lower broker commission costs and cut tax obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, futures trading is not for the faint-hearted. The active  
contract swung 100 points in the first two hours of trading, from a 
high of 598.33 to a low of 494.36. If trading started at 500 
points, someone made more than $9,830 at the high, while another 
investor lost $600 at the low. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say investors may be more interested in betting the  
index will fall over time, but few could be willing to bet it will 
rise. That could create a gap between buyers and sellers that would 
render the index useless. 
</P>
<P>
	To interest investors, the exchange is offering free real-time  
quotes off its Web site (www.kcbt.com) and simulated trading for up 
to one month.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch To Offer Online Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the nation's largest stock  
brokerage, shook the securities industry Tuesday by announcing it 
will let customers trade stocks over the Internet for $29.95 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision marks a grudging and dramatic change for Merrill  
Lynch, which has spent decades forging a nationwide network of 
14,000 brokers who give investment advice and who earn commissions 
of hundreds of dollars for placing stock trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill debated for months whether online trading would  
undermine its traditional brokerage services. The firm was finally 
swayed by the rapid loss of business to a growing number of online 
brokers such as Charles Schwab, ETrade and Ameritrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the most important decision we have made as  
an organization since the mid-1970s,'' said David Komansky, 
Merrill's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's Internet strategy, which competitors are likely  
to follow, reflects the revolutionary impact of the Internet on 
financial services. With more than 7 million Americans trading 
online, Merrill and others can no longer ignore the sea change. 
Online trades now account for between 30 percent and 35 percent of 
all individual trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared foolish for us to ignore that part of the  
market,'' Komansky said. ``So we decided to attack it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's a big change from a year ago when Merrill's brokerage  
chief John Steffens was badmouthing online trading big-time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The do-it-yourself model of investing, centered on Internet  
trading, should be regarded as a serious threat to Americans' 
financial lives,'' he told an audience at the PC Expo conference in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	As Merrill embarks on its new strategy, it faces big risks.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of Merrill's brokers stand to lose up to 18 percent of  
their pay as customers bypass their services and trade via the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill is also charging more than many rivals, some of whom  
offer trades for as little as $5. And, Merrill is setting another 
high bar: a minimum $20,000 to open an account. Finally, by waiting 
until December to launch the new service, competitors will have 
time to respond with their own products. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Merrill is preparing for battle.  
</P>
<P>
	Executives gave their Internet strategy the code name  
``Rubicon,'' the river Julius Caesar crossed on his way to take 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Merrill's clear targets: Charles Schwab, which caters to  
a similar upper-middle-class clientele and also charges $29.95 for 
online trades. Shares of Charles Schwab dropped $6 to $99.50 
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned,'' said Charles Schwab, chairman and chief  
executive of the San Francisco-based brokerage. ``What they're 
introducing is the affirmation of what we've been talking about a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other online brokers also got pounded: Shares of ETrade fell  
$5.18 3/4 to $39.31 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while Ameritrade 
dipped $9.93 3/4 to $79.75, also on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill's own stock dropped $8.75, or 10 percent, to $75.25 on  
the NYSE, though Komansky blamed it on the recent run up in 
Merrill's stock price and concerns in the market about inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	A second part of Merrill's Internet strategy involves more  
affluent investors. They will be offered an account with free, 
unlimited trading, either with a broker, online or over the phone, 
in return for an annual fee ranging from 0.02 percent to 1 percent 
of assets. As assets grow, the rate falls, but the minimum fee is 
$1,500. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to free research reports offered to all of its  
online customers, Merrill will offer its premium account holders 
financial planning, free ATM withdrawals and a Visa Signature 
credit card, which offers a wide-ranging reward program. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's traditional brokerage firms will have to match  
Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else sure as heck better follow suit or they're  
going to run the risk of not keeping up with their customers,'' 
said Scott Birnbaum, head of financial services for Mercer 
Management Consulting Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	One full-service brokerage firm is already online. Donaldson,  
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, which has about 400 brokers, last week spun off 
its online trading division, DLJ Direct into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	DLJ Direct had 519,000 online accounts at the end of March, up  
21 percent from March 1998. Daily trades via the Internet more than 
doubled to 20,200 over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
	PaineWebber, which has a nationwide staff of 7,000 brokers, will  
begin offering two types of online trading the fall. One account 
will charge a flat fee for a set number of trades. Another account 
will charge a fixed fee for financial advice, and then charge low 
fee for each trade.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball: Umpires Faulted for Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Umpires erred in consulting a TV replay to  
reverse a call and will be barred from doing so in the future, 
baseball officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman said umpire Frank Pulli should not have  
used television to decide that Florida's Cliff Floyd hit a double 
and not a home run Monday in the fifth inning of the Marlins' 5-2 
loss to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman said Pulli, who with 28 years is second in seniority  
among NL umpires, was ``acting in good faith'' but made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Use of the video replay is not an acceptable practice,''  
Coleman said. ``Part of the beauty of baseball is that it is 
imperfect. Players make errors. Managers are constantly 
second-guessed. But the game is played and determined by two teams 
between the white lines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd claimed the drive was a homer because it bounced off the  
facade behind the left-field scoreboard in Miami. Second-base 
umpire Greg Gibson thought the ball hit off the scoreboard and 
called it a double, but after the Marlins began to argue, the 
umpiring crew conferred briefly, and Pulli -- the crew chief and 
third-base ump -- changed the ruling to a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals then protested, and the game was delayed for more  
than five minutes while Pulli studied replays on a TV camera near 
the Marlins' dugout. After consulting the replay, Pulli changed the 
call back to a double. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, baseball has relied on the eyes of the umpires  
as opposed to any artificial devices for its judgments,'' Coleman 
said. ``I fully support this policy. Occasionally, however, the 
umpires too will make mistakes; that is also part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, speaking in Miami before tonight's game, agreed with  
Coleman's decision. He said allowing replays would lead to more 
arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	``You set yourself up for it to happen again, and you're going  
to have tons of people thrown out of the game. They'll be arguing 
until they're green in the face,'' Floyd said. ``Most guys make 
history by hitting two grand slams in a game or something. I make 
history by hitting a ball that's reviewed on instant replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Bottenfield, the winning pitcher in the game, also thought  
replays were inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never cared for it in football,'' he said. ``I'm kind of  
a traditionalist, and I'd rather not see it in baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig agreed with his NL counterpart.  
</P>
<P>
	``Major league games are determined between the lines, and  
electronic assistance is not permitted,'' Budig said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins filed a written protest today, but because Florida  
would have gained only one more run if the play had been ruled a 
homer, it's unlikely the protest will be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulli said he consulted the replay because he became confused  
about the ground rules. He declined to be more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things went through my mind,'' he said Monday. ``I  
hope I don't have to go to the replay again. I don't want it to 
become like football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL had replay from 1986-91 and reinstated it last March  
after a series of game-deciding calls that replay showed were 
incorrect. It is limited to out-of-bounds, goal line and possession 
calls and is based on a coaches' challenge system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intended for the crucial, game-deciding play, not the  
third-and-10 in the first quarter,'' NFL commissioner Paul 
Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA does not allow replays and the NHL allows it only to  
determine goals. College basketball has allowed officials to use 
replays to help reset the clock. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1997, soccer's International Board rejected the use of  
replays by officials, an idea proposed by Germany and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anxious television doesn't take over the game by  
controlling the referee,'' said Sepp Blatter, then FIFA's general 
secretary and now its president. ``Football is composed of human 
beings, human frailties, mistakes and errors. We have to live with 
that.''

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Is Tops in NCAA Discus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) --Fresh from an exam that took longer than  
expected, Gabor Mate raced across Auburn's campus on a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that he's late. He still greets everyone he passes.  
When he finally climbs off the bike and strolls across the track, 
Mate declines to sit for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll stand,'' the 6-foot-6 Hungarian said. ``I am a sportsman,  
you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is.  
</P>
<P>
	Mate, a 20-year-old freshman, enters Wednesday's NCAA Outdoor  
Track and Field Championships in Boise, Idaho, as the nation's top 
discus thrower. 
</P>
<P>
	Mate (pronounced Mah-tay) arrived in the United States on Jan.  
1. He expected to do well at Auburn, but never this well. 
</P>
<P>
	His throw of 202 feet, 7 inches at last month's Reebok  
Invitational is the best in the NCAA this year. He's won six of the 
seven tournament's he's entered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that in college there are a lot of good throwers so it  
is a big pleasure to have the best mark right now,'' he said in 
accented, yet fluid, English. ``But I am too young for this sport -- 
you could not call yourself world class until you are around 26 
years old. I still have years to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing that made it easier for Mate to leave Hungary. In his  
hometown of Bekescsaba, he could be an athlete or a student -- not 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mate nor his father would settle for that. So the two  
discussed sending Mate to the United States to study and train. 
</P>
<P>
	They made up their mind watching the 1996 Olympics. Hungary's  
Balazs Kiss had left the country to attend Southern California and 
won a gold medal in the hammer throw during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew then that the U.S. college system offered me many  
opportunities that I would not have at home,'' Mate said. ``I want 
to be an Olympian, but if I tried to do that in Hungary I would be 
nothing after the age of 35. In the U.S., I can learn to be a 
successful businessman also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first Mate had to pay for an American education. He said two  
months of his parents' salary comes out to be about $500. So a 
scholarship was his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from high school in 1997, Mate took off all of  
1998 to train. His goal was to attract college recruiters while 
competing in junior events. He wrote to schools, but only one coach 
got in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Clayton was an assistant at Florida when he contacted the  
Hungarian federation about athletes interested in coming to the 
United States. They gave him Mate's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a tradition of strong throwers in Hungary, so he  
could have trained there and had a great career,'' Clayton said. 
``But he wouldn't have had an opportunity to get an education, and 
that's something that is important to Gabor and his family. Gabor 
is very strong in the classroom and values getting a degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate was immediately interested in Florida, but then Clayton  
took an assistant job at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mate made his first trip to the United States in November. He  
and his father visited Auburn and South Carolina, bypassing other 
schools out of loyalty to Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton promised he would help Mate throw between 3 and 6 feet  
further within a year -- Mate is already throwing 10 feet further 
then when he arrived at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mate win an NCAA title this week, he and Clayton won't be  
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our real goal right now is for the Sydney Olympics, for him to  
meet the qualifying standard and make his country's team,'' Clayton 
said. ``Right now, he only ranks about fifth or sixth in Hungary, 
so we want him to get up there with the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate also has another goal -- to convince Clayton to offer a  
scholarship to his 15-year-old sister, Katalin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a sports crazy family and right now she is so jealous  
for me and what I am doing here,'' Mate said. ``But she is the 
talented one and someday I will be so jealous for her because she 
might be the best in the world.''

<HEADLINE> GM Installs 'Black Box' on Autos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- General Motors Corp. has installed devices in  
hundreds of thousands of its cars that collect data when a car 
crashes much like a black box on an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, engineers and government officials say the information  
can help them better understand how the human body tolerates car 
crashes. They plan to apply that knowledge to construct safer cars, 
improve the treatment of crash victims and write government auto 
safety standards that would better protect passengers in auto 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The existence of the so-called auto black box system also is  
raising sensitive privacy questions about whether such information 
can be used in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The most sophisticated version of GM's device, known formally as  
a sensing and diagnostic module, is in hundreds of thousands of GM 
cars from the 1999 model year: the Buick Century, Park Avenue and 
Regal, the Cadillac Eldorado, DeVille and SeVille, the Chevrolet 
Camaro and Corvette and the Pontiac Firebird. 
</P>
<P>
	The module will be in almost all GM vehicles in a few years, the  
company says. 
</P>
<P>
	The module, part of the air bag sensing system, stores  
information in the few seconds before a car sensor identifies a 
crash and fires the air bags. The data includes the speed of the 
car, whether the driver was wearing a seat belt, when an air bag 
deployed and whether the driver used the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has quietly installed different versions of the sensing  
system on some cars throughout the 1990s, but the modules have 
become more sophisticated over time. Their existence became public 
in a paper written by GM and government engineers and presented at 
a conference last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until now, government crash investigators could only take an  
educated guess at the speed of a car involved in an accident based 
on evidence at the crash scene. 
</P>
<P>
	GM is currently the only automaker that makes such data and a  
tool to recover it available to researchers, the paper said. GM 
hopes to have laptops available so government crash investigators 
can download data independently of the company by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lange, director of engineering safety for GM, said he wanted  
to use the device to collect crash injury information from all age 
groups so that autos could be designed to further ``reduce the 
likelihood of injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The module helped GM figure out last year why some air bags were  
deploying inadvertently, leading to a recall of more than 850,000 
Cavaliers and Sunfires to change a computer software program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an incredible opportunity to improve safety,'' said  
Dr. Jeffrey Augenstein of the Crash Injury Research and Engineering 
Network. Augenstein said if doctors know more about crashes, they 
can target their treatment of patients, in some cases including 
checks for serious injuries they might have missed. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hinch, a research engineer at the National Highway Traffic  
Safety Administration and one of the authors of the paper, said he 
saw ``lots of potential'' for the module's data. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can understand crashes better, we can have better  
sensors (in automobiles), better air bags,'' Hinch said. ``NHTSA 
can build better (safety) rules and have better information for 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers also seem to favor so-called black boxes for cars, in  
part because it would help them determine who is at fault in 
accidents. But they say state courts will first have to sort 
through how such devices could be used in litigation and whether 
they are reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Jolly, an attorney who has litigated auto cases, said he  
has already seen auto companies try to use air bag deployment 
information stored on a car computer chip as a defense in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Jolly and Richard Schiffrin, another lawyer involved in auto  
lawsuits, believe companies will not be able to keep such 
information private. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inevitable that information from a technology such as  
this would find its way into the public domain -- either through 
litigation arising out of an automobile accident or an 
investigation,'' Schiffrin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. said a more limited version of the module was on  
all its 1999 vehicles, but the company is unable to retrieve the 
data for customers. DaimlerChrysler AG also has a limited version 
that can detect whether an air bag deploys but a spokesman said the 
company was still considering other applications of the technology.

<HEADLINE> Interest Rates Up in Treasury Sale / T-Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Tuesday's auction to the highest level in nearly 
nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills  
at a discount rate of 4.620 percent, up from 4.495 percent last 
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a 
rate of 4.750 percent, up from 4.570 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since Sept. 21, 1998, when  
the bills sold for 4.635 percent. The six-month rate was the 
highest since last Sept. 14, when the rate was 4.755. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.753 percent for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,883.20, and 4.947 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,759.90. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index 
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 4.93 
percent last week from 4.89 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Leafs Content With Accomplishments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Steve Thomas will not be joining his Toronto  
Maple Leafs teammates on the golf course anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	The separated right shoulder and cracked collarbone he played  
with during the NHL's Eastern Conference final will have to heal 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about this out of any kind of bravado,''  
Thomas said as the 1998-99 Leafs gathered in their Air Canada 
Centre dressing room one last time Tuesday. ``I didn't know if, at 
this stage of my career, I would be in this position again. 
</P>
<P>
	``So I wanted to play. I wanted to push myself as far as I could  
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was injured May 17, the night Toronto eliminated  
Pittsburgh, and kept it a secret while taking injections for five 
games against the Buffalo Sabres. He was bodychecked by Vaclav 
Varada on the damaged shoulder late in the first period of the 
Sabres' 4-2 series clincher Monday night, but after gathering his 
senses, and being stitched across the right eyebrow to close a cut, 
he finished the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be golfing for a while, that's for sure, Thomas  
said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While disappointed their season was over, the players were  
content with their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going through what we went through, the intensity of these  
playoffs, is something we'll take and put in the bank,'' Thomas 
said. ``This was a learning experience that will help us get to the 
next level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Captain Mats Sundin spoke of the morning after.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's an emptiness,'' he said. ``You work so hard, and now all  
you feel is that the energy has been sucked out of you. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's been by far the most exciting hockey season for  
myself. There was a great chemistry in the room, a feeling that we 
could win every night. We had a great run in the playoffs. We fell 
short in the end but we gained a lot of experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After missing the playoffs two years in a row, the Leafs  
finished fourth in the East with 97 points -- two off the club 
record -- and won a club-record 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
	They led the NHL in goals with 268. Six Leafs scored at least 20  
as they went from a boring defensive club to a fast-skating, 
exciting team in head coach Pat Quinn's first season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiring Quinn and signing goaltender Curtis Joseph were keys to  
the 28-point improvement. Associate general manager Mike Smith made 
good trades, including the one that landed Bryan Berard for 
disgruntled Felix Potvin. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's contract expires, and if the ``associate'' is not  
removed from his title by GM-president Ken Dryden, Smith is 
expected to quit and search out a GM's job with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's status, and the expansion and entry drafts later this  
month provide Dryden with a heavy workload to begin the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	Garry Valk is set to become an unrestricted free agent and Quinn  
wants him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich is in line for a new contract, and  
said Tuesday he expects to re-sign without a hassle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be a holdout,'' Yushkevich said. ``I want to  
be with the team at the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be part of this team.''  
</P>
<P>
	Quinn was encouraged by the development of his younger players,  
especially defensemen Berard, Tomas Kaberle and Daniil Markov, and 
he pinpointed the change he wants added: toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to play better in the pits, in the one-on-one battles  
on the boards, in front of the net,'' he said. ``It's going to be a 
challenge because there will be expectations now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most pressing on-ice personnel needs are a left-winger for  
Sundin and Thomas, and a defenseman with a booming shot to 
quarterback an impotent power play. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, however, is a day of rest and reflection.  
</P>
<P>
	``We were on a journey from the start of the season,'' said  
veteran forward Tie Domi. ``Pat hit the nail on the head right from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Let's not just aim to make the playoffs. Let's try  
to do something here this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're another player or two away but, hopefully, next  
year we can be where Buffalo is this year, go all the way. The city 
is starving for it.''

<HEADLINE> Ramirez Unfazed by Bat Accusations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Here's how bothered Manny Ramirez was by  
accusations from unidentified New York Yankees that he corks his 
bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez sat around Tuesday in the clubhouse with headsets on  
listening to music and watching video of Roger Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
	He joked around with New York's Paul O'Neill before stretching.  
And he talked to friends in the stands from nearby Washington 
Heights during batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manny is pretty consistent in terms of his demeanor and his  
approach,'' Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove said. ``He's as 
unflappable as anybody. I have not talked to Manny about it and I 
don't plan to. It's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned because 
there's no truth to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For his part, Ramirez had nothing to say. But that's nothing  
new. He hasn't talked to reporters most of the season, anyway. But 
the rest of the Indians were pretty upset. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar suggested checking Derek Jeter's bat. Hitting  
coach Charley Manuel was angry that whatever Yankees made the 
accusations wouldn't identify themselves. Hargrove was just plain 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really sad that they accused Manny of this,'' Hargrove  
said. ``The thing is, he was using Sandy Alomar's bat. If he is 
corking the bat, as strong as he is, he'd have a lot more than 14 
homers. Manny doesn't cheat. Manny doesn't need to cheat. Plain and 
simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez has been one of the hottest hitters in the game. He  
entered Tuesday night hitting .350 with 14 homers and 63 RBIs. He 
is on pace to drive in 208 runs, 18 more than Hack Wilson's major 
league record. 
</P>
<P>
	The success is nothing new, as Ramirez averaged 40 homers and  
115 RBIs the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations came after Ramirez reached out to hit a low and  
away slider from Orlando Hernandez with one hand over the 
center-field fence. No one thought the ball had a chance to go out, 
including Ramirez who stopped at second base thinking it must have 
been a ground-rule double. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not talking about Manny,'' Manuel said. ``They think his  
bat is corked? Tell them to check it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre didn't want to talk about it either.  
His answer to every question about the accusations was, ``I don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said he doesn't plan to retaliate by checking the bat  
of a Yankees player. And he'd be surprised if the Yankees actually 
did check Ramirez's bat. But he says the Indians have nothing to 
hide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone can come into our locker room whenever they want,''  
Hargrove said. ``They can check any bat they want. They won't find 
anything.''

<HEADLINE> Nevada Has Highest Rate of Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Tony Hammond arrived in Las Vegas on a  
Greyhound bus with $250 in his pocket and, like migrants 
everywhere, hopes for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
	Four months later, he was penniless and on the streets.  
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-seven and homeless,'' says Hammond, staring at the  
ground, his face flushed with embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond is hardly alone. In fact, beneath Nevada's bustling  
image -- its billion-dollar high-rise casinos and nonstop 
entertainment -- lies a more desperate reality: America's 
fastest-growing state has suicide and dropout rates that lead the 
nation, a teen-pregnancy rate near the top. The number of gun 
deaths recently ranked second only to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's allure may be part of its problem.  
</P>
<P>
	Every month, thousands of new residents flood Las Vegas, where  
two-thirds of Nevadans live. Some are enticed by the low cost of 
living and the promise of a booming economy in a state that has led 
the nation in population growth for 13 consecutive years. Others, 
nomads who've failed elsewhere, gamble on making it amid the 
glitter and hustle of a 24-hour town. 
</P>
<P>
	``We attract a lot of these people, drifters, people that  
haven't been able to hold jobs. They come in droves and then they 
fill the welfare list,'' said Bill Thompson, a professor of public 
administration and gambling expert at the University of Nevada, Las 
Vegas. ``Many are third-chancers, fourth-chancers. We're the last 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A variety of figures indicate that many of these dreams end in  
failure: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nevada had the highest suicide rate in the nation in 1995, the  
latest year for which federal statistics are available. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Violence Policy Center, an anti-gun group, recently ranked  
Nevada second in the number of gun deaths. Louisiana was first. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nevada ranks among the unhealthiest states in the country,  
according to Minneapolis-based ReliaStar Financial Corp., finishing 
47th in 1997. It scored poorly for the prevalence of smoking, motor 
vehicle deaths, violent crime, risk of heart disease and for its 
high school graduation rates. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A recent study by UNLV said that some 6.6 percent of Clark  
County residents are pathological or problem gamblers; more than 
half know at least one person afflicted with problem gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A recent national report said 17 percent of students aged 16  
to 19 dropped out of Nevada's high schools in 1996. That ranked the 
state worst in the nation, where the average was 10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Nevada was among the 10 worst states in terms of births among  
girls ages 15 to 19 in 1996, according to the Kids Count 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Some officials, including state health officer Dr. Mary Guinan,  
blame Nevada's leaders for perpetuating a lax attitude toward 
social problems. Says Guinan: ``Nevada has not traditionally 
invested in prevention.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Progressive Alliance of Nevada, a lobbying group that promotes  
aggressive state policies on health issues, ranks Nevada 50th per 
capita for spending on health care and No. 1 in health-related 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevada's stingy,'' said Bob Fulkerson, the group's director.  
``Even in the best of economic times, we have barely paid for 
social health programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others say solutions are more elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	``These unfortunate social problems exist worldwide. It's part  
of the human race. Why it stands out in Nevada I don't know,'' said 
Chris Chrystal, spokeswoman for the Nevada Commission on Tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials acknowledge problems, but cite some improvement.  
``I think we've had just this tremendous growth and that certainly 
affects all of us,'' said Gov. Kenny Guinn, who recently proposed a 
program to help improve the state's dropout rate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're struggling somewhat when you look at our sources of  
income, sales tax and gaming taxes. When that doesn't do as well as 
we would like, it puts the state of Nevada in a very difficult 
situation,'' Guinn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hammond, who moved to Las Vegas from Lucerne Valley, Calif.,  
isn't quite sure what went wrong. He thought he could live on $250 
until he found a casino job. But his money ran out before could get 
an interview or a $35 sheriff's card, which is required to work in 
a casino. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured I would have a job in two weeks. I figured two weeks  
-- it's Vegas, it's happening,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other failed dreams converge at St. Vincent's homeless shelter,  
where a line of 200 men waiting for an evening meal weaves around 
the corner. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrice McCarty is one. The 22-year-old found himself homeless  
after being turned down for jobs at fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just gave up. It's basically suicide out here,'' he said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The Western Hemisphere's leading publishers'  
group sent a high-level delegation to Mexico on Tuesday, demanding 
progress in the unsolved cases of journalists who have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Inter American Press Association President Jorge E. Fascetto  
said the group would urge the government resolve the cases quickly 
and would propose the creation of a special unit in the attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member delegation planned to meet Wednesday with  
President Ernesto Zedillo. 
</P>
<P>
	The IAPA says more than 20 journalists apparently have been  
killed for doing their jobs in Mexico over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, which represents more than 1,300 publications

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said  
Tuesday he was preparing a bill that would ban the sale of firearms 
and ammunition in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso said that according to the United Nations, Brazil was  
the world leader in crimes committed with firearms and asked 
Congress to take urgent action on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here today to tell you that we will take a energetic  
stance against violence,'' Cardoso said in a his weekly radio 
address. ``Everyday we have alarming news about deaths provoked by 
the indiscriminate use of firearms. Even in schools firearms are 
being used with fatal results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, only members of the military, police and private  
security firms could purchase firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, the Rio de Janeiro state assembly approved a  
similar bill 41-10, banning the sale of firearms throughout the 
state. The state governor is expected to sign it.

	QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador plans to sell off or grant  
concessions to at least half its state-owned companies by 2001, 
pending Congress' approval, a top government official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvaro Guerrero, head of Ecuador's privatization agency, told  
Dow Jones newswires the government hopes to bring in about $4 
billion from the privatizations, which will include electricity 
generators, concessions to various highways, the state telephone 
company and oil installations. 
</P>
<P>
	The privatization drive, if approved, will begin in December  
with the sale of six of the government's 25 electricity generators, 
Guerrero said. The state telephone company would be sold in the 
first quarter of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	President Jamil Mahuad took office 10 months ago promising to  
modernize Ecuador's economy and sell off its inefficient state 
companies. Powerful unions have said they will try to block the 
privatizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The poor South American nation is locked in its worst economic  
crisis in recent decades with the economy expected to shrink by 5 
percent this year and inflation topping 100 percent.

</P>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's  
approval rating has plunged to one of its lowest levels ever, 
according to a poll released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, prepared for the National Transportation Confederation  
by the Vox Populi Institute, showed 51 percent of respondents 
considers Cardoso's administration ``bad or very bad,'' 32 percent 
sees it as ``adequate'' and only 15 percent said it was ``good or 
very good.'' Two percent had no opinion. The margin of error was 3 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Confederation President Clesio Andrade said Cardoso's poor  
showing was mostly due to negative fallout from investigations into 
irregularities in Brazil's financial and judicial systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso was re-elected to a second term in October largely due  
to his successful economic policies. But the recession and 
unemployment that accompanied this success continue unabated.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Econoomy Expands in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's industrial sector expanded for a  
fourth straight month in May, but indications of strong price rises 
in raw materials for the first time in 16 months sent shivers 
through financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its  
monthly index of business activity rose to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in 
April -- a much stronger showing than analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Most startling, however, was the rise in the association's price  
index, which jumped to 52.2 in May from 49.9 in April. It was the 
first time since December 1997 that manufacturers indicated they 
were seeing higher input prices, the trade association said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such readings disturb financial markets, which have been  
concerned that the Federal Reserve may follow through on its threat 
to raise interest rates if it sees inflation building up in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down almost 270 points last  
week as inflation jitters grew on Wall Street, was off an 
additional 110 at midday, and long-term Treasury bond yields were 
edging closer toward 6 percent, reaching the highest level in more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a certain feeling (in the market) that the question is  
when, not if, rates will be raised,'' said Anthony Chan, chief 
economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there were indications in other economic gauges released  
today that inflationary pressures for the time being are limited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board, a nonprofit business research group, said  
in a separate report that its Index of Leading Economic Indicators 
-- a gauge of future economic activity -- declined in April for the 
first time since June 1998, suggesting some softening in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	And a Commerce Department report said construction spending fell  
by a sharp 2.4 percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in 
more than five years for an industry that has been a driving force 
in the economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers, a group that represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for manufacturers, saw some good in 
the rise in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though commodity prices are active and rising, we must keep in  
mind the extent of the decline that they have experienced. Many 
commodity producers have had a tough time over the last year and a 
half and some upward movement probably constitutes welcome 
relief,'' said the report released by Norbert J. Ore, director of 
purchasing at Chesapeake Corp., and chairman of the Business Survey 
Committee of the purchasing managers' group. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that he did not expect the price increases -- which  
showed up most strongly in petroleum products, metals, plastics and 
paper -- to be passed by manufacturers to their customers because 
``there is still considerable excess capacity'' in the industrial 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board said the Index of Leading Economic  
Indicators fell 0.1 percent in April to 107.1, the first decline 
since June 1998, when the gauge fell 0.2 percent. A revised figure 
for March showed the index unchanged at 107.2 from the previous 
month following five consecutive monthly increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had been expecting a slight rise in the index.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the  
Conference Board, said that a single month's dip in the index did 
not necessarily signal that the economy's strong growth would 
falter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at trends over six months before we have any  
concern,'' Boldin said. He noted that despite April's decline, the 
index was up some 1.3 percent over the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like only a temporary pause, although last week's  
drop in the stock market adds some complications,'' Boldin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``With most of the leading indicators, including the stock  
market, showing increases this year and the economy showing growth 
in so many areas, this expansion should continue and become the 
longest ever in early 2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Conference Board's index of coincident indicators, which  
measure current activity, rose 0.2 percent in April, while it's 
lagging index which reflects the economy's past performance, rose 
0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Study: Clot Drugs Help Blood Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY SUSAN PARROTT   	
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A new regimen for treating heart attacks could  
save thousands of patients who aren't helped by current 
clot-busting therapy and could eliminate the need for some 
angioplasty or bypass surgery, a new study shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors added a ``super-aspirin'' called abciximab, or Reopro,  
to a standard clot buster, alteplase, also known as Activase. They 
found it restored normal blood flow in the hearts of more than 
three-quarters of heart attack victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The international study was published in today's edition of  
Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. It was 
intended to see if abciximab could boost the effectiveness of 
alteplase. Alteplase and similar drugs such as TPA (tissue 
plasminogen activator) are already a mainstay of heart attack 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We demonstrated that a combination of two drugs is better than  
one drug for opening blocked arteries,'' said Dr. Elliott M. 
Antman, director of the Coronary Care Unit at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston. ``We can open up blocked arteries faster and 
more extensively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both drugs are administered intravenously.  
</P>
<P>
	Antman said the new therapy could be the biggest advance in  
heart attack treatment since clot-busting drugs were introduced 15 
years ago. But he said that additional research may be needed 
before the therapy is put into clinical practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs are complementary, Antman said, because alteplase  
dissolves blood clots, while abciximab keeps platelets and proteins 
from clumping. 
</P>
<P>
	Aspirin also blocks platelets. But abciximab is much more  
potent, which is why the drug is often called a ``super-aspirin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antman's study included 888 heart attack patients at 63  
hospitals in North America, Britain, the Netherlands, France and 
Germany and examined the ability of the drugs to dissolve blood 
clots within 60 to 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study showed that 72 percent of patients who received  
abciximab plus half the standard dose of alteplase achieved optimal 
blood flow in their arteries within 60 minutes. Only 43 percent of 
patients had normal blood flow with TPA alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Within 90 minutes, 77 percent of patients treated with both  
drugs had optimal blood flow, compared with 62 percent with 
alteplase alone. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers ``have made a major contribution'' to the  
management of heart attacks, Dr. J. Ward Kennedy of the University 
of Washington wrote in an editorial about the research in 
Circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The advent of clot-busting therapy has revolutionized heart  
attack care by halting deadly damage to heart muscle. However, 
clot-busters alone are not always effective, and many individuals 
develop recurrent blood clots. 
</P>
<P>
	``By enhancing the effects of clot-busters, abciximab may  
improve the treatment for heart attacks, and allow more patients to 
be treated with drugs rather than angioplasty and surgery,'' Antman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers estimate that the new double-drug treatment will  
save 20 additional lives for every 1,000 heart attack patients who 
receive it. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Co. and Centocor, which  
together market abciximab.

<HEADLINE> Rules Keep Welfare Aid Unspent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $3 billion pool of federal money to help the  
welfare recipients with the toughest problems break into the 
workforce has barely been tapped as states scramble to find clients 
who fit the strict rules. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year and a half, only about 8 percent of the first  
year's money has been spent, according to figures obtained by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is depressingly slow considering it started so long ago,  
but usually once these things start moving, they start moving,'' 
said John Twomey, who runs an umbrella group for county boards in 
New York that distribute the federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials are asking Congress to change  
the rules so more people can qualify. The money was targeted toward 
recipients with histories of substance abuse, poor education and 
long dependencies on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also is seeking an additional $1 billion in  
2000. But local welfare directors are urging Congress to spend the 
money elsewhere. And at least one key lawmaker agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly not going to put more money into it, because  
it's not working,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who chairs 
the House Ways and Means welfare subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson predicted, however, that Congress will change the rules  
to make it easier for more people to qualify, particularly 
low-income fathers of children on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the states and at the Labor Department, which runs  
the program, cite several problems, including bureaucratic delays 
getting it started as well as the eligibility rules. 
</P>
<P>
	To participate, most recipients must have spent at least two and  
a half years on welfare or must be nearing their lifetime limit for 
benefits. They must also have two out of three other problems: 
substance abuse, a poor work history and low educational skills -- 
defined as no high school diploma plus poor reading ability. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases that could mean that ``If you have a high school  
diploma but can't read it, we can't serve you,'' Labor Secretary 
Alexis Herman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herman wants Congress to ease the eligibility rules, hoping to  
focus more on absentee dads. ``We can't finish the job of welfare 
reform without doing more to help people who have the hardest 
time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal program also has run into unexpected competition  
from local welfare agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton proposed the program in 1997 hoping to help  
Americans facing tough new welfare rules to find work. He and 
others feared those with the toughest problems would be left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
	But, as it turned out, the new rules and the robust economy  
helped the welfare rolls drop faster than anyone predicted. That 
left states with fewer clients and more money to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
	Ana Osegueda, a case manager in San Francisco, says she would  
like to use the program more but most of her clients don't fit the 
criteria. ``It's really hard to find someone checking `yes' in all 
those boxes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's rare, she said, for a welfare recipient to admit up front  
to drug or mental health problems. And if someone doesn't qualify, 
she explained, the agency has plenty of money to send clients to 
other community-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress gave the Labor Department $3 billion over two years for  
grants to states and private groups to provide job training, 
counseling, resume-writing, day care assistance and other help for 
the most needy welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1997, Labor released just over $1 billion to 44  
states, plus the District of Columbia and three territories, that 
opted to participate. An additional half billion was awarded 
directly to communities through a competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Through March, just $83.5 million of the state money had been  
spent, serving 38,705 participants. And last October, Labor got an 
additional $1.5 billion to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	States, which must match every $2 of federal money with $1 in  
state money, have three years to spend the grants. 
</P>
<P>
	There are some success stories. In Philadelphia, some 2,500 are  
working through the program, thanks in part to an advertising 
campaign that urges people to ask their caseworkers about the 
federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	Phylis Kelley had been on welfare for five years when she and  
her 3-year-old son saw an ad. He asked if she had a job, and Kelley 
was embarrassed by the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have answers for him, much less myself,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She found this program different from others she'd tried. An  
employment adviser helped her arrange child care, set up 
transportation and buy work clothes -- and promised to stick with 
Kelley for a year, helping address whatever problems arose. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is now making $8.75 per hour as a receptionist.  
</P>
<P>
	``I had no idea how many jobs were available,'' she said. ``Who  
knew it would be this easy?''

<HEADLINE> Teens Tried for Death of Gay Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Lawyers for two high school  
dropouts admitted Tuesday that the teen-agers beat a gay man to 
death, but they claimed it was not because of his sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Donahue, 17, and Billy Dodge, 18, are on trial for  
allegedly beating and kicking Steven Goedereis in front of a closed 
convenience store last year. The teen-agers are charged with 
second-degree murder and could be sentenced to life in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Goedereis, 29, was beaten beyond recognition. Blood splatters  
were found on the overhang of the building. There was a sneaker 
imprint on his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the attack was provoked when the soft-spoken,  
118-pound Goedereis called one of the boys ``beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Dodge and Donahue offered a dramatically different  
version of what happened. They said that Dodge thought Goedereis 
was a man who'd been stalking his girlfriend and that Donahue 
claimed Goedereis had tried to rape him. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case of second-degree murder where Mr. Goedereis  
was singled out because of his sexual preference,'' said Mitchell 
Beers, Dodge's attorney. ``He was chosen because somebody thought 
he was a stalker -- and Bryan told Billy a man tried to rape him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors hope the boys' own statements to police will prove  
otherwise. Both men told police Goedereis had complimented them on 
their looks. And Donahue allegedly told police, ``The fact that he 
was gay upset me the most.''

<HEADLINE> Car-Hauler Talks Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Negotiators for the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to auto showrooms resumed contract 
talks today aimed at averting a strike that could mean long delays 
in the delivery of some models. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think we're making some progress,'' said union president  
James P. Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief negotiator for the management of the National  
Automobile Transporters labor division said the negotiations were 
going, ``slow, but steady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following a post-midnight bargaining session Monday, Hoffa  
announced that today's 12:01 a.m. EDT strike deadline was extended 
for 24 hours to discuss management's ``11th hour'' economic 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	Talks resumed Tuesday morning.  
</P>
<P>
	While company officials declined to comment on their new offer,  
Hoffa said, ``We have some movement by the employer, but there 
still are troubling issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said the main sticking points with the 17 affected  
companies were management proposals to pay a lower wage to newly 
hired drivers and to hire part-time workers. Hoffa told reporters 
the union still was willing to strike over both of those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said, however, that management made ``an important move''  
by dropping a demand to use Mexican drivers and trucks to deliver 
vehicles in the United States after the U.S.-Mexican border opens 
up Jan. 1 under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Company 
officials had said earlier Monday that they had no plans to hire 
Mexican truckers and contended this was not an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, in addition to seeking wage and benefit improvements,  
wants higher retirement pay for drivers who choose to retire after 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations represented the first major challenge at the  
bargaining table for Hoffa, sworn in March 22 as president of the 
union once led by his late father, Jimmy Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	A strike by the drivers who haul cars from factories to  
showrooms could mean longer waits for popular cars, union officials 
have said. Automakers also have worried that if a strike persisted 
beyond several days they would not have space to keep vehicles as 
they come off the assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne, spokesman for the management negotiators of the  
National Automobile Transporters labor division, said the 17 
companies hauled more than 15 million cars last year, but that the 
companies faced stiff competition from railroads and nonunion 
trucking companies. The union has cited ``record profits'' by the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics, yard and  
office workers. Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a year in 
wages and benefits, with salaries of $55,000. The Teamsters said 
management wanted to pay newly hired drivers 30 percent less than 
the contract wage, with gradual increases eventually equalizing the 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed that Hoffa has been a factor in the  
discussions. He was elected in December in the aftermath of a 
campaign finance scandal, and personally led the union negotiating 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very important set of talks for Hoffa,'' said Chip  
Roth, the union spokesman. ``He'll be judged on his ability to 
deliver for the members. He knows the members will be watching 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffa said he felt ``invigorated'' by leading the bargaining  
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief management negotiator, said Hoffa's personal  
stake in the talks ``can't be discounted as a factor. ... Sure, it 
is a political concern that he has. But we're attempting at the 
table to reduce that as a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Healy, an auto industry analyst with Burnham Securities  
Inc., said a strike would have an impact within days. ``Some plants 
could be affected in a day or two because they'd run out of room to 
park vehicles that are coming off the assembly line,'' Healy said. 
He added that dealers' inventories overall are ``normal to slightly 
below normal.'' Roth, the union spokesman, said a strike would mean 
``people would have to wait for the hottest-selling cars.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alan Adler of General Motors Corp. said that GM had  
``contingency plans'' but he did not elaborate. He said that during 
a car-haulers strike in 1995, the company allowed dealers to pick 
up cars from factories.

<HEADLINE> FBI Hunts Federal Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Computer hackers who vandalized five  
government Web sites are being hunted by the FBI and could face 
jail time, FBI and Justice Department officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials took a dim view of the hackers who left a note  
threatening to attack other sites in retaliation for an FBI 
investigation in Texas into hacking at a corporate Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time-consuming and takes a lot of spade work, but we can  
track down many of these hackers, and that's going on now,'' FBI 
spokesman Frank Scafidi said. ``We'll catch a few, no matter how 
deep they hide in their basements. Someone will go to jail for some 
real time. That will have impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scafidi said a Dallas company he would not identify ``lost a few  
million dollars'' because of hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers who cause $5,000 damage in one year can be charged with  
a federal felony that carries up to five years in prison, said 
Scott Charney, head of the Justice Department's computer crime 
section. Merely trespassing on a government computer, without 
authorization and without causing a loss, can bring up to a year in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vandalism at government Web sites could cost more than $5,000  
in employee time and salaries to repair,'' Charney said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, hackers defaced Web sites for the Interior Department  
and a federal supercomputer laboratory in Idaho Falls, Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the sites suggest they were attacked to  
retaliate against what the vandals called the FBI's harassment of 
hacker groups, including one that boasted of breaking into the 
White House site last month. Earlier, a flood of access requests 
forced the FBI to shut down its site, and other hackers defaced the 
U.S. Senate site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do they think we're going to roll over and let them access  
anything they want on the Internet because they issue this 
threat?'' Scafidi asked. ``That's not the way it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're hurting honest individuals -- researchers, students,  
reporters -- who need to get information from these government 
sites,'' Scafidi added. ``It's not hurting the FBI, because they 
can't reach our sensitive data from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest spate of attacks are outside a tradition of so-called  
``ethical hacking devoted to opening up government,'' Charney said. 
``These attacks are preventing people from obtaining government 
information. It's not good for the public or democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like all types of crime, computer crimes are not all solved.  
Cybercrime can leave an electronic audit trail to the culprits, 
Charney said. But the Internet has special difficulties: Access is 
global and there are anonymous remailers that strip and discard the 
identities of those who send messages. 
</P>
<P>
	And computer crime is growing as computer literacy grows.  
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Sentencing Commission found 76 defendants convicted of  
violating computer statutes during 1989-1994 but noted that an 
uncounted number of computer criminals were charged with wire 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 computer crime survey done by the Computer Security  
Institute and the FBI's San Francisco office found that system 
penetration by outsiders increased for the third year in a row. 
Such intrusions were reported by 30 percent of the 521 computer 
security professionals surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Losses also mounted: 163 respondents reported almost $124  
million in losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on the rise was reporting of such incidents to law  
enforcement: 32 percent had done so compared with only 17 percent 
three years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI executed four search warrants last week in Texas in a  
computer intrusion probe, including a search at a prominent Houston 
hacker's home. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Interior Department's Web page, the hackers left a  
message saying they were ``going after every computer on the Net 
with a .gov (suffix). ... We'll keep hitting them until they get 
down on their knees and beg.'' At the site maintained by the Idaho 
National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, a note 
threatened the electronic destruction of powerful computers that 
``serve'' pages on the Internet ``if the FBI doesn't stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted  
Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion. Burns, 
reportedly known as ``Zyklon,'' is believed to belong to the group 
that claimed to have attacked the White House and Senate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon announced that additional  
``firewalls'' were installed in Defense Department computers 
Tuesday to add layers of protection against hacking into Pentagon 
Internet sites. ``We obviously have been watching what's been 
happening on other government agencies, and we are responding to 
that. But it's also part of something that we've been developing 
for some time,'' Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> Polygamist Stands Trial for Incest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A teen-age girl who grew up in a  
polygamist sect testified at her uncle's incest trial today that 
she had four sexual encounters with him after becoming his 15th 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now 17, took the stand as the prosecution's star  
witness against David O. Kingston, 32. The case has focused 
attention on the secretive Kingston clan, which has as many as 
1,000 members and business assets worth up to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The clan shares many of the beliefs of other polygamous groups  
in Utah, but stands apart, former members say, in practicing 
incest. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl said that in a meeting with her parents and Kingston in  
September 1997, ``he said that some of his family had dreams that 
I'd come into his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Oct. 13, 1997, he called her and suggested they marry on the  
15th -- a date Kingston thought was appropriate because she was to 
be his 15th wife, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of a shock. It was in two days. I just wanted more  
time,'' she said, appearing composed and speaking softly. 
</P>
<P>
	With her father performing the ceremony and the defendant's  
other wives in attendance, the girl married her uncle on the 15th, 
she said. Her uncle later gave her a ring with 15 diamonds, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, they had four sexual encounters, all in  
1998, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, who now is in state-supervised foster care, said she  
repeatedly tried to avoid her husband-uncle and would stay out late 
with friends when she knew he was planning to visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston is charged with incest and unlawful sexual contact and  
could be sentenced to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 21, the girl's father, John Daniel Kingston, pleaded no  
contest to child abuse for beating his daughter with a belt. He 
faces up to five years in prison. 
</P>

	Experts place Utah's polygamist population somewhere between  
20,000 and 30,000. About 70 percent of Utah's population are 
members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which 
renounced polygamy in 1890 after Congress passed tough anti-bigamy 
laws.

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending, which had been one of  
the driving forces in the economic expansion, fell by a sharp 2.4 
percent in April, the biggest monthly decline in more than five 
years, the government reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said the declines were widespread with  
decreases reported in single-family homes, apartment buildings, 
office buildings and big government projects. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2.4 percent drop caught analysts by surprise. Many had been  
expecting the country's construction boom to continue in April 
althought at a slightly slower pace than previous months. 
</P>
<P>
	The April decline followed five straight monthly increases  
including a 1.3 percent advance in March and a sizable 2.1 percent 
gain in February. The April decline was the first setback since a 
0.3 percent drop last October and it was the biggest monthly 
decrease since a 3 percent plunge in January 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity, driven by low  
mortgage rates, was a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. Both sales of new 
homes and existing homes hit record highs during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the pace of home sales have cooled somewhat in recent  
months, reflecting rising mortgage rates. Sales of existing 
single-family homes fell 3.3 percent in April after hitting a 
record high in March. Sales of new homes were up in March, but that 
followed four monthly declines. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction report showed that spending on residential  
construction fell by 1 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted 
annual rate of $324.7 billion with both single-family homes and 
apartments suffering declines. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction spending for all private building projects was off  
1.9 percent in April as spending on factories, office buildings, 
hotels and hospitals all saw declines. Spending on private 
construction had been up 1.9 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on government construction projects fell an even  
sharper 4.2 percent in April, the largest decline in this category 
since a 4.8 percent decrease last May. Public spending had fallen 
0.8 percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for highways, hospitals and water supply facilities  
were all down while spending on military facilities and housing 
redevelopment recorded increases. 
</P>
<P>
	For April, spending on all construction projects totaled $697.4  
billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up 8 percent from the 
spending level in April 1998.

<HEADLINE> Motives of Adoption Ring Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A lawyer accused of smuggling Mexican  
children into the United States for illegal adoptions had the best 
of intentions and was only trying to help them, his attorney says. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reyes Burgueno sought to help ``unwanted children of  
prostitutes in large measure and very poor people who simply 
couldn't afford to bring another child into the world,'' said 
Reyes' attorney, Ivan Abrams. ``His intentions were good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes, 41, was arrested last week at his home in the border town  
of Douglas on charges of fraud and alien smuggling. He allegedly 
used Mexican women with legal border-crossing documents to pose as 
mothers to bring babies into Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in New York charged Reyes and co-defendants  
Arlene Reingold and Arlene Lieberman of Medford, N.Y., with running 
an adoption ring that illegally placed 17 Mexican children in 
American homes for up to $22,000 per child. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lieberman, 48, and Mrs. Reingold, 47, neighbors on Long  
Island, were charged with fraud and conspiracy to violate various 
immigration laws. They were released on $150,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutor Steve Yarbrough said the government has no  
plans to remove the Mexican-born children, who lack INS immigration 
documents, from their adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Magistrate Nancy Fiora heard arguments for and against  
releasing Reyes on $50,000 bail at a hearing Tuesday but did not 
issue a ruling.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Airways Cancels More Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Cathay Pacific Airways canceled 47 flights  
Wednesday, as angry pilots staging a sickout planned to meet with 
Hong Kong's labor commissioner to seek any way out of the pay 
dispute that has affected 20,000 passengers over six days. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay said it was working to get all travelers to their  
destinations, and it was able to replace 21 of its grounded 
services with flights chartered from other airlines. But the Hong 
Kong carrier still is not selling tickets or making any new 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hong Kong Aircrew Officers Association, meanwhile, said it  
would meet in the afternoon with the territory's labor 
commissioner, Matthew Cheung, to explain the pilots' predicament 
and seek ways of getting the two sides together. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have to be optimistic,'' John Findlay, the secretary  
general of the air crew union, said by telephone. ``The longer the 
dispute drags on, the more inconvenience the public's going to go 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cathay is seeking pay cuts of up to 8 percent from the pilots in  
exchange for stock options as it tries to cut costs and return to 
profitability amid Asia's economic crisis and Hong Kong's 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the two sides deteriorated last week, when  
Cathay bosses gave the pilots until June 11 to either accept its 
offer, quit or be fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous pilots started phoning in sick, saying the situation  
has left them too stressed to fly -- and forcing the massive 
disruptions in Cathay's schedule. The airline has had to scrap some 
150 flights between Hong Kong and a variety of destinations in 
Asia, North America and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Meets Potential Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton interviewed  
potential campaign staff at the White House on Tuesday, and told at 
least two associates that she intends to seek the Senate seat from 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The associates, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mrs.  
Clinton is virtually certain to seek the seat being vacated by 
retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and is close to finalizing 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton intends to notify New York Rep. Nita Lowey, a  
Democrat who was considering the race herself, of her plans but it 
may be several days before the first lady talks to the 
congresswoman, the associates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not aware of any decision having been made,'' Lowey  
spokesman Howard Wolfson said Tuesday. Wolfson said his boss ``has 
not been told anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A senior adviser to the first lady who is intimately involved in  
her deliberations said the decision is not quite final, ``but she's 
edging awfully close to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official said Mrs. Clinton seemed even more likely to run  
after spending the Memorial Day weekend with her husband in 
Florida. Barring a ``dramatic change of heart,'' she will run, the 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Clinton advisers said there are tentative plans for her to  
announce the formation of an exploratory committee during a trip to 
New York in early July, though they cautioned that another scenario 
under consideration is to announce the committee simply through a 
statement from her White House office. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said:  
``Nothing has changed except that they are back from vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady met Tuesday at the White House with potential  
campaign workers, including Hank Morris, a New York consultant 
coming off Chuck Schumer's victorious 1998 Senate campaign to 
unseat Alfonse D'Amato; Gabrielle Fialkoff, who was the chief 
fund-raiser for New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone's 
unsuccessful gubernatorial bid last year; and Richard A. Riley, a 
veteran New York public relations specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to be in New York Wednesday to give  
the commencement address at City College and attend two political 
events. After the graduation ceremony, she will attend a Manhattan 
luncheon for state Democrats and an evening fund-raiser for U.S. 
Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of Mrs. Clinton's friends and advisers said they expect  
the next step in her deliberative move toward a campaign to be the 
announcement of a formal exploratory committee. That won't likely 
be made official until after Mrs. Clinton's travels abroad June 
15-30. For now, she is scheduled to travel through Europe with 
President Clinton to the summit of G-8 leaders in Germany, and then 
split off for a solo tour through Israel, Jordan and Morocco.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Names Baseball Regional Sites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (AP) -- Cal State Fullerton will play at Ohio  
State in the NCAA super regionals, the only top-seeded team whose 
home field was not selected to host a super regional. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA on Monday announced the hosts for the eight Division I  
baseball super regionals. The hosts were selected Sunday night by 
teleconference, said Dick Rockwell, chairman of the NCAA Division I 
Baseball Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The pairings and sites are: Wake Forest (47-14) at Miami (Fla.)  
(44-13); Southwestern Louisiana (41-22) vs. Rice (56-12) at the 
Astrodome in Houston; LSU (41-22-1) at Alabama (49-14); Oklahoma 
State (44-18) at Baylor (49-13); Auburn (46-17) at Florida State 
(51-12); Clemson (41-25) at Texas A&AMP;M (50-15); Southern California 
(36-24) at Stanford (46-13) and Cal State Fullerton (47-11) at Ohio 
State (49-12). 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell said the decision to have Ohio State host the game with  
top-seeded Cal St.-Fullerton, sprang from the committee's desire to 
expand into new areas of the country this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going to Columbus is the big unknown,'' Rockwell said.  
``Sometimes a blind squirrel can find that acorn. This will be a 
big boost for college baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All eight sites will be a best-of-three series to determine the  
College World Series participants. Each series will be played June 
4 and 5, and June 6 if necessary. Winners advance to the 53rd 
College World Series at Rosenblatt Stadium in Omaha, Neb., which 
begins June 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The College World Series tournament field was expanded this year  
for the from 48 to 64 teams. The committee selected sites for the 
first time because of the expanded bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell said the hosts were selected on the basis of several  
criteria including quality and availability of the sports facility, 
geographic location, attendance history and revenue potential.

<HEADLINE> Panthers Sign Highly Touted Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Panthers have signed highly  
touted right wing Ivan Novoseltsev to a three-year contract, just 
beating a Tuesday deadline to keep him from re-entering the NHL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial terms were not disclosed. Novoseltsev, a fourth-round  
pick two years ago, reportedly was seeking a deal matching the 
entry-level cap for 1997 draftees of $925,000 per season. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Panthers and Novoseltsev had not reached agreement by  
midnight Tuesday, the speedy Russian would have become eligible for 
the June 26 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Novoseltsev, 20, scored 57 goals in 68 games last season for  
Sarnia, finishing second in the Ontario Hockey League by one goal. 
He also had 39 assists and led the OHL with 10 game-winning goals, 
drawing comparisons to high-scoring Panthers wing Pavel Bure. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a quality prospect,'' Panthers assistant general manager  
Chuck Fletcher said. ``He's a good young player who had a good year 
and can score goals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Fletcher indicated Novoseltsev may need another year of  
seasoning before he's ready to help the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any 20-year-old, for that matter, would have a tough time  
making our team with Bure and (Mark) Parrish our top two right 
wingers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oleg Kvasha, Radek Dvorak and Marcus Nilson -- none older than 22  
-- also can play the right side.

<HEADLINE> Lobbyists Court Lawmakers With Trips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Larry Combest and his wife stayed at the  
Boca Raton Resort &AMP; Club in Florida in March, courtesy of the 
Futures Industry Association -- the trade group for the commodity 
futures industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas Republican's bill included dinner tabs for $167 and  
$141 per person, $504 per night in lodging costs and $316 in 
golf-related expenses over two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately sponsored trips to places like Boca Raton, Palm  
Springs, Calif., and Hawaii are -- along with lobbying and campaign 
donations -- part of a coordinated strategy by special interests to 
influence Congress. While congressional ethics rules sharply limit 
most gifts, these trips are allowed for events like speeches, 
fact-finding and conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	For members of Congress, the accommodations are often more plush  
than the standard government hotel room. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., 
and his wife were put up in a $900-a-night suite in Orlando, Fla., 
in February by a banking group. Hagel is a member of the Senate 
Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Three House members and 11 aides converged on the white sands of  
Hawaii's Hapuna Beach in January as guests of the American 
Association of Airport Executives. 
</P>
<P>
	The association of airport officials paid for the airfare, meals  
and hotel rooms so the congressional group could participate in an 
aviation conference along with airline executives, plane 
manufacturers and others in the air transport industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The players include old-line trade associations and companies --  
such as representatives of banks, railroads and manufacturers -- and 
new political forces like computer software giant Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn., who attended the Hawaii  
conference at a resort hotel where all the rooms had oceanfront 
views, admitted, ``It's not a bad place in January. I wouldn't 
describe it as a torture chamber.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sabo said the trip was worthwhile because there was ``a lot  
of serious work'' on airport funding issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Lewis, of the government watchdog group Center for  
Public Integrity, said such privately financed trips are a conflict 
of interest for lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of an elaborate strategy by most special  
interests -- it's one arrow in their quiver,'' Lewis said. ``They 
... take them on lavish trips, hobnob with them on golf courses, 
they bring cash to the campaigns. And guess what? It works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The airport executives who hosted Sabo have a huge stake in  
legislation to renew the federal trust fund that finances airport 
construction, and to increase airport passenger fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The association spent more than $175,000 on lobbying last year,  
just a small portion of the $36 million in lobbying spent by the 
air transportation industry in 1998. The industry's political 
action committees made more than $5 million in contributions in the 
1997-98 campaign cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Air transportation interests contributed $6,250 to Sabo, $22,480  
to Rep. Ron Packard, R-Calif., and $500 to Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., 
in 1997-98 -- the three congressmen who attended the Hawaii 
conference, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said the company also invites  
lawmakers to its headquarters near Seattle to combine discussions 
of the issues with technology demonstrations that ``we often can't 
bring to Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Members reach out to us and say we'd like to get a look at  
this,'' he said. ``That's what we're looking to showcase.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 members of Congress and 50 aides have visited in recent  
months, Sohn said, without specifying how many trips were paid by 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	In House records, 13 congressional staffers reported trips paid  
by Microsoft to its Redmond, Wash., headquarters. Microsoft spent 
$3.7 million on lobbying last year, and its political action 
committee made $264,500 in contributions in 1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	Other examples of private trips:  
</P>
<P>
	--Rogers and House Democratic Whip David Bonior of Michigan  
traveled to Palm Springs in February to speak to executives at the 
U.S. Telephone Association conference. Communications interests 
gave Bonior $52,500 and Rogers $36,399 in the 1997-98 campaign 
cycle, records show. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade group, representing large regional phone companies and  
smaller operations interested in revision of telecommunications 
law, spent $1.3 million on lobbying last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--A consumer electronics exhibit in Las Vegas -- billed as the  
world's largest trade show -- attracted Reps. Howard Berman, 
D-Calif.; Mac Collins, R-Ga.; Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.; Jay Inslee, 
D-Wash.; and Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Their travel in January was paid by an arm of the Electronic  
Industries Alliance, which spent $560,000 for lobbying last year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Hagel was the featured speaker at the American Bankers  
Association' conference in Orlando in February. The expenses 
included $2,747 for three nights at the Cypress Grand Hyatt for 
Hagel and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Blocklin, lobbyist for the group, said the association  
rented a suite ``like we do for all members (of Congress). It was 
the peak season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers association spent $4.6 million in lobbying last  
year. Hagel received $58,000 in donations from banking interests in 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	--The New York Stock Exchange and Merrill Lynch jointly paid the  
$341 bill for a night's stay for each of 13 congressional staffers 
who visited the exchange this year. Merrill Lynch, whose political 
committee doled out $252,600 in 1997-98, is pushing legislation to 
allow securities firms, banks and insurance companies to sell the

in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Revokes 'Prozac' Dr.'s License </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- A psychologist who gained notoriety as the  
``pied piper of Prozac'' because of his aggressive promotion of the 
antidepressant drug lost his license to practice on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington state Health Department's Examining Board of  
Psychology had charged Dr. James Goodwin with unprofessional 
conduct for failing to comply with a 1996 disciplinary order that 
he enter into an agreement with an adviser to monitor his practice. 
</P>
<P>
	In its order on Tuesday, the board called Goodwin's conduct  
unprofessional and wrote that revoking his license is ``the only 
sanction that sufficiently protects the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, 52, said he planned to appeal in federal court in hopes  
of winning back his license. He also said he would continue to see 
patients as a mental health therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin contends he has followed the wishes of the examining  
board, and he added: ``There are people on the licensing board 
running psychology in this state who are mentally ill and causing 
many of us problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin has been in practice in the north-central Washington  
city of Wenatchee since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1990s, he attracted widespread attention for his  
belief that everyone suffers from at least some level of depression 
and would benefit from a combination of antidepressants and 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1993, the licensing board accused Goodwin of  
breaching patient confidentiality, diagnosing patients without 
adequate evaluation, pressuring patients into taking Prozac and 
retaliating against a psychologist who protested his treatment 
methods.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Shifts Top Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Robertson, president and founder of the  
Christian Coalition, is restructing the leadership of his powerful 
conservative organization to assume more authority and move former 
GOP lawmaker Randy Tate to Washington to keep tabs on Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Tate will lose the title of executive director, becoming senior  
vice president for government relations. An official close to the 
group, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tate will not be 
replaced as executive director. The Christian Coalition is based in 
Chesapeake, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson is said to be upset that the GOP-led Senate responded  
to the school shootings in Colorado by passing gun control 
measures. He wants Tate to create a more aggressive lobbying 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The move leaves Robertson in charge of day-to-day operations of  
the group he founded after his 1988 run for the Republican 
presidential nomination. In the last several months, Robertson has 
slowly reasserted his authority over the group, which has had 
fund-raising and organizational problems. It is one of the most 
influential conservative political groups in the nation.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Activist Arrested in Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMLET, N.C. (AP) -- A man who gained national notoriety when he  
held newspaper employees hostage 11 years ago has been arrested on 
murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Hatcher, 41, was taken into custody without incident while  
driving away from a house in Hamlet, about 75 miles east of 
Charlotte, Sheriff Glenn Maynor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got me charged with murder?'' Hatcher said as he was led  
from Hamlet's police headquarters. ``I didn't kill nobody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maynor said Hatcher was wanted in a drive-by shooting Monday  
night near Maxton, where Hatcher used to live. Investigators said 
Bryan McMillian, 19, was killed at his home when Hatcher fired into 
a building with a high-powered rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the motive behind this one was,'' said  
homicide Capt. Randal Patterson. ``He shot the house. He didn't 
know what he was going to hit and probably didn't know who all was 
in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby McMillian, the slaying victim's mother, said Hatcher was  
upset with her son because someone had stolen property from 
Hatcher's home and taken it to McMillian. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher also had been sought since May 19, when a man was shot  
and wounded in a convenience store in Lumberton, 110 miles east of 
Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians, took over  
The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1, 1988. The armed 
men said they were protesting what they said was corruption in 
Robeson County government. They held hostages for 10 hours before 
surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
	They were acquitted of federal hostage-taking and firearms  
charges, but were later indicted on state charges. Both went to 
prison -- Hatcher for five years and Jacobs for less than three -- 
and were eventually paroled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was being held Tuesday night at a prison in Raleigh that  
has medical facilities able to treat the symptoms of AIDS, which 
Hatcher said he contracted while in prison.

<HEADLINE> Tiananmen Victims Sue China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Survivors of the Tiananmen Square massacre and  
relatives of victims said Tuesday they had filed a lawsuit in China 
demanding an investigation and an apology from the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ten years after the Tiananmen massacre, the perpetrators have  
still not been brought to justice,'' said Xiao Qiang, executive 
director of Human Rights in China, a group based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit filed last month in Beijing also seeks the release  
of political prisoners arrested in the protest and the return of 
people who went into exile afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcement of the lawsuit was timed to coincide with the 10th  
anniversary of the June 4, 1989, massacre in Beijing's central 
square. Hundreds of people were killed when the government sent in 
soldiers and tanks to crush seven weeks of pro-democracy protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Many who took part said they were patriots who only wanted  
government reforms. Supporters of the lawsuit said they will be 
sending evidence they've collected to the United Nations and other 
governments to try to pressure China's politicians to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said the student-led protests were an  
anti-government rebellion that threatened communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese government took timely and resolute measures which  
were necessary for the development and stability of the country,'' 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday. ``We have 
already come to a correct conclusion over this. There will be no 
change whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ding Zilin, a professor at People's University who organized the  
lawsuit, said by telephone from Beijing at a news conference in New 
York that her son was killed in the massacre. She has spent years 
gathering evidence from other victims' families, including photos 
and eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ding said the painstaking process of finding others who joined  
in the suit -- 160 victims' families and 70 of the wounded -- 
included raising the incident with every taxi driver she met and 
staking out tombstones dated ``June 4, 1989'' to seek out mourners. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not allowed to speak openly about the facts of how our  
loved ones were murdered and we cannot mourn our dead in public,'' 
she said. ``But what distresses us survivors the most, and makes us 
feel most guilty, is that the unfair charges against our loved ones 
have not been dismissed. We cannot even say a simple `rest in 
peace' to their buried souls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those at the news conference included Li Lu, a student leader of  
the 1989 movement who described watching his classmates get run 
down by a tank; Zhang Liming, whose sister was murdered by 
soldiers; and Zhang Yalai, whose leg was amputated after he was 
shot in the square.

<HEADLINE> Study: Fiber Benefits Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of more than 68,000 women found that  
dietary fiber -- particularly from breakfast cereals -- can 
significantly lower the risk of heart attacks, researchers reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiber helps by improving cholesterol levels, lowering blood  
sugar, boosting sensitivity to insulin and lowering the risk of 
blood clotting, according to a study published in today's Journal 
of the American Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A previous study of men had similar results.  
</P>
<P>
	Healthy female nurses studied at Brigham and Women's Hospital in  
Boston were divided into five groups, from highest to lowest fiber 
consumption, and their diets were tracked for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Women in the highest fiber group ate about 22 grams per day.  
They had a 47 percent lower risk of heart disease than women in the 
lowest group, who consumed about 11 grams of fiber a day. 
</P>
<P>
	``For every five-gram increase in fiber -- which is equal to a  
bowl of cereal per day -- the risk of heart disease was reduced by 
more than 30 percent,'' said Dr. JoAnn Manson, the author of the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	She said fruits and vegetables also are good sources of fiber.  
She cautioned that over-the-counter fiber supplements are not 
effective substitutes.

<HEADLINE> Va. Family's Murder Called Targeted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Associated Press Writer-    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI and police in a Washington suburb are  
investigating the ``targeted'' killing of an Iraqi-American 
businessman, his school teacher wife and their 16-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
	Fairfax County, Va., police are not ruling out anything, but  
``it appears it was a targeted incident and does not appear to be a 
random incident,'' police spokeswoman Katie Hughes said today. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the FBI was called in to help gather evidence and  
explore possible international connections in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuad Khazi Taima, 63; his wife, Dorothy Mae Taima, 54; and their  
son, Leith Fuad, all died of gunshot wounds to the upper body, 
police said. Their bodies were found in the family home in the 
Washington suburb of McLean, Va., on Friday after an anonymous 
call. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the shooting may have occurred on Wednesday when  
neighbors recalled hearing noises that could have been gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is being handled as a triple murder, not a  
murder-suicide or robbery, Hughes said. She said there was no sign 
of forced entry into the home. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiama's wife was an English teacher and their son a sophomore at  
McLean High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The police spokeswoman said Faud was a businessman who had been  
traveling back and forth between the United States and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI spokeswoman, Elisa Foster, confirmed that the FBI was  
assisting in the investigation. She said the FBI is routinely 
called in to help with violent crimes, whether there it has an 
international element or not. She declined to say what aspects of 
the investigation the FBI was handling. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither investigative agency would comment on reports they were  
looking into whether the crime involved either the Iraqi government 
or its U.S. opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Taimi has been prominent in the Iraqi-American community as  
founder of the American-Iraqi Foundation to help improve U.S.-Iraqi 
relations during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps Director Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mark Gearan is resigning as director of the  
Peace Corps to become a college president, the White House said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan, the corps' director since August 1995, is leaving to  
accept the presidency of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in 
Geneva, N.Y. President Clinton said Gearan is perfect for the job: 
``He is gifted, humane, a leader and deeply committed to the 
education of young people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan is a former deputy chief of staff and director of  
communications and strategic planning at the White House. He served 
as Vice President Al Gore's campaign manager in the 1992 
presidential campaign. He also was director of state-federal 
relations for Massachusetts, was press secretary in the 1988 
presidential campaign of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and for 
three years was executive director of the Democratic Governors 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have relied on Mark Gearan's skills, wisdom and talents for  
many years,'' Clinton said. ``He has rejuvenated the Peace Corps. 
... He can be proud that the Peace Corps will soon have more 
volunteers serving overseas than at any time in a generation. I 
thank Mark for his friendship and service.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan informed Clinton of his decision Tuesday, White House  
spokesman Joe Lockhart said. He said there was no word on when 
Gearan would leave or when Clinton would announce a replacement.

<HEADLINE> PacBell Drops StarTac Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Motorola Inc.'s StarTac cellular phones have  
been plagued by severe technical glitches, prompting Pacific Bell 
Wireless to quietly stop selling the popular phones for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said the problems -- which include dropped calls and the  
phone abruptly shutting off -- are limited to the StarTac 7000 
model, which uses digital technology known as global system for 
mobile communications, or GSM. 
</P>
<P>
	PacBell Wireless, the largest GSM carrier in the country, and  
Motorola refused to disclose exactly how many of the phones were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company would say how many model 7000s are in use. The  
companies also never told customers about the problems and only 
admitted the problems to customers who complained. 
</P>
<P>
	PacBell and Motorola officials said they have worked closely to  
fix the problems by replacing the phones' software when customers 
bring them in for service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're taking this very seriously, and we've taken steps to  
make sure that StarTac customers have a phone that will perform up 
to par,'' said PacBell Wireless vice president Steve Krom. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, meanwhile, has upgraded PacBell Wireless' entire  
inventory of StarTac 7000s with the new software, said Denise 
Gibson, vice president and general manager for Motorola's U.S. 
strategic operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems come as Motorola tries to regain market share lost  
to rivals Nokia and Ericsson when phones shifted from analog 
technology to digital. The StarTac has been a key part of 
Motorola's rebound.

<HEADLINE> Crews Control Fla., Ariz. Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAYLOR, Fla. (AP) -- A wildfire on the edge of the Okefenokee  
Swamp on the Florida-Georgia line was being contained Tuesday by an 
army of almost 650 firefighters and an air force of 11 helicopters 
and three water tankers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made good progress and have built a containment  
line,'' said Bill Paxon, a spokesman for the operation spearheaded 
by the U.S. Forestry Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began May 21 with a lightning strike and has burned  
53,000 acres, mostly between the Osceola National Forest and 
Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge. Only about 7,000 fire acres 
are in the Okefenokee preserve made famous by the old comic strip 
``Pogo,'' the story of a knowing little possum and his swamp 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Crews and equipment have come in from 30 states, from as far  
away as Alaska. No structures have been damaged and no one has been 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile in northwestern Arizona, crews from across the West  
neared containment of a 20,000-acre wildfire that charred an area 
between the Arizona-Utah line and the Grand Canyon. No injuries 
have been reported.

<HEADLINE>  Hungarian Is Tops in NCAA Discus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Ala. (AP) --Fresh from an exam that took longer than  
expected, Gabor Mate raced across Auburn's campus on a bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter that he's late. He still greets everyone he passes.  
When he finally climbs off the bike and strolls across the track, 
Mate declines to sit for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll stand,'' the 6-foot-6 Hungarian said. ``I am a sportsman,  
you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he is.  
</P>
<P>
	Mate, a 20-year-old freshman, enters Wednesday's NCAA Outdoor  
Track and Field Championships in Boise, Idaho, as the nation's top 
discus thrower. 
</P>
<P>
	Mate (pronounced Mah-tay) arrived in the United States on Jan.  
1. He expected to do well at Auburn, but never this well. 
</P>
<P>
	His throw of 202 feet, 7 inches at last month's Reebok  
Invitational is the best in the NCAA this year. He's won six of the 
seven tournament's he's entered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that in college there are a lot of good throwers so it  
is a big pleasure to have the best mark right now,'' he said in 
accented, yet fluid, English. ``But I am too young for this sport -- 
you could not call yourself world class until you are around 26 
years old. I still have years to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing that made it easier for Mate to leave Hungary. In his  
hometown of Bekescsaba, he could be an athlete or a student -- not 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mate nor his father would settle for that. So the two  
discussed sending Mate to the United States to study and train. 
</P>
<P>
	They made up their mind watching the 1996 Olympics. Hungary's  
Balazs Kiss had left the country to attend Southern California and 
won a gold medal in the hammer throw during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew then that the U.S. college system offered me many  
opportunities that I would not have at home,'' Mate said. ``I want 
to be an Olympian, but if I tried to do that in Hungary I would be 
nothing after the age of 35. In the U.S., I can learn to be a 
successful businessman also.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But first Mate had to pay for an American education. He said two  
months of his parents' salary comes out to be about $500. So a 
scholarship was his only option. 
</P>
<P>
	After graduating from high school in 1997, Mate took off all of  
1998 to train. His goal was to attract college recruiters while 
competing in junior events. He wrote to schools, but only one coach 
got in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Clayton was an assistant at Florida when he contacted the  
Hungarian federation about athletes interested in coming to the 
United States. They gave him Mate's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a tradition of strong throwers in Hungary, so he  
could have trained there and had a great career,'' Clayton said. 
``But he wouldn't have had an opportunity to get an education, and 
that's something that is important to Gabor and his family. Gabor 
is very strong in the classroom and values getting a degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate was immediately interested in Florida, but then Clayton  
took an assistant job at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mate made his first trip to the United States in November. He  
and his father visited Auburn and South Carolina, bypassing other 
schools out of loyalty to Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton promised he would help Mate throw between 3 and 6 feet  
further within a year -- Mate is already throwing 10 feet further 
then when he arrived at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mate win an NCAA title this week, he and Clayton won't be  
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our real goal right now is for the Sydney Olympics, for him to  
meet the qualifying standard and make his country's team,'' Clayton 
said. ``Right now, he only ranks about fifth or sixth in Hungary, 
so we want him to get up there with the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate also has another goal -- to convince Clayton to offer a  
scholarship to his 15-year-old sister, Katalin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a sports crazy family and right now she is so jealous  
for me and what I am doing here,'' Mate said. ``But she is the 
talented one and someday I will be so jealous for her because she 
might be the best in the world.''

competing in junior events. He wrote to schools, but only one coach 
got in touch. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Clayton was an assistant at Florida when he contacted the  
Hungarian federation about athletes interested in coming to the 
United States. They gave him Mate's name. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a tradition of strong throwers in Hungary, so he  
could have trained there and had a great career,'' Clayton said. 
``But he wouldn't have had an opportunity to get an education, and 
that's something that is important to Gabor and his family. Gabor 
is very strong in the classroom and values getting a degree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate was immediately interested in Florida, but then Clayton  
took an assistant job at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Mate made his first trip to the United States in November. He  
and his father visited Auburn and South Carolina, bypassing other 
schools out of loyalty to Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton promised he would help Mate throw between 3 and 6 feet  
further within a year -- Mate is already throwing 10 feet further 
then when he arrived at Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mate win an NCAA title this week, he and Clayton won't be  
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our real goal right now is for the Sydney Olympics, for him to  
meet the qualifying standard and make his country's team,'' Clayton 
said. ``Right now, he only ranks about fifth or sixth in Hungary, 
so we want him to get up there with the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mate also has another goal -- to convince Clayton to offer a  
scholarship to his 15-year-old sister, Katalin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a sports crazy family and right now she is so jealous  
for me and what I am doing here,'' Mate said. ``But she is the 
talented one and someday I will be so jealous for her because she 
might be the best in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sports Writer Murray Rose Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Murray Rose, an Associated Press sports writer  
and editor for 46 years and one of the country's best known boxing 
journalists during his career, died Monday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose had been hospitalized since April 29, when he suffered a  
heart attack, according to his son, David. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose, who retired in 1979, covered fights and fighters from Joe  
Louis to Muhammad Ali for four decades. He teamed with the late 
Jack Hand at ringside for scores of championship fights, and the 
two won awards for their coverage from the Boxing Writers 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was an integral part of the AP's Olympic staff and  
covered international sports on every continent except Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose started at the AP in 1934 as a copy boy, grateful for a job  
that offered some security during the Depression. He worked in a 
number of New York departments before settling in sports, where he 
crafted a memorable career, writing from places such as Helsinki, 
Paris, London, Mexico City, Melbourne, Rome, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Sao 
Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Cali and Munich. 
</P>
<P>
	``North to south and east to west, far places and near, many  
exhilarating assignments,'' he said when he retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five years before that, he was described by sports editor  
Ted Smits as ``the take-charge man of the sports department.'' 
Smits also said, ``Rose represents perpetual youth and 
enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wick Temple was the sports editor in Rose's last years on the  
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can put his finger on every sporting event in the world and  
every sports figure,'' Temple said. ``His planning and organization 
are a key factor in the success of the sports service and our 
dominance in the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, Rose was among the first American newsmen to tour the  
isolated housing of Soviet Union and other Iron Curtain athletes at 
the Olympics in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
	He was frequently confused with the champion Australian swimmer  
who had the same name, and the two were introduced at the Melbourne 
Olympics in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	Rose spent many years running the AP's night sports desk,  
directing coverage of breaking news stories. At the end of his 
career, he directed special projects. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, Evelyn, their son and two  
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday. The family asked  
that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the American Heart 
Association.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bianca Jagger divorced her famous husband two  
decades ago, but she still has trouble shaking her image as a rock 
'n' roll wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm on the board of very important organizations,'' she told  
The New Yorker magazine. ``I think I've paid my dues. I've earned 
my respect regardless of whether I was married to Mick or the 
cleaner in the street!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jagger, who has been traveling the world to promote human  
rights for years, recently visited refugee camps in the Balkans and 
is a strong supporter of NATO's military action against Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Stakes Out Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Staking out his differences with leading  
opponents for the Republican presidential nomination, Pat Buchanan 
today called the NATO bombing campaign over Kosovo ``a strategic 
blunder that may prove the ruin of the most successful alliance in 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech prepared for a Washington Press Club luncheon,  
Buchanan identified Texas Gov. George Bush, Sen. John McCain, 
former Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole and publisher Steve 
Forbes as his ``principal rivals'' for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``While all are good and able individuals, all four endorsed the  
president's decision to launch this war on Serbia,'' he said. ``Mr. 
Bush, Mrs. Dole and Sen. McCain even endorse sending a U.S. Army to 
fight its way into the Balkans to occupy Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	He called the conflict over Kosovo ``an illegal and  
unconstitutional war, launched without authorization by Congress. 
There is not now, and there never has been, any vital U.S. interest 
in whose flag flies over Pristina to justify the loss of a single 
platoon of U.S. Marines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan used his remarks, which covered a broad range of  
foreign policy issues, to try to set himself apart from his GOP 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a citizen of the world; I am an American,'' Buchanan  
said. ``And I am not running for president of the world, but for 
president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On trade, Buchanan said the four Republican rivals he named in  
his speech all endorse the trade policies of the Clinton 
administration, ``which have given us a merchandise trade deficit 
well in excess of $300 billion in the current year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So-called `free-trade conservatives' are not conservatives at  
all, but the unwitting masons of a one world government,'' Buchanan 
said. ``The final payment for any global free trade zone is an end 
to American sovereignty and the loss of American independence. ... 
As America crosses over into a new millennium, we deserve a choice 
of policies, philosophies and destinies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said that on policy toward the Balkan states and a  
variety of trade and global economic issues -- including trade 
status with China, the World Trade Organization, the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Bank -- ``Bush, Dole, McCain and Forbes 
are virtual Xerox copies of (President) Clinton and (Vice President 
Al) Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If one of these wins the GOP nomination, we risk a replay of  
1992 and 1996, where both major parties will agree on most major 
issues and a pillow right will ensue over some dinky tax cut,'' he 
said. ``This may satisfy the establishment, but it would cheat 
middle America. ... America deserves better than a politics of 
inconsequentiality, where the presidential choice is between two 
free-trade globalists, two compulsive interventionists, two 
open-borders one worlders enthralled by a Utopian vision of a 
different America or seized by the allure of some new world 
order.''

<HEADLINE> Remembering War Dead on USS Intrepid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing in sweltering heat, John Bonomo  
struggled against tears to explain why he spends each Memorial Day 
aboard the USS Intrepid, the aircraft carrier that was his home 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	He and another former crew member, Hector Giannasca, also in his  
70s, returned to the ship's decks today to pay homage to a pair of 
friends who grew up together, went to war together, and were killed 
together on a grim day in 1945 when a Japanese kamikaze fighter 
targeted their ship. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never knew what a kamikaze was,'' Giannasca said, shaking  
his head in disbelief over an enemy that trained pilots for 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Scores of military personnel in full uniform gathered with  
Bonomo and Giannasca and other former crew members to recall fallen 
comrades who served on the Intrepid and in other conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	They stood as an Air Force band played the national anthem and  
the hands of old men quivered as they held their salutes. Tears 
fell as a trumpeter's horn sounded ``Taps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Intrepid, commissioned in 1943 and converted to a museum off  
a New York pier 86 in 1982, serves as the platform for the city's 
Memorial Day celebration each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of similar ceremonies were held around the country.  
</P>
<P>
	The Intrepid now carries historic aircraft including the Grumman  
E-IB Tracer used in Korea and the ``Melody II'' Bell UH-1M Huey 
from Vietnam. A plaque marks the spot where 10 men died during a 
kamikaze attack on Oct. 29, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must remember the fallen,'' said Vice Admiral James C. Card  
of the Coast Guard. ``And we must remember the causes for which 
they fell.''

<HEADLINE> It's `Josh' Mania in Baseball Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Most scouts agree the No. 1 pick in baseball's  
amateur draft Wednesday will be a high school kid named Josh. But 
which Josh? 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Hamilton, an outfielder from Athens Drive High School in  
North Carolina, and Josh Beckett, a right-hander from Spring High 
School in Texas have posted impressive numbers and are expected to 
be the first two players selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay, Florida, Detroit, Arizona and Minnesota have the  
first five picks. Four teams -- Anaheim, Atlanta, Cleveland and the 
New York Mets -- do not have any picks until the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that we're picking No. 1, we're excited about getting a  
very good player,'' Devil Rays scouting director Dan Jennings said. 
``We just want to get the best player in the country, whether it's 
a high school player or a college player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last high school player taken with the first pick was Alex  
Rodriguez, chosen by Seattle in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	While some teams have balked at the escalation in signing  
bonuses negotiated by first-round picks -- the Philadelphia Phillies 
declined to sign J.D. Drew, who then was taken by St. Louis last 
summer -- Tampa Bay will likely be able to sign the franchise's 
first No. 1 pick. They gave free agent Matt White a $10.2 million 
signing bonus in 1996, which is still the highest ever for an 
amateur player. 
</P>
<P>
	Only twice since 1971 have the first three picks been high  
school players. It could happen again this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, who is 6-foot-4, is an outstanding hitter with a  
strong arm. He is projected as a pro right fielder, even though 
he's got a 94-mph fastball. 
</P>
<P>
	Beckett, also 6-4, has a shot at becoming the first high school  
right-hander selected No. 1 overall. He has impressed scouts with a 
fastball that reaches the mid-90s consistently, and a lively 
curveball. Even if he's taken second, Beckett would be the first 
high school righty taken that high since Bill Gullickson in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	B.J. Garbe, an outfielder/right-hander from Moses Lake High  
School in Washington, is also at the top of many scouts' wish 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably a better crop of high school prospects in the  
first round this year,'' Kansas City Royals scouting director Terry 
Wetzel said. ``And there aren't a whole lot of college position 
players in the first round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some scouts have predicted that up to 20 of the 30 first-round  
selections will be high school players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are just more high school players that will go  
in the first round,'' Baltimore scouting director Tony DeMacio 
said. ``However, there are some good, quality college arms out 
there. It's just one of those years where there just aren't many 
college position players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Southern California catcher Eric Munson is expected to be a  
top-five pick, possibly in the top three. While his left-handed 
stroke and ability to flat-out hit have scouts excited, his 
defensive shortcomings also have them somewhat concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Northeast Louisiana right-hander Ben Sheets, Baylor  
right-hander/designated hitter Jason Jennings, Miami shortstop 
Bobby Hill, Providence outfielder Keith Reed and North Carolina 
righty Kyle Snyder are expected to be first-rounders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Christianson, a catcher from Arlington High School in  
California, Bobby Bradley, a right-hander from Wellington High 
School in Florida, and Brett Myers, a righty from Englewood High 
School in Florida, are expected to be among the first high school 
players selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore and San Diego will benefit most from having extra  
first-round picks as compensation for losing Type A free agents. 
The Orioles have four of the first 23 picks, while the Padres have 
six of the first 51. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, our plan is just to take the best available player  
at each pick,'' DeMacio said. ``Whether that's a high school or 
college pitcher or hitter, we want to get the best player there. 
The strategy remains the same.''

<HEADLINE> RocketCash Courts Teen Web Shoppers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA, Calif. (AP) -- RocketCash Corp. today launched its  
version of an online mall -- complete with security and the watchful 
eyes of parents -- that aims to turn the 20 million teen-agers 
expected to be on the Internet this year into cybershoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	RocketCash's technology enables parents to use their credit  
cards to create online spending accounts for their teenagers and 
then set their children's access to specific RocketCash merchant 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents can also limit when the account can be used and set up  
an automatic allowance to replenish the account, the Saratoga-based 
company announced in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Teens then log on to RocketCash.com and select one of the  
pre-approved merchant sites. RocketCash partners include 
Amazon.com, Beyond.com, CDNOW, iTurf's dELiAs.com, eToys, jcrew.com 
and Reel.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The RocketCash payment system completes transactions at merchant  
sites without disclosing credit card numbers or other personal 
information. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Treasury Solutions, a division of The Chase Manhattan  
Bank, will hold funds of behalf of RocketCash until instructed to 
pay for purchases made at merchant Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Because most online purchases require credit cards, less than  
one percent of the $141 billion spent by teen-agers at the retail 
level last year was spent via e-commerce transactions, according to 
RocketCash.

<HEADLINE>  China Insists Crackdown Was Correct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China today ruled out any change in its position  
that the Tiananmen Square democracy protests needed to be crushed, 
saying its crackdown 10 years ago ensured the stability required 
for economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese government took timely and resolute measures which  
were necessary for the development and stability of the country,'' 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said. ``We have already come 
to a correct conclusion over this. There will be no change 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people were killed when the government sent in  
soldiers and tanks to crush seven weeks of protests centered on 
Tiananmen Square. The government said the peaceful student-led 
protests were an anti-government rebellion that threatened 
communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu said progress since the June 4, 1989, crackdown has ``proved  
convincingly that without political stability'' China would not 
have the social and economic development it enjoys today. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of those killed and critics of the crackdown view the  
military assault as government-sanctioned murder. In news 
conferences this week in New York and Hong Kong, they are expected 
to renew calls for compensation, an official apology and punishment 
for those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has ignored their previous pleas. Police and  
officials have stepped up surveillance and harassment of victims' 
families and dissidents ahead of the June 4 anniversary to prevent 
any public commemorations or protests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a small number of people in and out of China who are  
scheming and staging activities aimed at inciting the overthrow of 
the Chinese government and damaging the social order,'' said Zhu, 
the Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of people are against this, and this will not be  
well received,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether victims' families were also being subversive by  
appealing for compensation, Zhu said individuals ``can file their 
complaint according to legal procedures. However, their activities 
must observe the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past month, authorities have detained 60 dissidents for  
trying to commemorate the anniversary of the crackdown and are 
still holding 18, the Information Center of Human Rights and 
Democratic Movement in China said.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Raises Heart Attack Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Cocaine users are 24 times more likely to have a  
heart attack during the first hour after taking the drug, according 
to a Harvard study. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's rare to see such a strong association'' between cocaine  
use and heart attack, said Dr. Murray Mittleman, an internist at 
Harvard Medical School's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. 
``It's larger than all of the other triggers that bring on the 
onset of heart attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was led by Mittleman and published in Tuesday's issue  
of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long known that cocaine can raise the risk of a  
heart attack. Mittleman said this is the first controlled study to 
actually quantify the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The research was based on interviews at 64 hospitals across the  
United States with 3,946 patients, ages 20 to 92, who had suffered 
heart attacks. Researchers conducted the interviews between 1989 
and 1996. All patients were guaranteed anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-eight reported cocaine use in the year prior to their  
attack, with nine reporting use of the drug within an hour before 
their heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Mittleman said the risk of a heart attack appeared to drop  
significantly after the first hour of cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	The cocaine users who had a heart attack were 44 years old on  
average. By comparison, the average age for all heart attack 
patients in the United States is 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Research over the past decade has shown adrenaline-like drugs  
such as cocaine can trigger health problems such as increased heart 
rate, high blood pressure and stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Steven V. Manoukain, a cardiologist at Emory University  
School of Medicine in Atlanta, said the 24-times-higher risk as 
calculated by the Harvard researchers was higher than he thought it 
would be.

	JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Hobbled by age and prison's  
hard labor, his life's work done and dreams realized, President 
Nelson Mandela is stepping down from the job he says he never 
wanted, to enjoy the peace and freedom that took a lifetime to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's second all-race election Wednesday is ushering  
out the Mandela era. At age 80, and newly wed, he wants time for 
his grandchildren and to write his memoirs of suffering, struggle 
and triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	He leaves behind a country still troubled by racial hatred and  
suspicion, by enormous economic disparity, joblessness and crushing 
poverty, by a staggering rate of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet as Mandela retires, he is the most revered man in the  
country, admired behind the high walls of posh white suburbs and 
adored in the warrens of dusty, tumbledown shanties of black 
townships. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africans credit Mandela with saving the country from a  
bloodbath when apartheid crumbled. He emerged from 27 years as a 
political prisoner to direct a remarkably peaceful transition from 
tyranny to democracy with an unwavering commitment to 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ensured by his actions it was a peaceful transition,'' F.W.  
de Klerk, the last apartheid president and the man who freed 
Mandela, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela restored pride in a country ashamed of its past. He  
offered repentant whites forgiveness. To downtrodden blacks, he 
offered hope. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the country examine and confront its past. But at all  
times, he kept the focus on the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have confounded the prophets of doom and achieved a  
bloodless revolution. We have restored the dignity of every South 
African,'' Mandela said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	The revolution was hardly bloodless. Thousands of people died  
during decades of fighting to defeat or defend apartheid. Thousands 
more were tortured or imprisoned without trial. Many disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	But in apartheid's final days, Mandela helped ensure that the  
transfer of power to an angry black majority was amazingly 
peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our situation was tailor-made for lasting conflict -- 350 years  
of white minority rule engendered tremendous feelings of hate,'' 
said Ahmed Kathrada, a Mandela confidant who spent 25 years in 
prison, much of it alongside Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
	``We face a long road ahead, but we have taken giant steps  
toward this philosophy of reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kathrada said prison made Mandela stronger. It gave him the  
chance to think. He was forced to interact with the agents of 
apartheid, and he realized one day he would have to work with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The most militant prisoners believed that once apartheid was  
defeated, the white man would be thrown into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We realized that was nonsense,'' said Kathrada. ``They  
controlled everything in the country. They could not just be wished 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In negotiations with the last white government, Mandela knew  
apartheid had to be dismantled completely and forever. But he was 
determined not to replace one tyranny with another. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have great appreciation for the fact that we could always  
rise above the tensions that did develop when it was necessary to 
take the process forward,'' said De Klerk, who with Mandela shared 
the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela, who had been the symbol of the anti-apartheid struggle,  
moved quickly to make himself a symbol of reconciliation. Shortly 
after his release, he met with the prosecutor who sent him to 
prison. He traveled to the right-wing Afrikaner enclave of Oranje 
to talk with the widow of former Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd, 
the chief architect of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is really seen as the founding father of the new South  
Africa,'' said Professor Themba Sono, president of the South 
African Institute of Race Relations. ``When he came out of prison, 
he immediately became the statesman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there have been troubling trends since, Sono added.  
</P>
<P>
	``As he continued, after the (1994) elections, the boundaries  
between statesman and party man gradually got blurred, to the 
extent that he is sometimes undoing the good things that he did,'' 
Sono said. 
</P>
<P>
	For all his saintly qualities, Mandela has an autocratic streak  
often joked about even within his own inner circle. He responds 
harshly to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	When black South African journalists mildly criticized his  
government, Mandela painted them as stooges of white newspaper 
owners. When weak opposition parties complained about the 
government, he dismissed them as white parties trying to cling to 
white privilege. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a tendency among many ANC people to construe the  
party as the state, and that is very, very dangerous. In Africa, we 
have seen that happen many times,'' Sono said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela himself acknowledges mistakes, but says his party was a  
liberation movement inexperienced at governing. Right or wrong, he 
remains unflinchingly loyal to the party. 
</P>
<P>
	``One almost tradition of the ANC is when we are attacked we  
close ranks,'' said Kathrada. ``Rightly or wrongly, we close ranks, 
sometimes wrongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandela says he never wanted to be president, chiefly because of  
his age, and only agreed under pressure from party insiders. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was never a hands-on president. I don't think he ever tried  
to be a hands-on president,'' De Klerk said. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, Mandela has said the day-to-day running of the  
government has been in the hands of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, 
the ANC leader expected to succeed Mandela on June 16 when the 
parliament elected Wednesday chooses the new president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thabo has been running the government for several years, and I  
have only been the nominal president,'' Mandela told journalists 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
	De Klerk said he holds warm affection for Mandela and has no  
regrets about the decisions that brought Mandela from prison to the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, he made many mistakes, and in due course a more  
balanced perspective will develop about the good things he did and 
also about the mistakes he made,'' De Klerk said.

<HEADLINE> Bacteria Can Grow in Simulated Mars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A methane-making, oxygen-hating microbe is able  
to thrive in Mars-like laboratory conditions, according to a 
researcher who says the experiment raises fresh hope about the 
possibility of life on the red planet. 
</P>
<P>
	The microbe, said Timothy A. Kral of the University of Arkansas,  
``grows just fine and dandy'' in a simulated Martian environment 
that would kill most every other forms of Earth life. 
</P>
<P>
	Kral, who is reporting on his research Wednesday at the national  
meeting of the American Society for Microbiology, said he and a 
colleague, Curtis Bekkum, created an environment in culture dishes 
that closely mimics the environment of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The dishes contained no oxygen, but were bathed in carbon  
dioxide and hydrogen gases. The soil in the experiment resembles 
what is known about Martian dirt, with no organic nutrients and 
only a small trace of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``We make the assumption that there is liquid water beneath the  
surface,'' said Kral. Many planet experts believe that Mars once 
had great amounts of water and traces of it still remain beneath 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Into this mix, the researchers placed a group of microbes called  
methanogens, a type of bacteria that on Earth lives in places where 
there is no oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	Kral said the microbe comes from a family of organisms that  
lives on Earth deep under the ground or around sea floor vents. 
Some types of methanogens even live in the stomach of cows where 
they help digest grass. 
</P>
<P>
	All of these types of microbes, he said, use nitrogen and  
hydrogen to make methane, a natural gas that can be used as fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	To determine if the bacteria lived in the simulated Martian  
environment, Kral said he measured the amount of methane produced 
inside the sealed culture dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It made methane just like it does on Earth,'' he said. ``It  
grows just fine in the Martian conditions. In fact, it grew fine 
and dandy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the experiment is far from the final answer, Kral said  
the fact that the microbes thrived ``cautiously increases our 
belief that life on Mars is possible, or at least it was 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kral said the experiment also raises the possibility that the  
microbes could be used to cause a change in the planetary climate 
of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``If man were to go to Mars someday and introduce life, this  
might be the form of life that would grow there,'' he said. ``If 
you were going to try to create an Earthlike conditions there, 
putting this type of organism on Mars might be the thing to start 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kral said that colonies of methanogens would give off methane  
gas that could help change the climate and temperature of Mars. The 
planet surface now is very cold; but if methane collected in the 
atmosphere, it eventually could create a greenhouse effect, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Methane is a greenhouse gas, which means you could warm up the  
planet,'' he said. Greenhouse gases allow the sunlight to hit the 
planet surface, but prevent the solar heat from escaping back into 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	Methane also could provide the energy for a human colony on  
Mars, said Kral. The gas can be used as fuel and could even be 
processed into a rocket propellant. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA has been studying the idea of one day sending a  
methane-producing robot spacecraft to Mars, said Kral. Using 
hydrogen brought from Earth and carbon dioxide from the Martian 
atmosphere, it would be possible to make and store methane, he 
said. The fuel then would be available when people are eventually 
sent to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could use the methane to rocket themselves back to  
Earth,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Methanogen microbes, in theory, also could be used on Mars to  
make methane and provide the energy needed for a human colony 
there, said Kral.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Unions Likely To See Runoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- The United Farm Workers and an  
inexperienced rival union face a runoff in their efforts to 
represent pickers and packers at Coastal Berry Co., the nation's 
largest strawberry grower, state labor officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the UFW and the upstart Coastal Berry of California Farm  
Worker Committee predicted victory in the votes now set for 
Thursday in Oxnard and Friday in Watsonville, where Coastal Berry 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board announced the  
runoff Tuesday after counting most of the 60 ballots that were 
contested after last week's election, which failed to give either 
union the necessary majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The ALRB said the Coastal Berry Committee has 670 votes to the  
UFW's 589. But 83 workers voted against any union representation, 
meaning the Coastal Berry Committee would need five of the six 
remaining contested ballots for outright victory. 
</P>
<P>
	However, even the upstart union's representatives don't believe  
the remaining ballots will give them the necessary margin. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are preparing for a runoff election while we are  
investigating the unresolved ballots,'' said Octavio Galarza, the 
ALRB agent in charge of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coastal Berry Committee's vice president, Sergio Leal,  
predicted that the UFW will fare even worse in the runoff. ``We 
know we will have the votes to win,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Efren Barajas, a UFW spokesman, said their union also believes  
it will win, despite interference by antiunion growers who have 
feared that a victory at Coastal Berry might spread to other berry 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just the Committee, but the entire industry of  
strawberry growers that was doing everything possible to make sure 
we didn't win this,'' Barajas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's president, Ernie Farley, said he simply hopes that  
the organizing would be over soon, without further disrupting the 
strawberry harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	The runoff will be the third union vote at Coastal Berry. A  
victory by the same Coastal Berry Committee last year in an 
election boycotted by the UFW was thrown out because some workers 
weren't given a chance to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW targeted Coastal Berry several years ago in hopes of  
building momentum for unions throughout the state's $600 million, 
20,000 worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	At its most powerful in 1970, the UFW had 80,000 members, but  
dwindled to 20,000 by the death of its founder Cesar Chavez. Since 
then, it has grown to 27,000 members.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Case Vs. Lewis Docs Is 'Slim' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A judge refused today to dismiss a malpractice  
suit against two doctors who treated the late Boston Celtics guard 
Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, however, the judge described the case against  
the two consultants as ``very slim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith's comments came this morning as the  
defense's case was about to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants frequently ask judges for so-called ``directed  
verdicts,'' the equivalent of a dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was referring to Drs. Mark Creager and Peter Friedman,  
not to Dr. Gilbert Mudge, the noted cardiologist and lead physician 
who cared for Lewis, who collapsed while shooting baskets in July 
1993 at the age of 27.. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis, the basketball player's widow, sued Mudge  
and the consultants, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated her 
husband. A third consultant settled the case for an undisclosed 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, the case (against Creager and Friedman) is very slim,  
but that's why we have jurors,'' the judge said after four weeks of 
prosecution testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	The consultants' defense lawyers had suggested the doctors did  
little to care for Lewis, beyond administering tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said their involvement was greater than that, but said  
in Creager's case especially, the participation was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues in my mind are not black and white or clear cut,''  
Fremont-Smith said. ``A better procedure in a case such as this is 
to allow it to go to a jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis collapsed during a playoff game in April 1993, and saw a  
team of doctors at New England Baptist Hospital. They diagnosed him 
with a life-threatening and potentially career-ending heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis then sought another opinion from Mudge, who said he had a  
far less serious neurological ailment that causes fainting spells.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Continue Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to dealerships went into overtime 
Tuesday as negotiators sought to avoid a strike that could cause 
long waits and higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making progress but it's going to be a late evening,''  
said Teamsters' president James P. Hoffa, who is facing his first 
major challenge at the bargaining table since March when he was 
sworn in as head of the union once led by his late father, Jimmy 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief negotiator for the National Automobile  
Transporters labor division, representing the companies' management 
at the talks in suburban Arlington, Va., said progress was ``slow 
but steady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' contract with 17 trucking companies that hauled  
more than 15 million cars last year was scheduled to expire at 
12:01 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. However, Hoffa agreed to extend the 
strike deadline for 24 hours so the union could evaluate a 
last-minute offer from the employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers. Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a 
year in wages and benefits, with salaries of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon Tuesday, Hoffa said some issues had been  
resolved, including an agreement to equalize pay rates that have 
differed for drivers in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Teamsters claimed victory in a dispute over the  
possible use of Mexican drivers and trucks to deliver vehicles in 
the United States after the U.S.-Mexican border opens up Jan. 1 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they had no plans to hire Mexican  
truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney praised the  
Teamsters, saying ``cross-border trucking poses significant risks 
and concerns to working families and the American public's 
safety.... America's highways will be safer now that Mexican 
trucking is off the car haul negotiating table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some progress, however, Hoffa warned that some key  
issues remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to give everybody a shot clock. We don't have  
forever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among remaining points of contention that Hoffa has said the  
union is willing to strike over are the companies' proposals to 
start new workers at lower wages and to hire part-time drivers. 
Another key Teamsters' demand is for higher pensions for workers 
who retire after 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto industry analysts said a strike of any significant length  
could hurt consumers as well as car companies. Shoppers who order 
new cars may face a long wait, and dealers could drop some sales 
incentives to ease demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Teamsters haulers' strike could interrupt what could be a  
banner profit year for the car companies,'' said Lincoln Merrihew, 
automotive analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, in Lexington, Mass. 
``Automakers really want to capitalize on the fact that consumers 
are very confident right now and are really responding to (sales) 
incentives ... but if there's a real shortage, dealers might be 
less willing to negotiate and prices might go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a 32-day walkout by just 5,000 Teamsters working for  
Ryder System Inc. prevented the transport of thousands of new cars 
to dealers from factories, ports and distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at its lowest level in nearly three decades  
and the stock market climbing, Americans have been snapping up new 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contend the trucking companies have shared in the  
profits and can afford to treat workers better. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the companies say their share of business has declined  
in recent years due to competition from railroads and nonunion 
haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we change the way we do business, there will be less  
business for us, and fewer union jobs, in the future,'' said 
Hunter.

<HEADLINE> George Brett, Brothers To Make Bats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- After getting 3,154 hits in a Hall of Fame  
career, George Brett knows bats the way a winemaker knows grapes. 
So getting into bat production is a natural. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett and his brothers just bought half-ownership of TriDiamond  
Sports, a revolutionary bat maker, and renamed it Brett Bros. Bat 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike traditional bats milled from single pieces of wood, these  
bats are composed of three strips of Northern White Ash. The strips 
are glued to form a stick said to be 20 percent stronger than the 
models swung by Hank Aaron or Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard so many good things about these bats that it was a  
no-brainer,'' said Brett, a 13-time All-Star with Kansas City who 
will be inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. will join a movement to replace aluminum bats with  
so-called composite wooden ones that last longer than old-fashioned 
models, said Brett, who never used an aluminum bat in a game. 
Professional baseball has never allowed aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the high cost of replacing broken wooden bats that fueled  
the rise of aluminum bats in the amateur ranks about 30 years ago. 
Since then, a generation of Little Leaguers and college players 
have played the game without ever knowing the sublime feeling of 
crushing a cowhide ball with a wooden bat. 
</P>
<P>
	But times are changing.  
</P>
<P>
	Several companies are making composite wooden bats of various  
forms, hoping to reclaim the high school and college markets, and 
even softball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who grows up and plays baseball knows wood is the way  
baseball is meant to be played,'' said Spokane businessman Bobby 
Brett, a former minor league player who brought the bat deal to his 
three brothers: George, former major leaguer Ken Brett and former 
minor leaguer John Brett. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Brett, 83-85 in a 15-year pitching career with 10 teams,  
will be vice president of marketing for the bat company. Ken Brett 
batted .262 during his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
	Showing admirable family togetherness, the Bretts also co-own  
minor league baseball, hockey and soccer teams in Spokane, and real 
estate in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Brett became aware of TriDiamond Sports about two years  
ago, when co-owner Joe Sample asked the Bretts' Class A Spokane 
Indians to try out the new composite bats. The sticks held up well 
during batting practice, and Brett was intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	Sample, a thoroughbred horse breeder, and his partners developed  
the new bats with researchers at Washington State University's 
nearby Pullman campus who worked under contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Their process electronically scans each piece of ash, screening  
the wood for imperfections that can cause a bat to break. Pieces of 
cleared wood then are glued together, shaped into bats and 
laminated for extra strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, braided fibers of aerospace materials are bonded up the  
first 18 inches of the neck, forming what look like permanent 
batting grips. No need for extra pine tar here. 
</P>
<P>
	The grips were added when research by WSU's Wood Materials and  
Engineering Laboratory found that most wooden bats break below the 
label, where the wood starts to taper towards the knob. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing proved the new bats can withstand about 20 percent more  
``impacts per bat'' than regular bats. 
</P>
<P>
	TriDiamond began marketing the bats a couple of years ago, but  
progress was slow until the Bretts entered the picture a few weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``TriDiamond lacked name recognition,'' Sample said. ``When the  
bats changed to Brett, it eliminated that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. has already shipped its bats to 20 major league  
teams for their farm systems, Sample said. The bats are approved 
for use in the rookie and Class A ranks of the minor leagues, and 
the company hopes for approval in higher rungs of the minors next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	George Brett, a vice president with the Royals, hands the bats  
out to interested major league players for use in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	But he concedes it's unlikely major league baseball will shift  
to composite bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd have to put an asterisk on all batting records,'' Brett  
said from Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Bros. bats are cheaper than aluminum bats, and are being  
marketed as a money-saving tool for teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Brett said his Spokane Indians broke 392 wooden bats  
during their 76-game season last year, an average of five per game, 
and he expects better from the composites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had 12 unbroken bats at the end of the season,'' Brett  
said. ``We think these will save money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In college baseball, concerns have been raised about the safety  
of players due to the increasing velocity of balls bashed with 
high-tech aluminum bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Because aluminum bats hit the ball longer than wooden bats,  
college baseball has seen an eruption of power hitting, George 
Brett said. He contends wooden bats will make the college game more 
comparable to professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``College kids are used to getting jammed and still getting home  
runs,'' Brett said. ``With a wooden bat you can't do that. You've 
got to hit balls on the sweet spot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sweet spot is technically known as the bat's longitudinal  
nodal point. On a 35-inch, 32-ounce bat, the sweet spot is at 27.3 
inches from the handle end. 
</P>
<P>
	If hit there, the ball will sail farther and the player will  
feel no sting in the hands from vibrations. But if the player 
misses the sweet spot, the ball may not go as far, and the bat 
might break. 
</P>
<P>
	Players who grew up with aluminum bats have to be taught to  
avoid hitting a baseball on the vulnerable label of a wooden bat. 
For that reason, Brett Bats also sells a flat-faced bat designed to 
teach young players to keep the label facing up.

<HEADLINE> Government's Rail Monopoly Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALTOONA, Pa. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp.  
heralded a new era in railroading Tuesday as they broke up a 
23-year-old rail monopoly created by the government as the 
industry's last hope for survival. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring, in the works for more than two years,  
underscored an ongoing renaissance for the railroads. But it also 
came at a time of heightened concerns over safety and service in 
light of prolonged disruptions that followed the last major rail 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Much was at stake with Tuesday's split of Conrail Inc., the most  
complex restructuring in modern railroading because it involved 
breaking up an active carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Major mishaps could delay letters and packages, impede commuter  
trains and boost shipping costs for farm products and consumer 
goods. Disruptions also could alienate shippers just as railroads 
are trying to become more competitive with trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Early reports indicated that the transition occurred with no  
major glitches. However, it will be many weeks, perhaps months or 
years, before the railroads can declare the split a total success. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a good beginning, but that is only a good  
beginning,'' David Goode, the Norfolk Southern chief executive, 
told hundreds of workers gathered at a locomotive repair shop here. 
``Watch safety and keep service in mind so that we will continue to 
have a good beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day was one of both joy and apprehension for workers, many  
of whom had been with Conrail from the start. Railroad officials 
projected a net decrease in 1,500 union jobs, although the Altoona 
shop would gain positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been an optimist all my life, and there's no sense in  
changing now,'' said Paul Muri Jr., a welder who donned a 
``Gonerail'' T-shirt. ``It's scary in a way, but this is part of 
progress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The split of Conrail gives Norfolk Southern and CSX access to  
lucrative markets in the Northeast and restores competition for 
many shippers along former Conrail routes for the first time since 
1976. That was when Congress created Conrail out of six bankrupt 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern and CSX now control virtually all rail traffic  
east of the Mississippi River, with tracks stretching nearly 45,000 
miles from Montreal to Miami and from Boston to Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gridlock and delivery delays followed the 1996 merger of Union  
Pacific Railroad with Southern Pacific in the West and the Midwest. 
In addition, a string of accidents killed several crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Railroad Administrator Jolene Molitoris toured rail  
operations in Pennsylvania and Florida on Tuesday and encouraged 
employees to report problems and concerns to managers and 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a meeting with CSX officials in Jacksonville, Fla.,  
Molitoris said that while first-day operations appeared smooth, 
``We are not going to be lulled into any sort of comfortable 
feeling that now everything is taken care of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern and CSX, until now primarily Southeastern  
railroads, have many challenges ahead. To pay for the $10.3 billion 
purchase of Conrail, they are counting on capturing traffic that 
now moves by trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Rastatter, director of policy with the National Industrial  
Transportation League, a shipping group, said that even if the 
railroads can declare an operational success, it would take longer 
``to declare that it was a good merger and that they can pay for 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia-based Conrail, sold to the public in 1987 at  
about $15 a share, grew in value to $115 per share when CSX and 
Norfolk Southern jointly bought it. The bidding war that took place 
came after railroads became profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
	Computers were shut down overnight for several hours to make the  
conversion, although some trains continued to run. CSX reported 
that fewer than 10 of its 180 trains in operation went too far or 
did not reach the proper destination. Those trains were moved to 
the correct locations early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far the execution is going very well, but we know there's a  
lot left to do,'' said Bob Haulter, assistant CSX vice president 
for integration planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Brown, a Norfolk Southern spokesman, said computers  
required testing for a few hours beyond the noon target the company 
had set. A data entry error also required corrections, he said. 
However, he said computer problems did not disrupt service.

	Merrill Lynch To Offer Online Trades  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch, joining startups like ETrade as  
well as long-established brokerages like Charles Schwab, announced 
today it is creating an Internet site for individuals to buy and 
sell stocks for $29.95 a trade. The nation's largest brokerage said 
the site will begin operating in December and will also allow users 
to purchase mutual funds, bonds and other securities. The move 
poses a big risk for Merrill Lynch, which makes billions of dollars 
annually through full-fee commissions on stock and other trades and 
depends on its network of 15,000 brokers for its customer base. 
Merrill Lynch stock was down 8 3/4 at 75 1/4.

ETrade will acquire Telebanc in a stock transaction worth about 
$1.8 billion. ETrade made its name as a stock brokerage but has 
been trying to diversify. With Telebanc in its fold, ETrade has 
moved closer to becoming a full-service financial site, offering a

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A report by the nation's manufacturers of the  
first rise in prices for raw materials in 16 months sparked 
concerns in financial markets today inflation is heating up. 
Reports indicated the first monthly decline in nearly a year in a 
key gauge of future economic activity and a big drop in 
construction spending, but continued strength in the industrial 
economy. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its 
monthly index of business activity rose to 55.2 in May from 52.8 in

aggression toward rivals. As he opened the rebuttal phase of the 
lengthy antitrust trial after a 13-week recess, economist Franklin 
Fisher testified that Microsoft's actions -- such as spending

Airlines has gone along with a 4 percent increase levied by 
Continental Airlines last week. American, U.S. Airways, Delta, 
United and TWA then followed the competition's lead by raising 
fares. Stock for AMR Corp., the parent of American, was up $2.18 3/4 
at $67.25 a share, as was Delta's, up $1.56 1/4 at $58.93 3/4 and

<HEADLINE> Wynalda in Blockbuster MLS Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Fusion, struggling on the field and at  
the gate, upgraded both areas Tuesday by acquiring Eric Wynalda, 
the United States' leading career scorer, and Brazilian forward 
Welton as part of a four-team deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda, Welton and Colombian defender Arley Palacios were sent  
to the Fusion by the New York-New Jersey MetroStars, who had 
acquired Wynalda and Welton in separate deals earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars obtained Welton from the Los Angeles Galaxy for  
defender Roy Myers, and gained Wynalda's rights from San Jose to 
conclude an earlier deal that sent Raul Diaz Arce and Marcelo Vega 
to the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the MetroStars received the ``marquee'' player  
allocation Miami had been owed when midfielder Carlos Valderrama 
was reassigned to Tampa Bay. That could wind up becoming former 
German national team captain Lothar Matthaeus, a 38-year-old 
sweeper whose career with Bayern Munich apparently is over. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is only the first step in a very ambitious plan to shape  
the MetroStars into the marquee club our fans deserve,'' MetroStars 
general manager Charlie Stillitano said. 
</P>
<P>
	The big winner Tuesday was the Fusion, who have struggled  
through much of its 1 1/2 seasons in Major League Soccer despite 
Miami's multiethnic community and a history of drawing well for 
international games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were able to meet our immediate needs and do so in a time  
frame that allows us to impact the standings now,'' Fusion managing 
director Doug Hamilton said. ``Quite honestly, though we may have 
been able to use that allocation for an international star, we 
added three players to the roster that all have the ability to 
change the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fusion (4-8) rank last in attendance with an 8,461 average  
and had lost five straight games before last Saturday's 2-1 win 
over Tampa Bay. They are tied for fourth in the Eastern Conference 
with just eight points and have given up a league-high 23 goals. 
</P>
<P>
	There also was the highly publicized feud between Valderrama and  
coach Ivo Wortmann, who accused his midfielder of ignoring his game 
plan and undermining his authority. Wortmann exiled Valderrama on 
April 15, and MLS commissioner Doug Logan reassigned the Colombian 
to Tampa Bay eight days later. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton and Palacios are expected to be available for Saturday  
night's game at Tampa Bay. Wynalda is out until September after 
tearing knee ligaments last March while playing for Mexican team 
Leon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda, 29, has 32 goals in 102 games of international  
competition, including three World Cups. He also scored the first 
goal in MLS history as San Jose beat D.C. United in the league's 
inaugural game in 1996. In three seasons with the Clash, he had 21 
goals and 29 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Welton, 24, has struggled this season after ranking third among  
MLS scorers last year. He had 17 goals and 11 assists for the 
Galaxy in 1998, but has no goals and one assist in nine games this 
year. The Brazilian has 31 goals and 21 assists in three MLS 
seasons.

	Palacios, who has played 32 games in two seasons for the  
MetroStars, gives Miami a rugged central defender to replace the 
injured Wade Webber. His arrival reunites him with Fusion leading 
scorer Diego Serna, a former teammate at Colombian club 
Independiente Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
	To reach the MLS limit of four international players, the Fusion  
also announced they would waive Trinidadian forward Mickey Trotman.

	The MetroStars, left with an open roster spot for an  
international player, could be close to landing Matthaeus, who 
guided Germany to the 1990 World Cup title, is the career leader 
with 135 international games and fought repeatedly with former 
German and Bayern star forward Juergen Klinsmann, who also was 
coveted by MLS before his retirement last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthaeus told German media Sunday that he has received an offer  
from the MetroStars. According to published reports, he wants to 
move to New York to be with his girlfriend and will meet later this 
week with MLS vice president Ivan Gazidis.

<P>
	In Los Angeles, the arrival of Myers and Mexican forward Carlos  
Hermosillo should bolster an attack that has fallen from first in 
MLS last season to last. The Galaxy has scored just seven goals in 
11 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers will make his Galaxy debut June 6 against Kansas City.  
Hermosillo, who has scored 300 goals in Mexico's top league, was 
given an additional week to rest following the end of the Mexican 
season.

	Yugoslav Peace Deal May Be Reached  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia sent a letter to an  
alliance leader today indicating a willingness to accept a peace 
deal for Kosovo that was drawn up by the G-7 group of 
industrialized nations and Russia. But NATO leaders cautioned that 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has broken his word in the 
past, and may do so again. The letter, delivered today to German 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, said that Yugoslavia accepted the 
principals of the deal, including ``a United Nations presence, 
mandate and other elements to be decided by a U.N. Security Council 
resolution in accordance with the United Nations charter.''

presidential candidate. ``I'm a battler,'' he said. ``I love to 
battle.'' He'll have plenty of opportunities, as his political 
rivals seek to portray Bush as unproven, unworthy and unwilling to 
lead on tough issues. Fresh from a state legislative session he 
called ``successful and substantial,'' the Texas governor heads 
next week to Iowa and New Hampshire knowing he cannot possibly live 
up to the hype of his front-runner status. ``As my daughter said, 
`Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as they think you are.'''

	China Trade Talks To Resume Soon

as soon as the two countries meet to discuss the mistaken bombing 
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, U.S. Trade Representative 
Charlene Barshefsky said today. Barshefsky told a business audience

remove Chinese barriers to American exports in return for U.S. 
support for China's bid to join the Geneva-based WTO.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawsuit is pending against the Chinese

Tiananmen Square massacre that occurred almost 10 years ago. 
Survivors and relatives of the victims of the massacre filed the 
lawsuit. Hundreds of people were killed when the government sent in 
soldiers and tanks to crush seven weeks of protests centered on 
Tiananmen Square in June 1989. The government said the peaceful 
student-led protests were an anti-government rebellion that 
threatened communist rule.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Trade Commission staffers reportedly are  
opposing Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600 million plan to merge with the 
nation's largest book wholesaler, saying it violates antitrust 
laws. The staff has recommended that the FTC block the plan by the 
nation's largest bookseller to acquire the Ingram Book Group, an 
unnamed source told The New York Times. Publishers, independent 
booksellers and Amazon.com have opposed the planned merger since 
its announcement in November. They say the deal will hurt

popular books that are in short supply.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) -- A woman who uses a wheelchair and was  
accused of endangering her daughter by wheeling around on city 
streets with the girl strapped to her lap is in trouble again -- 
this time for allegedly operating the chair recklessly on a street. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they received a complaint that a woman was forcing  
cars to swerve to avoid hitting her. Officers saw Kelly Dillery, in 
her wheelchair, swerve from the edge of the street into the middle, 
said Robert Runner, assistant police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Police on Friday charged Ms. Dillery, 31, with being a  
pedestrian in the street. She could be fined $100 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery was convicted of the same charge in January. In  
March, she was acquitted of a charge that she put her 5-year-old 
daughter in danger by strapping the girl to her lap and riding in 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney did not return a message seeking comment on the  
latest charge Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dillery, who has muscular dystrophy, has said she sometimes  
has to travel in the street because not all sidewalks are 
accessible to her wheelchair.

<HEADLINE> Devers, Marsh Out of Pro Track Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Gail Devers, the two-time Olympic women's  
100-meter gold medalist, and Mike Marsh, the 1992 Olympic 200-meter 
champion, have withdrawn from Sunday's inaugural TFA Pro 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said Tuesday that Devers still was not recovered from  
a hamstring injury that sidelined her all of last year. The reason 
for Marsh's withdrawal was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers, the 1992 and 1996 Olympic champion, was scheduled to  
face 1997 world champion Marion Jones in the 100 and was Marsh was 
to oppose 1996 Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder 
Michael Johnson and Prefontaine Classic winner Maurice Greene in 
the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers was replaced by Merlene Frazer of Jamaica and Marsh by  
Obadele Thompson of Barbados. Thompson is also entered in the 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dropouts include American record-holder Sheila Hudson in  
the women's triple jump (knee), Patricia Girard of France (fitness) 
and Lacena Golding of Jamaica (no reason) in the women's 100 
hurdles, and Olga Kaliturina of Russia (Achilles') in the women's 
high jump. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Track and Field Association assigned permanent  
numbers to athletes competing in the ProSeries debut event at 
Mitchel Athletic Complex. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Johnson got No. 24, representing his choice of  
events, the 200 and 400. Jones received No. 20, the number she wore 
for North Carolina's basketball team that won the 1994 NCAA 
championship, and 800-meter specialist Joetta Clark was given No. 
4, since her goal is to make her fourth Olympic team in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Trial Ordered in School Threat Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Two 13-year-old boys accused with two  
other teen-agers of plotting a massacre at their middle school 
after the rampage in Colorado will stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge James Corden ruled Tuesday that he saw enough evidence of  
a conspiracy to commit murder and bound over Daniel Fick and 
Jonathan McDonald for trial. A trial date was not immediately set. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar hearing for co-defendants Justin Schnepp and Jedaiah  
``David'' Zinzo, both 14, was held last week. A ruling in their 
case was pending. 
</P>
<P>
	The older boys are charged as adults; the younger two are  
charged in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	All four could face life in prison if convicted. However,  
because the 13-year-olds are charged in juvenile court, a judge 
could also decide to sentence them to juvenile detention, where 
they could be held up to age 21. 
</P>
<P>
	The students' classmates said the defendants talked of staging a  
robbery to obtain firearms, seizing the Holland Woods Middle School 
office, using the public address system to call an assembly in the 
gym and then slaughtering students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they foiled the plot after classmates reported  
it to school officials.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Has Inside Track at NCAAs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Track and field teams have a special goal  
each season -- sweep the conference and NCAA titles in cross 
country, indoors and outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning all six is never easy. But Arkansas, the dominant team  
the past 25 years under John McDonnell, has accomplished the feat 
four times. The only other school to do it was UTEP, three times 
during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, in the NCAA Outdoor Championships at Boise State,  
the Razorbacks will be going for No. 5, their first since the 
1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's special,'' McDonnell said, ``but it's not routine. If  
it got routine, you wouldn't win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Routine or not, McDonnell has been perhaps the most successful  
college track coach in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Since becoming the Razorbacks' coach in 1972, McDonnell has won  
25 consecutive conference cross country championships since 1974. 
He has won nine NCAA cross country titles, all since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also won 19 indoor conference crowns the past 20 years,  
15 of the past 16 NCAA indoor championships, 17 of the past 18 
outdoor conference titles and eight NCAA outdoor crowns, including 
the past seven. 
</P>
<P>
	That's an astounding total of 61 conference titles and 32 NCAA  
championships. One hundred overall titles isn't far off. 
</P>
<P>
	The Razorbacks are heavily favored to stretch their outdoor  
winning streak to eight -- one shy of Southern California's men's 
record of nine in a row from 1935-43 -- in the 78th championships 
beginning Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's title figures to be a three-way battle among  
defending champion Texas; LSU, which had its 11-year winning streak 
snapped in 1998; and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA is the final big dance,'' McDonnell said. ``The  
conference was the minidance. We're ready to dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the Razorbacks are loaded with distance runners and  
jumpers, led by Seneca Lassiter, the two-time defending champion at 
1,500 meters, and Matt Kerr, last year's winner in the 3,000-meter 
steeplechase. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lassiter has won twice in a row and has run two  
outstanding times this season -- 3 minutes, 37.23 seconds and 
3:37.29 -- he is expected to be seriously challenged by Pac-10 
champion Bernard Lagat of Washington State. Lagat beat Lassiter in 
the NCAA indoor mile in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr faces strong opposition from sophomore Carlos Suarez of  
UTEP. Even if Lassiter and Kerr don't win their specialties -- they 
should still score highly -- Arkansas also has many other potential 
point producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lassiter also is running the 800, with Sharif Karie in the 1,500  
and 5,000, James Karanu in the 800 and 1,500, Mike Power in the 
5,000, Andrew Begley in the 10,000, Melvin Lister in the long jump 
and triple jump, Lavar Miller in the high jump and triple jump, 
Kenny Evans in the high jump, Sam Glover in the 400 hurdles, 
D'Marcus Brown in the 110 hurdles and Marcus Clavelle in the shot 
put. 
</P>
<P>
	No other team can match that depth.  
</P>
<P>
	The other men's defending champions are BYU's Leonard  
Myles-Mills (100), USC's Jerome Davis (400), Stanford's Brad Hauser 
(10,000) and Toby Stevenson (pole vault), South Carolina's Brad 
Snyder (shot put), SMU's Libor Charfreitag (hammer throw) and 
Arizona's Esko Mikkola (javelin). 
</P>
<P>
	The women's team championship came down to the final 1,600 relay  
last year before Texas ended LSU's record streak. This time, UCLA 
also figures to be in the mix, with the title to be decided in the 
sprints, hurdles and relays. The three teams are going against each 
other heavily in all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas has defending champions in Suziann Reid (400) and Erin  
Aldrich (high jump), plus its 400 and 1,600 relay teams. The 
Longhorns' Tanya Jarrett also is favored in the 400 hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	LSU had no individual champions last year, but now has potential  
winners in Peta-Gaye Dowdie (100 and 200) and Joyce Bates (100 
hurdles). UCLA has two strong relay teams, plus Shakedia Jones in 
the 100 and 200, Joanna Hayes in both hurdles and shot put and 
discus favorite Seilalu Sua. 
</P>
<P>
	Other returning champions are Georgia's Debbie Ferguson (100 and  
200), Villanova's Carmen Douma (1,500), Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo's 
Bianca Maran (pole vault), George Mason's Angie Brown (long jump) 
and Pittsburgh's Trecia Smith (triple jump). 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's program includes finals in the men's discus and  
10,000 and women's hammer throw and long jump, semifinals in seven 
events, preliminaries in two events and the first five events of 
the decathlon.

<HEADLINE> Aspiring Comics Perform in Subway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A homeless woman stands in the rattling subway  
car, clanging a cup of pennies and warbling a tune to an 
unimpressed audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, a well-dressed young woman jumps up from her seat,  
throws off her jacket and challenges the homeless woman to a 
fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're the one who stole my subway shtick!'' the woman  
screams, waving off a fellow passenger who tries to calm her down. 
Unfazed, the homeless woman stands her ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also stole your husband!'' she taunts her attacker.  
</P>
<P>
	This exclamation finally draws the attention of New York's  
notoriously self-involved subway passengers, who usually spend 
their rides reading, dozing or tuned in to a Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the No. 1 train slides into the next station and the  
doors open, the two women have apparently reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	The baffled passengers have just witnessed the ninth episode of  
``Subway Soaps!,'' an ongoing serial performed live before a 
literally captive audience. The show -- sort of ``All My Children'' 
meets ``The Jerry Springer Show'' -- is the creation of Katie Massa 
and CeCe Pleasants, two aspiring comics who have chosen to flex 
their acting muscles underground. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a good opportunity for us to write something and  
produce something without having to pay for space to perform it,'' 
said Ms. Massa, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Some giggle or howl at the show. Others move toward the subway  
doors, hoping to get away from the mayhem as soon as the train 
stops. Still others throw out advice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Punch her. Don't let her get away with that -- sleeping with  
your man,'' one woman encouraged Ms. Massa. 
</P>
<P>
	Their show goes on every Wednesday night at 8 p.m., along the  
No. 1 subway line, starting at West 86th Street, down to Chinatown 
and back to 86th. 
</P>
<P>
	Each episode lasts about three minutes -- the duration of two  
subway stops. Then the actors rush to the next car and perform it 
all over again before a different audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watch them every week. They're pretty good,'' said Jose  
Rivera, a subway employee. ``The first time I saw them I thought 
something was going to happen, like a fight. It was so crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The cast always includes the two women, a guest performer and  
someone who passes out post-performance leaflets explaining what 
passengers have just witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the show was drawing a regular following, Ms.  
Pleasants, 23, said the underground troupe sometimes gets a few 
repeat passengers from one week to the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``But a following? I'm not sure we have that yet,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Subway Soaps!'' follows Meme (Ms. Massa), a homeless woman  
rescued from life on the streets by 
prostitute-turned-advertising-executive Catty (Ms. Pleasants), who 
it turns out is Meme's long-lost sister from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spirit of soap opera, Meme sleeps with Catty's boyfriend.  
Meanwhile, Meme finds a homeless boy hawking candy bars on the 
subway is the son she gave up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest episode, titled ``A Lulu of a Ride,'' Meme faces  
off against her former partner in crime, Lulu, who has stolen 
Meme's song repertoire. Lulu is portrayed by aspiring actress Alice 
Muir, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Once, a real homeless man toting a plastic bag told the women to  
behave. ``You're crazy. Don't talk like that,'' he told them, 
moving into the next car to escape the commotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Other passengers can empathize.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was real,'' said Joe Roberts, who spent much of  
the performance putting his hand over his mouth to hold back 
laughter. ``This is New York after all.''

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Androstenedione, the dietary supplement used by  
slugger Mark McGwire, does nothing to boost men's strength and 
instead may promote breast enlargement, heart disease and cancer, a 
study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Wednesday's Journal of the American  
Medical Assocation, compared the substance with a dummy pill in 20 
men ages 19 to 29 during an eight-week weightlifting program 
</P>
<P>
	The supplement, a steroid pronounced an-droh-STEEN-die-ohn, is  
made of a naturally occurring hormone that the body uses in tiny 
amounts to make the male hormone testosterone. Androstenedione 
supplements contain many times the amount found in the body 
naturally, and McGwire has said he uses the substance to speed 
recovery from minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, androstenedione had no effect on testosterone  
levels in the blood, and no difference in strength could be found 
between the two groups of men, said Douglas S. King, an exercise 
biochemist at Iowa State University in Ames who led the research. 
</P>
<P>
	But the men who took the supplement -- 300 milligrams daily --  
showed significant declines in levels of the ``good'' cholesterol 
that helps prevent heart disease. The androstenedione also raised 
the men's levels of the female hormone estrogen, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elevated levels of estrogen in men are known to promote breast  
enlargement and are also associated with a higher risk of 
pancreatic and possibly other cancers, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The study did not measure breast size. King said such an effect  
probably would take longer to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who hit a record 70 home runs last year, had no comment  
on the findings. A furor erupted last year when The Associated 
Press reported that he used androstenedione. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league baseball spokesman Pat Courtney said the league has  
``some of the leading people in the field, along with the players' 
association, looking at the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't hurry,'' he said. ``I'm sure they will take  
everything into consideration in their findings. We're waiting to 
hear the results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hormonal effect of androstenedione in men is the opposite of  
what has been reported in women. In a paper 37 years ago, 
researchers reported that two women who each took 100 milligrams of 
androstenedione on a single occasion had four- to seven-fold 
increases in their blood levels of testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
	No other medical literature on the topic exists, the researchers  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts who were not involved in the new study praised it but  
said it leaves many questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the most comprehensive study on androstenedione that's  
ever been done,'' said Dr. Joel S. Finkelstein, an endocrinologist 
at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital. But ``what we 
really need are higher doses and larger groups of men studied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finkelstein and a colleague, Dr. Benjamin Leder, are conducting  
their own study with the support of major league baseball, which is 
looking at whether to ban the supplement. The NFL, the Olympics and 
the NCAA already have banned it. 
</P>
<P>
	Both researchers said that under standard medical-journal rules,  
they cannot discuss their findings before they are published. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles E. Yesalis III, a professor of health and human  
development at Pennsylvania State University, said testing the drug 
in athletes might reveal some slight benefit not seen in King's 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the men were new to weight training and made rapid  
strength gains during the study.

<HEADLINE> Polygamist Faces Trial in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- It began last summer when a 16-year-old  
girl showed up at a rural gas station just south of the Idaho state 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had run seven miles from a family ranch where her  
father had beaten her for trying to leave a forced marriage with 
her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the uncle, David O. Kingston, faces charges of incest and  
unlawful sexual contact in a case that has put an international 
spotlight on the practice of polygamy in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors and defense attorneys were to begin picking a jury  
today to hear the case, in which Kingston is accused of making his 
niece his 15th wife and having sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's father, John Kingston, pleaded no contest to child  
abuse and could get up to five years in prison at his sentencing 
June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kingston, 32, could get up to five years in prison and a  
$10,000 fine on each of four counts if convicted. He has rejected 
all proposed plea bargains and insists he is innocent, said his 
attorney, Stephen McCaughey. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaughey already has assailed the niece's ``inconsistent  
statements'' about how many times they had sex, and denies it 
happened. Prosecutors say it happened four times in 1997 and 1998. 
The girl is now 17. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kingston is an accountant for the secretive Kingston clan  
based in Salt Lake County that has as many as 1,000 members and 
business assets worth up to $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The clan shares many of the beliefs of other polygamous groups  
in the state but stands apart in practicing incest. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern-day polygamists, unlike 70 percent of Utah's population,  
are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
But their practices have roots in the early church, when founder 
Joseph Smith sanctioned plural marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The early Mormons' practice of plural marriage was renounced by  
the church in 1890.

<HEADLINE>  Indian Troops Battle Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- Indian soldiers battled today for a strategic  
peak occupied by Islamic guerrillas in the disputed Himalayan 
region of Kashmir, military commanders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Close combat on the 15,100-foot high Tololing peak raged through  
the night in what commanders said was a crucial battle against the 
guerrillas. The hostilities have sparked new tensions between India 
and Pakistan, the world's two newest nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The guerrillas seized strategic mountain positions in the  
Indian-held part of Kashmir earlier this month. India accuses 
Pakistan of backing the guerrillas in a bid to change the 
cease-fire line through the divided territory. Pakistan denies any 
role. 
</P>
<P>
	India agreed Monday to hold high-level talks with Pakistan over  
the hostilities in Kashmir. The territory is claimed by both 
countries and has been at the center of two of the three wars 
between the South Asia rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee says his troops  
will continue fighting until the guerrillas are dislodged. ``It is 
a matter of time that we would be able to remove them from these 
areas,'' said Defense Minister George Fernandes. 
</P>
<P>
	India has hammered the guerrillas for a week with airstrikes.  
More jets were seen today flying toward suspected guerrilla 
positions while artillery shelled the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian shells slammed into a high school today in the Pakistani  
village Nagdar, 70 miles from the fighting, killing 10 students, 
officials said. Six people were killed on the Indian side Monday 
when a shell hit a government building. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's army claimed it repulsed three separate attacks by  
Indian troops along the disputed border, inflicting heavy 
casualties. The statement could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The army statement said two Pakistani soldiers and an army  
officer were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tololing peak, Indian soldiers neared guerrilla  
positions, in some places within 10 yards, said commanders in the 
region, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. Two soldiers 
were killed Monday by sniper fire on Tololing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrillas also control nearly a dozen smaller hills near  
Tololing, but the commanders said their troops would not directly 
assault them. Instead they will encircle the positions and try to 
starve out the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	India says it has killed 400 of the 600 militants who entered  
India-controlled Kashmir. The claim could not be independently 
verified. Military experts have said fully dislodging them could 
take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian and Pakistani troops have long skirmished along the  
cease-fire line in Kashmir. Also, various Islamic militant groups 
have been fighting to gain independence from majority-Hindu India 
or to join Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan tested nuclear weapons last year, but they  
are not yet believed to have fully developed delivery systems.

<HEADLINE> Berry Pickers Head to Polls Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALINAS, Calif. (AP) -- More than 1,500 pickers and packers will  
return to makeshift polls in California's dusty strawberry fields 
this week for a runoff vote on which union they want to represent 
them -- the once powerful United Farm Workers or an inexperienced 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Agricultural Labor Relations Board announced the  
runoff Tuesday after counting the final 40 eligible votes cast in 
last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither union had the necessary majority to represent farm  
workers at Coastal Berry, the nation's largest employer of 
strawberry workers, state labor officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coastal Berry of California Farm Worker Committee had 670  
votes to the UFW's 589, labor officials said. Another 83 workers 
voted against any union representation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got most of the votes. Next time we'll get even more,''  
said Sergio Leal, vice president of the Coastal Berry Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Efren Barajas, a UFW spokesman, said organizers will continue to  
fight for victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't just the committee, but the entire industry of  
strawberry growers that was doing everything possible to make sure 
we didn't win this,'' Barajas said. 
</P>
<P>
	At its most powerful in 1970, the UFW had 80,000 members. But  
the figure dwindled to 20,000 by the time the union's legendary 
founder, Cesar Chavez, died in 1993. Since then, it has grown to 
27,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	The UFW targeted Coastal Berry several years ago in hopes of  
building momentum for unions throughout the state's $600 million, 
20,000-worker strawberry industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's president, Ernie Farley, said he simply looks  
forward to a resolution so he can focus on the strawberry harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I credit my workers,'' Farley said. ``They're doing their  
jobs, undistracted by all this labor organizing.''

<HEADLINE> Greene Explains Attack on Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Carolina Panthers linebacker Kevin Greene  
said Tuesday he was acting on instinct when he attacked one of the 
team's assistant coaches during a game last December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody and their brother out there who had ever  
played competitive sports at one time or another probably wanted to 
jerk a knot in some coach's tail,'' Greene said after the Panthers 
finished a practice on the opening day of their third minicamp of 
the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had been largely silent on the subject of his attack of  
former Carolina linebackers coach Kevin Steele on the sidelines 
during the Panthers' home loss to Washington on Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	One day after the attack the Panthers suspended Greene without  
pay for one game, costing him $117,647.05, the equivalent of one 
game check from his 1998 salary of $2 million. Greene released a 
brief statement that night saying he was wrong, he regretted his 
actions and that he respected Steele. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had a different tone Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was 50-50, both of our faults,'' he said. ``I don't  
think it was 100 percent my fault or 100 percent his fault. I think 
if I didn't have the passion, if I didn't have a love and intensity 
and desire for the game, maybe I wouldn't have reacted. Maybe I 
would have just said, `Hey, you know, who cares?' I might have just 
walked off. But that's not me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, Carolina's starting left outside linebacker, got into a  
heated discussion with Steele after the Redskins drove for long 
touchdowns on their first three possessions. Teammates said Greene 
was upset because someone had given him the wrong call on the 
Redskins' third score, a 5-yard burst up the middle by Skip Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, a 14-year NFL veteran, jumped up from the bench, lunged  
at Steele, grabbed him by the jacket just below the neck with both 
hands and began shoving him backwards before coaches and players 
separated the two. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene had cultivated an image as a team leader and was viewed  
in the community as one of the team's more popular players. Many 
fans said after the attack that they had lost respect for him, but 
when Greene was asked Tuesday if he was concerned about the 
public's perception of him, he tried to make light of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure someone did -- at one time or another through high  
school or pee wee football -- probably want to jerk a knot in some 
coach's tail,'' he said. ``So I did it for all those guys so they 
can help pay my fine. Send your dollars here to Ericsson Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele, who had interviewed for the head coaching job at Baylor  
shortly before the attack, subsequently got the job and left 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, 36, a four-time Pro Bowl selection, is trying to adjust  
to a new linebacking position with the Panthers this season and is 
not considered a lock to be a starter.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ready for Campaign Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he's eager to  
leave the safe confines of Texas to test his mettle as a 
presidential candidate. ``I'm a battler,'' he said. ``I love to 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have plenty of opportunities, as his political rivals seek  
to portray Bush as unproven, unworthy and unwilling to lead on 
tough issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a state legislative session he called ``successful  
and substantial,'' the Texas governor heads next week to Iowa and 
New Hampshire knowing he cannot possibly live up to the hype of his 
front-runner status. ``I understand the polls and the expectations 
are out of sight,'' Bush said in a session-closing news conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as  
they think you are.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Without spending a single day on the campaign trail, the son of  
former President Bush is the Republican's top money raiser and 
leads every GOP presidential poll. His political organization, 
seeded with endorsements of the party's establishment, has begun to 
take shape in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	He raked in more money at a fund-raiser Tuesday night. ``I'm  
looking forward to going out and seeing if America will like my 
ideas and like my style of leadership,'' Bush told the donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the big question in American politics today is whether this  
amiable, twice-elected self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' 
can hold up under campaign pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to see what happens when he's exposed to oxygen. Some  
candidates erode,'' said consultant Dick Morris, who has worked for 
Republicans and Democrats. ``He's been in sequestration for so long 
that we don't know what will happen when he gets a whiff of air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's finally time for us to determine whether he is ready for  
the big leagues,'' Tony Coelho, chairman of Vice President Al 
Gore's 2000 campaign, said in a telephone interview from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic operatives are already in Austin combing state  
records for political landmines that could be used against Bush in 
the general election. Coelho said Gore's campaign is researching 
Bush's professional -- not personal -- background. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's support of a concealed weapons law in Texas,  
coupled with his hedging on the gun control debate in Washington, 
will work against him in the campaign. ``You have to question 
whether he's tested,'' Coelho said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, abortion, global warming and a few other national  
issues, Bush has responded slowly or issued ambiguous statements. 
He told reporters Tuesday not to expect detailed policy positions 
anytime soon, ducking questions about his tax policies and other 
dicey topics, such as ethanol subsidies in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be ample time during the course of the summer and  
fall to lay out a specific agenda on taxes and other measures,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to contrast herself to Bush, GOP rival Elizabeth Dole has  
scheduled what aides say is a major policy address in Iowa on the 
day Bush makes his first campaign visit to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dole campaign will be issue-based and focused,'' spokesman  
Ari Fleischer said, implying that the Bush campaign will be 
neither. ``She knows who she is and what she stands for and won't 
hesitate to speak out on politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP rivals suggest that Bush simply isn't ready for prime  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get him off the front porch and into the race,''  
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said in a telephone 
interview. ``I'm eager to find out whether he's just another 
popular governor or whether he's ready to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president under President Bush and a GOP  
presidential candidate in 2000, is warning Republicans that it 
would be a disaster to follow the polls and stampede behind the 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush bristles at suggestions that he is living off the family  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people know a little more about me than you give  
people credit for,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``They know I got a 
great mother and dad, of which I'm most proud. They're going to 
learn soon that I have a great wife. They're going to learn that I 
love my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to even learn that I'm a tax-cutter,  
that I care about education, that I care passionately about making 
sure that we don't leave people behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush plans to use the 1999 legislative session to make those  
points. He helped secure $1.8 billion in tax cuts plus a raft of 
education initiatives, including $3,000 raises for teachers. Though 
the biggest tax cut in the state's history, Bush had sought nearly 
twice as much, and the reduction will likely have a marginal impact 
on Texans (the property tax will return about $60 to the owner of a 
$100,000 home). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fixing to leave (for the campaign) and I'm looking forward  
to it,'' Bush said. ``I know I'm late in particular states. I know 
I have a lot of work to do. I know the expectations are high. But 
it's OK. I'm a battler. I love to battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bush backers say he is bound to stumble but the true  
measure of their candidate will be his ability to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have expectations this unrealistically high it is  
inevitable that there is a bit of correction,'' said GOP strategist 
Bruce Reed, a Bush ally. ``But the truth is anybody who think 
George W. Bush has a glass jaw is going to break their hand trying 
to swing at it.''

<HEADLINE> Apple Crunch Guarantee Sought / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) -- Washington's apple industry wants to  
make sure that a bite into a Red Delicious will yield a satisfying 
crunch, not a mouth full of mush. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Ozanich and Al Robinson hope their research into systems to  
test apples' crunch without destroying the fruit will bring that 
certainty a little closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozanich's small Richland company, Berkeley Instruments, is a few  
months away from unveiling a new generation of near-infrared 
devices to detect bad apples without harming good ones. 
</P>
<P>
	And Al Robinson, a former Battelle Pacific Northwest  
Laboratories researcher and president of Columbia Basin 
Instruments, is building his own nondestructive test to find crisp 
fruit using air pressure chambers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our product suffers from inconsistencies in the market,'' said  
George Ing, manager of the Washington Tree Fruit Research 
Commission. Ing's panel is paying $100,000 for the two research 
programs, which are competing to become the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people buy (apples), they may look good,'' Ing said.  
``But the range of quality and firmness varies. This is the real 
bane of our marketing strategies because there isn't a way to 
segregate (apples) by firmness or internal quality of any kind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has tried to develop nondestructive internal  
tests for 12 years, with little success, including tapping tests to 
check for firmness. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that people haven't tried,'' Ing said, but ``usually  
they damage the apple to tap it enough to get the sound waves 
through it.''

	Lack of consistent quality is part of the reason the Red  
Delicious' market dominance has diminished over the years, though 
it's still grown on more acres than any other type in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia's economic woes coupled with trade barriers in Mexico and a  
flood of Chinese apples have created a slack market that is driving 
Washington farmers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Washington has always prided itself on having the finest  
quality in the world, and there's a lot of pressure to maintain 
that,'' said Denny Hayden, tree fruit research commissioner in 
Pasco. 
</P>
<P>
	The research work being done by Ozanich and Robinson may not  
single-handedly relieve industry pains, but ``it could solve a lot 
of problems for us,'' Hayden said. ``It's real vital information 
they are working on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington State Horticultural Association is proposing new  
rules this summer to expand the state's Red Delicious and Delicious 
inspection programs so each box will be certified year-round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to provide the consumer a much more crunchy ... crisp  
apple,'' said Jim Quigley, state fruit and vegetable program 
manager in Olympia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tree Fruit Research Commission hopes to come up with a  
system so every apple can be checked on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could assure that no bad apples reach the market,'' said  
Ozanich. ``As soon as somebody is able to say we've got guaranteed 
sweet, firm fruit, ... pretty soon other people will have to 
follow.''

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns Award vs. Suzuki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday  
overturned a $37 million trial award to woman paralyzed in a car 
accident because the vehicle manufacturer wasn't allowed to present 
evidence questioning the reliability of a safety test. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 6-1 decision, the panel ruled that at an earlier trial,  
Suzuki Motor Corp. was not allowed to present government reports 
noting that a Consumer Reports test used by the plaintiffs to show 
the vehicle, a Samurai, had defects was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Katie Rodriguez, 34, the passenger who has won two  
settlements from separate juries in the last three years only to 
see them overturned on appeal, provided a 1988 study published in 
Consumer Reports magazine that found that the Samurai would roll 
over under certain ``ordinary emergency steering maneuvers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suzuki claimed Ms. Rodriguez was hurt because she did not use  
her seat belt, that the driver had been drinking and that any 
vehicle would have rolled over. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rodriguez told The Associated Press on Tuesday the Supreme  
Court's decision to remand the case back to the trial court was 
fine by her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not much has changed except on paper,'' Ms Rodriguez said.  
``It's just another hurdle. I'm a strong woman, a very strong 
woman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George Ball, an attorney for Suzuki, also expressed  
determination that the company would continue to defend itself in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to defend this case vigorously in the third  
Rodriguez trial,'' Ball said in a telephone interview from Long 
Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a jury awarded Rodriquez $90 million in damages as a  
result of a February 1990 accident in which she was a front seat 
passenger. The vehicle was driven by a friend when it hit a curb 
and rolled. A judge later reduced the award to $40 million before 
the Supreme Court ordered a new trial because of questions about 
alcohol consumption by those involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1997 retrial, jurors awarded Rodriguez $37 million.  
</P>
<P>
	But the state's high court found the second trial court failed  
to allow the introduction of reports issued by the National Highway 
Transportation Safety Administration that raised questions about 
the safety testing methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Circuit Court of St. Louis City ruled that the government  
reports were hearsay, but the Supreme Court said that federal 
records are relevant and that omitting them was prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the reports go to the heart of the plaintiff's case  
-- the existence of a rollover design defect -- and this reason alone 
may justify reversal,'' the court said. ``Additionally, the fact 
that the reports were generated by a government entity that is 
presumably independent and unbiased and whose ultimate function is 
to protect the public by seeking out product defects, if they 
exist, gave the reports great credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court also ruled that the trial court was in error  
because it did not allow Suzuki to cross examine an expert witness 
for Ms. Rodriguez about the testing methodology. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lone dissenting opinion, Judge Ronnie White scolded the  
court for sending the case back to the trial court for a third 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kathyn Rodruguez is a real person. She is thirty-four years  
old and has spent the last nine years of her life paralyzed from 
the shoulders down,'' White wrote. ``While this does not mean she 
automatically deserves anything from Suzuki, what she deserves from 
this court is the same thing it owes all Missouri litigants: a 
speedy, just and final resolution of her claim.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WAPAKONETA, Ohio (AP) -- After a six-month countdown, the Neil  
Armstrong Air &AMP; Space Museum reopened Tuesday with more emphasis on 
the first man to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old museum, named after the publicity-shy native of  
this Ohio community, had closed Dec. 1 for a $750,000 remodeling 
and expansion. The project will be completed next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We decided it was time to update the museum as we were coming  
into the new century,'' said museum manager John Zwez. ``We needed 
more room to talk about the space shuttle and the international 
space station. And there is somewhat more of a focus on Neil and 
more of a focus on the Cold War and how we got to the moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New displays include Russian Sputnik spacecraft, artifacts and  
flight suits. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong and Apollo 11 crewmate Buzz Aldrin walked on the moon  
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong has no active role with the museum.

<HEADLINE> Pension Agency Loses Court Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal agency that takes over financially  
troubled pension plans lost a Supreme Court appeal today in a 
dispute over how much money it can collect from bankrupt companies 
after taking over their plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, without comment, turned away an appeal by the Pension  
Benefit Guaranty Corp. Lower courts had reduced the agency's claim 
against a Colorado steel company whose plan it assumed. 
</P>
<P>
	The PBGC is designed to protect beneficiaries of pension plans  
that get into financial difficulty. When the agency takes over a 
plan, it pays benefits to the beneficiaries and collects unpaid 
pension fund contributions from the employer. 
</P>
<P>
	CF&AMP;I Steel Corp., based in Pueblo, Colo., filed for bankruptcy  
reorganization in 1990 in Utah, where one of its subsidiaries was 
located. Two years later, the PBGC took over the pension plan and 
filed claims in bankruptcy court to collect unpaid contributions 
from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A bankruptcy judge followed a PBGC formula and calculated the  
main amount owed by the steel company for unfunded benefits at $221 
million. The judge ruled largely against the PBGC on another issue, 
saying only $1.6 million of its separate claim for post-bankruptcy 
contributions from CF&AMP;I would have priority over other claims. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge and the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled against use of the PBGC's formula, however, and the 
bankruptcy judge reduced the main amount to $123 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court ruled that the PBGC's formula does not apply  
in bankruptcy cases. 
</P>
<P>
	In other action today, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Rejected an appeal by Cable News Network over accusations that  
CNN violated a Montana couple's constitutional rights because its 
camera crew accompanied federal agents who raided their ranch. 
Without any comment, the justices left intact a federal appeals 
court ruling that would subject CNN to a trial on those 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Turned away the case of a New York girl who says school  
officials did nothing to stop her male classmates from sexually 
harassing her. The court, which recently decided that schools can 
be sued under one federal law for failing to stop student sexual 
harassment, refused to clarify whether such lawsuits can rely on 
another federal law as well. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let stand a lower court's ruling that two men could be  
prosecuted on drug-trafficking charges even after they were forced 
to pay a drug tax on the cocaine they illegally possessed. The two 
men, arrested in Kentucky, had paid a drug tax on the cocaine and 
then asked a state judge to dismiss the trafficking charges, saying 
it would subject them to double jeopardy. The judge did so, but the 
Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately ruled the two could be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the appeal acted on today related to pensions, government  
lawyers said the lower court rulings will encourage companies to 
file for bankruptcy to reduce their liability for unfunded pension 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to give priority to the PBGC's effort to collect  
post-bankruptcy pension contributions also means ``companies will 
have little or no incentive to continue funding while in 
bankruptcy,'' the appeal said. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel company's lawyers said allowing the PBGC to collect  
the money it seeks would harm other creditors, including former 
employees who still collect medical benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement reached when the company's assets were sold  
to another firm, the government could collect about $6 million if 
it won its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. vs. Reorganized CF&AMP;I  
Fabricators of Utah, 98-1440.

<HEADLINE> Post Office Targets Dog-Bite Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service has decided to make  
dog-bite prevention a summer-long project. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of warm weather tends to increase the confrontations  
between letter carriers and dogs. So post offices across the 
country are beginning safety campaigns aimed both at their workers 
and dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have improved markedly in recent years, postal officials  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 2,451 postal employees bitten by dogs last year, down  
167 from 1997 and far below the peak years in the 1980s when more 
than 7,000 letter carriers were attacked annually, the post office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston remained the most dangerous city for a letter carrier  
with 49 bitten last year. Even so, that was better than the 65 
attacked a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-place Chicago also showed a marked improvement, dropping  
from 55 bites in 1997 to 37 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami stayed in third place with 35 bites, down one, while Los  
Angeles went up three to 32 for fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	The only change in the top five dog bite cities was the New York  
City borough of Brooklyn, moving into fifth place, with 22 bites. A 
year earlier Cleveland was fifth, with 25, but reduced the toll 
last year to leave the most dangerous five. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office credited employee training and public education  
programs for the decline in bites since the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the 2,541 injured letter carriers is a tiny share of the  
estimated 4.7 million Americans bitten last year. About 60 percent 
of the victims were young children.

<HEADLINE> Students Return to Columbine High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- The backpacks dotting Columbine High  
School's hallways have been there since panicked students abandoned 
them and ran from gunfire and terror nearly six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A substitute teacher left her purse. Others left keys or books.  
</P>
<P>
	Today, most of the nearly 2,000 students and faculty were to  
return for the first time and retrieve items they left behind April 
20, when they ran from the building as Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Kaufman, spokesman for Jefferson County Public Schools,  
said students were assigned specific times to pick up their 
belongings in groups of 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Some items are being held as evidence and some areas remain  
off-limits. Things left in the commons area outside the cafeteria, 
where the attack began, or the library, where most people died, 
were taken to the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The library is still considered a crime scene,'' Kaufman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher and wounded  
21 others before taking their own lives. Columbine students 
finished the school year at nearby Chatfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
	The return was expected to be emotional and counselors were  
called in. Parents were also invited, said school spokeswoman 
Marilyn Saltzman. 
</P>
<P>
	The district will spend the summer renovating rooms damaged by  
bombs, bullets and water. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the dispute over how to memorialize the 15 deaths  
simmered as 13 crosses made a brief return to a hill overlooking 
the school in a Memorial Day tribute. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter Greg Zanis, whose crosses have been the subject of  
controversy since they were first erected, put them up again Monday 
on the hill overlooking the school for a brief tribute. He then 
moved them to private property, where they will remain until a 
decision is made on how to remember those killed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials have promised to build a memorial in Clement  
Park, but the design has not been finalized.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ready for Campaign Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- George W. Bush said Tuesday he's eager to  
leave the safe confines of Texas to test his mettle as a 
presidential candidate. ``I'm a battler,'' he said. ``I love to 
battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll have plenty of opportunities, as his political rivals seek  
to portray Bush as unproven, unworthy and unwilling to lead on 
tough issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a state legislative session he called ``successful  
and substantial,'' the Texas governor heads next week to Iowa and 
New Hampshire knowing he cannot possibly live up to the hype of his 
front-runner status. ``I understand the polls and the expectations 
are out of sight,'' Bush said in a session-closing news conference 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``As my daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as  
they think you are.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Without spending a single day on the campaign trail, the son of  
former President Bush is the Republican's top money raiser and 
leads every GOP presidential poll. His political organization, 
seeded with endorsements of the party's establishment, has begun to 
take shape in early voting states such as Iowa, New Hampshire and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	He was raking in more money Tuesday night at a San Antonio  
fund-raiser, the first he has attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the big question in American politics today is whether this  
amiable, twice-elected self-styled ``compassionate conservative'' 
can hold up under campaign pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to see what happens when he's exposed to oxygen. Some  
candidates erode,'' said consultant Dick Morris, who has worked for 
Republicans and Democrats. ``He's been in sequestration for so long 
that we don't know what will happen when he gets a whiff of air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's finally time for us to determine whether he is ready for  
the big leagues,'' Tony Coehlo, chairman of Vice President Al 
Gore's 2000 campaign, said in a telephone interview from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic operatives are already in Austin combing state  
records for political landmines that could be used against Bush in 
the general election. Coehlo said Gore's campaign is researching 
Bush's professional -- not personal -- background. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Bush's support of a concealed weapons law in Texas,  
coupled with his hedging on the gun control debate in Washington, 
will work against him in the campaign. ``You have to question 
whether he's tested,'' Coehlo said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, abortion, global warming and a few other national  
issues, Bush has responded slowly or issued ambiguous statements. 
He told reporters Tuesday not to expect detailed policy positions 
anytime soon, ducking questions about his tax policies and other 
dicey topics, such as ethanol subsidies in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be ample time during the course of the summer and  
fall to lay out a specific agenda on taxes and other measures,'' 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to contrast herself to Bush, GOP rival Elizabeth Dole has  
scheduled what aides say is a major policy address in Iowa on the 
day Bush makes his first campaign visit to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dole campaign will be issue-based and focused,'' spokesman  
Ari Fleischer said, implying that the Bush campaign will be 
neither. ``She knows who she is and what she stands for and won't 
hesitate to speak out on politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other GOP rivals suggest that Bush simply isn't ready for prime  
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get him off the front porch and into the race,''  
former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander said in a telephone 
interview. ``I'm eager to find out whether he's just another 
popular governor or whether he's ready to be president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Quayle, vice president under President Bush and a GOP  
presidential candidate in 2000, is warning Republicans that it 
would be a disaster to follow the polls and stampede behind the 
front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush bristles at suggestions that he is living off the family  
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people know a little more about me than you give  
people credit for,'' he told reporters Tuesday. ``They know I got a 
great mother and dad, of which I'm most proud. They're going to 
learn soon that I have a great wife. They're going to learn that I 
love my children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're going to even learn that I'm a tax-cutter,  
that I care about education, that I care passionately about making 
sure that we don't leave people behind,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush plans to use the 1999 legislative session to make those  
points. He helped secure $1.8 billion in tax cuts plus a raft of 
education initiatives, including $3,000 raises for teachers. Though 
the biggest tax cut in the state's history, Bush had sought nearly 
twice as much, and the reduction will likely have a marginal impact 
on Texans (the property tax will return about $60 to the owner of a 
$100,000 home). 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fixing to leave (for the campaign) and I'm looking forward  
to it,'' Bush said. ``I know I'm late in particular states. I know 
I have a lot of work to do. I know the expectations are high. But 
it's OK. I'm a battler. I love to battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Bush backers say he is bound to stumble but the true  
measure of their candidate will be his ability to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you have expectations this unrealistically high it is  
inevitable that there is a bit of correction,'' said GOP strategist 
Bruce Reed, a Bush ally. ``But the truth is anybody who think 
George W. Bush has a glass jaw is going to break their hand trying 
to swing at it.''

<HEADLINE> Barnes &AMP; Noble Merger Said Opposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Trade Commission staffers are opposing  
Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600 million plan to merge with the nation's 
largest book wholesaler, saying it violates antitrust laws, The New 
York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff has recommended that the full FTC block the plan by  
the nation's largest bookseller to acquire the Ingram Book Group, 
the Times reported, citing an unidentified source familiar with the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble executives say the merger would allow the company  
to reduce costs and delivery times to customers, particularly those 
online. Lawyers for Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram plan to discuss the 
deal with the FTC, which rarely overturns staff recommendations, 
the Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingram fills more than 58 percent of the orders of online  
bookseller Amazon.com, one of Barnes &AMP; Noble's primary Internet 
competitors. Ingram also is the sole supplier for many small 
bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers and independent booksellers have opposed the planned  
merger since its announcement in November. They say the deal will 
hurt competition and could affect credit, delivery speed and access 
to popular books that are in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes &AMP; Noble spokeswoman Mary Ellen Keating declined to  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Brack Had Everyone's Number at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For Kenny Brack, the final laps of the Indy 500  
came down to a simple matter of numbers and some long division. 
</P>
<P>
	Brack and his pit crew, headed by feisty car owner A.J. Foyt,  
had the calculations figured to the last decimal point, and it all 
added up to leader Robby Gordon running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	And when that happened, it meant Brack would win the world's  
most famous car race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew he would have to have to pit again,'' Brack said  
Tuesday, still aglow in his victory. ``He went in at lap 164. We 
went in at 169. To go 36 laps, you can't do it unless you have a 
bigger tank.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Gordon was equipped with the standard 35-gallon tank. So  
Brack was comfortable with his situation. It was just a matter of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to pit,'' Brack said. ``We weren't that worried.''  
</P>
<P>
	Still, auto racing is all about speed so Brack decided in the  
final laps to step on the gas -- since he had some left and Gordon 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	There was, after all, the possibility that, despite a fuel  
indicator pointing to empty, Gordon wouldn't pull in, gambling that 
a yellow flag would come up at the end, protecting his position. It 
never did. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he had a yellow, obviously he'd be able to make it,'' Brack  
said. ``I was faster at the end. A yellow before that last lap 
would not have been so good. I was a second behind when he pulled 
in. It was a relief. After that, it was a cruise to the flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his headphone, Brack heard Foyt screaming, ``We won this  
thing!'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a payoff for careful planning by Foyt and Brack and the  
rest of their team. The Swedish driver was cautious with his last 
fill-up of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were economy driving after the last pit stop,'' Brack said.  
``By 193 or 194, we had saved enough to go faster at the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was conservative at the start. I was leading. I didn't want  
to do anything stupid to keep the lead. We kept pace. I knew there 
would be more yellows and a lot of stuff happening. I stayed on my 
pace. I didn't take unnecessary risks at the start, in the middle 
or at the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory was worth $1,465,190, the second biggest prize in  
Indy history. 
</P>
<P>
	``To win a race like this, you have to prepare every little  
detail, when to take risks and when not to take risks,'' Brack 
said. ``You don't win by taking chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And how much fuel was left in Brack's tank at the end?  
</P>
<P>
	``About two gallons,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	More than enough, it turned out.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Candidate Asks for Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's presidential frontrunner  
appealed for peace during campaign stops in two provinces Tuesday 
as her supporters fought with rivals elsewhere in clashes that left 
at least eight injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding  
president, Sukarno, is the favorite in Monday's parliamentary 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	She first visited East Timor, where violence has risen among  
factions fighting for and against independence with the approach of 
an Aug. 8 referendum on the future of the former Portuguese colony, 
invaded by Indonesia in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is impossible for acts of violence to resolve the problem  
of East Timor,'' Megawati told 3,000 supporters. ``I hope the 
ballot process will be conducted properly and the Timorese can 
decide their own future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati, 52, later campaigned in Ambon, where violence among  
rival Muslims and Christians has left more than 300 dead this year. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim.  
Some conservative Islamic religious leaders have said they oppose a 
woman becoming head of state, despite Megawati's wide popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	But as she campaigned, witnesses said clashes erupted in  
Ujungpandang, on Sulawesi island, 840 miles northeast of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati supporters tore down a sign hanging from a private  
Muslim university that read: ``Are Muslims willing to be led by a 
woman?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students responded by burning campaign flags emblazoned with a  
bull's head, the symbol of Megawati's party, the Indonesian 
Democratic Party for Struggle. The students halted a convoy of her 
supporters, threw rocks and damaged a car and a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of security officers rushed in to separate the two  
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	Megawati hopes to unseat President B.J. Habibie, the hand-picked  
successor of President Suharto, who left office last year amid mass 
demonstrations and deadly riots. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning for the parliamentary elections will go on for three  
more days, followed by a two-day cooling-off period before the 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of 100 electoral monitors will be led by former  
President Carter, who said Tuesday that he thinks Indonesians want 
peaceful change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indonesians have voiced a clear commitment to a more open form  
of government and to a democratic electoral process,'' Carter said 
in a statement from Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Livent To Sell Assets to SFX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Livent, the troubled Canadian company that  
produced ``Ragtime'' and ``Fosse'' on Broadway, has agreed to sell 
most of its assets to SFX Entertainment, the nation's leading 
producer and promoter of live shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed Tuesday, but news reports  
have speculated that the price could exceed $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale, which is subject to approval by a federal bankruptcy  
court, includes Livent theaters in New York, Chicago and Toronto as 
well as rights to such current Livent productions as ``Fosse,'' 
``Ragtime'' and the Toronto production of ``The Phantom of the 
Opera.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SFX already is a powerhouse on the road, not only in staging and  
promoting concerts and other live entertainment, but in touring 
Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent filed for bankruptcy protection in November after its new  
owners, including super agent Michael Ovitz, said they discovered 
accounting fraud by the company's Canadian founders, Garth 
Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb.

<HEADLINE> Husband Charged in Neb. Coach Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAHOO, Neb. (AP) -- A first-degree murder charge was filed today  
against a man accused of killing his wife, a high school teacher 
and coach, and then covering up the crime with a staged car 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Conviction would carry a sentence of life in prison or the death  
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Schnabel, 42, is accused of killing his 40-year-old wife,  
Sandy Schnabel, a popular volleyball coach and 12-year business 
teacher at Yutan High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Schnabel's body was found under her smashed and burning  
minivan May 22. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities said they believe her husband either planned his  
wife's death or beat her in a fit of passion, and then placed her 
under the blazing vehicle to cover up the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Saunders County Attorney Tom Jaudzemis said he is convinced  
Schnabel set the fire, and the autopsy, which showed the fire was 
the cause of Mrs. Schnabel's death, was a ``big, big factor'' in 
his decision to file a first-degree murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
	First-degree murder requires premeditation. The charge also can  
be filed in killings that occur in the commission of another 
felony, such as arson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnabel, a landscape designer, was arrested Wednesday at his  
wife's burial service. His attorney, Chuck Forrest, maintains that 
Schnabel is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaudzemis said the Schnabels had marital and financial troubles  
and Schnabel took out a $200,000 life insurance policy on his wife 
about a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Actress Hillary Brooke Dies at 84 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONSALL, Calif. (AP) -- Hillary Brooke, the elegant blond actress  
who played the ``other woman'' in dozens of movies and had a 
recurring role in the 1950s TV sitcom ``My Little Margie,'' has 
died. She was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Brooke died May 25 in Bonsall in Southern California,  
according to a friend, Helen Lovass. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Miss Brooke was often tagged a ``blonde bombshell,''  
she once publicly challenged a psychology professor's claim that 
``intelligence can repel a man'' and that smart actresses would 
frighten male fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Vacuity will never substitute for a glint of intelligence,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although never a leading lady, the former model worked with top  
actors and directors in such movies as ``Jane Eyre,'' (1944) which 
starred Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine; ``The Enchanted Cottage,'' 
(1944) starring Robert Young; ``Road to Utopia'' (1945) starring 
Bob Hope and Bing Crosby; and Alfred Hitchcock's ``The Man Who Knew 
Too Much'' (1956). 
</P>
<P>
	She appeared in ``My Little Margie'' from 1952 to 1955, playing  
Roberta Townsend, who was often romantically linked with Margie's 
father, Vernon Albright, played by Charles Farrell.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Activist Arrested in Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMLET, N.C. (AP) -- A man who gained national notoriety when he  
held newspaper employees hostage 11 years ago was arrested Tuesday 
on murder charges, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Hatcher, 41, was taken into custody without incident while  
driving away from a house in Hamlet, about 75 miles east of 
Charlotte, Sheriff Glenn Maynor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maynor said Hatcher was wanted in a drive-by shooting Monday  
night near Maxton, where Hatcher used to live. Investigators said 
Bryan McMillian, 19, was killed at his rural home when Hatcher 
fired into a building with a high-powered rifle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know what the motive behind this one was,'' said  
homicide Capt. Randal Patterson. ``He shot the house. He didn't 
know what he was going to hit and probably didn't know who all was 
in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher also had been sought since May 19, when a man was shot  
and wounded in a convenience store in Lumberton, about 110 miles 
east of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher and Timothy Jacobs, both Tuscarora Indians, took over  
The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton on Feb. 1, 1988. The armed 
men said they were protesting what they said was corruption in 
Robeson County government. They held hostages for 10 hours before 
surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair were acquitted of federal hostage-taking and firearms  
charges, but were later indicted on state charges. Both went to 
prison -- Hatcher for five years and Jacobs for less than three -- 
and were eventually paroled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher was being held Tuesday night at a prison in Raleigh that  
has medical facilities able to treat the symptoms of AIDS, which 
Hatcher said he contracted while in prison.

<HEADLINE> ETrade Is Buying Telebanc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Leading online broker ETrade Group Inc. is  
buying online banker Telebanc Financial Corp. for $1.6 billion in 
stock, creating the first purely Internet-based financial services 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the merger is complete, ETrade customers will be able to  
trade stocks, apply for mortgages and pay bills all on the same Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will carry the name ETrade, company  
executives said Tuesday. Customers will access Telebanc's banking 
services through links on ETrade's main site. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., made its name as a stock  
brokerage but has been trying to diversify. The company already 
sells mutual funds and has a deal with online mortgage provider 
E-Loan Inc. that lets ETrade's one-million-plus customers apply for 
home mortgages online. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Arlington, Va.-based Telebanc in its fold, ETrade has  
moved closer to becoming a full-service financial site, offering a 
range of online services for all sorts of transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Telebanc Financial is the holding company for Telebank, one of  
several Internet-based banks that serve customers without any 
actual branch offices. Since the banks don't have to pay for 
branches, they say they can operate more inexpensively -- and thus 
pay higher deposit rates and charge lower fees -- than traditional 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurred by the competition, established brokerage firms like  
Charles Schwab now offer online trading, and brokerage giant 
Merrill Lynch announced Tuesday that it will be online by December. 
But the non-Internet based firms may charge more for services -- 
Merrill Lynch, for example, plans to charge $29.95 a trade, 
compared to ETrade's $14.95. 
</P>
<P>
	Established ``brick-and-mortar'' banks and brokerages still  
control a substantial portion of the financial services market. But 
as those firms start to add Internet services, millions of new 
customers will try online finance, and the Internet-based firms 
will then lure them with cheaper prices, said Mitchell H. Caplan, 
Telebanc's vice chairman, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Internet banking is not yet really known nationwide or  
worldwide,'' Caplan said. ``They educate ... and we then go and 
scoop up those consumers with the better-value equation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though most online brokers offer some limited banking services,  
only one other company has tried to combine large-scale Internet 
banking and brokerage. That company, Royal Bank of Canada, owns 
Bull &AMP; Bear Securities Inc. and Telebanc rival Security First 
Network Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	But Telebanc is much larger than Security First and its other  
rivals, Caplan said. He said the company has almost 70,000 customer 
accounts and is bigger than the next five Internet banks combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement, Telebanc shareholders will get 2.1  
shares of ETrade common stock for each share of Telebanc common 
stock. Officials said the merger should close this fall, pending 
regulatory and stockholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of ETrade fell Tuesday in trading on the Nasdaq Stock  
Market, reducing the value of the deal, which was worth $1.8 
billion when it was announced. Shares fell $5.18 3/4, or nearly 12 
percent, to $39.31 1/4, while shares of Telebanc rose $8, or 12 
percent, to $74.50, also on the Nasdaq.

<HEADLINE> Jury Set in Utah Polygamist Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The practice of polygamy was in the  
spotlight today as attorneys selected a jury to hear the case 
against a man accused of making his underage niece his 15th wife 
and having sex with her. 
</P>
<P>
	David O. Kingston is charged with incest and unlawful sexual  
contact with a minor, but his case also is attracting international 
attention to Utah's peculiar and thriving polygamy practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston was in 3rd District Court this morning, accompanied by  
his first wife, Sharli Rae Jenkins Kingston. Kingston took lengthy 
notes during the beginning of jury selection and made eye contact 
with each of the prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	By noon, the jury of eight men and one alternate -- picked from a  
pool of 50 prospective jurors -- was seated and opening arguments 
were scheduled for this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, defense attorney Stephen McCaughey made two motions  
which were denied by Judge David Young. McCaughey asked to call 
prosecutor Dane Nolan as a witness in the case, and he also 
requested that information about an alleged beating given to the 
girl by her father be prohibited from the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaughey said Nolan, who interviewed the girl twice, would have  
critical information about alleged inconsistencies in the girl's 
story. Calling Nolan as a witness would have disqualified him to 
serve as an attorney in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaughey has said the the niece has given different stories  
about how many times they had sex. Prosecutors say it happened four 
times in 1997 and 1998; the defense denied they had sex at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Young denied that motion and also ruled that the alleged beating  
could be discussed during the trial. The judge said McCaughey could 
raise his objections to the second decision on rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kingston is an accountant for the secretive Kingston clan  
based in Salt Lake County, which has as many as 1,000 members and 
business assets worth up to $150 million. The clan shares many of 
the beliefs of other polygamous groups in the state but stands 
apart, former members say, in practicing incest. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began last summer when the girl, then 16, showed up at  
a rural gas station just south of the Idaho state line. She said 
she had run seven miles from a family ranch where her father had 
beaten her for trying to leave a forced marriage with her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl's father, John Kingston, pleaded no contest to child  
abuse and could get up to five years in prison at his sentencing 
June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	David Kingston, 32, could get up to five years in prison and a  
$10,000 fine on each of four counts if convicted. He has rejected 
all proposed plea bargains and insists he is innocent, his attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modern-day polygamists, unlike 70 percent of Utah's population,  
are not members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
But their practices have roots in the early church, when founder 
Joseph Smith sanctioned plural marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The early Mormons' practice of plural marriage was renounced by  
the church in 1890, after the U.S. Congress passed tough 
anti-bigamy laws. Then Congress insisted the anti-polygamy clause 
be included in the Utah Constitution when Utah was granted 
statehood in 1896.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Might Have Arena Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A Baptist youth convention planned for the  
Alamodome on June 25-26 could conflict with a San Antonio Spurs 
home game should the team reach the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention is expected to draw 15,000 to 20,000 people to  
the dome on a Friday and Saturday, both eyed as potential game 
dates in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs executives said Tuesday they have been negotiating with  
all parties involved to try to work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to get solved in at least the next week to two weeks.  
We don't have much time beyond that,'' said Russ Bookbinder, Spurs 
vice president of business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio leads the Portland Trail Blazers 2-0 in the  
best-of-7 Western Conference finals. The winner advances to the NBA 
Finals to face the winner of the Indiana-New York Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to get settled because we're not going to give up a  
home playoff date, from a competitive standpoint. And I think the 
NBA is working towards a solution,'' Bookbinder said. 
</P>
<P>
	No conflict would occur if either of the current playoff series  
lasts six or seven games. But if both series finish in five games 
or less, there could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Alamodome director Mike Abington said the Baptist convention was  
scheduled before it was known the playoff season would last longer 
than usual because of the NBA lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortened season began in February instead of November.  
Normally, the NBA Finals are finished by June 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``San Antonio committed to the convention when there were no  
conflicts,'' Abington said. ``This conflict is a casualty of the 
NBA lockout.''

<HEADLINE> Boxing League Proposes Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Borrowing a page from college football  
bowls, NASCAR and other pro sports, Pensacola lawyer Fred Levin 
wants to create a boxing league with corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, who represents five-time world champion Roy Jones Jr. and  
other boxers, hopes the World Boxing League can replace the 
hodge-podge of sanctioning organizations already out there -- WBC, 
WBA, WBO, WBU, IBF, IBO, and so on. The proliferation has resulted 
in multiple champions and fan confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to go back to the old days, when everybody knew who  
the champion was, and the respect boxing had,'' Levin told the 
Pensacola News Journal for a story Monday. ``It was the great 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	January 2000 is the tentative start date for the WBL.  
</P>
<P>
	Levin created the WBL concept with Terdema Ussery, president and  
chief executive officer of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. Ussery is a 
former Continental Basketball Association commissioner and 
ex-president of Nike Sports Management where he got to knew Levin 
and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	They have sought help from artist and boxing fan LeRoy Neiman as  
well as former FBI investigator Warren Flagg. 
</P>
<P>
	Murad Muhammad, Jones' promoter and a Levin client, said he  
welcomed the new league but was skeptical about its chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come into the world with a new sanctioning group like the  
IBC and the like, all alphabets, no one knows them,'' Muhammad 
said. ``So how could you come on the level of the IBF, WBC and WBA? 
These guys have been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only thing Levin has going for him is that a wealthy  
sponsor might be able to sustain the league over the long haul. 
``If they keep it going 10 years, it will be a factor,'' Muhammad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin raised the possibility of such a league during testimony  
in March, 1998 before a Senate committee that was investigating 
professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically said private-sector sponsorship, rather than  
legislation, is really the answer,'' Levin said. A corporate 
sponsor would give the sport legitimacy through a recognizable, 
credible brand name, similar to the Winston Cup in NASCAR, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the WBL,'' Levin said. ``It's the WBL Pepsi  
World Championship, for example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsorship and sale of stock would allow the league  
to operate without charging sanctioning fees that typically take 3 
percent from each fighter's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin also envisions a reduction to about 10 weight classes with  
the emphasis on title fights that would appeal to television 
matchmakers who often are forced to show mandatory mismatches under 
the existing structure. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes boxers would be ranked by something like the media  
polls used in college football. Sanctioning bodies produce their 
own rankings that are susceptible to influence from promoters and 
often fail to recognize another group's champion as a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin is one of the nation's most successful plaintiff lawyers.  
He engineered Florida's suit against the tobacco industry that 
resulted in a $13 billion settlement. He contributed $10 million 
from his tobacco fees to the University of Florida law school which 
then was named after him.

<HEADLINE> IOC Takes Steps on Path to Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- As the International Olympic  
Committee considers how to restructure itself, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch has made it clear there isn't any imminent change at the 
top. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch reiterated Monday his intention to serve the final two  
years of his term as IOC president, dismissing speculation -- 
including from one of his own deputies -- that he might step down 
early. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Samaranch said he  
will heed the wishes of the IOC delegates who gave him an 
overwhelming vote of confidence -- 86-2 -- during the crisis meeting 
in March on the Salt Lake City scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``My position depends on the IOC members,'' Samaranch said  
Monday. ``The secret ballot we had in Lausanne was very clear. The 
IOC members think I am the right man at this moment to lead the 
changes we need in the IOC. With the confidence of the IOC members, 
I am ready to finish my mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been in office since 1980, was re-elected to  
his latest four-year term in 1997 and is due to serve until the IOC 
session in Moscow in September 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice president Dick Pound of Canada, a leading presidential  
contender, recently suggested that Samaranch could decide to retire 
at the end of this year after ushering in a series of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual public rebuke by a fellow IOC executive board  
member, Kevan Gosper of Australia -- another presidential hopeful -- 
said Pound's remarks were ``rather unfortunate to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His postulation that Samaranch might go early was unwelcome,''  
Gosper said. ``Samaranch's intentions are quite clear: he intends 
to see out his mandate. He has repeated that to me and I fully 
support that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who wrote to Pound expressing disappoinment at his  
comments, said Monday that the two remain on good terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't judge what he said or did not say,'' Samaranch said.  
``What I am judging with Dick Pound is our relations of 18-19 
years. He is always working very close to me. I am giving him the 
most important responsibilities. Dick Pound was one who always 
defended me. I consider Dick Pound one of the most important 
members of the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch spoke on the eve of the inaugural meeting of the IOC's  
new reform commission, an 80-member task force charged with 
reshaping the 105-year-old organization after its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC 2000 panel, meeting today and Wednesday, will begin  
examining ways of overhauling the IOC's structure and the process 
for selecting Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the commission is expected to consider  
changes to the way IOC members are selected, including the 
possibility of term limits and reduction of the age limit from 80 
to between 70 and 75. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is scheduled to submit a preliminary report June  
20 at the next IOC general assembly in Seoul, South Korea. 
Samaranch hopes final recommendations will be approved at a special 
IOC session in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``This meeting is only the beginning,'' Samaranch. ``We cannot  
expect any kind of resolution this week. Our aim is to have final 
decisions by the end of the year. If that's not possible, then by 
the spring of next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch said the reforms would not be dictated by pressure  
from Arizona Sen. John McCain and other congressional critics who 
have threatened to enact legislation that would punish the IOC 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can do what they desire,'' Samaranch said. ``But I  
repeat: The IOC is run by the IOC members. ... We highly respect 
the Senate of the United States, but I am sure they also will 
respect the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Originally planned as a group of 20-24 people, the reform  
commission has expanded to 80 members -- 44 from the IOC and 36 from 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is divided into three working groups: the  
composition and structure of the IOC, the role of the IOC, and the 
selection of Olympic host cities. 
</P>
<P>
	A 26-member executive committee, divided equally among IOC and  
non-IOC members, will oversee the reform process. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the most prominent non-IOC members on the commission are  
Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State; Peter 
Ueberroth, chief organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Games; Italian 
industrialist Giovanni Agnelli; former U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt; NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol; and 
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former Costa Rica president Oscar 
Arias Sanchez.

<HEADLINE> Religious School Subsidy Ban Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A federal appeals court has upheld a  
Maine law that bars the state from paying students' tuition at 
religious schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Maine law, families who live in towns without public  
secondary schools may send pupils to any public or nonsectarian 
private school, with the state picking up at least part of the 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston agreed with a lower  
judge's ruling that the state is not constitutionally required to 
extend subsidies to parochial schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Conn, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of  
Church and State, called the ruling a landmark decision against 
school voucher proponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the highest federal court that has ruled on the school  
voucher issue,'' he said Tuesday. ``It's a very important 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court has let stand a Wisconsin program that  
provides financial help for families whose children attend 
religious schools. But the justices voted not to hear a challenge 
to the Wisconsin program and did not issue a decision or set a 
national precedent. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling in the Maine case was issued Thursday, but the  
parties involved did not learn of the decision until after the 
holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Center for Law and Justice, a group founded by the  
Christian Coalition's Pat Robertson that is representing the 
plaintiffs, vowed to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The case began when three parents sued Maine's education  
commissioner for state money to send their children to a Catholic 
high school.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Insist on Doping Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADERBORN, Germany (AP) -- European Union sports ministers  
threatened Tuesday to set up their own doping agency if the 
International Olympic Committee fails to accept their demands. 
</P>
<P>
	French sports minister Marie-George Buffet outlined the program  
during an informal meeting of the ministers in a German castle. 
</P>
<P>
	In comments to the German radio, she called the demands  
``nonnegotiable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Participants at the conference said there was wide agreement on  
the demands, which will be officially presented Wednesday, 
according to German Interior Minister Otto Schily, the informal 
meeting's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Schily has been one of the sharpest critics of IOC doping  
policies. As interior minister, Schily's responsibilities include 
overseeing sports. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU sports ministers want the IOC to set up a worldwide  
doping agency by Jan. 1, 2000. The agency should be able to conduct 
drug tests without advance warning and must be able to impose 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's seat must not be in Lausanne, Switzerland, which is  
also the headquarters of the IOC. The agency should be financed by 
participating governments, the ministers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	If the IOC does not accept these conditions, the EU will set up  
its own doping agency, participants said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU remained on a collision course with the IOC also by  
insisting on a minimum two-year ban for first-time drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Several major sports, such as soccer, cycling and tennis, are  
opposed to a two-year ban, arguing that such punishment for a first 
offense would never hold up to challenges under right-to-work laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Schily was expected to meet Wednesday with Sepp Blatter,  
president of FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, and Lennart 
Johansson, president of soccer's European ruling body UEFA. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the meeting in Paderborn, Blatter said FIFA would not  
back down. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this question, there will be no compromise with FIFA. An  
automatic two-year ban will not be imposed with our approval. 
Never,'' Blatter said during a gathering of soccer officials Monday 
in Lorsch, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in Lausanne in February, the 15 EU governments and  
the IOC failed to agree on a doping program. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU governments refused to allow the IOC a lead role in the  
proposed doping agency, which would supervise worldwide drug 
testing and policy and have an initial budget of $25 million.

<HEADLINE> Karpov To Sue Over Chess Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The World Chess Championships that were delayed  
last year to placate defending champion Anatoly Karpov will be held 
in Las Vegas next month. Karpov's agent said he won't participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Shiloh Quinn of Montreal, who represents Karpov, said the  
Russian champion would file a lawsuit to try and block the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's already scheduled to do things,'' Quinn said Tuesday.  
``They were supposed to consult with him and they didn't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov won the world title in January 1998 and was to have held  
it for two years. But the 150-country World Chess Federation, known 
by its French acronym, FIDE, decided the championship should take 
place annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Karpov objected to that and to new rules that called for him to  
compete from the start of the tournament. In the past, the 100 top 
chess players from around the world competed against each other, 
with the lone survivor playing the reigning champion for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans to hold the tournament in Las Vegas late last year were  
scrubbed, in part because Karpov said he would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Next month's tournament is scheduled to be held at Caesars  
Palace, with 100 of the world's top players beginning competition 
July 30. Final play is set for Aug. 22-28.

<HEADLINE> IOC Member Looks To Clear Name </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Australian IOC member Phil Coles  
said Tuesday he would clear his name when he appears before a 
special panel investigating charges of ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said it was a ``good sign'' he had been asked to appear  
before the three-member panel on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot to say, a lot to present,'' Coles said.  
``I've got every confidence in that special commission, they are 
very capable people. I wanted to come. I couldn't see the meeting 
taking place without me being here to present my information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles said he doesn't believe the panel will recommend his  
expulsion from the International Olympic Committee when it reports 
its findings to the executive board at its next meeting June 16 in 
Seoul, South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that will happen but we'll just play that as it  
comes,'' Coles said. ``But I really don't believe that will 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC vice presidents Keba Mbaye and Anita DeFrantz and executive  
board member Marc Hodler could recommend that the case be dropped 
or that Coles be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the 
full IOC assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles has already received a severe warning from the IOC for  
accepting lavish travel and other incentives from Salt Lake 
bidders, and is under investigation for further allegations of 
abusing his Olympic positions. 
</P>
<P>
	His ex-wife told the IOC that the couple received jewelry valued  
at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid for the 
1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Most recently, the Australian has been accused of compiling  
secret dossiers on IOC members for Sydney's successful 2000 bid. 
Those files were also passed on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles again denied any wrongdoing.  
</P>
<P>
	``They certainly have attacked me without any consultation or  
any knowledge of where it all came from but we'll have the 
opportunity on Thursday,'' he said. ``But it was terribly 
embarrassing to have private memo notes published.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The continued controversy has taken its toll on Coles, who was  
subdued and cautious throughout a news conference hours after his 
arrival from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an absolute nightmare,'' Coles said. ``I've never  
seen such vilification. But I'm confident there are brighter 
horizons ahead. ... I'm hoping this will be the finish of it 
here.''

<HEADLINE> SLOC Officials Shuffle Jobs Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Salt Lake Organizing Committee has  
promoted Gordon Crabtree to a job with some responsibilities 
similar to those he had when he first started working for the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC also announced Tuesday that chief operating officer  
Fraser Bullock has taken over as chief financial officer -- the post 
Crabtree was originally hired for -- as part of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree will take over as managing director of finance, the  
SLOC said. He will receive the financial updates of most staff 
members previously reporting to former chief financial officer Mark 
Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree will report directly to Bullock as well as Brett  
Hopkins, SLOC's director of financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Crabtree, who had served as the state's director of  
finance for 10 years, was hired as the SLOC's chief financial 
officer. He quit two years later shortly after Frank Joklik took 
over the SLOC for former president Tom Welch, who pleaded no 
contest to a spouse abuse charge and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabtree cited personal reasons for quitting, but later  
acknowledged that subsequent changes after Joklik took over 
prompted his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner was hired to replace Crabtree, who continued to work for  
the SLOC as a consultant. Crabtree returned full time in July 1998 
as director of finance, a job with narrower responsibilities than 
his earlier post. 
</P>
<P>
	But Joklik resigned during a house-cleaning of the SLOC after  
the Olympic bribery scandal broke. Mitt Romney took over as 
president in February and brought Bullock with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month Tanner announced he was resigning to become chief  
financial officer at Salt Lake-based Mrs. Field's Cookies, citing 
financial reasons. He will make considerably more money and his new 
job is more secure, since it will exist after the 2002 Winter 
Olympics are over. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanner dismissed suggestions he resigned because he had felt  
left out since Romney and Bullock's arrival.

<HEADLINE> NBC Sports Chief Assails Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The head of the Olympics' biggest  
revenue source accused a major sponsor of damaging fund raising for 
American athletes through ``cynical ... self-serving'' attacks on 
the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Sports president Dick Ebersol described David D'Alessandro,  
the president of John Hancock insurance and the most vocal 
corporate critic in the Salt Lake City scandal, as a ``bully'' 
motivated by a thirst for publicity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's motivated by his own desire to be on a soapbox,''  
Ebersol said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, D'Alessandro said Hancock was  
dedicated to helping athletes directly and will continue to support 
Olympic organizers in Sydney and Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we are saying is, until we see what the reforms are, don't  
support the IOC,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro said he had not spoken with Ebersol during the  
scandal. He called the NBC chief's statements a ``desperate and sad 
commentary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were Dick Ebersol and had hitched my career to the  
Olympics, I'd be pretty scared, too,'' D'Alessandro said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC has a $3.5 billion deal with the IOC for the U.S. television  
rights to five Olympics between 2000 and 2008. 
</P>
<P>
	Hancock pays more than $40 million for a berth in the  
International Olympic Committee's highest-level sponsorship 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, D'Alessandro pulled out of negotiations with  
NBC for $20 million in ads during Olympic telecasts to protest the 
IOC's handling of the Salt Lake crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro also has removed the Olympic rings from the  
company's annual report, billboards and stationery. He has accused 
the IOC of failing to take decisive action or commit to true 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has probably, more than anyone else, deeply harmed fund  
raising efforts for American athletes,'' Ebersol said in an 
interview. ``The IOC has raised all the money they are going to 
raise in the United States and NBC is doing fine with our 
advertising efforts. The only ones being hurt are American athletes 
and Salt Lake organizers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said many other U.S. companies are ready to step in as a  
replacement for Hancock in the financial services sponsorship 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was me, I'd give back the money,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol also said NBC is not interested in signing any  
advertising deal with D'Alessandro. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need him,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said NBC has already sold ad time to another American  
insurance company, which he declined to identify, and expects to 
sign deals with three others before the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol is a member of IOC 2000, a reform commission that met  
for the first time Tuesday to begin studying ways of restructuring 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ebersol said D'Alessandro had refused to acknowledge that the  
IOC had taken significant steps to clean up the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he thought through his actions,'' Ebersol said.  
``He's been so eager to say the big, attention-getting statement, 
that he hasn't paid attention that there have been serious reforms 
addressed in the last couple of months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the wake of  
the scandal, the biggest purge in the committee's 105 years. 
Besides IOC 2000, the committee also formed an ethics panel with 
outside members. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro has said Hancock will honor its Olympic contract  
that runs through the 2000 Games in Sydney but is undecided whether 
to sign up for the next IOC program that would go through at least 
2004. He cited ``preliminary indications'' the IOC might not invite 
Hancock back. 
</P>
<P>
	D'Alessandro recently questioned the makeup of IOC 2000, which  
expanded from a planned 24 members in March to 80 members, 
including 44 IOC delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have now loaded your reform committee with people who have  
Olympic DNA, and clearly the offspring of that union will be as 
cross-eyed as the other results you've brought so far,'' 
D'Alessandro said.

	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar was mixed against most major currencies  
in European trading today. Gold prices fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 120.95 Japanese yen from 121.47 yen late

<HEADLINE> Avondale Nearing Shipbuilder Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Avondale Industries Inc., a major Navy  
shipbuilder, is prepared to accept a $500 million cash buyout offer 
from defense contractor Litton Industries Inc., but is giving a 
rival bidder two days to top it. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale, based in New Orleans, earlier agreed to merge with  
Newport News Shipbuilding in a $470 million stock swap deal. In a 
statement Tuesday, Avondale chairman Albert L. Bossier Jr. said the 
Litton offer, which amounts to $39.50 per share, is a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale said it has given the Virginia-based Newport News 48  
hours notice of its intention to go with the Litton deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News had no comment on the announcement, said company  
spokeswoman Jerri Fuller Dickseski. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Agular, an analyst who follows Avondale for New  
Orleans-based Johnson Rice &AMP; Co., said he expects Litton to be the 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Newport News is going to come with a higher  
offer, though I could be surprised,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also doesn't expect many layoffs, even though the merger  
would join two major Gulf Coast shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The amount of work these companies both have is always going  
to be determined by the number of workers in their yards,'' Agular 
said. ``In the overhead -- the corporate administrative side -- there 
may be some. But I think it will be minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Newport News-Avondale merger was apparently doomed Friday  
when Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon would 
probably tell the Justice Department to reject the Woodland Hills, 
Calif.-based Litton's $1.3 billion bid for Newport News for 
anti-competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Cohen said the Navy had determined it would  
not oppose Litton's offer for Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton owns Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss. Litton  
made its bids for Avondale and Newport News earlier in May after 
Cohen rejected an attempt by General Dynamics Corp. to acquire 
Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Cohen said that the Navy had made a ``preliminary  
determination'' that Litton's bid for Newport News would 
excessively limit competition in naval shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News deal would have reduced the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News is the Navy's only builder of nuclear-powered  
aircraft carriers. Ingalls makes destroyers and other surface 
ships; Avondale specializes in auxiliary and amphibious craft. 
Ingalls and Avondale have competed for some defense contracts, as 
well as for building cruise ships. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Tuesday, shares of Newport News rose 56 1/4 cents to  
$28.06 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Litton rose 18 3/4 
cents to $65.37 1/2 on the NYSE, while shares of Avondale rose $1.65 5/8 
to $38.15 5/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Paris Bourse To Go Public Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. GALLEN, Switzerland (AP) -- The Paris Bourse is ready to go  
public and plans to do so next year, the chief executive of the 
French exchange said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dominique Brutin said that in the past two years, the Bourse has  
transformed from a cooperative to a company with shares. ``Now we 
are ready,'' he told reporters at a management symposium here. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to us because when you discuss what is the  
best exchange, what is the most efficient if you are on the market 
it's a good answer, it's the real answer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paris exchange is one of eight major European stock  
exchanges which have signed a memorandum of understanding to form a 
partnership to create a pan-European bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the exchanges have said shares from those  
exchanges should be able to trade on each other's exchanges by the 
end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Brutin said a pan-European alliance should be exclusive but also  
should allow for smaller linkups with other exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Teamsters Continue Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Talks between the Teamsters union and  
companies that haul new cars to dealerships went into overtime 
Tuesday as negotiators sought to avoid a strike that could cause 
long waits and higher prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making progress but it's going to be a late evening,''  
said Teamsters' president James P. Hoffa, who is facing his first 
major challenge at the bargaining table since March when he was 
sworn in as head of the union once led by his late father, Jimmy 
Hoffa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ian Hunter, chief negotiator for the National Automobile  
Transporters labor division, representing the companies' management 
at the talks in suburban Arlington, Va., said progress was ``slow 
but steady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' contract with 17 trucking companies that hauled  
more than 15 million cars last year was scheduled to expire at 
12:01 a.m. EDT on Tuesday. However, Hoffa agreed to extend the 
strike deadline for 24 hours so the union could evaluate a 
last-minute offer from the employers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters' contract covers about 12,800 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers. Union haulers currently earn $68,000 a 
year in wages and benefits, with salaries of $55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	By late afternoon Tuesday, Hoffa said some issues had been  
resolved, including an agreement to equalize pay rates that have 
differed for drivers in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Teamsters claimed victory in a dispute over the  
possible use of Mexican drivers and trucks to deliver vehicles in 
the United States after the U.S.-Mexican border opens up Jan. 1 
under the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials said they had no plans to hire Mexican  
truckers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney praised the  
Teamsters, saying ``cross-border trucking poses significant risks 
and concerns to working families and the American public's 
safety.... America's highways will be safer now that Mexican 
trucking is off the car haul negotiating table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some progress, however, Hoffa warned that some key  
issues remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to give everybody a shot clock. We don't have  
forever,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among remaining points of contention that Hoffa has said the  
union is willing to strike over are the companies' proposals to 
start new workers at lower wages and to hire part-time drivers. 
Another key Teamsters' demand is for higher pensions for workers 
who retire after 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Auto industry analysts said a strike of any significant length  
could hurt consumers as well as car companies. Shoppers who order 
new cars may face a long wait, and dealers could drop some sales 
incentives to ease demand. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Teamsters haulers' strike could interrupt what could be a  
banner profit year for the car companies,'' said Lincoln Merrihew, 
automotive analyst for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, in Lexington, Mass. 
``Automakers really want to capitalize on the fact that consumers 
are very confident right now and are really responding to (sales) 
incentives ... but if there's a real shortage, dealers might be 
less willing to negotiate and prices might go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, a 32-day walkout by just 5,000 Teamsters working for  
Ryder System Inc. prevented the transport of thousands of new cars 
to dealers from factories, ports and distribution centers. 
</P>
<P>
	With unemployment at its lowest level in nearly three decades  
and the stock market climbing, Americans have been snapping up new 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contend the trucking companies have shared in the  
profits and can afford to treat workers better. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the companies say their share of business has declined  
in recent years due to competition from railroads and nonunion 
haulers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we change the way we do business, there will be less  
business for us, and fewer union jobs, in the future,'' said 
Hunter.

<HEADLINE> Air Fares Hike Upwards Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Just in time for the summer travel season, major  
airlines have announced another round of air fare increases. 
</P>
<P>
	The third fare increase of 1999 -- a 4 percent hike for seven-,  
14- and 21-day advance fares -- was instituted last week by 
Continental Airlines and has been matched by American Airlines, 
Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, United Airlines and TWA. So 
far this year, advance purchase tickets are up 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines blame the price surge on heavy demand for seats.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's based on supply and demand and the market dictates  
fares,'' said Sarah Anthony, a spokeswoman for Continental, which 
is carrying record loads in many markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, overcapacity at the airlines is expected to be a problem  
this year with the number of available seats rising by 5.6 percent 
in this quarter alone, according to analyst Susan Donofrio of BT 
Alex. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Add to that, revenues were down in April and off to a weak start  
in May, according to the Air Transport Association. Full-fare 
business traffic was reported to have declined by 4.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston-based Continental is addressing the problem by  
announcing it would trim back its growth from 9 percent to 6 
percent by retiring some aircraft early. Fort Worth, Texas-based 
American also has announced a modest acceleration in its retirement 
schedule for some of its older planes, mainly to keep capacity 
growth under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Parsons, editor of Bestfares.com, said the overcapacity and  
tumbling revenues create pressure on the airlines to raise prices 
to keep analysts happy. Rising jet fuel prices also are 
contributing. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers traveling for pleasure typically buy the leisure-fare  
tickets, which come with restrictions such as advance purchase 
requirements. Fares are lower if purchased further in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Parsons said a roundtrip fare on American tickets  
from Dallas to Los Angeles, purchased 21 days in advance for 
midweek travel, rose to $484 from $465 while seven-day fares 
between the same cities increased to $1,030 from $990. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the reasons behind higher costs, people will  
continue with their vacation plans. Thirteen percent of Americans 
are expected to fly this summer, up 3 percent from a year ago, 
according to the Travel Industry Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anthony said the increases are only for leisure fares at  
this point, although business fares have seen industrywide 
increases of 3 percent so far this year.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Talks To Resume Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration expects to resume  
intensive negotiations over China's bid to enter the World Trade 
Organization as soon as the two countries meet to discuss the 
mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, U.S. Trade 
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky told a business audience that the administration  
expected a ``broad re-engagement with the Chinese'' in a number of 
areas, including the negotiations to remove Chinese barriers to 
American exports in return for U.S. support for China's bid to join 
the Geneva-based WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshefsky said the trade talks will resume after a meeting  
demanded by the Chinese in which U.S. officials will provide ``a 
more detailed explanation of the tragic accident with respect to 
the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the time frame for the discussions, Barshefsky said  
she expected them to occur ``fairly soon,'' but she refused to be 
more specific. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistaken NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy and release  
last week of a congressional report on Chinese espionage of U.S. 
nuclear facilities have increased uncertainty over whether the 
United States and China will be able to reach a trade deal this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries came close to an agreement in April during the  
visit of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to Washington, but in the end 
the administration decided that China's offers to lower trade 
barriers did not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to strike a deal angered a number of U.S. business  
groups that stood to gain significantly from the offers that China 
did make in an effort to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the embassy bombing and the release of the espionage  
report, the administration had pledged to intensify negotiations 
with the aim of sending a completed WTO deal to Congress in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress must approve any trade deal because China's membership  
in the WTO will require Congress to drop the requirement for an 
annual review of China's trade status with the United States.

<HEADLINE> Old Waverly Site of Women's US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) -- Meg Mallon probably won't have to wave  
a white flag in mock surrender at Old Waverly Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54th U.S. Women's Open figures to be a kinder, gentler  
championship when it begins Thursday in an area of Mississippi 
known as the Golden Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	If a drive strays beyond the rough-framed fairways, it might not  
take a national search party to find it. The course is playing at 
6,431 yards to a par of 71, meaning none of the par-5s have been 
changed to a par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Karrie Webb even complained that one of the par-5s was too  
short. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the course stays the same condition, I could see 10 under  
winning,'' Webb said. ``If the greens get harder and firmer and 
rough grows a little bit, you're going to see only a few people 
under par.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just one person under par would be an improvement from last year  
at Blackwolf Run, located in an area of Wisconsin that may as well 
have been called the Bermuda Triangle. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Se Ri Pak and amateur Jenny Chuasiriporn  
finished 72 holes in 6-over 290, the highest winning score in the 
Women's Open since Jan Stephenson won at 6 over in 1983. Only 30 
players managed to break 300 over 72 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak, who went 20 holes in a playoff to win, was asked Tuesday  
how Old Waverly suited her game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pretty good,'' she said with a bright smile. ``A lot better  
than last year. Not only me, all players feel the same way, I 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't the case last year at Blackwolf Run, the Pete  
Dye-design that changed from a brute to a beast when the winds 
kicked up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Lopez was in a group with Mallon and Jane Geddes the first  
two rounds. Mallon hit her first drive in the right rough, hit a 
tree and eventually walked off with a 9. Geddes took a double-bogey 
6. Lopez was shaken. 
</P>
<P>
	``My caddie said to me, `Are you all right?' And I said, `I need  
two Valiums, quick!' It was horrible,'' Lopez said. ``I'm trying to 
keep my emotions, because you know what's in store for you the next 
17 holes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That threesome, with 68 victories and seven major championships  
among them, didn't hit the same green in regulation until the 14th 
hole of the second round. Lopez told this to Mallon, who replied, 
``Hey, we can play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And out came the white flags as they walked up the 18th fairway,  
laughing to keep themselves from crying. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open prides itself on being the toughest test of golf,  
but no one is quite sure what to expect at Old Waverly. The course 
only opened 11 years ago and has never played host to a 
championship featuring the best in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
	And no matter how the USGA wants to set up the course, it is at  
the mercy of Mother Nature. Unseasonably cool nights have kept the 
Bermuda rough from growing out of control. The fairways are ample 
and the greens are running smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course is playing fair,'' said Dinah Shore champion  
Dottie Pepper. ``This golf course rewards good shots. It's not like 
if you hit some goofy spins off a mound, you knock it 40 feet 
coming back for par.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb played 18 holes Monday, the first time she has played a  
full practice round that early in the week, and was asked which 
holes scared her. 
</P>
<P>
	``After playing last year, I don't know if there are any holes  
like that,'' Webb said. ``Last year, I think the whole 18 holes 
scared me. It's definitely not as tough as Blackwolf Run, but I 
don't think any of the players wanted to see it as tough as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Low scoring might only play to Webb's advantage. Already a  
four-time winner this year, she set the LPGA record for 72 holes 
with a 26-under 262 in the Australian Ladies Masters and won the 
Titleholders Championship at 17-under 271 last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anyone, not even the USGA, wants to see 6 over  
win a golf tournament,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries already are strong, and officials are hopeful to  
go over 100,000 for the week. The seriousness on their faces is 
indication that this is a major championship, the biggest event of 
the year in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Walking across the tightly mowed fairways of Old Waverly, and  
the unusually tame rough, may have been the only thing that lulled 
players into a false sense of a security. 
</P>
<P>
	Is this really a Women's Open course?  
</P>
<P>
	``Not compared to last year, no,'' Juli Inkster said. ``This is  
not as severe as last year's course. But that's the beauty of a 
U.S. Open. It changes every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, most players might agree that the change was for the  
better.

<HEADLINE> NASA Measure of Universe Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new method of measuring distances to far  
galaxies casts doubt about the proclamation last week by NASA 
astronomers that they had determined the age and expansion rate of 
the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	A technique using a radio-telescope is a ``golden ruler'' for  
measuring cosmic distances and calls into question the conclusions 
announced by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope who were 
supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, a 
researcher said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ours is a direct measurement, using geometry, and is  
independent of all other methods of determining cosmic distances,'' 
said Jim Herrnstein of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. 
``It is the most precise distance ever measured to a remote 
galaxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein presented his findings Tuesday at the national  
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the new technique shows a 15 to 20 percent margin of  
error in the results announced last week by a NASA team led by 
Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Institute of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The NASA team using the space telescope said last week that it  
had successfully achieved the goal of measuring within an 
uncertainty of only 10 percent the speed at which the universe is 
expanding, a value called the Hubble constant. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on its study, the team concluded that the universe is 12  
to 13 billion years old and is expanding at an accelerating rate of 
70 kilometers per second for every 3.3 million light years in 
distance from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein said this calculation is off by 15 to 20 percent. He  
based his conclusion on the difference in calculated distance to a 
specific galaxy using his technique compared with the calculation 
method used by the NASA group. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman and her group of 27 astronomers funded by NASA spent  
eight years measuring the distance to stars that pulsate in 
brightness at a known rate. Such stars, called Cepheids, are 
considered ``standard candles'' whose varying luminosity gives a 
gauge for their distance. 
</P>
<P>
	But Herrnstein said the technique using Cepheids is far less  
accurate than his new method that directly measures the motion of 
gas around a galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein used a galaxy called NGC 4258 to establish what he  
called a ``golden ruler'' for measuring cosmic distances. 
</P>
<P>
	NGC 4258 is surrounded by a rotating cloud of gas. Within this  
gas cloud is water vapor, which tends to amplify radio signals. 
This creates radio ``hot spots'' called masers. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbital speed of masers between NGC 4258 and Earth was  
measured in 1994, and again every few months over the following 
three years. By determining the speed at which the masers were 
moving, the astronomers created a triangle with the first maser 
position at one angle, the latest position at a second angle, and 
the galaxy center at the third angle. Measuring the angles gives 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can use plain old trigonometry to calculate the distance,''  
said Lincoln Greenhill, a member of the Herrnstein team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very simple and direct,'' said Herrnstein. ``Most of us  
know enough math from high school to do the calculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The distance to NGC 4258 was calculated at 23.5 million light  
years, with an accuracy to within 4 percent. This distance has been 
calculated using the Cepheid star technique at 27 to 29 million 
light years. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein said that the distance measure using Cepheid stars is  
based on a series of assumed values, such as the distance to the 
Large Magellanic Cloud, a galaxy neighbor to the Milky Way. These 
assumed values, said Herrnstein, have a greater margin of error 
than does the direct measuring technique he is using. 
</P>
<P>
	Freedman, who attended a news conference at which Herrnstein  
announced his results, said the new study provided ``wonderful 
data,'' but she would like other measurements to be taken to 
confirm its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, she said the assumed values used in the Cepheid star  
technique have been verified by a number of researchers and she was 
``confident'' of the results. Freedman admitted, however, that 
uncertainties in her team's results still needed to be checked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrnstein conducted his study using the Very Long Baseline  
Array, which is a series of radio-telescope antennae that are 
scattered across the United States, from the Virgin Islands to 
Hawaii. The antennae operate as a single unit and are able to 
measure natural radio signals to an accuracy 500 times greater than 
the Hubble can measure visible light.

<HEADLINE> Boxing League Proposes Unification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Borrowing a page from college football  
bowls, NASCAR and other pro sports, Pensacola lawyer Fred Levin 
wants to create a boxing league with corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin, who represents five-time world champion Roy Jones Jr. and  
other boxers, hopes the World Boxing League can replace the 
hodge-podge of sanctioning organizations already out there -- WBC, 
WBA, WBO, WBU, IBF, IBO, and so on. The proliferation has resulted 
in multiple champions and fan confusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to go back to the old days, when everybody knew who  
the champion was, and the respect boxing had,'' Levin told the 
Pensacola News Journal for a story Monday. ``It was the great 
sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	January 2000 is the tentative start date for the WBL.  
</P>
<P>
	Levin created the WBL concept with Terdema Ussery, president and  
chief executive officer of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. Ussery is a 
former Continental Basketball Association commissioner and 
ex-president of Nike Sports Management where he got to knew Levin 
and Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	They have sought help from artist and boxing fan LeRoy Neiman as  
well as former FBI investigator Warren Flagg. 
</P>
<P>
	Murad Muhammad, Jones' promoter and a Levin client, said he  
welcomed the new league but was skeptical about its chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``To come into the world with a new sanctioning group like the  
IBC and the like, all alphabets, no one knows them,'' Muhammad 
said. ``So how could you come on the level of the IBF, WBC and WBA? 
These guys have been here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the only thing Levin has going for him is that a wealthy  
sponsor might be able to sustain the league over the long haul. 
``If they keep it going 10 years, it will be a factor,'' Muhammad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin raised the possibility of such a league during testimony  
in March, 1998 before a Senate committee that was investigating 
professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically said private-sector sponsorship, rather than  
legislation, is really the answer,'' Levin said. A corporate 
sponsor would give the sport legitimacy through a recognizable, 
credible brand name, similar to the Winston Cup in NASCAR, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just the WBL,'' Levin said. ``It's the WBL Pepsi  
World Championship, for example.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate sponsorship and sale of stock would allow the league  
to operate without charging sanctioning fees that typically take 3 
percent from each fighter's purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin also envisions a reduction to about 10 weight classes with  
the emphasis on title fights that would appeal to television 
matchmakers who often are forced to show mandatory mismatches under 
the existing structure. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes boxers would be ranked by something like the media  
polls used in college football. Sanctioning bodies produce their 
own rankings that are susceptible to influence from promoters and 
often fail to recognize another group's champion as a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	Levin is one of the nation's most successful plaintiff lawyers.  
He engineered Florida's suit against the tobacco industry that 
resulted in a $13 billion settlement. He contributed $10 million 
from his tobacco fees to the University of Florida law school which 
then was named after him.

<HEADLINE> Stars Try To Avoid Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche weren't supposed to have  
enough depth to match the Detroit Red Wings and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of depth has turned out to be a shallow perception.  
</P>
<P>
	Having survived injuries and illness to key players, the  
Avalanche are just one game away from the Stanley Cup finals. They 
can advance for the second time in four seasons with a victory over 
the Stars tonight in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we rebounded in two rounds,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``When you look at our intensity, goaltending, 
special teams, the way we have gone from the finesse game to a war 
to a football game ... I don't think I have ever seen this 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, who ousted the defending Stanley Cup champion Red  
Wings in six games in the second round, won Game 4 against Dallas 
without sharpshooting forward Valeri Kamensky. They came back and 
scored seven goals in Game 5 without All-Star right wing Theo 
Fleury and productive rookie forward Milan Hejduk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk is out with a broken collarbone, but Fleury is expected  
to return to the lineup tonight after missing Colorado's 7-5 
victory Sunday with the flu. He did not skate Monday, but his 
health was improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made sure I was walking on the other side of the street,''  
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy said of staying away from his 
contagious teammate. ``It was nice to see Theo was much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury and Hejduk out, the Avalanche figured to be in  
trouble heading into Dallas for Game 5, but Peter Forsberg, 
Kamensky, Sandis Ozolinsh and rookie Chris Drury made up for their 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his only goal went into an empty net Sunday, Forsberg  
was the strongest offensive player on the ice. He set up two goals 
and rarely was knocked off the puck when the Avalanche controlled 
the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the game,'' Forsberg said. ``It surprised me that it  
was an open game. I thought that everyone was tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fatigue may have been a factor in Sunday's score-a-thon, but 12  
goals still came as a surprise considering the teams combined for 
16 in the first four games of the series. Twelve games Sunday in 
major league baseball had less than a dozen runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this round has gone so far, you can expect anything,''  
Hartley said. ``I didn't look into my magic ball. The person who 
can predict what type of game it will be is a very bright man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: Dallas needs to avoid another fast-paced  
shootout that favors the fleet-skating Avalanche. While the Stars 
have scoring punch on all four lines, they have more success when 
games turn into a battle along the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started playing their game,'' Dallas captain Derian Hatcher  
said. ``We didn't hit people the way we need to. We didn't check 
the way we need to. We played their game. We can't win games like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their two-game slump, it's premature to discount the  
Stars. Dallas had the league's top record and did not lose three 
straight all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to us to turn the tables on them and steal one in  
their building,'' forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We had to go to 
Denver anyhow, so we might as well go up there and win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awaiting the winner of the Colorado-Dallas series are the  
Buffalo Sabres, who beat Toronto 4-2 Monday night to clinch the 
Eastern Conference finals in five games.

<HEADLINE> SFX Entertainment Buys Canadian Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Livent, the troubled Canadian company that  
produced popular Broadway musicals like ``Ragtime'' and ``Fosse,'' 
is being bought by SFX Entertainment, the nation's leading producer 
and promoter of live shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but news reports have  
speculated that the price could exceed $100 million. The 
transaction, which does not include Livent's headquarters in 
Toronto, will have to be approved by a New York bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest acquisition for SFX, which has been on a  
two-year buying spree since being spun off from the hugely 
successful radio business founded by its chairman, Robert F. X. 
Sillerman. Sillerman founded the radio company SFX Broadcasting in 
1992, taking the name from a scrambling of his initials. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to all the rights for Livent's current shows, which  
include the long-running Canadian production of ``Phantom of the 
Opera,'' SFX will also acquire Livent's theaters in New York, 
Chicago and Toronto. Other recent Livent productions have included 
``Parade,'' which was just nominated for nine Tony Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Livent filed for bankruptcy protection last November after its  
new owners, which include Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz, said they 
discovered massive accounting fraud by Livent's original owners, 
Garth Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities filed fraud and conspiracy charges against the  
two founders in January, but they have refused to appear in court. 
Drabinsky and Gottleib have remained in Canada and deny any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	SFX is the largest stager and promoter of concerts and other  
live entertainment in the United States. It owns 82 venues 
throughout the country as well as concert promoters like Bill 
Graham Presents and a sports marketing company.

<HEADLINE> Gators Receiver Has Tough Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- John Capel ran the fastest 200-meter  
time in the United States this year. He is probably only the 
fourth-best wide receiver on the Florida football team. 
</P>
<P>
	It should seem clear where his future lies.  
</P>
<P>
	But nobody should forget that at Florida, a fourth-string  
receiver garners much more day-in, day-out attention than a 
world-class sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	With the 2000 Olympics taking place in September, the heart of  
football season, Capel faces a tough decision. Does he stick with 
coach Steve Spurrier's team, or does he give up a season -- maybe 
more -- to try for a spot in the Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
	``I've prayed that God will show me the right direction to go,''  
said Capel, who came to UF on a football scholarship. ``The only 
thing I can do is wait. Maybe that's not in my future to run in the 
Olympics. But if I have a chance to run in the Olympics, I'm pretty 
sure coach Spurrier won't mind it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This may not have been an issue had the freshman from  
Brooksville, Fla., not surprised everyone, including himself, and 
won the 200-meter title at the Southeastern Conference 
Championships last month in 19.99 seconds. That was the best time 
recorded by an American this year, and the second-best in the 
world, behind only Frank Fredericks of Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes Capel one of the runners to watch at the NCAA  
Championships in Boise, Idaho, where preliminaries in the 200-meter 
race begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Every bit as intriguing will be the choice he'll face about a  
six months from now. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decisions for him will probably start to come after the  
bowl game this fall,'' said Florida track coach Doug Brown. 
``Helping the Gator football team to a national title has to be a 
priority for John. Then he can come and help the Gator track team. 
The challenge for him is: where to go from there. That's something 
we'll have to assess and talk about after the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier affectionately calls Capel ``John, John.'' and rarely  
mentions the receiver without saying how much more he would 
contribute if his hands were better and his pass routes a bit more 
crisp. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with the flaws, Capel had an impact on special teams last  
season, returning 10 kickoffs for an average of 27.4 yards and 
eight punts for nearly 10 yards a return. Lining up at receiver, 
however, Capel was a bigger threat running than catching. He ran 11 
times for 80 yards last season, while catching just two balls for 4 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks like a sure backup next season. But when juniors Travis  
Taylor and Darrell Jackson leave, the position could be his to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Spurrier always replenishes his talent. This spring,  
he started bragging about redshirt freshman Reche Caldwell, a 
football-only athlete, who coaches claim ran a 4.31-second 40-yard 
dash, in the same range as Capel. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the kind of feedback that keeps Capel working on the  
football field, even in the middle of track season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to about four practices the first couple of weeks'' of  
spring practice, he said. ``But then I would go out on the football 
field by myself. I wasn't trying to make it a big deal by going 
from one practice to the other, so I would go out on the field 
every once in a while and would run routes and have footballs shot 
at me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capel is not alone. Dozens of players around the country run  
track to stay in shape for football. Very few, however, will have 
to choose one over the other with as much riding on it as Capel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, I love both sports,'' he said. ``I love football a  
lot more than I like track, but I don't seem them conflicting and I 
don't see it coming to that point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least not for a few more months.

<HEADLINE> Ala. To Vote on Interracial Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama voters will have the opportunity  
to end the nation's last remaining ban on interracial marriages. 
</P>
<P>
	Alabama's constitution, written in 1901, contains a prohibition  
against a black person -- or any descendant of a black person -- 
marrying a white person. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed amendment that would remove that language was  
approved by the state House in April and by the Senate on Tuesday 
without a dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
	It now goes before Alabama voters in a statewide election Oct.  
12, along with a proposed constitutional amendment to legalize a 
state lottery. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a good message across the nation that Alabama is  
moving into the 21st century,'' said the bill's sponsor, Democratic 
Rep. Alvin Holmes. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Virginia law  
banning interracial marriages. Since then, laws such as Alabama's 
have been unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina voters approved removing an interracial marriage  
ban from their constitution in November, and the state Legislature 
ratified the action in February. That left Alabama as the only 
state that retained the remnant of segregation.

<HEADLINE> Saab Recalls 26,000 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Saab Cars USA Inc. is recalling 26,000 Saab 9000  
cars to fix a defect that could cause the air bags to malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Tuesday affects Saab 9000s from model years  
1992 through 1994. The automaker said the covers on the air bag's 
electronic control module, located in the engine compartment, could 
allow moisture to enter and corrode its circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in turn, could cause the air bag to malfunction. Saab said  
no accidents or injuries had been reported as a result of the 
defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The '92-93 models were equipped with driver's side air bags  
only, while 1994 models came with driver and passenger-side air 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the affected cars will be notified by mail in July and  
asked to schedule an appointment with their Saab dealer to have the 
parts replaced, if necessary, free of charge.

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Recipients Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Women who claim silicone breast implants made  
them ill or want the implants removed overwhelmingly approved a 
$3.2 billion settlement deal with Dow Corning Corp., once the 
largest makers of the implants, the company announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 96 percent of the 112,774 women who cast ballots voted to  
approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying this is the best thing since sliced bread, but  
it is finally a process by which we can draw an end to this and get 
some people the medical care that they have not been able to get,'' 
said Sybil Niden Goldrich, a trustee appointed to represent implant 
recipients on the Tort Claimants Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will go back to court June 28, when a U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court judge in Bay City will hear arguments from 
creditors opposed to the plan. If the settlement is approved, 
claimants could begin receiving payments by the end of the year, 
ending a settlement process that began four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always up to the judge, but there's no reason for me to  
believe it won't be confirmed,'' said T. Michael Jackson, a Dow 
Corning spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court approves the deal, claimants worldwide would  
receive information explaining how they could collect funds. Women 
still have the option to reject the settlement and pursue 
litigation, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the values and options available, we are confident  
that most people will elect to settle their claims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Goldrich said she is relieved that women who want to have  
their implants removed would be able to get the money for the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``For women to finally be able to get these dreadful items  
removed from their bodies is very important,'' Ms. Goldrich said. 
``It's an expensive process and one that needs to be done. This 
settlement, should it be approved, will give people that 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Claimants would get $5,000 for implant removal surgery and  
$20,000 for ruptured implants. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, women whose conditions qualify them for disease  
claims also could receive up to $300,000 for the most serious 
medical conditions. Women who do not intend to file a disease claim 
could get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman whose medical condition changes after she has been  
compensated for that condition could qualify for an additional 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement plan includes an additional $1.3 billion for  
claims from suppliers, lenders and hospitals owed money by Dow 
Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some classes of creditors, including commercial claimants and  
debt speculators, did not approve the plan by the necessary 
two-thirds vote. Dow plans to ask the court to ``cram down'' the 
plan, a process which would allow the court to accept it despite 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we've gone through this entire process, we've had the  
agreement to disagree,'' Jackson said. ``But we've agreed to move 
this process forward to reach a positive resolution for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million to 2 million U.S. women have received  
implants, either to restore their breasts after cancer surgery or 
for enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about implants surfaced in the mid-1980s. Thousands of  
women who had implants have since claimed leaks have caused serious 
diseases of the immune system such as lupus, depression, kidney 
disease and serious joint damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Several studies have found little solid evidence that implants  
cause diseases. In 1992, however, the FDA restricted silicone gel 
implants to mastectomy patients in medical experiments. 
Saline-filled implants are still approved for use in cosmetic or 
reconstructive surgery.

<HEADLINE> Stars Try To Avoid Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Avalanche weren't supposed to have  
enough depth to match the Detroit Red Wings and Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of depth has turned out to be a shallow perception.  
</P>
<P>
	Having survived injuries and illness to key players, the  
Avalanche are just one game away from the Stanley Cup finals. They 
can advance for the second time in four seasons with a victory over 
the Stars tonight in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we rebounded in two rounds,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said. ``When you look at our intensity, goaltending, 
special teams, the way we have gone from the finesse game to a war 
to a football game ... I don't think I have ever seen this 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche, who ousted the defending Stanley Cup champion Red  
Wings in six games in the second round, won Game 4 against Dallas 
without sharpshooting forward Valeri Kamensky. They came back and 
scored seven goals in Game 5 without All-Star right wing Theo 
Fleury and productive rookie forward Milan Hejduk. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk is out with a broken collarbone, but Fleury is expected  
to return to the lineup tonight after missing Colorado's 7-5 
victory Sunday with the flu. He did not skate Monday, but his 
health was improving. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made sure I was walking on the other side of the street,''  
Colorado goalie Patrick Roy said of staying away from his 
contagious teammate. ``It was nice to see Theo was much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Fleury and Hejduk out, the Avalanche figured to be in  
trouble heading into Dallas for Game 5, but Peter Forsberg, 
Kamensky, Sandis Ozolinsh and rookie Chris Drury made up for their 
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his only goal went into an empty net Sunday, Forsberg  
was the strongest offensive player on the ice. He set up two goals 
and rarely was knocked off the puck when the Avalanche controlled 
the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked the game,'' Forsberg said. ``It surprised me that it  
was an open game. I thought that everyone was tired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fatigue may have been a factor in Sunday's score-a-thon, but 12  
goals still came as a surprise considering the teams combined for 
16 in the first four games of the series. Twelve games Sunday in 
major league baseball had less than a dozen runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way this round has gone so far, you can expect anything,''  
Hartley said. ``I didn't look into my magic ball. The person who 
can predict what type of game it will be is a very bright man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing is certain: Dallas needs to avoid another fast-paced  
shootout that favors the fleet-skating Avalanche. While the Stars 
have scoring punch on all four lines, they have more success when 
games turn into a battle along the boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started playing their game,'' Dallas captain Derian Hatcher  
said. ``We didn't hit people the way we need to. We didn't check 
the way we need to. We played their game. We can't win games like 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their two-game slump, it's premature to discount the  
Stars. Dallas had the league's top record and did not lose three 
straight all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up to us to turn the tables on them and steal one in  
their building,'' forward Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We had to go to 
Denver anyhow, so we might as well go up there and win it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Awaiting the winner of the Colorado-Dallas series are the  
Buffalo Sabres, who beat Toronto 4-2 Monday night to clinch the 
Eastern Conference finals in five games.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Minister Is Optimistic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarrin  
Nimmanahaeminda expressed guarded optimism over his country's 
economic prospects Tuesday, suggesting the country could still meet 
export targets about which the central bank last week expressed 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Thailand last week hiked its economic growth  
forecast from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, while lowering its export 
growth target to 2.1 percent from 4 percent. The central bank said 
local demand could fuel economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	Tarrin, speaking to a dinner meeting of foreign correspondents,  
said exports in the first four months were down around 1 percent in 
dollar terms compared with the same period last year. However, he 
added, it was still possible to meet the 4 percent target. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand's automotive sector had good export potential, he said,  
adding that vehicle exports should pick up from June following the 
arrival of new models on the market. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government will stick to its 1999 target of 1  
percent gross domestic product growth, as stated in Thailand's 
latest commitment to the International Monetary Fund, which is 
overseeing a $17.2 billion bailout of the ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tarrin added that economic growth could top that level given  
a recent economic stimulus package, including cuts to the 
value-added tax and increased public spending, and the possibility 
of exports still hitting the 4 percent growth target this year.

<HEADLINE> Students Return to Columbine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Columbine High students were allowed  
back inside Tuesday for the first time since the bloodbath six 
weeks ago to retrieve backpacks and other belongings they left 
behind when they ran for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in shock again,'' said 16-year-old Charise Walters.  
``We're in shock that we have to go back under these circumstances. 
We were happy to be there, but there were sad moments for some of 
the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until Tuesday, the school had been off limits to students as  
authorities investigated the shooting and checked for booby traps. 
Authorities had taken only a few students inside earlier to help 
reconstruct the attack, and some teachers were also let in last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, counselors and clergy members were on hand to help.  
Parents were also invited, though most students came by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers escorted groups of about 15 students to classrooms to  
pick up their things. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students were tearful. Many seemed relieved, breaking into  
smiles as they hugged and spoke with friends, parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Galina Vol, who graduated last month, emerged from the school in  
tears. She said going back reminded her of the days before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were doing projects and just enjoying the last few weeks of  
school. And we just didn't get to finish it there, and I'm really 
sad about that,'' Ms. Vol said. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine students finished out the school year at nearby  
Chatfield High. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Don Marxhausen went into the school with several  
students from his church. He said the atmosphere was a little 
tense. 
</P>
<P>
	The students were ``happy to find their backpacks, some  
discovering the glasses that they missed and others finding lunches 
that have been down there for six weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Students were barred from some areas -- including the library,  
where gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed themselves and 
most of their 13 victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for some items that are being held as evidence,  
belongings left in the library, the halls or the cafeteria were 
placed in the auditorium for the students to pick up. Items left in 
lockers were sorted, labeled and left in the gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Morroni, who went with her son, 15-year-old Dante, said  
the damage inside was striking. ``Glass is broken all over. Lockers 
are open, ceiling panels are out,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cleanup and rebuilding began Tuesday, when authorities  
returned control of everything but the library to the school 
district. The library is still being treated as a crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Walters said going back left her feeling a little sad.  
</P>
<P>
	``But it felt like home to me,'' she said. ``We got our school  
back, and we're all happy.''

<HEADLINE> Borders To Provide Instant Books </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Before long, readers who can't find the book they want on the  
shelves at their local Borders bookstore may be able to get a 
custom-printed paperback copy in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Borders Group Inc. said Tuesday it had acquired a 19.9 percent  
stake in Atlanta-based Sprout Inc., a first step toward providing 
books on demand. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will give Borders -- and the reading public -- access to  
older and out-of-print titles that the store wouldn't ordinarily 
carry, and may give the nation's second-largest bookstore chain new 
life as it tackles rivals Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bookstores, including small independent retailers, are  
considering the technology as well, seeing it as another way to 
broaden their appeal to readers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a winner for everyone -- publishers, retailers  
and consumers,'' said Jerrold Jenkins, publisher of Independent 
Publisher magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprout, founded in 1997, will provide the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based  
Borders with books in digital form that it licenses from 
publishers. The company has about 1,300 titles in a wide variety of 
topics and expects to acquire thousands more, spokeswoman Ashley 
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	As envisioned, the system would enable Borders workers to  
download digital versions of books. 
</P>
<P>
	Each store would have two digital printers, one for the cover  
and other for the pages. Employees could assemble the books in a 
binding machine that uses the same adhesive process normally 
employed for making paperbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can deliver a book to the customer in 15 minutes,'' Ms.  
Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average reader would see no difference in print and binding  
quality between the instant books and ordinary paperbacks, she 
said, although the machines can print color only for covers. The 
books' interior will be black and white. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't be a great idea for some children's books, for coffee  
table books,'' Ms. Gordon said. ``But for most paperbacks, it's 
going to be almost identical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The price for the book will vary, but will be similar to prices  
for books now on sale in bookstores, said Borders spokeswoman Ann 
Binkley. Officials are not sure when they will begin making the 
books widely available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know the demand that's out there yet,'' said Ms.  
Binkley. ``But we do believe there's a market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprout does not sell the printing and binding machines, which  
stores would have to buy on their own for around $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprout is courting other bookstores in addition to Borders,  
contending its system would help them clear their shelves of 
little-requested titles and reduce the number of books returned to 
publishers when anticipated sales fall short. 
</P>
<P>
	How well it's accepted in the industry remains to be seen,  
though leading publishers are taking notice, said Stuart Applebaum, 
a spokesman for New York-based Random House Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology is ``in the incubation stage,'' he said. ``A lot  
has to be worked out before this becomes an accepted mainstream 
practice across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declining to say whether the company had provided titles to  
Sprout. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Weinberger, co-owner of Readers' Books in Sonoma, Calif.,  
said he finds the idea appealing but predicted some readers would 
never warm to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can pop an out-of-print book out of the toaster in 20  
minutes and it may have the same words, but for someone who wants 
the original book that was printed in 1903 it won't be the same,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Browsing at the Borders store in Traverse City, Mich., John  
Major said he'd be more likely to shop at a store with on-demand 
printing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There've been a few occasions where I wanted something and a  
store didn't have it,'' said Major, 29, a videographer from 
Marquette, Mich. ``If I knew they could get it right away, that 
would definitely bring me in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But to social worker Jan Stump, 39, of Traverse City, instant  
books are contrary to what reading is all about. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine doing that,'' she said. ``I worry that the  
pace is getting too fast. Maybe sometimes we need to wait for good 
things.''

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Measure Orbit of Sun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Astronomers focusing on a star at the center of  
the Milky Way say they have measured precisely for the first time 
how long it takes the sun to circle its home galaxy: 226 million 
years. The last time the sun was at this exact spot of its galactic 
orbit, dinosaurs ruled the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a radio telescope system that measures celestial distances  
500 times more accurately than the Hubble Space Telescope, 
astronomers plotted the motion of the Milky Way and found that the 
sun and its family of planets were orbiting the galaxy at about 135 
miles per second. 
</P>
<P>
	That means it takes the solar system about 226 million years to  
orbit the Milky Way and puts the most precise value ever determined 
on one of the fundamental motions of the Earth and its sun, said 
James Moran of Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the finding was presented Tuesday at a national  
meeting of the American Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our new figure of 226 million miles is accurate to within 6  
percent,'' Mark Reid, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer and leader 
of the team that made the measurements, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun is one of about 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, one  
of billions of ordinary galaxies in the universe. The Milky Way is 
a spiral galaxy, with curving arms of stars pinwheeling out from a 
center. The solar system is about halfway out on one of these arms 
and is about 26,000 light years from the center. A light year is 
about 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid and his team made the measurement using the Very Long  
Baseline Array, a system of 10 large radio-telescope antennae 
placed 5,000 miles across the United States, from the U.S. Virgin 
Islands to Hawaii. Working together as a single unit, the antennae 
can measure motions in the distant universe with unprecedented 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	The accuracy is such that the VLBA can look at a bit of sky that  
has an apparent size one ten- thousandth the diameter of a human 
hair held at arms length. 
</P>
<P>
	For their solar system measurement, the astronomers focused on  
Sagittarius A , a star discovered two decades ago to mark the Milky 
Way's center. Over a 10-day period, they measured the apparent 
shift in position of the star against the background of stars far 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	The apparent motion of Sagittarius A is very, very small, just  
one-600,000th of what could be detected with the human eye, the 
astronomers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid said the measurement adds supports to the idea that the  
Milky Way's center contains a supermassive black hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``This ... strengthens the idea that this object, much smaller  
than our own solar system, contains a black hole about 2.6 million 
times more massive than the sun,'' Reid said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Moran said the new measurement of the solar system orbit adds  
new accuracy to a fundamental fact of the universe: everything is 
moving constantly. 
</P>
<P>
	The Earth rotates on its axis at about 1,100 miles an hour, a  
motion that creates day and night. The Earth orbits the sun at 
about 67,000 miles an hour, a motion that takes one year. The sun 
circles the Milky Way at a speed of about 486,000 miles per hour. 
And every object in the universe is moving apart from the other 
objects as the universe expands at a constantly accelerating rate.

<HEADLINE> Top Thoroughbred Sire Dies at 29 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Mr. Prospector, who went from an  
undistinguished racing career to prominence as the nation's top 
thoroughbred stallion, died Tuesday. He was 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Prospector came down with the colic early Tuesday morning  
and was diagnosed with an inflammation of the membrane lining the 
abdomen. Acting on the advice of veterinarians, Claiborne Farm 
owner Seth Hancock had him euthanized at 1:25 p.m., assistant farm 
manager Gus Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch said Mr. Prospector will be buried in the Claiborne  
cemetery, between Nijinsky and Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone said earlier that he always did keep good company,''  
Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Few would have predicted such a fate for Mr. Prospector when he  
went to stud in 1975, having earned a modest $112,171 in 14 starts 
in 1973 and 1974. Only two of Mr. Prospector's seven wins came in 
stakes races, and the son of Raise A Native and grandson of Native 
Dancer and Nashua was known primarily for his speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the knock on him when he first went to stud, that he  
was going to be all speed,'' Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
	That myth was smashed in 1982, when the Mr. Prospector colt  
Conquistador Cielo won the Metropolitan Mile and, just five days 
later, the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes, and went on to win Horse of the 
Year honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other champion offspring, including 1985 Preakness winner Tank's  
Prospect, 1988 Breeder's Cup Classic winner Seeking the Gold and 
the champion sprinter Gulch, made Mr. Prospector the continent's 
top stallion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to figures compiled by the industry magazine ``The  
Blood-Horse,'' Mr. Prospector had sired a total of 1,014 foals and 
162 stakes winners through the end of last year. Both figures were 
tops among North American stallions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just feel like this is possibly the greatest horse we have  
been around and the most influential sire that the breed has seen 
in our lifetime,'' Koch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. Prospector's legacy will live on. Three colts and two  
fillies from his 1997 crop have been selected for sale at 
Keeneland's top yearling sale this July, with his 1998 and 1999 
crops still on their way to the sales ring and, ultimately, the 
racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch said Mr. Prospector had completed his 1999 breeding  
schedule at the time of his death, covering 47 mares. As of early 
last month, some 31 of those mares were in foal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Mr. Prospector's line will be represented by his  
descendants now standing at stud. At Claiborne alone, Koch said, 
Seeking the Gold and Mr. Prospector grandsons Unbridled and 
Coronado's Quest will ensure that his line lives on. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch had been with Mr. Prospector since 1980, when Hancock  
resyndicated him and moved him to Claiborne, in Paris, from 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was all class, he really was,'' Koch said. ``This horse was  
a gentleman. He never had a problem. He was very easy to work with, 
very easy to be around.''

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Names New SUV `Santa Fe' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. said Tuesday  
that its new compact sport utility vehicle will be called the Santa 
Fe, the same name used for the concept version of the truck 
displayed on this year's auto show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUV is scheduled to go on sale in North America next spring  
as a 2001 model. It will compete with smaller, car-based sport 
utilities, such as Toyota's RAV4, Honda's CR-V and the Subaru 
Forester. Pricing has not been announced, but the Santa Fe is 
expected to list for under $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe, which debuted at this year's Detroit auto show,  
was designed primarily for the U.S. market at Hyundai's California 
design studio. It's expected to come with four- or six-cylinder 
engines and two- or all-wheel drive.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch To Offer Online Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. has announced that it will  
offer discount trading over the Internet, marking a dramatic change 
for the nation's biggest stock brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers will be able to trade stocks online for $29.95 a  
transaction beginning in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The company debated for months whether online trading would  
undermine its traditional brokerage services. Merrill Lynch has 
spent decades building a nationwide network of 14,000 brokers, some 
of whom stand to lose up to 18 percent of their pay as customers 
bypass their services and trade via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm was finally swayed by the rapid loss of business to a  
growing number of online brokers such as Charles Schwab, ETrade and 
Ameritrade. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the most important decision we have made as  
an organization since the mid-1970s,'' said David Komansky, 
Merrill's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch's Internet strategy, which competitors are likely  
to follow, reflects the revolutionary impact of the Internet on 
financial services. More than 7 million Americans are trading 
online, and more than one-third of individual trades are made 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appeared foolish for us to ignore that part of the  
market,'' Komansky said Tuesday. ``So we decided to attack it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill, however, is charging more than many rivals, some of  
whom offer trades for as little as $5, and will require at least 
$20,000 to open an account. Some online brokers allow people to 
open accounts for just a few thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Merrill's clear targets: Charles Schwab, which caters to  
a similar upper-middle-class clientele and also charges $29.95 for 
online trades. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not concerned,'' said Charles Schwab, chairman and chief  
executive of the San Francisco-based brokerage. ``What they're 
introducing is the affirmation of what we've been talking about a 
long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's traditional brokerage firms will have to match  
Merrill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody else sure as heck better follow suit or they're  
going to run the risk of not keeping up with their customers,'' 
said Scott Birnbaum, head of financial services for Mercer 
Management Consulting Inc.

each with Williams getting 55, Bibby 47 and Harpring 35. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches were asked to pick first and second teams, regardless of  
position, and were not permitted to vote for their own players.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Breast Implant Recipients Settle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Dow Corning Corp. is a step closer to settling  
thousands of claims from women who say the company's silicone 
breast implants made them ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Claimants overwhelmingly approved a $3.2 billion settlement plan  
that would pay as much as $300,000 to women whose implants caused a 
serious medical condition, Dow Corning announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 96 percent of the 112,774 women who cast ballots voted to  
approve the plan. If it is approved, the first claims could be paid 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying this is the best thing since sliced bread, but  
it is finally a process by which we can draw an end to this and get 
some people the medical care that they have not been able to get,'' 
said Sybil Niden Goldrich, a trustee appointed to represent implant 
recipients on the Tort Claimants Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement will go back to court June 28, when a U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court judge in Bay City will hear arguments from 
creditors opposed to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always up to the judge, but there's no reason for me to  
believe it won't be confirmed,'' said T. Michael Jackson, a Dow 
Corning spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement plan, claimants who want their silicone  
implants removed would get $5,000 for the surgery or $20,000 if 
their implants had ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to money for implant removal, women with the most  
serious medical conditions could receive up to $300,000. Women 
without a disease claim could get $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court approves the deal, claimants worldwide would  
receive information explaining how they could collect funds. Women 
still have the option to reject the settlement and pursue 
litigation, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the values and options available, we are confident  
that most people will elect to settle their claims,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Goldrich said she is relieved that women who want to have  
their implants removed would be able to get the money for the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``For women to finally be able to get these dreadful items  
removed from their bodies is very important,'' Ms. Goldrich said. 
``It's an expensive process and one that needs to be done. This 
settlement, should it be approved, will give people that 
opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, a woman whose medical condition  
changes after she has been compensated for that condition also 
could qualify for an additional payment. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement plan includes an additional $1.3 billion for  
claims from suppliers, lenders and hospitals owed money by Dow 
Corning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some classes of creditors, including commercial claimants and  
debt speculators, did not approve the plan by the necessary 
two-thirds vote. Dow plans to ask the court to ``cram down'' the 
plan, a process which would allow the court to accept it despite 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we've gone through this entire process, we've had the  
agreement to disagree,'' Jackson said. ``But we've agreed to move 
this process forward to reach a positive resolution for everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 1 million to 2 million U.S. women have received  
implants, either to restore their breasts after cancer surgery or 
for enlargement. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns about implants surfaced in the mid-1980s. Thousands of  
women who had implants have since claimed leaks have caused serious 
diseases of the immune system such as lupus, depression, kidney 
disease and serious joint damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Several studies have found little solid evidence that implants  
cause diseases. In 1992, however, the FDA restricted silicone gel 
implants to mastectomy patients in medical experiments. 
Saline-filled implants are still approved for use in cosmetic or 
reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Midland-based Dow Corning, one of the largest makers of breast  
implants, is co-owned by Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc.
